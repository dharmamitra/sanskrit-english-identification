means that the transaction settling the issue must be carried out in the presence of the Community in the presence of the individuals and in the presence of the Dhamma and VinayaA verdict of mindfulness may be givenThis is the verdict of innocence given in an accusation based on the fact that the accused remembers fully that she did not commit the offense in questionA verdict of past insanity may be givenThis is another verdict of innocence given in an accusation based on the fact that the accused was out of her mind when she committed the offense in question and so is absolved of any responsibility for itActing in accordance with what is admittedThis refers to the ordinary confession of offenses where no formal interrogation is involvedThe confession is valid only if in accord with the facts eg a bhikkhunī actually commits a pācittiya offense and then confesses it as such and not as a stronger or lesser offenseIf she were to confess it as a dukkata or a Saṅghādisesa that would be invalidActing in accordance with the majorityThis refers to cases in which bhikkhunīs are unable to settle a dispute unanimously even after all the proper procedures are followed and  in the words of the Canon  are wounding one another with weapons of the tongue In cases such as these decisions can be made by majority voteActing for her further punishmentThis refers to cases where a bhikkhunī admits to having committed the offense in question only after being formally interrogated about itShe is then to be reproved for her actions made to remember the offense and to confess it after which the Community carries out a further punishment transaction against her as an added punishment for being so uncooperative as to require the formal interrogation in the first placeCovering over as with grassThis refers to situations in which both sides of a dispute realize that in the course of their dispute they have done much that is unworthy of a contemplativeIf they were to deal with one another for their offenses the only result would be greater divisivenessThus if both sides agree all the bhikkhunīs gather in one placemust attendNo one should send her consent and even sick bhikkhunīs must go A motion is made to the entire group that this procedure will be followedOne member of each side then makes a formal motion to the members of her faction that she will make a confession for themWhen both sides are ready the representative of each side addresses the entire group and makes the blanket confession using the form of a motion and one announcementThere is also a good practical reason to follow the Commentary here in that if the Community of bhikkhus acting in unity suspended the bhikkhu in question in a transaction that was not in line with the Dhamma the Vinaya the teachers instructions then there is no good reason that the bhikkhunī following him should be subject to this ruleIn the nonoffense clauses BD translates attano veyyavaccakarassa as in doing household work for herself This omits the kara in the second term thus changing veyyavaccakara to veyyavaccaThe correct translation is for her own choredoerThus the nonoffense clauses as a set read There is no offense in conjeydrink in a Community meal in homage to a chedi or if she cooks conjey or a meal or a nonstaple food or washes a piece of clothing or a headwrap for her own choredoer The Commentary explains In conjeydrink etc When people are making a Community meal or a conjeydrink for the purpose of the Community there is no offense in her doing any cooking at all in the position of being their friendIn homage to a chedi It is all right if being a friend she does homage with scents etcFor her own choredoer Even if mother and father come and are makingdoing something a fan or a broom handle and so stand in the position of a choredoer it is all right to cook anythingI have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Vesālī at the Gabled Hall in the Great ForestThen early in the morning he adjusted his under robe and  carrying his bowl  robes  went into Vesālī for almsThen having gone for alms in Vesālī after the meal returning from his alms round he addressed Vennanda Get a sitting cloth nandaWe will go to the Pāvāla shrine for the days abidingResponding As you say lord to the Blessed One Vennanda followed along behind the Blessed One carrying the sitting clothThen the Blessed One went to the Pāvāla shrine and on arrival sat down on the seat laid outSeated the Blessed One addressed Vennanda Vesālī is refreshing nandaRefreshing too are the Udena shrine the Gotamaka shrine the Sattamba shrine the ManySon shrine the Sāranda shrine the Pāvāla shrineBut Vennanda  even when the Blessed One had given such a blatant sign such a blatant hint

out of sympathy for the world for the welfare benefit  happiness of human and divine beings It was as if his mind was possessed by MāraA second time A third time the Blessed One addressed Vennanda

as if his mind was possessed by MāraThen the Blessed One addressed Vennanda Go nandaDo what you think it is now time to doResponding As you say lord to the Blessed One Vennanda got up from his seat bowed down to the Blessed One and  after circling him to the right  went to sit under a tree not far from the Blessed OneThen not long after Vennanda had left Māra the Evil One went to the Blessed One and on arrival stood to one sideAs he was standing there he said to the Blessed One May the Blessed One totally unbind now lordMay the OneWellGone totally unbind now lordNow is the time for the Blessed Ones total unbinding lordAfter all these words were said by the Blessed One Evil One I will not totally unbind as long as my monk disciples are not yet experienced trained attained to

among many people wellexpounded as far as there are devas  human beingsMay the Blessed One totally unbind now lordMay the OneWellGone totally unbind now lordNow is the time for the Blessed Ones total unbinding lordWhen this was said the Blessed One said to Māra the Most Evil One Relax Evil OneIt wont be long until the Tathāgatas total unbindingIn three months time from now the Tathāgata will totally unbindThus at the Pāvāla shrine  mindful  alert  the Blessed One relinquished the fabrications of lifeAnd as the Blessed One relinquished the fabrications of life there was a great earthquake frightening  hairraising along with cracks of thunderThen on realizing the significance of that the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimedAnd what is the development of the base of powerThere is the case where a monk develops the base of power endowed with concentration founded on desire  the fabrications of exertionHe develops the base of power endowed with concentration founded on persistence concentration founded on intent concentration founded on discrimination  the fabrications of exertionThis is called the development of the base of powerI have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Sāvatthī at Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monasteryNow at that time a large number of monks after the meal on returning from their alms round were sitting gathered together at a pavilion when this discussion arose Who friends knows a craftWhos studying which craftWhich is the supreme among craftsWith regard to that some said The elephantcraft is the supreme craft among crafts Some said The horsecraft is the supreme craft among crafts The chariotcraft Archery Swordsmanship Signaling Calculating Accounting Writing Literary composition Cosmology Some said Geomancy is the supreme craft among crafts And this discussion came to no conclusionThen the Blessed One emerging from his seclusion in the late afternoon went to the pavilion and on arrival sat down on a seat laid outAs he was sitting there he addressed the monks For what topic are you sitting together hereAnd what was the discussion that came to no conclusionJust now lord after the meal on returning from our alms round we were sitting gathered together here at the pavilion when this discussion arose It isnt proper monks that sons of good families on having gone forth out of faith from home to the homeless life should talk on such a topicWhen you have gathered you have two duties either Dhammatalk or noble silenceThen on realizing the significance of that the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimedIndeed the Blessed One is worthy and rightly selfawakened consummate in knowledge  conduct wellgone an expert with regard to the world unexcelled as a trainer for those people fit to be tamed the Teacher of divine  human beings awakened blessedThe Dhamma is wellexpounded by the Blessed One to be seen here  now timeless inviting verification pertinent to be realized by the wise for themselvesThe Sangha of the Blessed Ones disciples who have practiced well who have practiced straightforwardly who have practiced methodically who have practiced masterfully  in other words the four types when taken as pairs the eight when taken as individual types  they are the Sangha of the Blessed Ones disciples worthy of gifts worthy of hospitality worthy of offerings worthy of respect the incomparable field of merit for the worldThere is the case where a disciple of the noble ones has gone to the Buddha for refugeThis is the first reward of merit reward of skillfulness nourishment of happiness celestial resulting in happiness leading to heaven leading to what is desirable pleasurable  appealing to welfare  to happinessFurthermore the disciple of the noble ones has gone to the Dhamma for refugeThis is the second reward of meritFurthermore the disciple of the noble ones has gone to the Sangha for refugeThis is the third reward of meritWhen the Exalted One had spoken thus Sigala the young householder said as followsExcellent Lord excellentIt is as if Lord a man were to set upright that which was overturned or were to reveal that which was hidden or were to point out the way to one who had gone astray or were to hold a lamp amidst the darkness so that those who have eyes may seeEven so has the doctrine been explained in various ways by the Exalted OneI take refuge Lord in the Buddha the Dhamma and the SanghaMay the Exalted One receive me as a lay follower as one who has taken refuge from this very day to lifes endI have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Kuṇḍiya in the Kuṇḍiṭṭhāna forestAnd on that occasion Suppavāsā the Koliyandaughter had been seven years pregnant and seven days in difficult laborShe  touched by fierce sharp pains  endured them with three thoughts How rightly selfawakened is the Blessed One who abandoning this sort of suffering teaches the DhammaHow wellpracticed is the community of the Blessed Ones disciples who practice abandoning this sort of sufferingHow truly blissful is unbinding where this sort of pain is not foundThen Suppavāsā said to her husband Come young masterGo to the Blessed One and on arrival showing reverence with your head to his feet in my name ask whether he is free from illness  affliction is carefree strong  living in comfort saying Suppavāsā the Koliyandaughter lord shows reverence with her head to your feet and asks whether you are free from illness  affliction are carefree strong  living in comfort And say this Suppavāsā has been seven years pregnant and seven days in difficult laborShe  touched by fierce sharp pains  endures them with three thoughts How rightly selfawakened is the Blessed One who abandoning this sort of suffering teaches the DhammaHow wellpracticed is the community of the Blessed Ones disciples who practice abandoning this sort of sufferingHow truly blissful is unbinding where this sort of pain is not found Responding Excellent to Suppavāsā the Koliyandaughter the Koliyanson went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to the Blessed One sat to one sideAs he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One Suppavāsā the Koliyandaughter lord shows reverence with her head to your feet and asks whether you are free from illness  affliction are carefree strong  living in comfortAnd she says this Suppavāsā has been seven years pregnant and seven days in difficult laborShe  touched by fierce sharp pains  endures them with three thoughts How rightly selfawakened is the Blessed One who abandoning this sort of suffering teaches the DhammaHow wellpracticed is the community of the Blessed Ones disciples who practice abandoning this sort of sufferingHow truly blissful is unbinding where this sort of pain is not found May Suppavāsā the Koliyandaughter be well  free from diseaseAnd may she deliver a son free from disease And at the same time as the Blessed Ones statement Suppavāsā the Koliyandaughter  well  free from disease  delivered a son free from diseaseSaying Very well lord the Koliyanson delighting in  approving of the Blessed Ones words got up from his seat bowed down to the Blessed One and  circling him to the right  returned to his homeHe saw that Suppavāsā the Koliyandaughter  well  free from disease  had delivered a son free from diseaseOn seeing this the thought occurred to him How amazingHow astounding the Tathāgatas great power great might in that at the same time as the Blessed Ones statement Suppavāsā the Koliyandaughter  well  free from disease  would deliver a son free from disease Gratified he was joyful rapturous  happyThen Suppavāsā said to her husband Come young masterGo to the Blessed One and on arrival showing reverence with your head to his feet in my name saying Suppavāsā the Koliyandaughter lord shows reverence with her head to your feet And say this Suppavāsā who was seven years pregnant and seven days in difficult labor has now  well  free from disease  delivered a son free from diseaseShe invites the community of monks with the Buddha at its head for seven days of mealsMay the Blessed One acquiesce to Suppavāsās seven meals together with the community of monks Responding Excellent to Suppavāsā the Koliyandaughter the Koliyanson went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to the Blessed One sat to one sideAs he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One Suppavāsā the Koliyandaughter lord shows reverence with her head to your feetAnd she says this Suppavāsā who was seven years pregnant and seven days in difficult labor has now  well  free from disease  delivered a son free from diseaseShe invites the community of monks with the Buddha at its head for seven days of mealsMay the Blessed One acquiesce to Suppavāsās seven meals together with the community of monks Now at that time a certain lay follower had invited the community of monks with the Buddha at its head for the next days mealThat lay follower was a supporter of VenMahā MoggallānaSo the Blessed One addressed VenMahā Moggallāna Come MoggallānaGo to the lay follower and on arrival say to him Suppavāsā the Koliyandaughter who was seven years pregnant and seven days in difficult labor has now  well  free from disease  delivered a son free from diseaseShe has invited the community of monks with the Buddha at its head for seven days of mealsLet Suppavāsā do seven mealsAfterward you will do yours Hes your supporterResponding As you say lord to the Blessed One VenMoggallāna went to the lay follower and on arrival said to him Suppavāsā the Koliyandaughter who was seven years pregnant and seven days in difficult labor has now  well  free from disease  delivered a son free from diseaseShe has invited the community of monks with the Buddha at its head for seven days of mealsLet Suppavāsā do seven meals afterward you will do yoursVenerable sir if VenMoggallāna will be my guarantor for three things  wealth life  faith  then let Suppavāsā do seven meals afterward I will do mineFor two things friend will I be your guarantor your wealth  lifeOnly you are the guarantor of your faithVenerable sir if VenMoggallāna will be my guarantor for two things  wealth  life  then let Suppavāsā do seven meals afterward I will do mineThen VenMoggallāna having conciliated the lay follower went to the Blessed One and on arrival said The lay follower lord has been conciliatedLet Suppavāsā do seven meals afterward he will do hisSo for seven days Suppavāsā the Koliyandaughter with her own hand served  satisfied the community of monks with the Buddha at its head with exquisite staple  nonstaple foodAnd she had the child show reverence to the Blessed One and the community of monksThen VenSāriputta said to the child I trust child that things are bearable for youI trust that things are comfortable for youI trust that theres no painFrom where VenSāriputta would things be bearable for meFrom where would they be comfortable for me living seven years in a belly of bloodThen Suppavāsā  My son is conversing with the Dhamma General  was gratified joyful rapturous  happyThe Blessed One knowing that Suppavāsā was gratified joyful rapturous  happy said to her Suppavāsā would you like to have another son like thisO Blessed One lord I would like to have seven more sons like thisThen on realizing the significance of that the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimedI have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Rājagaha at the Bamboo Grove the Squirrels refugeNow at on that occasion VenPilindavaccha went around addressing the monks as if they were outcastesSo a large number of monks went to the Blessed One and on arrival bowed down to him and sat to one sideAs they were sitting there they said to him Lord VenPilindavaccha goes around addressing the monks as if they were outcastesThen the Blessed One told a certain monk Come monkIn my name call Pilindavaccha saying The Teacher calls you friend Vaccha Responding As you say lord to the Blessed One the monk went to VenPilindavaccha and on arrival said to him The Teacher calls you friend VacchaResponding As you say my friend to the monk VenPilindavaccha went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one sideAs he was sitting there the Blessed One said to him Is it true Pilindavaccha that you go around addressing the monks as if they were outcastesYes lordThen the Blessed One having directed attention to VenPilindavacchas previous lives said to the monks Dont take offense at the monk VacchaIts not out of inner hatred that he goes around addressing the monks as if they were outcastesFor consecutive lifetimes the monk Vaccha has been born in brahman familiesFor a long time he has been accustomed to addressing people as outcastesThats why he goes around addressing the monks as if they were outcastesThen on realizing the significance of that the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimedI have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying at Uruvelā on the bank of the Nerañjarā River at the root of the Bodhi tree  the tree of awakening  newly awakenedAnd on that occasion he sat at the root of the Bodhi tree for seven days in one session sensitive to the bliss of releaseAt the end of seven days he emerged from that concentrationThen a certain overbearing brahman went to the Blessed One and on arrival exchanged courteous greetings with himAfter an exchange of friendly greetings  courtesies he stood to one sideAs he was standing there he said to the Blessed One To what extent Master Gotama is one a brahmanAnd which are the qualities that make one a brahmanThen on realizing the significance of that the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimedKisa Gotami has two of the most heartrending stories in the Buddhist tradition associated with her nameThe Commentary to this verse tells that when her young child had died she refused to believe it was deadAfter asking many people  in vain  for medicine that would revive the child she was finally directed to the BuddhaWhen she told him her story he offered to provide medicine for the child but he would need some mustard seed  the cheapest Indian spice  obtained from a family in which no one had diedShe went from house to house asking for mustard seed and no one refused to give it to herBut when she asked if anyone had died in the family the universal response was always Oh yes of course After a while the message sunk in Death is universalOn abandoning the childs body to a charnel ground she returned to the Buddha and asked to be ordained as a nun and afterwards became an arahantThe canonical verses associated with Kisa Gotamis name however tell a different story which is identical to the story that the Commentary attributes to Patacara Pregnant with her second child she was returning to her parents home along with her husband and small firstborn child to give birthAlong the way a great storm blew up and she asked her husband to provide shelter for the familyAs he was cutting grass and sticks to build a shelter a snake bit him and he died of the poisonUnsheltered and wondering at her husbands long absence Patacara gave birth and had to spend the night sheltering both her children against the rain and wind with nothing more than her bodyThe next morning she found her husband deadDistraught she decided to return to her parents homeHowever a river  swollen from the rain of the previous night  ran across her wayUnable to carry both children across the river she left her firstborn on the near bank and waded through the raging current carrying her babyPlacing the baby on the far bank she turned back to fetch her firstbornA hawk seeing the baby took it for a piece of flesh and swooped down on itSeeing this Patacara raised her hands and tried to chase it away but to no avail The hawk picked up the baby and carried it offMeanwhile her firstborn  seeing his mother raising her hands  took it for a signal to cross the riverAs he jumped into the raging current he was carried off to his deathOverwhelmed with grief Patacara returned to her parents home only to learn that it had burned down from a lightning strike in the previous nights stormHer parents and brother were at that moment being cremated on a single pyreAt this point she went mad and began wandering around halfnakedOnly on coming into the Buddhas presence did she recover her sensesHe taught her the Dhamma and eventually she ordained and became an arahantWhy this story is attributed to Patacara in the Commentary when it is obviously Kisa Gotamis in the Canon is hard to tellSome scholars have suggested that the tales in the Pali commentaries were imported from other Buddhist traditions such as the MulasarvastivadinThus the differences between the canonical verses and the commentarial tales stem from the fact that the different traditions attributed particular stories to different elder monks and nunsFor instance the Pali Canon attributed the story of the woman whose family was destroyed in a single day to Kisa Gotami while the tradition from which the Commentary drew attributed it to PatacaraIf thats the case its interesting to note how the commentators who adopted these tales nevertheless remained faithful to their CanonInstead of trying to change the Pali to fit with the commentarial source on which they drew they allowed the discrepancies between the two sources to stand one of many instances in which the discrepancies between the Canon and the commentaries suggest that the monks who handed down the Pali Canon tried to keep it intact even when they didnt agree with itLater Theravadin texts have tried to cover over the discrepancies between Kisa Gotamis verses and the Commentary to those verses by insisting that the passage in the verses beginning Going along about to give birth and ending my husband dead I reached the Deathless is actually Patacara speaking but this seems unlikely Why would one arahant butt in on another ones taleAt any rate regardless of which story is Patacaras and which Kisa Gotamis both speak to the universality of death and the power of the path of practice that in the midst of this human world with all its sorrows there is still a way to find that which is free from grieving aging and illness the DeathlessThe Suttavibhanga contains the basic training rules for bhikkhus and bhikkhunis along with the origin story for each oneThese rules are summarized in the Patimokkha and amount to rules for the bhikkhus for the bhikkhunisThe Patimokkkha rules are grouped as followsTranslators note The verses here fall into three sections with the first two relating to Ratthapalas story as told in MNIn the first Ratthapala is addressing his father after the latter had tried to use wealth and Ratthapalas former wives to lure Ratthapala into disrobingIn the second section Ratthapala is talking to King Koravya who had asked him why he had ordained when he was still young and healthy and had suffered no loss of relatives or wealthThe third section of verses here does not occur in MNTranslators note This discourse mentions the metaphorical notion of heartwood three timesAlthough sara as a metaphor is often translated as essence this misses some of the metaphors implicationsWhen x is said to have y as its heartwood that means that the proper development of x yields y and that y is the most valuable part of x  just as a tree as it matures develops heartwood and the heartwood is the most valuable part of the treeTranslators note Although it is often lost in translation this poem in the Pali has a clearly articulated overall structureThe first seven verses  coming under the because  state reasons while the last verse under the so draws the conclusion find a good teacher and practice the DhammaI have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Savatthi in the Eastern Monastery the palace of Migaras motherNow on that occasion  the Uposatha day of the fifteenth the fullmoon night  the Blessed One was sitting in the open air surrounded by the community of monksSurveying the silent community of monks he addressed them Monks if there are any who ask Your listening to teachings that are skillful noble leading onward going to selfawakening is a

Ones wordsAnd while this explanation was being given the minds of monks through lack of clinging were fully released from fermentationI have heard that at one time the Blessed One was staying in Savatthi at Jetas Grove Anathapindikas monasteryThen a certain deva in the far extreme of the night her extreme radiance lighting up the entirety of Jetas Grove approached the Blessed OneOn approaching having bowed down to the Blessed One she stood to one sideAs she stood to one side she addressed him with a verseThis the first book in the Khuddaka Nikaya appears to have been designed as a primer for novice monks and nunsIn nine short passages it covers the basic topics that one would need to know in beginning Buddhist monastic life many of the passages also serve as useful introductions to Buddhist practice in generalPassages and cover the ceremony for taking ordination as a novicePassage gives preliminary guidance in the contemplation of the body a meditation exercise designed to overcome lustPassage introduces many of the basic categories of analysis through which discernment can be developed beginning with the most basic formulation of the causal principle so central to the Buddhas teachingPassage gives an overview of the practice as a whole  beginning with the need to associate with wise people and ending with the attainment of UnbindingThis overview is presented in the context of the concept of protective rituals and makes the point that  given the nature of human action and its results  the best protection comes not from rituals but from acting in a generous moral and wise mannerPassage expands both on Passage and Passage detailing some of the virtues of the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha while at the same time elaborating on the practice of meditation and the attainment of streamentry  the point at which the meditator has hisher first glimpse of UnbindingPassage elaborates on the theme of generosity showing how gifts to the Sangha can be dedicated to the welfare of ones dead relativesPassage presents meritorious action in general as an investment more reliable and longerlasting than material investmentsPassage returns to the subject of meditation focusing on the development of goodwill and lovingkindnessThese nine passages in different contexts are frequently chanted in Theravada countries even todayLay and ordained Buddhists chant Passage daily as an affirmation of their refuge in the Triple GemMonks will often chant Passages  as blessings when lay people make merit and frequently use verses from Passage as sermon themesThus the passages contained in this book serve as a useful introduction both to early Buddhist training and to modern Theravada practicesI undertake the training rule to refrain from taking lifeI undertake the training rule to refrain from stealingI undertake the training rule to refrain from sexual intercourseI undertake the training rule to refrain from telling liesI undertake the

lighting up the entirety of Jetas Grove approached the Blessed OneOn approaching having bowed down to the Blessed One she stood to one sideAs she stood to one side she addressed him with a versePossessed of form one sees formsThis is the first emancipationNot percipient of form internally one sees forms externallyThis is the second emancipationOne is intent only on the beautifulThis is

feelingThis is the eighth emancipationNow when a monk attains these eight emancipations in forward order in reverse order in forward and reverse order when he attains them and emerges from them wherever he wants however he wants and for as long as he wants when through the ending of the mental fermentations he enters and remains in the fermentationfree awarenessrelease and discernmentrelease having directly known it and realized it in the here and now he is said to be a monk released in both waysAnd as for another release in both ways higher or more sublime than this there is noneThis was

pain Then the first man on hearing the words of the second man would make an effort with his hands  feet to go against the flowI have given you this simile to illustrate a meaningThe meaning is this

by the Arahant so I have heard There are these three ways of obtaining sensual pleasuresWhich threeThose whose sensual pleasures are already provided those who delight in creating those with control over what is created by othersThese are the three ways of obtaining sensual pleasuresThis was said by the Blessed One said by the Arahant so I have heard Tied by the yoke of sensuality  the yoke of becoming one is a returner returning to this stateUntied from the yoke of sensuality but tied by the yoke of becoming one is a nonreturner not returning to this stateUntied from the yoke of sensuality  from the yoke of becoming one is an arahant whose fermentations are endedThis was said by the Blessed One said by the Arahant so I have heard A monk who has admirable virtue admirable qualities  admirable discernment is called in this DhammaVinaya one who is complete fulfilled a superlative personAnd how is a monk a person with admirable virtueThere is the case where a monk is virtuousHe dwells restrained in accordance with the Patimokkha consummate in his behavior  sphere of activityHe trains himself having undertaken the training rules seeing danger in the slightest faultsIn this way a monk is a person with admirable virtueThus he is of admirable virtueAnd how is a monk a person with admirable qualitiesThere is the case where a monk lives devoted to developing the seven qualities that are wings to AwakeningIn this way a monk is a person with admirable qualitiesThus he is of admirable virtue  admirable qualitiesAnd how is a monk a person with admirable discernmentThere is the case where a monk through the ending of fermentations dwells in the awarenessrelease  discernmentrelease that are free from fermentation having known  made them manifest for

on the strength of Dhamma that I describe a brahman with threefold knowledge and not another as measured by citing  recitingAnd how is it on the strength of Dhamma that I describe a brahman with threefold knowledge and not another as measured by citing  recitingThere is the case where a monk recollects his manifold past lives ie one birth two five ten fifty a hundred a thousand a hundred thousand many aeons of cosmic contraction many aeons of cosmic expansion many aeons of cosmic contraction  expansion There I had such a name belonged to such a clan had such an appearanceSuch was my food such my experience of pleasure  pain such the end of my lifePassing away from that state I rearose thereThere too I had such a name belonged to such a clan had such an appearanceSuch was my food such my experience of pleasure  pain such the end of my lifePassing away from that state I rearose here Thus he recollects his manifold past lives in their modes  detailsThis is the first knowledge he has attainedIgnorance has been destroyed knowledge has arisen darkness has been destroyed light has arisen  as happens in one who is heedful ardent  resoluteThen again the monk sees  by means of the divine eye purified  surpassing the human  beings passing away  reappearing and I discerned how they are inferior  superior beautiful  ugly fortunate  unfortunate in accordance with their actions These beings  who were endowed with bodily misconduct verbal misconduct  mental misconduct who reviled noble ones held wrong views and undertook actions under the influence of wrong views  at the breakup of the body after death have reappeared in the plane of deprivation the bad destination the lower realms in hellBut these beings  who were endowed with bodily good conduct verbal good conduct  mental good conduct who did not revile noble ones who held right views and undertook actions under the influence of right views  at the breakup of the body after death have reappeared in the good destinations in the heavenly world Thus  by means of the divine eye purified  surpassing the human  he sees beings passing away  reappearing and discerns how they are inferior  superior beautiful  ugly fortunate  unfortunate in accordance with their actionsThis is the second knowledge he has attainedIgnorance has been destroyed knowledge has arisen darkness has been destroyed light has arisen  as happens in one who is heedful ardent  resoluteThen again the monk  with the ending of fermentations  remains in the fermentationfree awarenessrelease  discernmentrelease having directly known and made it manifest for himself right in the present lifeThis is the third knowledge he has attainedIgnorance has been destroyed knowledge has arisen darkness has been destroyed light has arisen  as happens in one who is heedful ardent  resoluteIts in this way that on the strength of Dhamma I describe a brahman with threefold knowledge and not another as measured by citing  recitingSee also MN

actionsDelusion is a cause for the origination of actionsAny action performed with greed  born of greed caused by greed originating from greed wherever ones selfhood turns up there that action will ripenWhere that action ripens there one will experience its fruit either in this very life that has arisen or further along in the sequenceAny action performed with aversion  born of aversion caused by aversion originating from aversion wherever ones selfhood turns up there that action will ripenWhere that action ripens there one will experience its fruit either in this very life that has arisen

action ripens there one will experience its fruit either in this very life that has arisen or further along in the sequenceJust as when seeds are not broken not rotten not damaged by wind  heat capable of sprouting wellburied planted in wellprepared soil and the raingod would offer good streams of rainThose seeds would thus come to growth increase  abundanceIn the same way any action performed with greed performed with aversion performed with delusion  born of delusion caused by delusion originating from delusion wherever ones selfhood turns up there that action will ripenWhere that action ripens there one will experience its fruit either in this very life that has arisen or further along in the sequenceThese are three causes for the origination of actionsNow these three are

attainment of arahantship and that an arahant  in reaching nibbana  sheds not only bad destinations but also good onesThe word sheds acts as a lamp in this verse  it appears only once but functions in

ignoble unprofitable and that which is devoted to selfaffliction painful ignoble unprofitableAvoiding both of these extremes the middle way realized by the Tathagata  producing vision producing knowledge  leads to calm to direct knowledge to selfawakening to UnbindingAnd what is the middle way realized by the Tathagata that  producing vision producing knowledge  leads to calm to direct

the middle way realized by the Tathagata that  producing vision producing knowledge  leads to calm to direct knowledge to selfawakening to UnbindingNow this monks is the noble truth of stress Birth is stressful aging is stressful death is stressful sorrow lamentation pain distress  despair are stressful association with the unbeloved is stressful separation from the loved is stressful not getting what is wanted is stressfulIn short the five clingingaggregates are stressfulAnd this monks is the noble truth of the origination of stress the craving that makes for further becoming  accompanied by passion  delight relishing now here  now there  ie craving for sensual pleasure craving for becoming craving for nonbecomingAnd this monks is the noble truth of the cessation of stress the

through mindfulness of inout breathing when developed  pursued is of great fruit of great benefitAnd how is concentration through mindfulness of inout breathing developed  pursued so as to be of great fruit of great benefitThere is the case where a monk having gone to the wilderness to the shade of a tree or to an empty building sits down folding his legs crosswise holding his body erect and setting mindfulness to the foreAlways mindful he breathes in mindful he breathes outBreathing in long he discerns I am breathing in long or breathing out long he discerns I am breathing out long Or breathing in short he discerns I am breathing in short or breathing out short he discerns I am breathing out short He trains himself I will breathe in sensitive to the entire body He trains himself I

focusing on relinquishmentThis is how concentration through mindfulness of inout breathing is developed  pursued so as to be of great fruit of great benefitI too monks before my awakening when I was an unawakened bodhisatta frequently remained with this abidingWhen I frequently remained with this abiding neither my body was fatigued nor were my eyes and my mind through lack of clingingsustenance was released from fermentationsSo if a monk should wish May neither my body be fatigued nor my eyes and may my mind through lack of clingingsustenance be released from fermentations then he should attend carefully to this same concentration through mindfulness of inout breathingIf a monk should wish May my memories  resolves related to the household life be abandoned then he should attend carefully to this same concentration through mindfulness of inout breathingIf a monk should wish May I remain percipient of loathsomeness in the presence of what is not loathsome then he should attend carefully to this same concentration through mindfulness of inout breathingIf a monk should wish May I remain percipient of unloathsomeness in the presence of what is loathsome then he should attend carefully to this same concentration through mindfulness of inout breathingIf a monk should wish May I remain percipient of loathsomeness in the presence of what is not loathsome  what is then he should attend carefully to this same concentration through mindfulness of inout breathingIf a monk should wish May I remain percipient of unloathsomeness in the presence of what is loathsome  what is not then he should attend carefully to this same concentration through mindfulness of inout breathingIf a monk should wish May I  in the presence of what is loathsome  what is not  cutting myself off from both  remain equanimous mindful  alert then he should attend carefully to this same concentration through mindfulness of inout breathingIf a monk should wish May I  quite secluded from sensuality secluded from unskillful qualities  enter  remain in the first jhana rapture  pleasure born from seclusion accompanied by directed thought  evaluation then he should attend carefully to this same concentration through mindfulness of inout breathingIf a monk should wish May I with the stilling of directed thoughts  evaluations enter  remain in the second jhana rapture  pleasure born of concentration unification of awareness free from directed thought  evaluation  internal assurance then he should attend carefully to this same concentration through mindfulness of inout breathingIf a monk should wish May I with the fading of rapture remain equanimous mindful  alert sense pleasure with the body and enter  remain in the third jhana of which the noble ones declare Equanimous  mindful he has a pleasant abiding then he should attend closely to this very same concentration through mindfulness of inout breathingIf a monk should wish May I with the abandoning of pleasure  pain  as with the earlier disappearance of elation  distress  enter  remain in the fourth jhana purity of equanimity  mindfulness neitherpleasurenorpain then he should attend closely to this very same concentration through mindfulness of inout breathingIf a monk should wish May I with the complete transcending of perceptions of form with the disappearance of perceptions of resistance and not heeding perceptions of diversity Infinite space enter  remain in the dimension of the infinitude of space then he should attend carefully to this same concentration through mindfulness of inout breathingIf a monk should wish May I with the complete transcending of the dimension of the infinitude of space Infinite consciousness enter  remain in the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness then he should attend carefully to this same concentration through mindfulness of inout breathingIf a monk should wish May I with the complete transcending of the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness There is nothing enter  remain in the dimension of nothingness then he should attend carefully to this same concentration through mindfulness of inout breathingIf a monk should wish May I with the complete transcending of the dimension of nothingness enter  remain in the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception then he should attend carefully to this same concentration through mindfulness of inout breathingIf a monk should wish May I with the complete transcending of the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception enter  remain in the cessation of perception  feeling then he should attend carefully to this same concentration through mindfulness of inout breathingWhen concentration through mindfulness of inout breathing is thus developed thus pursued then if he senses a feeling of pleasure he discerns that it is inconstant not grasped at not relishedIf he senses a feeling of pain he discerns that it is inconstant not grasped at not relishedIf he senses a feeling of neitherpleasurenorpain he discerns that it is inconstant not grasped at not relishedIf he senses a feeling of pleasure he senses it disjoined from itIf he senses a feeling of pain he senses it disjoined from itIf he senses a feeling of neitherpleasurenorpain he senses it disjoined from itWhen sensing a feeling limited to the body he discerns that I am sensing a feeling limited to the body When sensing a feeling limited to life he discerns that I am sensing a feeling limited to life He discerns that With the breakup of the body after the termination of life everything that is experienced not being relished will grow cold right hereJust as an oil lamp burns in dependence on oil  wick and from the termination of the oil  wick  and from not being provided any other sustenance  it goes out unnourished in the same way when sensing a feeling limited to the body he discerns that I am sensing a feeling limited to the body When sensing a feeling limited to life he discerns that I am sensing a feeling limited to life He discerns that With the breakup of the body after the termination of life everything that is sensed not being relished will grow cold right here See also MN SNI have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Savatthi in Jetas Grove Anathapindikas monasteryThen VenAnanda went to the Blessed One and on arrival bowed down to him and sat to one sideAs he was sitting there he addressed the Blessed One saying Is there one quality that when developed  pursued brings four qualities to completionAnd four qualities that when developed  pursued bring seven qualities to completionAnd seven qualities that when developed  pursued bring two qualities to completionYes Ananda there is one quality that when developed  pursued brings four qualities to completion and four qualities that when developed  pursued bring seven qualities to completion and seven qualities that when developed  pursued bring two qualities to completionAnd what is the one quality that when developed  pursued brings four qualities to completionWhat are the four qualities that when developed  pursued bring seven qualities to completionWhat are the seven qualities that when developed  pursued bring two qualities to completionMindfulness of inout breathing when developed  pursued brings the four frames of reference to completionThe four frames of reference when developed  pursued bring the seven factors for Awakening to completionThe seven factors for Awakening when developed  pursued bring clear knowing  release to completionNow how is mindfulness of inout breathing developed  pursued so as to bring the four frames of reference to their culminationThere is the case where a monk having gone to the wilderness to the shade of a tree or to an empty building sits down folding his legs crosswise holding his body erect and setting mindfulness to the foreAlways mindful he breathes in mindful he breathes out Breathing in long he discerns I am breathing in long or breathing out long he discerns I am breathing out long Or breathing in short he discerns I am breathing in short or breathing out short he discerns I am breathing out short He trains himself I will breathe in sensitive to the entire body He trains himself I will breathe out sensitive to the entire body He trains himself I will breathe in calming bodily fabrication He trains himself I will breathe out calming bodily fabrication He trains himself I will breathe in sensitive to rapture He trains himself I will breathe out sensitive to rapture He trains himself I will breathe in sensitive to pleasure He trains himself I will breathe out sensitive to pleasure He trains himself I will breathe in sensitive to mental fabrication He trains himself I will breathe out sensitive to mental fabrication He trains himself I will breathe in calming mental fabrication He trains himself I will breathe out calming mental fabrication He trains himself I will breathe in sensitive to the mind He trains himself I will breathe out sensitive to the mind He trains himself I will breathe in satisfying the mind He trains himself I will breathe out satisfying the mind He trains himself I will breathe in steadying the mind He trains himself I will breathe out steadying the mind He trains himself I will breathe in releasing the mind He trains himself I will breathe out releasing the mind He trains himself I will breathe in focusing on inconstancy He trains himself I will breathe out focusing on inconstancy He trains himself I will breathe in focusing on dispassion He trains himself I will breathe out focusing on dispassion He trains himself I will breathe in focusing on cessation He trains himself I will breathe out focusing on cessation He trains himself I will breathe in focusing on relinquishment He trains himself I will breathe out focusing on relinquishment Now on whatever occasion a monk breathing in long discerns that he is breathing in long or breathing out long discerns that he is breathing out long or breathing in short discerns that he is breathing in short or breathing out short discerns that he is breathing out short trains himself to breathe in  out sensitive to the entire body trains himself to breathe in  out calming the bodily processes On that occasion the monk remains focused on the body in  of itself  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the worldI tell you that this  the inout breath  is classed as a body among bodies which is why the monk on that occasion remains focused on the body in  of itself  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the world On whatever occasion a monk trains himself to breathe in  out sensitive to rapture trains himself to breathe in  out sensitive to pleasure trains himself to breathe in  out sensitive to mental processes trains himself to breathe in  out calming mental processes On that occasion the monk remains focused on feelings in  of themselves  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the worldI tell you that this  close attention to inout breaths  is classed as a feeling among feelings which is why the monk on that occasion remains focused on feelings in  of themselves  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the world On whatever occasion a monk trains himself to breathe in  out sensitive to the mind trains himself to breathe in  out satisfying the mind trains himself to breathe in  out steadying the mind trains himself to breathe in  out releasing the mind On that occasion the monk remains focused on the mind in  of itself  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the worldI dont say that there is mindfulness of inout breathing in one of confused mindfulness and no alertness which is why the monk on that occasion remains focused on the mind in  of itself  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the world On whatever occasion a monk trains himself to breathe in  out focusing on inconstancy trains himself to breathe in  out focusing on dispassion trains himself to breathe in  out focusing on cessation trains himself to breathe in  out focusing on relinquishment On that occasion the monk remains focused on mental qualities in  of themselves  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the worldHe who sees clearly with discernment the abandoning of greed  distress is one who oversees with equanimity which is why the monk on that occasion remains focused on mental qualities in  of themselves  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the worldThis is how mindfulness of inout breathing is developed  pursued so as to bring the four frames of reference to their culminationAnd how are the four frames of reference developed  pursued so as to bring the seven factors for Awakening to their culmination On whatever occasion the monk remains focused on the body in  of itself  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the world on that occasion his mindfulness is steady  without lapseWhen his mindfulness is steady  without lapse then mindfulness as a factor for Awakening becomes arousedHe develops it and for him it goes to the culmination of its development Remaining mindful in this way he examines analyzes  comes to a comprehension of that quality with discernmentWhen he remains mindful in this way examining analyzing  coming to a comprehension of that quality with discernment then analysis of qualities as a factor for Awakening becomes arousedHe develops it and for him it goes to the culmination of its development In one who examines analyzes  comes to a comprehension of that quality with discernment unflagging persistence is arousedWhen unflagging persistence is aroused in one who examines analyzes  comes to a comprehension of that quality with discernment then persistence as a factor for Awakening becomes arousedHe develops it and for him it goes to the culmination of its development In one whose persistence is aroused a rapture notoftheflesh arisesWhen a rapture notoftheflesh arises in one whose persistence is aroused then rapture as a factor for Awakening becomes arousedHe develops it and for him it goes to the culmination of its development For one who is enraptured the body grows calm and the mind grows calmWhen the body  mind of an enraptured monk grow calm then serenity as a factor for Awakening becomes arousedHe develops it and for him it goes to the culmination of its development For one who is at ease  his body calmed  the mind becomes concentratedWhen the mind of one who is at ease  his body calmed  becomes concentrated then concentration as a factor for Awakening becomes arousedHe develops it and for him it goes to the culmination of its development He oversees the mind thus concentrated with equanimityWhen he oversees the mind thus concentrated with equanimity equanimity as a factor for Awakening becomes arousedHe develops it and for him it goes to the culmination of its developmentThis is how the four frames of reference are developed  pursued so as to bring the seven factors for Awakening to their culminationAnd how are the seven factors for Awakening developed  pursued so as to bring clear knowing  release to their culminationThere is the case where a monk develops mindfulness as a factor for Awakening dependent on seclusion dispassion cessation resulting in relinquishmentHe develops analysis of qualities as a factor for Awakening persistence as a factor for Awakening rapture as a factor for Awakening serenity as a factor for Awakening concentration as a factor for Awakening equanimity as a factor for Awakening dependent on seclusion dispassion cessation resulting in relinquishmentThis is how the seven factors for Awakening when developed  pursued bring clear knowing  release to their culminationThat is what the Blessed One saidGratified VenAnanda delighted in the Blessed Ones wordsI have heard that on one occasion VenAnuruddha was staying near Savatthi in the Dark Forest  diseased in pain severely illThen a large number of monks went to VenAnuruddha and on arrival said to him What dwelling are you dwelling in so that the pains that have arisen in the body do not invade or remain in the mindWhen I dwell with my mind wellestablished in the four frames of reference the pains that have arisen in the body do not invade or remain in the mindWhich fourThere is the case where I remain focused on the body in  of itself  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the worldI remain focused on feelings in  of themselves

reference the pains that have arisen in the body do not invade or remain in the mindThese four bases of power when developed  pursued are of great fruit  great benefitAnd how are the four bases of power developed  pursued so as to be of great fruit  great benefitThere is the case where a monk develops the base of power endowed with concentration founded on desire  the fabrications of exertion thinking This desire of mine will be neither overly sluggish nor overly active neither inwardly restricted nor outwardly scattered He keeps perceiving what is in front  behind so that what is in front is the same as what is behind what is behind is the same as what is in frontWhat is below is the same as what is above what is above is the same as what is belowby night as by day and by day as by nightBy means of an awareness thus open  unhampered he develops a brightened mindHe develops the base of power endowed with concentration founded on persistenceHe develops the base of power endowed with concentration founded on intentHe develops the base of power endowed with concentration founded on discrimination  the fabrications of exertion thinking This discrimination of mine will be neither overly sluggish nor overly active neither inwardly restricted nor outwardly scattered He keeps perceiving what is in front  behind so that what is in front is the same as what is behind what is behind is the same as what is in frontWhat is below is the same as what is above what is above is the same as what is belowby night as by day and by day as by nightBy means of an awareness thus open  unhampered he develops a brightened mindAnd how is desire overly sluggishWhatever desire is accompanied by laziness conjoined with laziness that is called overly sluggish desireAnd how is desire overly activeWhatever desire is accompanied by restlessness conjoined with restlessness that is called overly active desireAnd how is desire inwardly restrictedWhatever desire is accompanied by sloth  drowsiness conjoined with sloth  drowsiness that is called inwardly restricted desireAnd how is desire outwardly scatteredWhatever desire is stirred up by the five strings of sensuality outwardly dispersed  dissipated that is called outwardly scattered desireAnd how does a monk dwell perceiving what is in front  behind so that what is in front is the same as what is behind and what is behind is the same as what is in frontThere is the case where a monks perception of what is in front  behind is well in hand wellattended to wellconsidered welltuned by means of discernmentThis is how a monk keeps perceiving what is in front and behind so that what is in front is the same as what is behind and what is behind is the same as what is in frontAnd how does a monk dwell so that what is below is the same as what is above and what is above is the same as what is belowThere is the case where a monk reflects on this very body from the soles of the feet on up from the crown of the head on down surrounded by skin  full of various kinds of unclean things In this body there are head hairs body hairs nails teeth skin flesh tendons bones bone marrow kidneys heart liver pleura spleen lungs large intestines small intestines gorge feces bile phlegm pus blood sweat fat tears skinoil saliva mucus fluid in the joints urine This is how a monk dwells so that what is below is the same as what is above and what is above is the same as what is belowAnd how does a monk dwell by night as by day and by day as by nightThere is the case where a monk at night develops the base of power endowed with concentration founded on desire  the fabrications of exertion by means of the same modes  signs  themes that he uses by day and by day he develops the base of power endowed with concentration founded on desire  the fabrications of exertion by means of the same modes  signs  themes that he uses by nightThis is how a monk dwells by night as by day and by day as by nightAnd how does a monk  by means of an awareness open  unhampered  develop a brightened mindThere is the case where a monk has the perception of light the perception of daytime well in hand  wellestablishedThis is how a monk  by means of an awareness open  unhampered  develops a brightened mindWhen a monk has thus developed  pursued the four bases of power he experiences manifold supranormal powersHaving been one he becomes many having been many he becomes oneHe appearsHe vanishesHe goes unimpeded through walls ramparts  mountains as if through spaceHe dives in  out of the earth as if it were waterHe walks on water without sinking as if it were dry landSitting crosslegged he flies through the air like a winged birdWith his hand he touches  strokes even the sun  moon so mighty  powerfulHe exercises influence with his body even as far as the Brahma worldsHe hears  by means of the divine earelement purified  surpassing the human  both kinds of sounds divine  human whether near or farHe knows the awareness of other beings other individuals having encompassed it with his own awarenessHe discerns a mind with passion as a mind with passion and a mind without passion as a mind without passionHe discerns a mind with aversion as a mind with aversion and a mind without aversion as a mind without aversionHe discerns a mind with delusion as a mind with delusion and a mind without delusion as a mind without delusionHe discerns a restricted mind as a restricted mind and a scattered mind as a scattered mindHe discerns an enlarged mind as an enlarged mind and an unenlarged mind as an unenlarged mindHe discerns an excelled mind as an excelled mind and an unexcelled mind as an unexcelled mindHe discerns a concentrated mind as a concentrated mind and an unconcentrated mind as an unconcentrated mindHe discerns a released mind as a released mind and an unreleased mind as an unreleased mindHe recollects his manifold past lives ie one birth two births three births four five ten twenty thirty forty fifty one hundred one thousand one hundred thousand many aeons of cosmic contraction many aeons of cosmic expansion many aeons of cosmic contraction  expansion There I had such a name belonged to such a clan had such an appearanceSuch was my food such my experience of pleasure  pain such the end of my lifePassing away from that state I rearose thereThere too I had such a name belonged to such a clan had such an appearanceSuch was my food such my experience of pleasure  pain such the end of my lifePassing away from that state I rearose here Thus he remembers his manifold past lives in their modes  detailsHe sees  by means of the divine eye purified  surpassing the human  beings passing away and reappearing and he discerns how they are inferior  superior beautiful  ugly fortunate  unfortunate in accordance with their kamma These beings  who were endowed with bad conduct of body speech  mind who reviled the noble ones held wrong views and undertook actions under the influence of wrong views  with the breakup of the body after death have reappeared in the plane of deprivation the bad destination the lower realms in hellBut these beings  who were endowed with good conduct of body speech  mind who did not revile the noble ones who held right views and undertook actions under the influence of right views  with the breakup of the body after death have reappeared in the good destinations in the heavenly world Thus  by means of the divine eye purified  surpassing the human  he sees beings passing away and reappearing and he discerns how they are inferior  superior beautiful  ugly fortunate  unfortunate in accordance with their kammaThrough the ending of the mental effluents he remains in the effluentfree awarenessrelease  discernmentrelease knowing  realizing it for himself in the here  nowThis is how these four bases of power when developed  pursued are of great fruit  great benefitI have heard that on one occasion VenAnanda was staying in Kosambi at Ghositas ParkThen the Brahman Unnabha went to where VenAnanda was staying and on arrival greeted him courteouslyAfter an exchange of friendly greetings  courtesies he sat to one sideAs he was sitting there he said to VenAnanda Master Ananda what is the aim of this holy life lived under Gotama the contemplativeBrahman the holy life is lived under the Blessed One with the aim of abandoning desireIs there a path is there a practice for the abandoning of that desireYes there is a path there is a practice for the abandoning of that desireWhat is the path the practice for the abandoning of that desireBrahman there is the case where a monk develops the base of power endowed with concentration founded on desire  the fabrications of exertionHe develops the base of power endowed with concentration founded on persistence concentration founded on intent concentration founded on discrimination  the fabrications of exertionThis Brahman is the path this is the practice for the abandoning of that desireIf thats so Master Ananda then its an endless path and not one with an end for its impossible that one could abandon desire by means of desireIn that case brahman let me question you on this matterAnswer as you see fitWhat do you think Didnt you first have desire thinking Ill go to the park and then when you reached the park wasnt that particular desire allayedYes sirDidnt you first have persistence thinking Ill go to the park and then when you reached the park wasnt that particular persistence allayedYes sirDidnt you first have the intent thinking Ill go to the park and then when you reached the park wasnt that particular intent allayedYes sirDidnt you first have discrimination thinking Ill go to the park and then when you reached the park wasnt that particular act of discrimination allayedYes sirSo it is with an arahant whose mental effluents are ended who has reached fulfillment done the task laid down the burden attained the true goal totally destroyed the fetter of becoming and who is released through right gnosisWhatever desire he first had for the attainment of arahantship on attaining arahantship that particular desire is allayedWhatever persistence he first had for the attainment of arahantship on attaining arahantship that particular persistence is allayedWhatever intent he first had for the attainment of arahantship on attaining arahantship that particular intent is allayedWhatever discrimination he first had for the attainment of arahantship on attaining arahantship that particular discrimination is allayedSo what do you think brahmanIs this an endless path or one with an endYoure right Master AnandaThis is a path with an end and not an endless oneMagnificent Master AnandaMagnificentJust as if he were to place upright what was overturned to reveal what was hidden to show the way to one who was lost or to carry a lamp into the dark so that those with eyes could see forms in the same way has Master Ananda  through many lines of reasoning  made the Dhamma clearI go to Master Gotama for refuge to the Dhamma and to the Sangha of monksMay Master Ananda remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge from this day forward for lifeMonks when one quality is established in a monk the five faculties are developed  developed wellWhich one qualityHeedfulnessAnd what is heedfulnessThere is the case where a monk guards his mind with regard to fermentations and mental qualities accompanied by fermentationsWhen his mind is guarded with regard to fermentations and mental qualities accompanied by fermentations the faculty of conviction goes to the culmination of its developmentThe faculty of persistence mindfulness concentration discernment goes to the culmination of its developmentThis is

can discern that I am an adeptFor us lord the teachings have the Blessed One as their root their guide  their arbitratorIt would be good if the Blessed One himself would explicate the meaning of this statementHaving heard it from the Blessed One the monks will remember itIn that case monks listen  pay close attentionI will speakAs you say lord the monks respondedThe Blessed One said There is a manner of reckoning whereby a monk who is a learner standing at the level of a learner can discern that I am a learner and whereby a monk who is an adept standing at the level of an adept can discern that I am an adeptAnd what is the manner of reckoning whereby a monk who is a learner standing at the level of a learner can discern that I am a learnerThere is the case where a monk is a learnerHe discerns as it actually is that This is stress This is the origination of stress This is the cessation of stress This is the path of practice leading to the cessation of stress This is a manner of reckoning whereby a monk who is a learner standing at the level of a learner can discern that I am a learnerFurthermore the monk who is a learner reflects Is there outside of this any brahman or contemplative who teaches the true genuine  accurate Dhamma like the Blessed One And he discerns No there is no brahman or contemplative outside of this doctrine  discipline who teaches the true genuine  accurate Dhamma like the Blessed One This too is a manner of reckoning whereby a monk who is a learner standing at the level of a learner can discern that I am a learnerFurthermore the monk

Unnaabha was delighted with the words of the Blessed One and rejoiced in themHe rose saluted the Blessed One and departedNot long after his departure the Blessed One said to the monksMonks imagine a

Brahman Unnaabha is settled on the Tathaagata rooted in him established in himIt is strong and cannot be uprooted by any recluse or Brahman deva or Maara Brahmaa or anyone else in the worldMonks if

the five are three and the three fiveIt would be well for me Lord if the Blessed One would teach me briefly a doctrine so that having heard it I might dwell alone in seclusion unwearied ardent and resoluteWell then monk you should purify the rudiments of skillAnd what are the rudiments of skillIn this monk you must dwell restrained according to the restraint of the Obligations having perfected the scope of your practice aware of danger in the slightest faults undertaking the precepts and training yourself in themHaving done this then monk with morality as your support established in morality you must practice the four foundations of mindfulnessWhich fourIn this monk you must dwell in contemplation of body feelings mind mindobjects ardent clearly aware mindful having got rid of worldly longing and depressionThen monk when with morality as your support established in morality you have cultivated the four foundations of mindfulness then you will obtain by night and by day that hopedfor increase in skilled states which will not declineIn this Aananda a monk dwells contemplating the body ardent clearly aware and mindful putting aside worldly desire and dejectionAs he thus dwells contemplating the body some bodily object arises or physical discomfort or mental drowsiness causes his mind to wander to external thingsThen Aananda that bhikkhus attention should be directed to some inspiring object of thoughtAs he thus directs it to some inspiring object of thought delight springs up in himWhen he is thus delighted rapture arisesWhen he experiences rapture his body is calmed downWith body so calmed down he experiences joyBeing joyful his mind is concentratedHe reflects thus The aim on which I set my mind has been achievedLet me now withdraw my mind So he does so without starting or continuing the thoughtprocessAnd he is aware of being free from initial or sustained thought inwardly mindful and joyfulSuch Aananda is the practice for the direction of mindAnd what Aananda is the practice for the nondirection of mindA monk who does not direct his mind to external things is aware My mind is not directed to external things Then he is aware My mind is not concentrated on before or after it is set free and undirected And then he is aware I dwell in contemplation of the body ardent clearly aware and mindfulI am joyful This Aananda is the practice for the nondirection of mindOn one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Alavi on a spread of leaves by a cattle track in a simsapa forestThen Hatthaka of Alavi out roaming  rambling for exercise saw the

already available  the fingers of at least five people would be needed to count them  so I suppose that a new translation has to be justified to prove that its not just another oneIn doing so though Id rather not criticize the efforts of earlier translators for I owe them a great dealInstead Ill ask you to read the Introduction and Historical Notes to gain an idea of what is distinctive about the approach I have taken and the translation itself which I hope will stand on its own meritsThe original impulse for making the translation came from my conviction that the text deserved to be offered freely as a gift of DhammaAs I knew of no existing translations available as gifts I made my ownThe explanatory material is designed to meet with the needs of two sorts of readers those who want to read the text as a text in the context of the religious history of Buddhism  viewed from the outside  and those who want to read the text as a guide to the personal conduct of their livesAlthough there is no clear line dividing these groups the Introduction is aimed more at the second group and the Historical Notes more at the firstThe End Notes and Glossary contain material that should be of interest to bothVerses marked with an asterisk in the translation are discussed in the End NotesPali terms  as well as English terms used in a special sense such as effluent enlightened one fabrication stress and Unbinding  when they appear in more than one verse are explained in the GlossaryIn addition to the previous translators and editors from whose work I have borrowed I owe a special debt of gratitude to Jeanne Larsen for her help in honing down the language of the translationAlso John Bullitt Gil Fronsdal Charles Hallisey Karen King Andrew Olendzki Ruth Stiles Clark Strand Paula Trahan and Jane Yudelman offered many helpful comments that improved the quality of the book as a wholeAny mistakes that remain of course are my own responsibilityThe Dhammapada an anthology of verses attributed to the Buddha has long been recognized as one of the masterpieces of early Buddhist literatureOnly more recently have scholars realized that it is also one of the early masterpieces in the Indian tradition of kavya or belles lettresThis translation of the Dhammapada is an attempt to render the verses into English in a way that does justice to both of the traditions to which the text belongsAlthough it is tempting to view these traditions as distinct dealing with form and content the ideals of kavya aimed at combining form and content into a seamless wholeAt the same time the early Buddhists adopted and adapted the conventions of kavya in a way that skillfully dovetailed with their views of how teaching and listening played a role in their path of practiceMy hope is that the translation presented here will convey the same seamlessness and skillAs an example of kavya the Dhammapada has a fairly complete body of ethical and aesthetic theory behind it for the purpose of kavya was to instruct in the highest ends of life while simultaneously giving delightThe ethical teaching of the Dhammapada is expressed in the first pair of verses the mind through its actions is the chief architect of ones happiness and suffering both in this life and beyondThe first three chapters elaborate on this point to show that there are two major ways of relating to this fact as a wise person who is heedful enough to make the necessary effort to train hisher own mind to be a skillful architect and as a fool who is heedless and sees no reason to train the mindThe work as a whole elaborates on this distinction showing in more detail both the path of the wise person and that of the fool together with the rewards of the former and the dangers of the latter the path of the wise person can lead not only to happiness within the cycle of death and rebirth but also to total escape into the Deathless beyond the cycle entirely the path of the fool leads not only to suffering now and in the future but also to further entrapment within the cycleThe purpose of the Dhammapada is to make the wise path attractive to the reader so that heshe will follow it  for the dilemma posited by the first pair of verses is not one in the imaginary world of fiction it is the dilemma in which the reader is already placed by the fact of being bornTo make the wise path attractive the techniques of poetry are used to give savor to the messageAncient Indian aesthetic treatises devoted a great deal of discussion to the notion of savor and how it could be conveyedThe basic theory was this Artistic composition expressed states of emotion or states of mind called bhava The standard list of basic emotions included love humor grief anger energy fear disgust and astonishmentThe reader or listener exposed to these presentations of emotion did not participate in them directly rather heshe savored them as an aesthetic experience at one remove from the emotionThus the savor of grief is not grief but compassionThe savor of energy is not energy itself but admiration for heroismThe savor of love is not love but an experience of sensitivityThe savor of astonishment is a sense of the marvelousThe proof of the indirectness of the aesthetic experience was that some of the basic emotions were decidedly unpleasant while the savor of the emotion was to be enjoyedAlthough a work of art might depict many emotions and thus  like a good meal  offer many savors for the readerlistener to taste one savor was supposed to dominateWriters made a common practice of announcing the savor they were trying to produce usually stating in passing that their particular savor was the highest of allThe Dhammapada states explicitly that the savor of Dhamma is the highest savor which indicates that that is the basic savor of the workClassic aesthetic theory lists the savor of Dhamma or justice as one of the three basic varieties of the heroic savor thus we would expect the majority of the verses to depict energy and in fact they do with their exhortations to action strong verbs repeated imperatives and frequent use of the imagery from battles races and conquestsDhamma in the Buddhist sense implies more than the justice of Dhamma in aesthetic theoryHowever the long section of the Dhammapada devoted to The Judge  beginning with a definition of a good judge and continuing with examples of good judgment  shows that the Buddhist concept of Dhamma has room for the aesthetic meaning of the term as wellClassic theory also holds that the heroic savor should especially at the end of a piece shade into the marvelousThis in fact is what happens periodically throughout the Dhammapada and especially at the end where the verses express astonishment at the amazing and paradoxical qualities of a person who has followed the path of heedfulness to its end becoming pathless  totally indescribable transcending conflicts and dualities of every sortThus the predominant emotions that the verses express in Pali  and should also express in translation  are energy and astonishment so as to produce qualities of the heroic and marvelous for the reader to savorThis savor is then what inspires the reader to follow the path of wisdom with the result that heshe will reach a direct experience of the true happiness transcending all dualities found at the end of the pathClassic aesthetic theory lists a variety of rhetorical features that can produce savorExamples from these lists that can be found in the Dhammapada include accumulation admonitions ambiguity benedictions distinctions encouragement etymology examples explanations of cause and effect illustrations implications rhetorical questions praise prohibitions and ornamentationOf these ornamentation is the most complex including four figures of speech and ten qualities The figures of speech are simile extended metaphor rhyme and lampsThis last figure is a peculiarity of Pali  a heavily inflected language  that allows say one adjective to modify two different nouns or one verb to function in two separate sentencesIn English the closest we have to this is parallelism combined with ellipsisAn example from the translation is in verse  where overcomes functions as the verb in both clauses even though it is elided from the secondThis is how I have rendered lamps in most of the verses although in two cases I found it more effective to repeat the lampwordThe ten qualities are more general attributes of sound syntax and sense including such attributes as charm clarity delicacy evenness exaltation sweetness and strengthThe ancient texts are not especially clear on what some of these terms mean in practiceEven where they are clear the terms deal in aspects of PaliSanskrit syntax not always applicable to EnglishWhat is important though is that some qualities are seen as more suited to a particular savor than others strength and exaltation for example best convey a taste of the heroic and marvelousOf these characteristics strength is the easiest to quantify for it is marked by long compounded wordsIn the Dhammapada approximately one tenth of the verses contain compounds that are as long as a whole line of verse and one verse has three of its four lines made up of such compoundsBy the standards of later Sanskrit verse this is rather mild but when compared with verses in the rest of the Pali Canon and other early masterpieces of kavya the Dhammapada is quite strongThe text also explicitly adds to the theory of characteristics in saying that sweetness is not just an attribute of words but of the person speakingIf the person is a true example of the virtue espoused hisher words are sweetThis point could be generalized to cover many of the other qualities as wellAnother point from classic aesthetic theory that may be relevant to the Dhammapada is the principle of how a literary work is given unityAlthough the text does not provide a stepbystep sequential portrait of the path of wisdom as a lyric anthology it is much more unified than most Indian examples of that genreThe classic theory of dramatic plot construction may be playing an indirect role hereOn the one hand a plot must exhibit unity by presenting a conflict or dilemma and depicting the attainment of a goal through overcoming that conflictThis is precisely what unifies the Dhammapada it begins with the duality between heedless and heedful ways of living and ends with the final attainment of total masteryOn the other hand the plot must not show smooth systematic progress otherwise the work would turn into a treatiseThere must be reversals and diversions to maintain interestThis principle is at work in the fairly unsystematic ordering of the Dhammapadas middle sectionsVerses dealing with the beginning stages of the path are mixed together with those dealing with later stages and even stages beyond the completion of the pathOne more point is that the ideal plot should be constructed with a subplot in which a secondary character gains hisher goal and in so doing helps the main character attain his or hersIn addition to the aesthetic pleasure offered by the subplot the ethical lesson is one of human cooperation people attain their goals by working togetherIn the Dhammapada the same dynamic is at workThe main plot is that of the person who masters the principle of kamma to the point of total release from kamma and the round of rebirth the subplot depicts the person who masters the principle of kamma to the point of gaining a good rebirth on the human or heavenly planesThe second person gains hisher goal in part by being generous and respectful to the first person thus enabling the first person to practice to the point of total masteryIn return the first person gives counsel to the second person on how to pursue hisher goalIn this way the Dhammapada depicts the play of life in a way that offers two potentially heroic roles for the reader to choose from and delineates those roles in such a way that all people can choose to be heroic working together for the attainment of their own true well beingPerhaps the best way to summarize the confluence of Buddhist and kavya traditions in the Dhammapada is in light of a teaching from another early Buddhist text the Samyutta Nikaya on the factors needed to attain ones first taste of the goal of the Buddhist pathThose factors are four associating with people of integrity listening to their teachings using appropriate attention to inquire into the way those teachings apply to ones life and practicing in line with the teachings in a way that does them justiceEarly Buddhists used the traditions of kavya  concerning savor rhetoric structure and figures of speech  primarily in connection with the second of these factors in order to make the teachings appealing to the listenerHowever the question of savor is related to the other three factors as wellThe words of a teaching must be spoken by a person of integrity who embodies their message in hisher actions if their savor is to be sweetThe listener must reflect on them appropriately and then put them into practice if they are to have more than a passing superficial tasteThus both the speaker and listener must act in line with the words of a teaching if it is to bear fruitThis point is reflected in a pair of verses from the Dhammapada itselfAppropriate reflection the first step a listener should follow in carrying out the wellspoken word means contemplating ones own life to see the dangers of following the path of foolishness and the need to follow the path of wisdomThe Buddhist tradition recognizes two emotions as playing a role in this reflectionThe first is samvega a strong sense of dismay that comes with realizing the futility and meaningless of life as it is normally lived together with a feeling of urgency in trying to find a way out of the meaningless cycleThe second emotion is pasada the clarity and serenity that come when one recognizes a teaching that presents the truth of the dilemma of existence and at the same time points the way outOne function of the verses in the Dhammapada is to provide this sense of clarity which is why verse states that the wise grow serene on hearing the Dhamma and states that the most worthwhile verse is the meaningful one that on hearing brings peaceHowever the process does not stop with these preliminary feelings of peace and serenityThe listener must carry through with the path of practice that the verses recommendAlthough much of the impetus for doing so comes from the emotions of samvega and pasada sparked by the content of the verses the heroic and marvelous savor of the verses plays a role as well by inspiring the listener to rouse within him or herself the energy and strength that the path will requireWhen the path is brought to fruition it brings the peace and delight of the DeathlessThis is where the process initiated by hearing or reading the Dhamma bears its deepest savor surpassing all othersIt is the highest sense in which the meaningful verses of the Dhammapada bring peaceIn preparing the following translation I have kept the above points in mind motivated both by a firm belief in the truth of the message of the Dhammapada and by a desire to present it in a compelling way that will induce the reader to put it into practiceAlthough trying to stay as close as possible to the literal meaning of the text Ive also tried to convey its savorIm operating on the classic assumption that although there may be a tension between giving instruction and giving delight the best translation is one that plays with that tension without submitting totally to one side at the expense of the otherTo convey the savor of the work I have aimed at a spare style flexible enough to express not only its dominant emotions  energy and astonishment  but also its transient emotions such as humor delight and fearAlthough the original verses conform to metrical rules the translations are in free verseThis is the form that requires the fewest deviations from literal accuracy and allows for a terse directness that conforms with the heroic savor of the originalThe freedom I have used in placing words on the page also allows many of the poetic effects of Pali syntax  especially the parallelism and ellipsis of the lamps  to shine throughI have been relatively consistent in choosing English equivalents for Pali terms especially where the terms have a technical meaningTotal consistency although it may be a logical goal is by no means a rational one especially in translating poetryAnyone who is truly bilingual will appreciate this pointWords in the original were chosen for their sound and connotations as well as their literal sense so the same principles  within reasonable limits  have been used in the translationDeviations from the original syntax are rare and have been limited primarily to six sortsThe first four are for the sake of immediacy occasional use of the American you for one occasional use of imperatives for optatives substituting active for passive voice and replacing he who does this with he does this in many of the verses defining the true brahman in ChapterThe remaining two deviations are making minor adjustments in sentence structure to keep a word at the beginning or end of a verse when this position seems important and changing the number from singular to plural when talking about personality types both to streamline the language and to lighten the gender bias of the original PaliIn verses where I sense that a particular Pali word or phrase is meant to carry multiple meanings I have explicitly given all of those meanings in the English even where this has meant a considerable expansion of the verseOtherwise I have tried to make the translation as transparent as possible in order to allow the light and energy of the original to pass through with minimal distortionThe Dhammapada has for centuries been used as an introduction to the Buddhist point of viewHowever the text is by no means elementary either in terms of content or styleMany of the verses presuppose at least a passing knowledge of Buddhist doctrine others employ multiple levels of meaning and wordplay typical of polished kavyaFor this reason I have added notes to the translation to help draw out some of the implications of verses that might not be obvious to people who are new to either of the two traditions that the text representsI hope that whatever delight you gain from this translation will inspire you to put the Buddhas words into practice so that you will someday taste the savor not just of the words but of the Deathless to which they pointThere are many versions of the Dhammapada now extant several recensions of the Pali Dhammapada from Burma Cambodia Laos Sri Lanka and Thailand two incomplete manuscripts of a Gandhari Dharmapada found in central Asia and a manuscript of a Buddhist HybridSanskrit Dharmapada found in a library in Tibet called the Patna Dharmapada because photographs of this manuscript are now kept in Patna IndiaThere is also a Chinese translation of the Dharmapada made in the third century CEfrom a Prakrit original now no longer extant similar to  but not identical with  the Pali DhammapadaParts of a Dharmapada text are included in the Mahavastu a text belonging to the Lokottaravadin Mahasanghika schoolIn addition there are Sanskrit Tibetan and Chinese versions of a text called the Udanavarga which is known in at least four recensions all of them containing many verses in common with the DhammapadaDharmapada textsTo further complicate matters there are Jain anthologies that contain verses clearly related to some of those found in these Buddhist anthologies as wellDespite the many similarities among these texts they contain enough discrepancies to have fueled a small scholarly industryThe different recensions of the Pali Dhp contain so many variant readings that there isnt yet  even after more than a century of Western scholarship on the topic  a single edition covering them allThe discrepancies among the Pali and nonPali versions are even greaterThey arrange verses in different orders each contains verses not found in the others and among the verses in different versions that are related the similarity in terms of imagery or message is sometimes fairly tenuousFortunately for anyone looking to the Dhp for spiritual guidance the differences among the various recensions  though many in number  range in importance from fairly minor to minor in the extremeAllowing for a few obvious scribal errors none of them fall outside the pale of what has long been accepted as standard early Buddhist doctrine as derived from the Pali discoursesFor example does the milk in verse come out or does it curdleIs the bond in verse subtle slack or elasticIs the brahman in verse happy or is he pureFor all practical purposes these questions hardly matterThey become important only when one is forced to take sides in choosing which version to translate and even then the nature of the choice is like that of a conductor deciding which of the many versions of a Handel oratorio to performUnfortunately for the translator though the scholarly discussions that have grown around these issues have tended to blow them all out of proportion to the point where they call into question the authenticity of the Dhp as a wholeBecause the scholars who have devoted themselves to this topic have come up with such contradictory advice for the potential translator  including the suggestion that its a waste of time to translate some of the verses at all  we need to sort through the discussions to see what if any reliable guidance they giveThose who have worked on the issues raised by the variant versions of Dhp have by and large directed the discussion to figuring out which version is the oldest and most authentic and which versions are later and more corruptLacking any outside landmarks against which the versions can be sighted scholars have attempted to reconstruct what must have been the earliest version by triangulating among the texts themselvesThis textual trigonometry tends to rely on assumptions from among the following three types Assumptions concerning what is inherently an earlier or later form of a verseThese assumptions are the least reliable of the three for they involve no truly objective criteriaIf for instance two versions of a verse differ in that one is more internally consistent than the other the consistent version will seem more genuine to one scholar whereas another scholar will attribute the consistency to later efforts to clean up the verseSimilarly if one version contains a rendition of a verse different from all other renditions of the same verse one scholar will see that as a sign of deviance another as a sign of the authenticity that may have predated a later standardization among the textsThus the conclusions drawn by different scholars based on these assumptions tell us more about the scholars presuppositions than they do about the texts themselves Assumptions concerning the meter of the verses in questionOne of the great advances in recent Pali scholarship has been the rediscovery of the metrical rules underlying early Pali poetryAs the Buddha himself is quoted as saying Meter is the structural framework of verses Knowledge of metrical rules thus helps the editor or translator spot which readings of a verse deviate from the structure of a standard meter and which ones follow itTheoretically the obvious choice would be to adopt the latter and reject the formerIn practice however the issue is not so clearcutEarly Pali poetry dates from a time of great metrical experimentation and so there is always the possibility that a particular poem was composed in an experimental meter that never achieved widespread recognitionThere is also the possibility that  as the poetry was spontaneous and oral  a fair amount of metrical license was allowedThis means that the more correct forms of a verse may have been the products of a later attempt to fit the poetry into standard moldsThus the conclusions based on the assumption of standard meters are not as totally reliable as they might seem Assumptions concerning the language in which the original Dhp was first composedThese assumptions require an extensive knowledge of Middle Indic dialectsA scholar will assume a particular dialect to have been the original language of the text and will further make assumptions about the types of translation mistakes that might have been common when translating from that dialect into the languages of the texts we now haveThe textual trigonometry based on these assumptions often involves such complicated methods of sighting and computation that it can produce an original version of the text that is just that very original coinciding with none of the versions extantIn other words where the current variants of a verse might be a b and c the added assumption about the Dhps original language and the ineptitude of ancient translators and copyists leads to the conclusion that the verse must have been dHowever for all the impressive erudition that this method involves not even the most learned scholar can offer any proof as to what the Dhps original language wasIn fact as we will consider below it is possible that the Buddha  assuming that he was the author of the verses  composed poetry in more than one language and more than one version of a particular verseSo as with the first set of assumptions the methods of triangulation based on an assumed original language of the Dhp tell us more about the individual scholars position than they do about the position of the textThus although the scholarship devoted to the different recensions of the Dhp has provided a useful service in unearthing so many variant readings of the text none of the assumptions used in trying to sort through those readings for the original Dhp have led to any definite conclusionsTheir positive success has been limited mainly to offering food for academic speculation and educated guessesOn the negative side though they have succeeded in accomplishing something totally useless a wholesale sense of distrust for the early Buddhist texts and the poetic texts in particularIf the texts contain so many varying reports the feeling goes and if their translators and transmitters were so incompetent how can any of them be trustedThis distrust comes from accepting unconsciously the assumptions concerning authorship and authenticity within which our modern predominately literate culture operates that only one version of a verse could have been composed by its original author and that all other versions must be later corruptionsIn terms of the Dhp this comes down to assuming that there was only one original version of the text and that it was composed in a single languageHowever these assumptions are totally inappropriate for analyzing the oral culture in which the Buddha taught and in which the verses of the Dhp were first anthologizedIf we look carefully at the nature of that culture  and in particular at clear statements from the early Buddhist texts concerning the events and principles that shaped those texts  we will see that it is perfectly natural that there should be a variety of reports about the Buddhas teachings all of which might be essentially correctIn terms of the Dhp we can view the multiple versions of the text as a sign not of faulty transmission but of an allegiance to their oral originsOral prose and poetry are very different from their written counterpartsThis fact is obvious even in our own cultureHowever we have to make an active effort of the imagination to comprehend the expectations placed on oral transmission between speakers and listeners in a culture where there is no written word to fall back onIn such a setting the verbal heritage is maintained totally through repetition and memorizationA speaker with something new to say has to repeat it often to different audiences  who if they feel inspired by the message are expected to memorize at least its essential partsBecause communication is facetoface a speaker is particularly prized for an ability to tailor hisher message to the moment of communication in terms of the audiences background from the past its state of mind at present and its hopedfor benefits in the futureThis puts a double imperative on both the speaker and the listenerThe speaker must choose hisher words with an eye both to how they will affect the audience in the present and to how they will be memorized for future referenceThe listener must be attentive both to appreciate the immediate impact of the words and to memorize them for future useAlthough originality in teaching is appreciated it is only one of a constellation of virtues expected of a teacherOther expected virtues include a knowledge of common culture and an ability to play with that knowledge for the desired effect in terms of immediate impact or memorabilityThe Pali Dhp itself makes this point in comparing the act of teaching not to creating something totally new out of nothing but to selecting among available flowers to create a pleasing arrangement just right for the occasionOf course there are situations in an oral culture where either immediate impact or memorability is emphasized at the expense of the otherIn a classroom listening for impact is sacrificed to the needs of listening for memorization whereas in a theater the emphasis is reversedAll indications show however that the Buddha as a teacher was especially sensitive to both aspects of oral communication and that he trained his listeners to be sensitive to both as wellOn the one hand the repetitious style of many of his recorded teachings seems to have been aimed at hammering them into the listeners memory also at the end of many of his discourses he would summarize the main points of the discussion in an easytomemorize verseOn the other hand there are many reports of instances in which his listeners gained immediate Awakening while listening to his wordsAnd there is a delightful section in one of his discourses satirizing the teachers of other religious sects for their inability to break away from the formulaic mode of their teachings to give a direct answer to specific questions The Buddha in contrast was famous for his ability to speak directly to his listeners needsThis sensitivity to both present impact and future use is in line with two wellknown Buddhist teachings first the basic Buddhist principle of causality that an act has repercussions both in the present and on into the future second the Buddhas realization early on in his teaching career that some of his listeners would attain Awakening immediately on hearing his words whereas others would be able to awaken only after taking his words contemplating them and putting them into prolonged practiceA survey of the Buddhas prose discourses recorded in the Pali Canon gives an idea of how the Buddha met the double demands placed on him as a teacherIn some cases to respond to a particular situation he would formulate an entirely original teachingIn others he would simply repeat a formulaic answer that he kept in store for general use either teachings original with him or more traditional teachings  sometimes lightly tailored sometimes not  that fit in with his messageIn still others he would take formulaic bits and pieces and combine them in a new way for the needs at handA survey of his poetry reveals the same range of material original works set pieces  original or borrowed occasionally altered in line with the occasion and recyclings of old fragments in new juxtapositionsThus although the Buddha insisted that all his teachings had the same taste  that of release  he taught different variations on the theme of that taste to different people on different occasions in line with his perception of their short and longterm needsIn reciting a verse to a particular audience he might change a word a line or an image to fit in with their backgrounds and individual needsAdding to this potential for variety was the fact that the people of northern India in his time spoke a number of different dialects each with its own traditions of poetry and proseThe Pali Cullavagga records the Buddha as insisting that his listeners memorize his teachings not in a standardized lingua franca but in their own dialectsThere is no way of knowing whether he himself was multilingual enough to teach all of his students in their own dialects or expected them to make the translations themselvesStill it seems likely that as a welleducated aristocrat of the time he would have been fluent in at least two or three of the most prevalent dialectsSome of the discourses  such as DN  depict the Buddha as an articulate connoisseur of poetry and song so we can expect that he would also have been sensitive to the special problems involved in the effective translation of poetry  alive for instance to the fact that skilled translation requires more than simply substituting equivalent wordsThe Mahavagga reports that the Buddha listened with appreciation as a monk from the southern country of Avanti recited some of his teachings  apparently in the Avanti dialect  in his presenceAlthough scholars have often raised questions about which language the Buddha spoke it might be more appropriate to remain open to the possibility that he spoke  and could compose poetry in  severalThis possibility makes the question of the original language or the original text of the Dhp somewhat irrelevantThe texts suggest that even during the Buddhas lifetime his students made efforts to collect and memorize a standardized body of his teachings under a rubric of nine categories dialogues narratives of mixed prose and verse explanations verses spontaneous exclamations quotations birth stories amazing events question and answer sessionsHowever the act of collecting and memorizing was pursued by only a subgroup among his monks while other monks nuns and lay people doubtlessly had their own individual memorized stores of teachings they had heard directly from the Buddha or indirectly through the reports of their friends and acquaintancesThe Buddha had the foresight to ensure that this less standardized fund of memories not be discounted by later generations at the same time he established norms so that mistaken reports deviating from the principles of his teachings would not be allowed to creep into the accepted body of doctrineTo discourage fabricated reports of his words he warned that anyone who put words in his mouth was slandering himThis however could in no way prevent mistaken reports based on honest misunderstandingsSo shortly before his death he summarized the basic principles of his teachings the Wings to Awakening in the general framework of the development of virtue concentration and discernment leading to releaseThen he announced the general norms by which reports of his teachings were to be judgedThe Mahaparinibbana Suttanta quotes him as sayingThus a report of the Buddhas teachings was to be judged not on the authority of the reporter or his sources but on the principle of consistency did it fit in with what was already known of the doctrineThis principle was designed to ensure that nothing at odds with the original would be accepted into the standard canon but it did open the possibility that teachings in line with the Buddhas yet not actually spoken by him might find their way inThe early redactors of the canon seem to have been alert to this possibility but not overly worried by itAs the Buddha himself pointed out many times he did not design or create the DhammaHe simply found it in natureAnyone who developed the pitch of mental strengths and abilities needed for Awakening could discover the same principles as wellThus the Dhamma was by no means exclusively hisThis attitude was carried over into the passages of the Vinaya that cite four categories of Dhamma statements spoken by the Buddha spoken by his disciples spoken by seers spoken by heavenly beingsAs long as a statement was in accordance with the basic principles the question of who first stated it did not matterIn an oral culture where a saying might be associated with a person because he authored it approved it repeated it often or inspired it by hisher words or actions the question of authorship was not the overriding concern it has since become in literate culturesThe recent discovery of evidence that a number of teachings associated with the Buddha may have pre or postdated his time would not have fazed the early Buddhists at all as long as those teachings were in accordance with the original principlesShortly after the Buddhas passing away the Cullavagga reports his disciples met to agree on a standardized canon of his teachings abandoning the earlier ninefold classification and organizing the material into something approaching the canon we have todayThere is clear evidence that some of the passages in the extant canon do not date to the first convocation as they report incidents that took place afterwardsThe question naturally arises as to whether there are any other later additions not so obviousThis question is particularly relevant with regard to texts like the Dhp whose organization differs considerably from redaction to redaction and leads naturally to the further question of whether a later addition to the canon can be considered authenticThe Cullavagga recounts an incident that sheds light on this issueIn other words VenPurana maintained  and undoubtedly taught to his followers  a record of the Buddhas teachings that lay outside the standardized version but was nevertheless authenticAs we have already noted there were monks nuns and lay people like him even while the Buddha was alive and there were probably others like him who continued maintaining personal memories of the Buddhas teachings even after the latters deathThis story shows the official early Buddhist attitude toward such differing traditions each accepted the trustworthiness of the othersAs time passed some of the early communities may have made an effort to include these external records in the standardized canon resulting in various collections of prose and verse passagesThe range of these collections would have been determined by the material that was available in or could be effectively translated into each individual dialectTheir organization would have depended on the taste and skill of the individual collectorsThus for instance we find verses in the Pali Dhp that do not exist in other Dhps as well as verses in the Patna and Gandhari Dhps that the Pali tradition assigns to the Jataka or Sutta NipataWe also find verses in one redaction composed of lines scattered among several verses in anotherIn any event the fact that a text was a later addition to the standardized canon does not necessarily mean that it was a later inventionGiven the ad hoc way in which the Buddha sometimes taught and the scattered nature of the communities who memorized his teachings the later additions to the canons may simply represent earlier traditions that escaped standardization until relatively lateWhen Buddhists began committing their canons to writing approximately at the beginning of the common era they brought a great change to the dynamic of how their traditions were maintainedThe advantages of written over oral transmission are obvious the texts are saved from the vagaries of human longterm memory and do not die out if those who have memorized them die before teaching others to memorize them as wellThe disadvantages of written transmission however are less obvious but no less realNot only is there the possibility of scribal error but  because transmission is not facetoface  there can also be the suspicion of scribal errorIf a reading seems strange to a student he has no way of checking with the scribe perhaps several generations distant to see if the reading was indeed a mistakeWhen confronted with such problems he may correct the reading to fit in with his ideas of what must be right even in cases where the reading was correct and its perceived strangeness was simply a result of changes in the spoken dialect or of his own limited knowledge and imaginationThe fact that manuscripts of other versions of the text were also available for comparison in such instances could have led scribes to homogenize the texts removing unusual variants even when the variants themselves may have gone back to the earliest days of the traditionThese considerations of how the Dhp may have been handed down to the present  and especially the possibility that variant recensions might all be authentic and that agreement among the recensions might be the result of later homogenization  have determined the way in which I have approached this translation of the Pali DhpUnlike some other recent translators I am treating the Pali Dhp as a text with its own integrity  just as each of the alternative traditions has its own integrity  and have not tried to homogenize the various traditionsWhere the different Pali recensions are unanimous in their readings even in cases where the reading seems strange I have stuck with the Pali without trying to rectify it in light of less unusual readings given in the other traditionsOnly in cases where the different Pali redactions are at variance with one another and the variants seem equally plausible have I checked the nonPali texts to see which variant they supportThe translation here is drawn from three editions of the text the Pali Text Society edition edited by Ovon Hinber and KRNorman the Oxford edition edited by John Ross Carter and Mahinda Palihawadana together with its extensive notes and the Royal Thai edition of the Pali CanonThe pts edition gives the most extensive list of variant readings among the Pali recensions but even it is not completeThe Royal Thai edition for example contains preferred and variant readings not given in the PTS version at allPassages where I have differed from the PTS reading are cited in the End NotesDrawing selectively on various recensions in this way I cannot guarantee that the resulting reading of the Dhp corresponds exactly to the Buddhas words or to any one text that once existed in ancient IndiaHowever as I mentioned at the beginning of this note all the recensions agree in their basic principles so the question is immaterialThe true test of the reading  and the resulting translation  is if the reader feels engaged enough by the verses to put their principles into practice and finds that they do indeed lead to the release that the Buddha taughtIn the final analysis nothing else really countsThe fact that the word mano is paired here with dhamma would seem to suggest that it is meant in its role as intellect the sense medium that conveys knowledge of ideas or mental objectsHowever the illustrations in the second sentence of each verse show that it is actually meant in its role as the mental factor responsible for the quality of ones actions the factor of will and intention shaping not only mental events but also physical realityThus following a Thai tradition I have rendered it here as heartThe images in these verses are carefully chosenThe cart representing suffering is a burden on the ox pulling it and the weight of its wheels obliterates the oxs trackThe shadow representing happiness is no weight on the body at allAll Pali recensions of this verse give the reading manomaya  made of the heart while all other recensions give the reading manojava  impelled by the heartThe question raised in this verse is answered in SNDhpA House  selfhood housebuilder  cravingHouse may also refer to the nine abodes of beings  the seven stations of consciousness and two spheresThe word anibbisam in can be read either as the negative gerund of nibbisati or as the negative gerund of nivisati altered to fit the meter meaning coming to a rest settled situated Both readings make sense in the context of the verse so the word is probably intended to have a double meaning without reward without restThe BuddhaNo outside contemplative No true contemplative defined as a person who has attained any of the four stages of Awakening exists outside of the practice of the Buddhas teachingsIn DN the Buddha is quoted as teaching his final student In any doctrine  discipline where the noble eightfold path is not found no contemplative of the first second third fourth order is foundBut in any doctrine  discipline where the noble eightfold path is found contemplatives of the first second third fourth order are foundThe noble eightfold path is found in this doctrine  discipline and right here there are contemplatives of the first second third fourth orderOther teachings are empty of knowledgeable contemplativesAnd if the monks dwell rightly this world will not be empty of arahants On objectification see note I have taught you this path reading akkhato vo maya maggo with the Thai edition a reading supported by the Patna DhpHaving known  for your knowing two ways of interpreting what is apparently a play on the Pali word aññaya which can be either be the gerund of ajanati or the dative of aññaOn the extraction of arrows as a metaphor for the practice see MN and MNAstute in expression knowing the combination of sounds  which comes first  which after Some arahants in addition to their ability to overcome all of their defilements are also endowed with four forms of acumen one of which is acumen with regard to expression ie a total mastery of linguistic expressionThis talent in particular must have been of interest to the anthologist who put together the DhpLastbody Because an arahant will not be reborn this present body is

who has not attained the hearts goal but remains intent on the unsurpassed safety from bondageA monk who is a friend with admirable people abandons what is unskillful and develops what is skillfulThese are the four drains on ones store of wealth being debauched in sex being debauched in drink being debauched in gambling and having evil people as friends associates and companionsJust as

for you to declare Friends the Tathagata  the supreme man the superlative man attainer of the superlative attainment  being described is described otherwise than with these four positions The Tathagata exists after death does not exist after death both does  does not exist after death neither exists nor does not exist after deathNo lordVery good AnuradhaVery goodBoth formerly  now it is only stress that I describe and the cessation of stressSee also other suttas in the Avyakata Samyutta ANThis samyutta is organized around questions that the Buddha left unansweredMost of the discourses here focus on questions in a standard list of ten that were apparently the hot issues for philosophers in the Buddhas day Is the cosmos eternalIs it not eternalIs it finiteIs it infiniteIs the body the same as the soulIs the body one thing and the soul anotherDoes the Tathagata exist after deathDoes he not exist after deathBothNeitherMN lists the reasons why the Buddha does not take a position on any of these questionsIn each case he says that such a position is a thicket of views a wilderness of views a contortion of views a writhing of views a fetter of viewsIt is accompanied by suffering distress despair  fever and it does not lead to disenchantment dispassion cessation to calm direct knowledge full awakening UnbindingThese reasons fall into two categoriesThe first concerns the present drawbacks of taking such a position It is accompanied by suffering distress despair and feverThe second category concerns the effects of such a position over time It does not lead to awakening or UnbindingANfurther explores the first category of reasonsMN further explores the secondSome of the discourses in this samyutta explore a third category of reasons for why the Buddha does not take a position on any of these questions Such a position is based on attachment to and misunderstanding of the aggregates and sense mediaWhen one sees these things for what they are as theyre actually present the idea of forming them into any of these positions simply does not occur to oneOf the discourses here SNand SNare special casesSNfocuses specifically on the questions that try to describe the status of the Tathagata after death and explains that having been released from the classification of the aggregates the Tathagata defies description in the same way that the sands of the river Ganges cannot be numbered and the waters of the oceans cannot be calculated in gallonsThe Commentary to this passage tries to fathom the Tathagatas infathomability but its attempt is controversialSee the note to that suttaEven more controversial is SN which addresses an issue not included in the standard list of ten undeclared questions Is there a selfIs there no selfMany scholars have been uncomfortable with the fact that the Buddha leaves this question unanswered believing that his statement that all phenomena are notself implicitly states that there is no selfThus they have tried to explain away the Buddhas silence on the existence or nonexistence of the self usually by pointing to the fourth of his reasons for not answering the question his bewildered interlocutor Vacchagotta would have become even more bewilderedHad the Buddha been asked by someone less bewildered these commentators say he would have given the straight answer that there is no selfHowever these commentators ignore two pointsThe Buddhas first two reasons for not answering the questions have nothing to do with VacchagottaTo say that there is a self he says would be siding with the wrong views of the eternalistsTo say that there is no self would be siding with the wrong views of the annihilationistsImmediately after Vacchagotta leaves VenAnanda asks the Buddha to explain his silenceHad the Buddha really meant to declare that there is no self this would have been the perfect time to do so for bewildered people were now out of the wayBut again he did not take that positionOne peculiarity of this approach to the Buddhas silence on this issue is that many commentators noting the Buddhas desire not to bewilder Vacchagotta assume somehow that their readers and listeners at present would not be bewildered by a doctrine that there is no self and feel free to jump into the breach stating baldly what they believe the Buddha was simply too reticent to sayAnother attempt to explain the Buddhas silence on this issue focuses on the second reason for his silence saying that the annihilationists had laid claim to the slogan that there is no self so  because the Buddha did not want his own doctrine of no self to be confused with theirs  he avoided their sloganThis explanation however is not supported by the CanonThe doctrines of the annihilationists are presented in a fair amount of detail in the Canon and nowhere are they quoted as saying outright that there is no selfThus there is no basis for saying that it was their sloganSecond there are many instances where the Buddha when asked a categorical question concerning an issue where he wanted to give a nuanced answer showed himself perfectly capable of rephrasing the question in more nuanced terms before giving his replyHad he held a nuanced doctrine that there is no self he could have easily rephrased Vacchagottas question before answering itThe fact that he chose not to do so either in Vacchagottas or VenAnandas presence indicates that he felt that this issue too was a thicket of views based on a misunderstanding accompanied by suffering and not leading to awakeningSo how is the statement all phenomena are not self to be takenAs a path to awakeningAccording to Dhp when one sees this fact with discernment to the point of becoming disenchanted with stress it forms the path to purityHere the term phenomena covers fabricated and unfabricated phenomenaThe fabricated phenomena encountered along the path include the aggregates elements and sense mediaThe unfabricated phenomenon encountered when these fabricated phenomena cease is the deathlessAN however points out that it is possible on encountering the deathless to feel a dhammapassion and dhammadelight for it thus preventing full awakeningAt this point the realization that all phenomena are notself would be needed to overcome this last obstacle to total releaseAnd once there is release one becomes like the Tathagata indescribable deep boundless hard to fathom like the ocean At that point the path is abandoned like a raft after it has been used to cross a river and positions that there is a self and there is no self would not applyOn one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Rajagaha at the Squirrels SanctuaryNow at that time when the kings assembly had gathered and was sitting together in the royal palace this topic of conversation arose Money is allowable for the Sakyanson contemplativesThe Sakyanson contemplatives consent to moneyThe Sakyanson contemplatives accept moneyAt that time Maniculaka the headman was sitting in that assembly so he said to them Dont say that mastersMoney is not allowable for the Sakyanson contemplativesThe Sakyanson contemplatives do not consent to moneyThe Sakyanson contemplatives do not accept moneyThe Sakyanson contemplatives have given up gold  jewelry have renounced money And he was able to convince the assemblyThen he went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one sideAs he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One Just now lord when the kings assembly had gathered and was sitting together in the royal palace this topic of conversation arose Money is allowable for the Sakyanson contemplativesThe Sakyanson contemplatives consent to moneyThe Sakyanson contemplatives accept money When this was said I said to them Dont say that mastersMoney is not allowable for the Sakyanson contemplativesThe Sakyanson contemplatives do not consent to moneyThe Sakyanson contemplatives do not accept moneyThe Sakyanson contemplatives have given up gold  jewelry have renounced money And I was able to convince the assemblyAnswering in this way lord am I speaking in line with what the Blessed One has said am I not misrepresenting the Blessed One with what is unfactual am I answering in line with the Dhamma so that no one whose thinking is in line with the Dhamma will have grounds for criticizing meYes headman in answering in this way you are speaking in line with what I have said you are not misrepresenting me with what is unfactual and you are answering in line with the Dhamma so that no one whose thinking is in line with the Dhamma will have grounds for criticizing youFor money is not allowable for the Sakyanson contemplatives the Sakyanson contemplatives do not consent to money the Sakyanson contemplatives do not accept money the Sakyanson contemplatives have given up gold  jewelry have renounced moneyFor anyone for whom money is allowable the five strings of sensuality are also allowableFor anyone for whom the five strings of sensuality are allowable money is allowableThat you can unequivocally recognize as not the quality of a contemplative not the quality of a Sakyan sonNow I do say that thatch may be sought for by one needing thatch wood may be sought for by one needing wood a cart may be sought for by one needing a cart a workman may be sought for by one needing a workman but by no means do I say that money may be consented to or sought for in any way at allOn one occasion the Blessed One was staying among the Mallans in a Mallan town named UruvelakappaThen Gandhabhaka the headman went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one sideAs he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One It would be good lord if the Blessed One would teach me the origination  ending of stressHeadman if I were to teach you the origination  ending of stress with reference to the past saying Thus it was in the past you would be doubtful and perplexedIf I were to teach you the origination  ending of stress with reference to the future saying Thus it will be in the future you would be doubtful and perplexedSo instead I  sitting right here  will teach you sitting right there the origination  ending of stressListen  pay close attentionI will speakAs you say lord Gandhabhaka the headman repliedThe Blessed One said Now what do you think headman Are there any people in Uruvelakappa who if they were murdered or imprisoned or fined or censured would cause sorrow lamentation pain distress or despair to arise in youYes lord there are people in Uruvelakappa who if they were murdered or imprisoned or fined or censured would cause sorrow lamentation pain distress or despair to arise in meAnd are there any people in Uruvelakappa who if they were murdered or imprisoned or fined or censured would cause no sorrow lamentation pain distress or despair to arise in youYes lord there are people in Uruvelakappa who if they were murdered or imprisoned or fined or censured would cause no sorrow lamentation pain distress or despair to arise in meNow what is the cause what is the reason why the murder imprisonment fining or censure of some of the people in Uruvelakappa would cause you sorrow lamentation pain distress or despair whereas the murder imprisonment fining or censure of others would cause you no sorrow lamentation pain distress or despairThose people in Uruvelakappa whose murder imprisonment fining or censure would cause me sorrow lamentation pain distress or despair are those for whom I feel desire  passionThose people in Uruvelakappa whose murder imprisonment fining or censure would cause me no sorrow lamentation pain distress or despair are those for whom I feel no desire or passionNow headman from what you have realized fathomed attained right now in the present without regard to time you may draw an inference with regard to the past and future Whatever stress in arising arose for me in the past all of it had desire as its root had desire as its cause  for desire is the cause of stressAnd whatever stress in arising will arise for me in the future all of it will have desire as the root will have desire as its cause  for desire is the cause of stress Amazing lordStupendousHow well the Blessed One has put it Whatever stress in arising arose for me in the past all of it had desire as its root had desire as its cause  for desire is the cause of stressAnd whatever stress in arising will arise for me in the future all of it will have desire as the root will have desire as its cause  for desire is the cause of stress I have a son lord named Ciravasi who lives far away from hereWhen I get up in the morning I send a man saying Go learn how Ciravasi is doing And as long as that man has not returned I am simply beside myself Dont let Ciravasi be sick Now headman what do you think If Ciravasi were to be murdered or imprisoned or fined or censured would you feel sorrow lamentation pain distress  despairLord if my son Ciravasi were to be murdered or imprisoned or fined or censured my very life would be alteredSo how could I not feel sorrow lamentation pain distress  despairThus headman by this line of reasoning it may be realized how stress when arising arises All of it has desire as its root has desire as its cause  for desire is the cause of stressNow what do you think headman Before you had seen or heard of Ciravasis mother did you feel desire passion or love for herNo lordAnd after you had seen or heard of Ciravasis mother did you feel desire passion or love for herYes lordWhat do you think If Ciravasis mother were to be murdered or imprisoned or fined or censured would you feel sorrow lamentation pain distress  despairLord if Ciravasis mother were to be murdered or imprisoned or fined or censured my very life would be alteredSo how could I not feel sorrow lamentation pain distress  despairThus headman by this line of reasoning it may be realized how stress when arising arises All of it has desire

brought to downfall through the giving of cooked almsOn the contrary Whatever families are rich  with much wealth many possessions a great deal of money a great many accoutrements of wealth a great many commodities  all have become so from giving from truth from restraintHeadman there are eight causes eight reasons for the downfall of familiesFamilies go to their downfall because of kings or families go to their downfall because of thieves or families go to their downfall because of fire or families go to their downfall because of floods or their storedup treasure disappears or their mismanaged undertakings go wrong or in the family a wastrel is born who squanders scatters  shatters its wealth and inconstancy itself is the eighthThese are the eight causes the eight reasons for the downfall of familiesNow when these eight causes these eight reasons are to be found if anyone should say of me The Blessed One is practicing for the ruin of families the Blessed One is practicing for the demise of families the Blessed One is practicing for the downfall of families  without abandoning that statement without abandoning that intent without relinquishing that view  then as if he were

day forward for lifeSee also SNTranslators note Although the Jains like the Buddhists teach a doctrine of the moral consequences of actions the teachings of the two traditions differ in many important detailsThis discourse points out two of the major points where the Buddhist teaching is distinctive its understanding of the complexity of the kammic process and its application of that understanding to the psychology of teachingThe Buddha shows that a simplistic fatalistic view of the kammic process is logically inconsistent and also leads to unfortunate results for any person who with a background of bad kamma believes in itThe actual complexity of kamma however allows for a way in which past evil deeds can be overcome through refraining from evil now and into the future and through developing expansive mindstates of good will compassion appreciation  equanimityIn such an expansive mind state the unavoidable consequences of past evil actions count for next to nothingThe Buddha also shows how his method of teaching is better than that of the Jains in that it actually can help free the mind from debilitating feelings of guilt and remorse and lead to the overcoming of past kammaFor a fuller discussion of the complexity of the kammic process see Kamma and the Ending of Kamma in The Wings to AwakeningOn one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Nalanda in the Pavarika

headman the Tathaagata does dwell in compassion for all living beingsWell then Lord does not the Blessed One teach Dhamma in full to some but not so fully to othersI will reply to this question

wants to sow his seed which field would he sow first the excellent one the middling one or the poor one that is sandy salty and with bad soilLord the farmer who wanted to sow his seed would sow the excellent field firstHaving done that he would sow the middling field next and the one that was poor sandy salty with bad soil he might or might not sowWhyWell it might do for cattlefoodWell headman that excellent field is like my monks and nunsTo them I teach the Dhamma which is lovely in its beginning lovely in its middle and lovely in its ending in spirit and in letter I display to them the holy life perfectly fulfilled and purifiedWhyBecause these people adhere to me as their island their shelter their resort their refugeThe middling field is like my male and female layfollowersTo these too I teach the Dhamma which is lovely in its beginning lovely in its middle and lovely in its ending in spirit and in letter I display to them the holy life perfectly fulfilled and purifiedWhyBecause these people adhere to me as their island their shelter their resort their refugeThe poor field that is sandy salty and with bad soil is like my wandering recluses and Brahmans of other sectsTo them I also teach the Dhamma which is lovely in its beginning lovely in its middle and lovely in its ending in spirit and in letter I display to them the holy life perfectly fulfilled and purifiedWhyBecause if they only understand a single phrase it would long be for their profitAt that time Citta the householder was a sick man suffering from a serious illnessThen a number of devas that dwell in gardens forests and trees the devas of healing herbs and of great trees in the forest gathered together and said to Citta the householder Make a resolve householder In some future time may I be a king a worldruler To this Citta replied That is something impermanent something to be rejected and passed overNow Cittas friends colleagues and bloodrelations heard him say this and they said to him SirSet up mindfulness dont rambleWhat have I said that makes you tell me to set up mindfulness and not to rambleWhy sir you just said That is something impermanent something to be rejected and passed over Yes but I said that to the devas who dwell in gardens who bade me make a resolve that in some future time I might be a king a worldrulerSir what purpose did those devas have in mind in urging you to make such a resolveThis is what those devas thought This householder Citta is a virtuous man of noble dispositionIf he makes a resolve that in some future time he may be a king a worldruler this will be profitable to that virtuous man having made such a resolve with a pure heart and will bring the just man a just and great reward So then I said That is something impermanent something to be rejected and passed overOn one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Nalanda in the Pavarika Mango GroveThen Asibandhakaputta the headman went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down

fire  can take a dead person lift it out instruct it  send it to heavenBut the Blessed One worthy  rightly selfawakened can arrange it so that all the world at the breakup of the body after death reappears in a good destination the heavenly worldVery well then headman I will question you on this matterAnswer as you see fitWhat do you think There is the case where a man is one who takes life steals indulges in illicit sex is a liar one who speaks divisive speech harsh speech  idle chatter is greedy bears thoughts of illwill  holds to wrong viewsThen a great crowd of people gathering  congregating would pray praise  circumambulate with their hands palmtopalm over the heart May this man at the breakup of the body after death reappear in a good destination the heavenly world What do

man at the breakup of the body after death reappear in a good destination the heavenly world  still at the breakup of the body after death he would reappear in destitution a bad destination the lower realms hellNow what do you think There is the case where a man is one who refrains from taking life from stealing  from indulging in illicit sex he refrains from lying from speaking divisive speech from harsh speech  from idle chatter he is not greedy bears no thoughts of illwill  holds to right viewThen a great crowd of people gathering  congregating would pray praise  circumambulate with their

one in meaning and different only in nameIts a gain for you householder a great gain what your eye of discernment plumbs in the deep word of the BuddhaTranslators note This discourse is a slightly expanded version of a discussion of the same topic given in MNOn one occasion VenKamabhu was living near Macchikasanda in the Wild Mango GroveThen Citta the householder went to him and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one sideAs he was sitting there he said to VenKamabhu Venerable sir how many fabrications are thereThere are three fabrications householder bodilyfabrications verbal fabrications  mental fabricationsVery good venerable sir And delighting in and approving of VenKamabhus answer Citta asked him a further question But what are bodilyfabricationsWhat are verbal fabricationsWhat are mental fabricationsInout breaths are bodily fabricationsDirected thought  evaluation are verbal fabricationsPerceptions  feelings are mental fabricationsVery good venerable sir And delighting in and approving of VenKamabhus answer Citta asked him a further question But why are inout breaths bodily fabricationsWhy are directed thought  evaluation verbal fabricationsWhy are perceptions  feelings mental fabricationsInout breaths are bodily these are things tied up with the bodyThats why inout breaths are bodily fabricationsHaving first directed ones thoughts and made an evaluation one then breaks out into speechThats why directed thought  evaluation are verbal fabricationsPerceptions  feelings are mental these are things tied up with the mindThats why perceptions  feelings are mental fabricationsVery good venerable sir And delighting in and approving of VenKamabhus answer Citta asked him a further question Now how does the attainment of the cessation of perception  feeling come aboutThe thought does not occur to a monk as he is attaining the cessation of perception  feeling that I am about to attain the cessation of perception  feeling or that I am attaining the cessation of perception  feeling or that I have attained the cessation of perception  feeling Instead the way his mind has previously been developed leads him to that stateVery good venerable sir And delighting in and approving of VenKamabhus answer Citta asked him a further question When a monk is attaining the cessation of perception  feeling which things cease first bodily fabrications verbal fabrications or mental fabricationsWhen a monk is attaining the cessation of perception  feeling verbal fabrications cease first then bodily fabrications then mental fabricationsVery good venerable sir And delighting in and approving of VenKamabhus answer Citta asked him a further question What is the difference between a monk who has died  passed away and a monk who has attained the cessation of perception  feelingIn the case of a monk who has died  passed away his bodily fabrication has ceased  subsided verbal fabrication has ceased  subsided mental fabrication has ceased  subsided his life force is totally ended his heat is dissipated and his faculties are shut downBut in the case of a monk who has attained the cessation of perception  feeling his bodily fabrication has ceased  subsided verbal fabrication has ceased  subsided mental fabrication has ceased  subsided his life force is not ended his heat is not dissipated and his faculties are bright  clearThis is the difference between a monk who has died  passed away and a monk who has attained the cessation of perception  feelingVery good venerable sir And delighting in and approving of VenKamabhus answer Citta asked him a further question Now how does emergence from the cessation of perception  feeling come aboutThe thought does not occur to a monk as he is emerging from the cessation of perception  feeling that I am about to emerge from the cessation of perception  feeling or that I am emerging from the cessation of perception  feeling or that I have emerged from the cessation of perception  feeling Instead the way his mind has previously been developed leads him to that stateVery good venerable sir And delighting in and approving of VenKamabhus answer Citta asked him a further question When a monk is emerging from the cessation of perception  feeling which things arise first bodily fabrications verbal fabrications or mental fabricationsWhen a monk is emerging from the cessation of perception  feeling mental fabrications arise first then bodily fabrications then verbal fabricationsVery good venerable sir And delighting in and approving of VenKamabhus answer Citta asked him a further question When a monk has emerged from the cessation of perception  feeling how many contacts make contactWhen a monk has emerged from the cessation of perception  feeling three contacts make contact contact with emptiness contact with the signless  contact with the undirectedVery good venerable sir And delighting in and approving of VenKamabhus answer Citta asked him a further question When a monk has emerged from the cessation of perception  feeling to what does his mind lean to what does it tend to what does it inclineWhen a monk has emerged from the cessation of perception  feeling his mind leans to seclusion tends to seclusion inclines to seclusionVery good venerable sir And delighting in and approving of VenKamabhus answer Citta asked him a further question How many mental qualities are of great help in the attainment of the cessation of perception  feelingActually householder you have asked last what should have been asked firstNevertheless I will answer youTwo qualities are of great help in the attainment of the cessation of perception  feeling tranquillity  insightOn one occasion VenSariputta was staying in Magadha in Nalaka VillageThen Jambukhadika the wanderer went to VenSariputta and on arrival exchanged courteous greetings with himAfter this exchange of friendly greetings  courtesies he sat to one sideAs he was sitting there he said to VenSariputta Stress stress it is said my friend SariputtaWhich type of stressThere are these three forms of stressfulness my friend the stressfulness of pain the stressfulness of fabrication the stressfulness of changeThese are the three forms of stressfulnessBut is there a path is there a practice for the full comprehension of these forms of stressfulnessYes there is a path there is a practice for the full comprehension of these forms of stressfulnessThen what is the path what is the practice for the full comprehension of these forms of stressfulnessPrecisely this Noble Eightfold

of these forms of stressfulnessIts an auspicious path my friend an auspicious practice for the full comprehension of these forms of stressfulness  enough for the sake of heedfulnessOn one occasion a large number of senior monks were living near Macchikasanda in the Wild Mango GroveThen Citta the householder went to them and on arrival having bowed down to them sat to one sideAs he was sitting there he said to them Venerable sirs may the senior monks acquiesce to tomorrows meal from meThe senior monks acquiesced by silenceThen Citta the householder sensing the senior monks acquiescence got up from his seat and having bowed down to them circumambulated them  keeping them to his right  and leftWhen the night had passed the senior monks put on their robes in the early morning and  taking their bowls  outer robes  went to Cittas residenceThere they sat down on the appointed seatsCitta the householder went to them and having bowed down to them sat to one sideAs he was sitting there he

Tathagata neither exists nor doesnt exist after death these along with the sixtytwo views mentioned in the Brahmajala  when what is present do these views come into being and when what is absent do they not come into beingWhen this was said the senior monk was silentA second time A third time Citta the householder asked Concerning the various views that arise in the world when what is present do they come into being and what is absent do they not come into being A third time the senior monk was silentNow on that occasion VenIsidatta was the most junior of all the monks in that CommunityThen he said to the senior monk Allow me venerable sir to answer Citta the householders questionYou may answer it friend IsidattaNow householder are you asking this Concerning the various views that arise in the world when what is present do they come into being and what is absent do they not come into beingYes venerable sirConcerning the various views that arise in the world householder when selfidentity view is present these views come into being when selfidentity view is absent they dont come into beingBut venerable sir how does selfidentity view come into beingThere is the case householder where an uninstructed runofthemill person  who has no regard for noble ones is not wellversed or disciplined in their Dhamma who has no regard for men of integrity is not wellversed or

from Avanti named Isidatta an unseen friend of mine who has gone forthHave you ever seen himYes householderWhere is he living now venerable sirWhen this was said VenIsidatta was silentAre you my IsidattaYes householderThen may Master Isidatta delight in the charming Wild Mango Grove at MacchikasandaI will be responsible for your robes almsfood lodgings  medicinal requisitesThat is admirably

monks had finished eating and had removed their hands from their bowls they got up from their seats and leftThen the most senior monk said to VenIsidatta It was excellent friend Isidatta the way that question inspired you to answerIt didnt inspire an answer in me at allWhenever a similar question comes up again may it inspire you to answer as you did just nowThen VenIsidatta  having set his

monk went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one sideAs he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One Just now lord while I was alone in seclusion this train of

people have interpreted this sutta as stating that there are many experiences that cannot be explained by the principle of kammaA casual glance of the alternative factors here  drawn from the various causes for pain that were recognized in the medical treatises of his time  would seem to support this conclusionHowever if we compare this list with his definition of old kamma in SN we see that many of the alternative causes are actually the result of past actionsThose that arent are the result of new kammaFor instance MN counts asceticism  which produces pain in the immediate present  under the factor harsh treatmentThe point here is that old and new kamma do not override other causal factors operating in the universe  such as those recognized by the physical sciences  but instead find their expression within those factorsA second point is that some of the influences of past kamma can be mitigated in the present  a disease caused by bile for instance can be cured by medicine that brings the bile back to normalSimilarly with the mind suffering caused by physical pain can be ended by understanding and abandoning the attachment that led to that sufferingIn this way the Buddhas teaching on kamma avoids determinism and opens the way for a path of practice focused on eliminating the causes of suffering in the here and nowOn one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling near Rajagaha in the Bamboo Grove Monastery the Squirrels Feeding PlaceThere Moliyasivaka the wanderer went to the Blessed One and on arrival exchanged courteous greetings with himAfter an exchange of friendly greetings  courtesies he sat to one sideAs he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One Master Gotama there are some brahmans  contemplatives who are of this doctrine this view Whatever an individual feels  pleasure pain neitherpleasurenorpain  is entirely caused by what was done beforeNow what does Master Gotama say to thatThere are cases where some feelings arise based on bileYou yourself should know how some feelings arise based on bileEven the world is agreed on how some feelings arise based on bileSo any brahmans  contemplatives who are of the doctrine  view that whatever an individual feels  pleasure pain neitherpleasurenorpain  is entirely caused by what was done before  slip past what they themselves know slip past what is agreed on by the worldTherefore I say that those brahmans  contemplatives are wrongThere are cases where some feelings arise based on phlegm based on internal winds based on a combination of bodily humors from the change of the seasons from uneven care of the body from harsh treatment from the result of kammaYou yourself should know how some feelings arise from the result of kammaEven the world is agreed on how some feelings arise from the result of kammaSo any brahmans  contemplatives who are of the doctrine  view that whatever an individual feels  pleasure pain neither pleasurenorpain  is entirely caused by what was done before  slip past what they themselves know slip past what is agreed on by the worldTherefore I say that those brahmans  contemplatives are wrongWhen this was said Moliyasivaka the wanderer said to the Blessed One Magnificent lordMagnificentJust as if he were to place upright what was overturned to reveal what was hidden to point out the way to one who was lost or to carry a lamp into the dark so that those with eyes could see forms in the same way has the Blessed One  through many lines of reasoning  made the Dhamma clearI go to the Blessed One for refuge to the Dhamma  to the community of monksMay the

might say That is the highest pleasure that beings experience I would not grant them thatWhy is thatBecause there is another pleasure more extreme  refined than thatAnd what Ananda is another pleasure

pleasure more extreme  refined than thatNow its possible Ananda that some wanderers of other persuasions might say Gotama the contemplative speaks of the cessation of perception  feeling and yet describes it as pleasureWhat is thisHow can this be When they say that they are to be told Its not the case friends that the Blessed One describes only pleasant feeling as included under pleasureWherever pleasure is found in whatever terms the Blessed One describes it as pleasure See also MN ANI have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Vesali in the Great Forest at the Gabled PavilionThen in the late afternoon he left his seclusion and went to the sick ward and on arrival sat down on a prepared seatAs he was sitting there he addressed the monks A monk should approach the time of death mindful  alertThis is our instruction to you allAnd how is a monk mindfulThere is the case where a monk remains focused on the body in  of itself  ardent alert

he discerns that I am sensing a feeling limited to life He discerns that With the breakup of the body after the termination of life all that is sensed not being relished will grow cold right here See also Straight from the HeartSuppose monks a man catches six animals of different domains and different resorts of living  a snake a crocodile a bird a dog a jackal and a monkey tethering each with a stout ropeHaving tethered them with a stout rope he fastens the ropes together in the middle he lets go of themNow monks these six animals of different domains and feeding habits would swing around and struggle each trying to get to his natural domainThe snake would struggle thinking Ill get to the anthill the crocodile Ill get into the water the bird Ill fly up in the air the dog Ill make for the village the jackal Ill make for the charnelground the monkey Ill head for the forestNow monks when those six hungry animals grew weary they would yield to the one that was the strongest go his way and be under his powerIn the same way monks whenever a monk fails to practice and develop mindfulness as to body the eye struggles to draw him towards attractive objects while unattractive objects are repellent to him The mind struggles to draw him towards attractive objects of thought while unattractive objects of thought are repellent to himThis monks is lack of restraintAnd what monks is restraintIn this a monk seeing objects with the eye is not drawn to attractive objects is not repelled by unattractive objectsHe remains with firmly established mindfulness as to body his mind being unrestrictedHe knows in truth that liberation of the heart that liberation by wisdom through which those evil unskilled states that have arisen pass away without remainderSuppose a man catches six animals and he fastens the rope together to a stout post or pillar Then when those six animals grow weary they would have to stand crouch or lie down by the stout post or pillarIn the same way monks when a monk practices and develops mindfulness as to the body the eye does not struggle to draw him towards attractive visual objects nor are unattractive visual objects repellent to him the mind does not struggle to draw him towards attractive objects of thought nor are unattractive objects of thought repellent to himThis monks is restraintTethered to a stout post or pillar monks denotes mindfulness as to bodyTherefore monks this is how you must train yourselves We shall practice mindfulness as to body develop it make it our vehicle our dwellingplace our resort we will build it up and undertake it thoroughly This monks is how you must train yourselvesSuppose that a man wounded and festering were to go into a swampy jungleIts sharpbladed grasses would pierce his feet its thorns would scratch his festering soresAnd so from that cause he would experience an even greater measure of pain and unhappinessIn the same way there is the case where a certain monk having gone to a village or to the wilderness meets up with someone who upbraids him This venerable one acting in this way undertaking practices in this way is a thorn of impurity in this village Knowing this person to be a thorn one should understand restraint and lack of restraintAnd what is lack of restraintThere is the case where a monk seeing a form with the eye is obsessed with pleasing forms is repelled by unpleasing forms and remains with bodymindfulness unestablished with limited awarenessHe does not discern as it actually is present the awarenessrelease the discernmentrelease where any evil unskillful mental qualities that have arisen utterly cease without remainderHearing a sound with the earSmelling an aroma with the noseTasting a flavor with the tongueTouching a tactile sensation with the bodyCognizing an idea with the intellect he is obsessed with pleasing ideas is repelled by unpleasing ideas and remains with bodymindfulness unestablished with limited awarenessHe does not discern as it actually is present the awarenessrelease the discernmentrelease where any evil unskillful mental qualities that have arisen utterly cease without remainderJust as if a person catching six animals of different ranges of different habitats were to bind them with a strong ropeCatching a snake he would bind it with a strong ropeCatching a crocodile a bird a dog a hyena a monkey he would bind it with a strong ropeBinding them all with a strong rope and tying a knot in the middle he would set chase to themThen those six animals of different ranges of different habitats would each pull toward its own range  habitatThe snake would pull thinking Ill go into the anthill The crocodile would pull thinking Ill go into the water The bird would pull thinking Ill fly up into the air The dog would pull thinking Ill go into the village The hyena would pull thinking Ill go into the charnel ground The monkey would pull thinking Ill go into the forest And when these six animals became internally exhausted they would submit they would surrender they would come under the sway of whichever among them was the strongestIn the same way when a monk whose mindfulness immersed in the body is undeveloped  unpursued the eye pulls toward pleasing forms while unpleasing forms are repellentThe ear pulls toward pleasing sounds The nose pulls toward pleasing aromas The tongue pulls toward pleasing flavors The body pulls toward pleasing tactile sensations The intellect pulls toward pleasing ideas while unpleasing ideas are repellentThis monks is lack of restraintAnd what is restraintThere is the case where a monk seeing a form with the eye is not obsessed with pleasing forms is not repelled by unpleasing forms and remains with bodymindfulness established with immeasurable awarenessHe discerns as it actually is present the awarenessrelease the discernmentrelease where all evil unskillful mental qualities that have arisen utterly cease without

thinking Ill go into the charnel ground The monkey would pull thinking Ill go into the forest And when these six animals became internally exhausted they would stand sit or lie down right there next to the post or stakeIn the same way when a monk whose mindfulness immersed in the body is developed  pursued the eye does not pull toward pleasing forms and unpleasing forms are not repellentThe ear does not pull toward pleasing sounds The nose does not pull toward pleasing aromas The tongue does not pull toward pleasing flavors The body does not pull toward pleasing tactile sensations The intellect does not pull toward pleasing ideas and unpleasing ideas are not repellentThis monks is restraintThus you should train yourselves We will develop mindfulness immersed in the bodyWe will pursue it hand it the reins and take it as a basis give it a groundingWe will steady it consolidate it and set about it properly Thats how you should train yourselvesSuppose monks there is some ripe corn and a lazy guardianAnd an ox fond of corn gets into the field and eats his fill with ravenous delightIn the same way monks the ignorant worldling being uncontrolled in the six sensespheres eats his fill with ravenous delight among the five kinds of sensepleasureBut suppose monks there is some ripe corn and a vigilant guardianAnd an ox fond of corn gets into the fieldThe guardian seizes him firmly by the muzzleHolding him by the muzzle he gets a firm grip on his forehead and holds him fastHe then gives him a sound thrashing with a stick and then lets him go So it comes about monks that that ox fond of corn though he wanders about in the village or the forest whether he stands still or lies down will not go into that field again because he remember the beating he got there beforeIn the same way monks when a monks mind is strongly stirred by the six sensespheres nevertheless he stands firm inwardly becomes calm onepointed and concentratedMonks in whatever monk or nun there arises desire passion aversion delusion or mental resistance with regard to forms cognizable via the eye heshe should hold the mind in checkIts dangerous  dubious that path thorny  overgrown a miserable path a devious path impenetrableIts a path followed by people of no integrity not a path followed by people of integrityIts not worthy of you heshe should hold the mind in check with regard to forms

an uninstructed runofthemill person not exercising restraint with regard to the six media of sensual contact intoxicates himself with the five strings of sensuality as much as he likesNow suppose that corn had ripened and the watchman was heedfulThe corneating ox would invade the corn to eat it but then the watchman would grab it firmly by the muzzleHaving grabbed it firmly by the muzzle he would pin it down by the foreheadHaving pinned it down by the forehead he would give it a sound thrashing with a stickHaving given it a sound thrashing with a stick he would let it goA second time A third time the corneating ox would invade the corn to eat it but then the watchman would grab it firmly by the muzzleHaving grabbed it firmly by the muzzle he would pin it down by the foreheadHaving pinned it down by the forehead he would give it a sound thrashing with a stickHaving given it a sound thrashing with a stick he would let it goAs a result the corneating ox  regardless of whether it went to the village or to the wilds was standing still or lying down  wouldnt invade the corn again because it would recall the earlier taste it got of the stickIn the same way when a monks mind is held back thoroughly held back from the six media of sensory contact his mind settles inwardly grows steady unified  concentratedSuppose there were a king or kings minister who had never heard the sound of a lute beforeHe might hear the sound of a lute and say What my good men is that sound  so delightful so tantalizing so intoxicating so ravishing so enthralling They would say That sire is called a lute whose sound is so delightful so tantalizing so intoxicating so ravishing so enthralling Then he would say Go  fetch me that lute They would fetch the lute and say Here sire is the lute whose sound is so delightful so tantalizing so intoxicating so ravishing so enthralling He would say Enough of your luteFetch me just the sound Then they would say This lute sire is made of numerous components a great many componentsIts through the activity of numerous components that it sounds that is in dependence on the body the skin the neck the frame the strings the bridge and the appropriate human effortThus it is that this lute  made of numerous components a great many components  sounds through the activity of numerous componentsThen the king would split the lute into ten pieces a hundred piecesHaving split the lute into ten pieces a hundred pieces he would shave it to splintersHaving shaved it to splinters he would burn it in a fireHaving burned it in a fire he would reduce it to ashesHaving reduced it to ashes he would winnow it before a high wind or let it be washed away by a swiftflowing streamHe would then say A sorry thing this lute  whatever a lute may be  by which people have been so thoroughly tricked  deceivedIn the same way a monk investigates form however far form may goHe investigates feeling perception fabrications consciousness however far consciousness may goAs he is investigating form feeling perception fabrications consciousness however far consciousness may go any thoughts of me or mine or I am do not occur to himA certain monk visited another monk and said Tell me friend how does a monks vision become fully purifiedFriend when a monk fully comprehends as they really are the arising and passing away of the six spheres of contact to that extent his vision becomes fully purifiedBut that monk was dissatisfied with the others answer so he went to another monkFriend when a monk fully comprehends as they really are the arising and passing away of the five groups of clinging to that extent his vision becomes fully purifiedBut that monk was dissatisfied with the others answer and he went to another monkFriend when a monk fully comprehends as they really are the arising and passing away of the four great elements to that extent his vision becomes fully purifiedBut that monk was dissatisfied with the others answer so he went to another monkFriend when a monk fully comprehends as it really is that whatever is of a nature to arise is bound to pass away to that extent his vision becomes fully purifiedBut that monk was dissatisfied with the others answer and he went to the Blessed OneSuppose monk a man had never seen a whats it treeSo he went to someone who had seen one and said Tell me good sir what does a whats it tree look like The other man replied Well now a whats it tree is sort of blackish like a burnt stump But that man was not long satisfied with this answer so he went to another man Well now a whats it tree is sort of reddish like a lump of meat But that man was not long satisfied with this answer so he went to another man Well now a whats it tree is stripped of its bark with burst pods rather like an acacia But that man was not long satisfied with this answer so he went to another man Well now a whats it tree has very thick leavesIt gives close shade like a banyan So for a while he sees the whats it tree as that man sees itIn the same way monk according to the way the vision of these wise monks has become purified so they explain it each according to his dispositionIt is monk just like some kings bordercity with strong walls and arches and with six gatesAnd there is a wise skilled and experienced gatekeeper who keeps out the unknown and admits the knownFrom the east there come a swift pair of messengers and they say to the gatekeeper Where is the lord of this city  He is over there sirs at the crossroads in the center Then the two messengers take a truthful report to the lord of the city and return the way they cameI have given you a parable monk and so that you can understand it this is the explanation The city is a name for the body composed of the four great elements born of mother and father an accumulation of rice and gruel impermanent subject to abrasion dissolution and disintegrationThe six gates denote the six internal sensespheresThe gatekeeper denotes mindfulnessThe two swift messengers denote calm and insightThe lord of the city denotes consciousnessThe crossroads at the center denotes the four great elements the earthelement the waterelement the fireelement the airelementThe truthful report denotes NibbaanaThe way they came monk denotes the Noble Eightfold Path that is to say Right View Right Thought Right Speech Right Action Right Livelihood Right Effort Right Mindfulness Right ConcentrationA certain monk went to another monk and on arrival said to him To what extent my friend is a monks vision said to be wellpurifiedWhen a monk discerns as it actually is the origination  passing away of the six media of sensory contact my friend it is to that extent that his vision is said to be wellpurifiedThe first monk dissatisfied with the other monks answer to his question went to still another monk and on arrival said to him To what extent my friend is a monks vision said to be wellpurifiedWhen a monk discerns as it actually is the origination  passing away of the five clingingaggregates my friend it is to that extent that his vision is said to be wellpurifiedThe first monk dissatisfied with this monks answer to his question

great elements my friend it is to that extent that his vision is said to be wellpurifiedThe first monk dissatisfied with this monks answer to his question went to still another monk and on arrival said to him To what extent my friend is a monks vision said to be wellpurifiedWhen a monk discerns as it actually is that whatever is subject to origination is all subject to cessation my friend it is to that extent that his vision is said to be wellpurifiedThe first monk dissatisfied with this monks answer to his question then went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one sideAs he was sitting there he Monk its as if there were a man who had never seen a riddle treeHe would go to another man who had seen one and on arrival would say to him What my good man is a riddle tree likeThe other would say A riddle tree is black my good man like a burnt stump For at the time he saw it thats what the riddle tree was likeThen the first man dissatisfied with the other mans answer went to still another man who had seen a riddle tree and on arrival said to him What my good man is a riddle tree likeThe other would say A riddle tree is red my good man like a lump of meat For at the time he saw it thats what the riddle tree was likeThen the first man dissatisfied with this mans answer went to still another man who had seen a riddle tree and on arrival said to him

was likeThen the first man dissatisfied with this mans answer went to still another man who had seen a riddle tree and on arrival said to him What my good man is a riddle tree likeThe other would say A riddle tree has thick foliage my good man and gives a dense shade like a banyan For at the time he saw it thats what the riddle tree was likeIn the same way monk however those intelligent men of integrity were focused when their vision became well purified is the way in which they answeredSuppose monk that there were a royal frontier fortress with strong walls  ramparts and six gatesIn it would be a wise experienced intelligent gatekeeper to keep out those he didnt know and to let in those he didA swift pair of messengers coming from the east would say to the gatekeeper Where my good man is the commander of this fortress He would say There he is sirs sitting in the central square The swift pair of messengers delivering their accurate report to the commander of the fortress would then go back by the route by which they had comeThen a swift pair of messengers coming from the west the north the south would say to the gatekeeper Where my good man is the commander of this fortress He would say There he is sirs sitting in the central square The swift pair of messengers delivering their accurate report to the commander of the fortress would then go back by the route by which they had comeI have given you this simile monk to convey a messageThe message is this The fortress stands for this body  composed of four elements born of mother  father nourished with rice  barley gruel subject to constant rubbing  abrasion to breaking  falling apartThe six gates stand for the six internal sense mediaThe gatekeeper stands for mindfulnessThe swift pair of messengers stands for tranquillity and insightThe commander of the fortress stands for consciousnessThe central square stands for the four great elements the earthproperty the liquidproperty the fireproperty  the windpropertyThe accurate report stands for UnbindingThe route by which they had come stands for the noble eightfold path right view right resolve right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness right concentrationI have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Savatthi in Jetas GroveThen he addressed the monks Monks suppose there were four vipers of utmost heat  horrible venomThen a man would come along  desiring life desiring not to die desiring happiness  loathing pain  and people would tell him Good man these four vipers of utmost heat  horrible venom are yoursTime after time they must be lifted up time after time they must be bathed time after time they must be fed time after time put to restAnd if any of these vipers ever gets angered with you then you will meet with death or deathlike sufferingDo what you think should be doneThen the man  afraid of the four vipers of utmost heat  horrible venom  would flee this way or thatThey would tell him Good man there are five enemy executioners chasing right on your heels Wherever we see him well kill him right on the spot Do what you think should be doneThen the man  afraid of the four vipers of utmost heat  horrible venom afraid of the five enemy executioners  would flee this way or thatThey would tell him Good man there is a sixth executioner a fellowtraveler chasing right on your heels with upraised sword Wherever I see him Ill kill him right on the spot Do what you think should be doneThen the man  afraid of the four vipers of utmost heat  horrible venom afraid of the five enemy executioners afraid of the sixth fellowtraveling executioner with upraised sword  would flee this way or thatHe would see an empty villageWhatever house he entered would be abandoned void  empty as he entered itWhatever pot he grabbed hold of would be abandoned void  empty as he grabbed hold of itThey would tell him Good man right now villageplundering bandits are entering this empty villageDo what you think should be doneThen the man  afraid of the four vipers of utmost heat  horrible venom afraid of the five enemy executioners afraid of the sixth fellowtraveling executioner with upraised sword afraid of the villageplundering bandits  would flee this way or thatHe would see a great expanse of water with the near shore dubious  risky the further shore secure  free from risk but with neither a ferryboat nor a bridge going from this shore to the otherThe thought would occur to him Here is this great expanse of water with the near shore dubious  risky the further shore secure  free from risk but with neither a ferryboat nor a bridge going from this shore to the otherWhat if I were to gather grass twigs branches  leaves and having bound them together to make a raft were to cross over to safety on the other shore in dependence on the raft making an effort with my hands  feet Then the man having gathered grass twigs branches  leaves having bound them together to make a raft would cross over to safety on the other shore in dependence on the raft making an effort with his hands  feetCrossed over having gone to the other shore he would stand on high ground a brahmanMonks I have made this simile to convey a meaningHere the meaning is this The four vipers of utmost heat  horrible venom stands for the four great existents the earth property the liquid property the fireproperty  the wind propertyThe five enemy executioners stands for the five clingingaggregates the form clingingaggregate the feeling clingingaggregate the perception

Kosambi in Ghositas ParkThen in the evening VenUdayin emerged from his seclusion and went to VenAnanda and exchanged courteous greetings with himAfter an exchange of friendly greetings  courtesies he sat to one sideAs he was sitting there he said to VenAnanda In many ways the body has been pointed out revealed and announced by the Blessed One For this reason the body is notselfCan consciousness in the same way be declared taught described set forth revealed explained  made plain For this reason consciousness is notselfIt can Doesnt eyeconsciousness arise in dependence on the eye  formsYes friendAnd if the cause  reason for the arising of eyeconsciousness were to cease totally everywhere totally in every way without remainder would eyeconsciousness be discernedNo friendIts in this way

tree trunk straight young without shootsHe would cut off the roof cut off the crown and unfurl the coil of the stemThere he wouldnt even find softwood much less heartwoodIn the same way a monk assumes neither a self nor anything pertaining to a self in the six spheres of sensory contactAssuming in this way he doesnt cling to anything in the worldNot clinging he is not agitatedUnagitated he is totally unbound right withinHe discerns that Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task doneThere is nothing further for this worldHow is it friend Is the eye the fetter of visual objects or are visual objects the fetter of the eye Is the tongue the fetter of tastes or are tastes the fetter of the tongue Is mind the fetter of thoughts or are thoughts the fetter of mindIt is not friend that the eye is the fetter of visual objects nor are visual objects the fetter of the eye but that based on these two desire and lust arise and they are the fetter it is not that the tongue is the fetter of tastes that mind is the fetter of thoughts but that based on these two desire and lust arise and they are the fetterIt is just as if there were a black and a white ox bound together by one rope or one yoketie would it be right to say that the black ox is the fetter of the white one or the white one of the blackNo indeed friendNeither the black nor the white ox is the fetter of the other but they are bound together by the same rope or the same yoketie that is the fetterSo too friend the eye is not the fetter of objects nor are objects the fetter of eye the tongue the mind but based on these two desire and lust arise and they are the fetterIf friend the eye were the fetter of visual objects or visual objects were the fetter of the eye if the tongue if the mind were the fetter of thoughts or thoughts were the fetter of mind then this holy life would not be discernible for the utter destruction of sufferingBut since it is not case therefore this holy life is discernible for the utter destruction of sufferingThus it should be understood that the eye is not the fetter the tongue the mind but that based on these two desire and lust arise and they are the fetterThe Blessed One friend has eyes he sees objects with the eyeBut in the Blessed One there is no desire or lustThe Blessed Ones heart is completely liberatedThe Blessed One has a tongue a mind he knows thoughts with the mindBut in the Blessed One there is no desire or lustThe Blessed Ones heart is completely liberatedThus it should be understood that the eye is not the fetter the tongue the mind but that based on these two desire and lust arise and they are the fetterOnce VenSariputta and VenMaha Kotthita were living near Varanasi at Isipatana in the Deer ParkThen VenMaha Kotthita in the late afternoon left his seclusion and went to VenSariputtaOn arrival he exchanged courteous greetings with himAfter an exchange of friendly greetings  courtesies he sat to one sideAs he was sitting there he said to VenSariputta Now tell me friend Sariputta is the eye the fetter of forms or are forms the fetter of the eyeIs the ear Is the nose Is the tongue Is the body Is the intellect the fetter of ideas or are ideas the fetter of the intellectNo my friendThe eye is not the fetter of forms nor are forms the fetter of the eyeWhatever desire  passion arises in dependence on the two of them That is the fetter thereThe ear is not the fetter of sounds The nose is not the fetter of aromas The tongue is not the fetter of flavors The body is not the fetter of tactile sensations The intellect is not the fetter of ideas nor are ideas the fetter of the intellectWhatever desire  passion arises in dependence on the two of them That is the fetter thereSuppose that a black ox and a white ox were joined with a single collar or yokeIf someone were to say The black ox is the fetter of the white ox the white ox is the fetter of the black  speaking this way would he be speaking rightlyNo my friendThe black ox is not the fetter of the white ox nor is the white ox the fetter of the blackThe single collar or yoke by which they are joined That is the fetter thereIn the same way the eye is not the fetter of forms nor are forms the fetter of the eyeWhatever desire  passion arises in dependence on the two of them That is the fetter thereThe ear is not the fetter of sounds The nose is not the fetter of aromas The tongue is not the fetter of flavors The body is not the fetter of tactile sensations The intellect is not the fetter of ideas nor are ideas the fetter of the intellectWhatever desire  passion arises in dependence on the two of them That is the fetter thereIf the eye were the fetter of forms or if forms were the fetter of the eye then this holy life for the right ending of stress  suffering would not be proclaimedBut because whatever desire  passion arises in dependence on the two of them is the fetter there that is why this holy life for the right ending of stress  suffering is proclaimedIf the ear were the fetterIf the nose were the fetterIf the tongue were the fetterIf the body were the fetterIf the intellect were the fetter of ideas or if ideas were the fetter of the intellect then this holy life for the right ending of stress  suffering would not be proclaimedBut because whatever desire  passion arises in dependence on the two of them is the fetter there that is why this holy life for the right ending of stress  suffering is proclaimedAnd through this line of reasoning one may know how the eye is not the fetter of forms nor are forms the fetter of the eye but whatever desire  passion arises in dependence on the two of them That is the fetter thereThe ear is not the fetter of sounds The nose is not the fetter of aromas The tongue is not the fetter of flavors The body is not the fetter of tactile sensations The intellect is not the fetter of ideas nor are ideas the fetter of the intellect but whatever desire  passion arises in dependence on the two of them That is the fetter thereThere is an eye in the Blessed OneThe Blessed One sees forms with the eyeThere is no desire or passion in the Blessed OneThe Blessed One is wellreleased in mindThere is an ear in the Blessed OneThere is a nose in the Blessed OneThere is a tongue in the Blessed OneThere is a body in the Blessed OneThere is an intellect in the Blessed OneThe Blessed One knows ideas with the intellectThere is no desire or passion in the Blessed OneThe Blessed One is wellreleased in mindIt is through this line of reasoning that one may know how the eye is not the fetter of forms nor are forms the fetter of the eye but whatever desire  passion arises in dependence on the two of them That is the fetter thereThe ear is not the fetter of sounds The nose is not the fetter of aromas The tongue is not the fetter of flavors The body is not the fetter of tactile sensations The intellect is not the fetter of ideas nor are ideas the fetter of the intellect but whatever desire  passion arises in dependence on the two of them That is the fetter thereIs there monks any criterion whereby a monk apart from faith apart from persuasion apart from inclination apart from rational speculation apart from delight in views and theories could affirm the attainment of enlightenment Birth is destroyed the holy life has been accomplished what was to be done is done there is no further living in this worldFor us Lord all things have the Blessed One as their root their guide their refugeIt would be well Lord if the meaning of these words were to be made clear by the Blessed OneHearing it from the Blessed One the monks will remember itThere is such a criterion monks whereby a monk could affirm the attainment of enlightenment What is that methodIn this monks a monk seeing an object with the eye recognizes within himself the presence of lust hatred or delusion knowing Lust hatred or delusion is present in me or he recognizes the absence of these things knowing There is no lust hatred or delusion present in me Now monks as regards that recognition of the presence or absence of these things within him are these matters to be perceived by faith by persuasion by inclination by rational speculation by delight in views and theoriesNo indeed LordAre not these matters to be perceived by the eye of wisdomIndeed LordThen monks this is the criterion whereby a monk apart from faith apart from persuasion apart from inclination apart from rational speculation apart from delight in views and theories could affirm the attainment of enlightenment Birth is destroyed the holy life has been accomplished what was to be done is done there is no further living in this worldTranslators note This sutta is based on a play on wordsIn everyday Pali the term consummate in faculties is used to describe a person whose beauty and health are inspiringHere the Buddha gives a different meaning to the termThen a certain monk went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one sideAs he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One Consummate in faculties consummate in faculties it is saidTo what extent is one consummate in facultiesIf a monk while keeping track of arising  passing away with regard to the eyefaculty becomes disenchanted with the eyefaculty if while keeping track of arising  passing away with regard to the earfaculty the nosefaculty the tonguefaculty the body faculty the intellectfaculty he becomes disenchanted with the intellectfaculty and disenchanted he becomes dispassionate through dispassion he is fully released with full release there is the knowledge Fully released he discerns that Birth is depleted the holy life fulfilled the task doneThere is nothing further for this world it is to this extent that one is consummate in facultiesMonks I will teach you about new kamma and old kamma about the ceasing of kamma and the path that leads to the ceasing of kammaListen well pay close attention and I will

blackhaired with the bloom of youth in the prime of life never having enjoyed the pleasure of the senses can practice the holy life fully and perfectly to the end of their daysIt has been said sire by the Blessed One who knows and sees the Arahant the Fully Selfenlightened One Come monks whatever woman is a mother think of her just as a mother whatever woman is a sister think of her just as a sister whatever woman is a daughter think of her just as a daughterThat is how these young monks can practice the holy life to the end of their days But Bhaaradvaaja the heart is fickleIt may well be that at times thoughts of desire arise towards those they think of just as mothers just as sisters just as daughtersIs there any other cause any other reason whereby these young monks youthful and blackhaired can practice the holy life to the end of their daysIt has been said sire by the Blessed One Come monks contemplate this body upwards from the soles of the feet downwards from the top of the head bounded by the skin full of manifold impuritiesThere are in this body hair of the head hair of the body nails teeth skin flesh sinews bones marrow kidneys heart liver pleura spleen lungs intestines mesentery bowels feces bile phlegm pus blood sweat fat tears tallow saliva synovic fluid urineThat is how these young monks can practice the holy life to the end of their days Well Bhaaradvaaja for those monks who train the body morals mind and insight that is easy but for those who do not it is difficultSometimes when a man thinks I will regard this as repulsive he comes to think of it as attractiveIs there any other cause any other reason whereby those young monks can practice the holy life to the end of their daysIt has been said sire by the Exalted One Come monks guard the doors of your sensefacultiesSeeing an object with the eye do not seize hold of either its general appearance or its detailsBecause anyone dwelling with the eyefaculty uncontrolled could be overwhelmed by cupidity and dejection evil and unwholesome states of mind therefore practice to control the eyefaculty guard it and gain control over itThat is how these young monks can practice the holy life to the end of their days Wonderful good Bhaaradvaaja it is marvelous how well spoken are the words of the Blessed One I myself good Bhaaradvaaja whenever I enter the inner parts of my palace with body speech and mind unguarded with mindfulness unestablished with sensefaculties uncontrolled am at such times overcome with lustful thoughtsBut when I do so with body speech and mind guarded with mindfulness established with faculties controlled then lustful thoughts do not overcome meFriend Saariputta my companion has renounced the training and reverted to the lower lifeThis is what happens friend with one whose sensedoors are unguarded who is immoderate in eating and not given to wakefulnessAs long as he lives it will be impossible for him to maintain the holy life in all its fullness and purityBut if a monk guards his sensedoors is moderate in eating and given to watchfulness then it will be possible for him as long as he lives to maintain the holy life in all its fullness and purityAnd how friend does one guard the sensedoorsIn this a monk seeing an object with the eye does not seize hold of either its general appearance or its detailsBecause anyone dwelling with the eyefaculty uncontrolled could be overwhelmed by cupidity and dejection evil and unwholesome states of mind therefore he practices to control the eyefaculty guards it and gains control over itSo one guards the sensedoorsAnd how friend is one moderate in eatingIn this a monk takes his food properly considering not for sport for intoxication for adornment or beautification but purely for the maintenance and nourishment of this body for keeping it unharmed as an aid to the practice of the holy life thinking I shall put an end to the old feeling and not produce any new feelingThus I shall keep going incur no fault and live at ease That friend is how one is moderate in eatingAnd how friend is one given to watchfulnessIn this a monk walks up and down by day and then sits thus cleansing his mind from obstructive statesof the night In the middle watch of the night lying on his right side he adopts the lion posture resting one foot on the other mindful and clearly aware with his thoughts fixed on risingIn the last watch of the night he rises walks up and down and then sits thus cleansing his mind from obstructive statesThat friend is how one is given to watchfulnessTherefore this is how you should train yourselves We will guard the doors of our senses be moderate in eating and given to watchfulnessThis friend is the way for you to train

sideSetting his dwelling in order and taking his robe and bowl he set out for the Sunaparanta country and after wandering stage by stage he arrived thereThere he livedDuring that Rains retreat he established male and female lay followers in the practice while he realized the three knowledges and then attained total UnbindingThen a large number of monks went to the Blessed One and on arrival

totally unboundThis may not be life affirming in the American sense of the word but it does affirm that the arahants have awakened to a release that transcends life and deathAnd that is the whole point of Dhamma practiceIf there were nothing more important than life then life itself would be pointlessThen a certain monk went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one

sitting there he said to the Blessed One Lord in such and such a dwelling a certain monk  newly ordained not well known  is diseased in pain severely illIt would be good if the Blessed One would visit the monk out of sympathy for himThen the Blessed One on hearing the word newly ordained on hearing the word diseased and realizing that the monk was not well known went to himThe monk saw the Blessed One coming from afar and on seeing him stirred in his bedThen the Blessed One said to him Enough monkDont stir in your bedThere are these seats made readyI will sit down thereThe Blessed One sat down

discerns that Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task doneThere is nothing further for this world That is what the Blessed One saidGratified the monk delighted in the Blessed Ones wordsAnd while this explanation was being given the mind of that monk through no clinging was fully released from fermentationsThis lesswellknown metta verse has its origins in an ancient probably preBuddhist snake charmIt is taught by the Buddha in the Vinaya in response to his hearing of a monk who perished after being bitten by a snakeThe first stanza not translated here extends loving kindness to the four main groups of snake deitiesThe Buddha tells the monks that if they adequately develop loving kindness to these snake deities they will be free of harm from snake bitesMore interesting is the characteristic way in which the Buddha adapts an existing tradition  charms against snake bites  to serve as a vehicle for his own more universal teachingHe expands the cultivation of loving kindness far beyond snakes and reptiles to include insects animals and all human beingsAt the same time he emphasizes the interdependent thinking that ones best protection against being harmed is to do no harm oneself to othersThe word metta has a more unique scope than even that most protean of English words  love  can easily expressExcept for the fact that it throws off the eightsyllable meter of the verse one can easily substitute words such as friendship friendliness deep unselfish caring or loving kindnessNow at that time a certain monk was sick with dysenteryHe lay fouled in his own urine  excrementThen the Blessed One on an inspection tour of the lodgings with VenAnanda as his attendant went to that monks dwelling and on arrival saw the monk lying fouled in his own urine  excrementOn seeing him he went to the monk and said What is your sickness monkI have dysentery O Blessed OneBut do you have an attendantNo O Blessed OneThen why dont the monks attend to youI dont do anything for the monks lord which is why they dont attend to meThen the Blessed One addressed VenAnanda Go fetch some water AnandaWe will wash this monkAs you say lord VenAnanda replied and he fetched some waterThe Blessed One sprinkled water on the monk and VenAnanda washed him offThen  with the Blessed One taking the monk by the head and VenAnanda taking him by the feet  they lifted him up and placed him on a bedThen the Blessed One from this cause because of this event had the monks assembled and asked them Is there a sick monk in that dwelling over thereYes O Blessed One there isAnd what is his sicknessHe has dysentery O Blessed OneBut does he have an attendantNo O Blessed OneThen why dont the monks attend to himHe doesnt do anything for the monks lord which is why they dont attend to

AllSimply the eye  forms ear  sounds nose  aromas tongue  flavors body  tactile sensations intellect  ideasThis monks is called the AllAnyone who would say Repudiating this All I will describe another if questioned on what exactly might be the grounds for his statement would be unable to explain and furthermore would be put to griefWhyBecause it lies beyond rangeSecondly the Commentary includes nibbana within the scope of the All described here  as a dhamma or object of the intellect  even though there are many other discourses in the Canon specifically stating that nibbana lies beyond the range of the six senses and their objectsSn for instance indicates that a person who has attained nibbana has gone beyond all phenomena and therefore cannot be describedMN discusses a consciousness without feature that does not partake of the Allness of the All Furthermore the following discourse says that the All is to be abandonedAt no point does the Canon say that nibbana is to be abandonedNibbana follows on cessation which is to be realizedOnce nibbana is realized there are no further tasks to be doneThus it seems more this discourses discussion of All is meant to limit the use of the word all throughout the Buddhas teachings to the six sense spheres and their objectsAs the following discourse shows this would also include the consciousness contact and feelings connected with the sense spheres and their objectsNibbana would lie outside of the word all This would fit in with another point made several times in the Canon that dispassion is the highest of all dhammas while the arahant has gone beyond even dispassionThis raises the question if the word all does not include nibbana does that mean that one may infer from the statement all phenomena are notself that nibbana is selfThe answer is noAs ANstates to even ask if there is anything remaining or not remaining after the cessation of the six sense spheres is to differentiate what is by nature undifferentiatedThe range of differentiation goes only as far as the All Perceptions of self or notself which would count as differentiation would not apply beyond the All When the cessation of the All is experienced all differentiation is allayedAt SavatthiMonks any desirepassion with regard to the eye is a defilement of the mindAny desirepassion with regard to the ear the nose the tongue the

animal womb or in the realm of hungry shadesHe is incapable of passing away until he has realized the fruit of streamentryOne who knows and sees that these phenomena are this way is called a streamenterer steadfast never again destined for states of woe headed for selfawakeningSee also Other suttas from the Okkanta Samyutta the Study Guides on streamentryTranslators note A number of discourses make the point that the mind is fettered not by things like the five aggregates or the objects of the six senses but by the act of passion  delight for themThere are two ways to try to cut through this fetterOne is to focus on the drawbacks of passion  delight in  of themselves seeing clearly the stress  suffering they engender in the mindThe other is to analyze the objects of passion  delight in such a way that they no longer seem worthy of interestThis second approach is the one recommended in this discourse when the Buddha talks of smashing scattering  demolishing form and making it unfit for play he is referring to the practice of analyzing form minutely into its component parts until it no longer seems a fit object for passion  delightWhen all five aggregates can be treated in this way the mind is left with no conditioned object to serve as a focal point for its passion and so is released  at the very least  to the stage of Awakening called nonreturnI have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Savatthi at Jetas Grove Anathapindikas monasteryThen VenRadha went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one sideAs he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One A being lordA being its saidTo what extent is one said to be a beingAny desire passion delight or craving for form Radha when one is caught up there tied up there one is said to be a beingAny desire passion delight or craving for feeling perception fabricationsAny desire passion delight or craving for consciousness Radha when one is caught up there tied up there one is said to be a beingJust as when boys or girls are playing with little sand castles as long as they are not free from passion desire love thirst fever  craving for those little sand castles thats how long they have fun with those sand castles enjoy them treasure them feel possessive of themBut when they become free from passion desire love thirst fever  craving for those little sand castles then they smash them scatter them demolish them with their hands or feet and make them unfit for playIn the same way Radha you too should smash scatter  demolish form and make it unfit for playPractice for the ending of craving for formYou should smash scatter  demolish feeling and make it unfit for playPractice for the ending of craving for feelingYou should smash scatter  demolish perception and make it unfit for playPractice for the ending of craving for perceptionYou should smash scatter  demolish fabrications and make them unfit for playPractice for the ending of craving for

an inconstruable beginning comes transmigrationA beginning point is not evident although beings hindered by ignorance and fettered by craving are transmigrating  wandering onIts just as when a dog is tied by a leash to a post or stake If it walks it walks right around that post or stakeIf it stands it stands right next to that post or stakeIf it sits it sits right next to that post or stakeIf it lies down it lies down right next to that post or stakeIn the same way an uninstructed runofthemill person regards form as This is mine this is my self this is what I am He regards feeling perception fabrications consciousness as This is mine this is my self this is what I am If he walks he walks right around these five clingingaggregatesIf he stands he stands right next to these five

dispassionateThrough dispassion he is fully releasedWith full release there is the knowledge Fully released He discerns that Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task doneThere is nothing further for this worldIn these five groups of clinging I perceive no self nor any thing pertaining to a self As for this I am you mention friend Khemaka what is itDo you say this I am is the body or not the body feelings perceptions mental formations consciousness or not consciousnessNo friends I do not say this I am is the body consciousness nor that it is other than the body consciousnessYet with regard to the five groups of clinging I am comes to me but I do not consider it as This I am It is just like the scent of a blue red or white lotusIf someone were to say The scent belongs to the petals or the color or the fibers would he be describing it correctlySurely not friendThen how would he describe it correctlyAs the scent of the flower would be the correct explanationIn the same way friends I do not say this I am is the body consciousness nor that it is other than the body consciousnessYet with regard to the five groups of clinging I am comes to me but I do not consider it as This I am Though friends an Ariyan disciple has abandoned the five lower fetters there still remains in him a subtle remnant from among the five groups of clinging a subtle remnant of the Iconceit of the Idesire an unextirpated lurking tendency to think I am Later on he dwells contemplating the rise and fall of the five groups of clinging and he sees This is the body this is its arising this is its passing awayThese are feelings perceptions mental formations this is consciousness this is its arising this is its passing awaySo as he dwells thus in contemplation of the rise and fall of the five groups of clinging this subtle remnant from among the five groups of clinging this subtle remnant of the Iconceit of the Idesire this unextirpated lurking tendency to think I am is brought to an endFriends it is like a cloth soiled and stained whose owners give it to the washermanHe rubs it smooth with saltearth lye or cowdung then rinses it in clean waterNow though the cloth has been cleaned and thoroughly purified there still hangs about it unremoved the subtle smell of saltearth lye or cowdungThe washerman returns it to the owners who put it away carefully in a sweetsmelling boxThen the smell of saltearth lye or cowdung that still clung to it disappears completelyIn just the same way friends though an Ariyan disciple has abandoned the five lower fetters this unextirpated lurking tendency to think I am is brought to an endNow when this teaching was thus expounded the hearts of some sixty elders were completely freed from the cankers as too was that of Venerable KhemakaI am staying Lord in a forest hut not far awayNow a number of wanderers of another sect came to me and said Friend Anuraadha a Tathaagata a superman a man supreme one who has gained the Highest must be describable in four ways a Tathaagata comes to be after death he does not come to be after death he both comes to be and does not come to be after death he neither comes to be nor does not come to be after death To this Lord I replied A Tathaagata can be described otherwise than in these four ways At my reply the wanderers of another sect said This monk must be a novice not long ordained or if he is an elder he is an ignorant fool Then the wanderers abusing me as a novice and a fool got up and went awaySoon after they had left Lord I thought If these wanderers were to ply me with further questions how should I answer them so as to express correctly the Blessed Ones standpoint without misrepresentation in accordance with the true doctrine so that no follower of his teacher would incur reproach Now what do you think Anuraadha is the body permanent or impermanentImpermanent LordWell then Anuraadha do you equate the Tathaagata with his body feelings perceptions mental formations consciousnessNo indeed LordDo you consider he has no body feelings perceptions mental formations consciousnessNo indeed LordThen Anuraadha since in this very life the Tathaagata is not to be regarded as really and truly existing is it proper for you to declare of him Friends he who is a Tathaagata can be described otherwise than in these four waysNo indeed LordGood good AnuraadhaAs before so now I proclaim just suffering and the ceasing of sufferingI have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Vesali in the Great Wood at the Hall of the Gabled PavilionAt that time VenAnuradha was staying not far from the Blessed One in a wilderness hutThen a large number of wandering sectarians went to VenAnuradha and on arrival exchanged courteous greetings with himAfter an exchange of friendly greetings  courtesies they sat to one sideAs they were sitting there they said to VenAnuradha Friend Anuradha the Tathagata  the supreme man the superlative man attainer of the superlative attainment  being described is described with these four positions The Tathagata exists after death does not exist after death both does  does not exist after death neither exists nor does not exist after deathWhen this was said VenAnuradha said to the wandering sectarians Friends the Tathagata  the supreme man the superlative man attainer of the superlative attainment  being described is described otherwise than with these four positions The Tathagata exists after death does not exist after death both does  does not exist after death neither exists nor does not exist after deathWhen this was said the wandering sectarians said to VenAnuradha This monk is either a newcomer not long gone forth or else an elder who is foolish  inexperienced So the wandering sectarians addressing VenAnuradha as they would a newcomer or a fool got up from their seats and leftThen not long after the wandering sectarians had left this thought occurred to VenAnuradha If I am questioned again by those wandering sectarians how will I answer in such a way that will I speak in line with what the Blessed One has said will not misrepresent the Blessed One with what is unfactual will answer in line with the Dhamma so that no one whose thinking is in line with the Dhamma will have grounds for criticizing meThen VenAnuradha went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to the Blessed One sat to one sideAs he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One Just now I was staying not far from the Blessed One in a wilderness hutThen a large number of wandering sectarians came and said to me Friend Anuradha the Tathagata  the supreme man the superlative man attainer of the superlative attainment  being described is described with these four positions The Tathagata exists after death does not exist after death both does  does not exist after death neither exists nor does not exist after deathWhen this was said I said to them Friends the Tathagata  the supreme man the superlative man attainer of the superlative attainment  being described is described otherwise than with these four positions The Tathagata exists after death does not exist after death both does  does not exist after death neither exists nor does not exist after deathWhen this was said the wandering sectarians said to me This monk is either a newcomer not long gone forth or else an elder

If I am questioned again by those wandering sectarians how will I answer in such a way that will I speak in line with what the Blessed One has said will not misrepresent the Blessed One with what is unfactual will answer in line with the Dhamma and no one whose thinking is in line with the Dhamma will have grounds for criticizing me What do you think Anuradha Is form constant or inconstantInconstant lordAnd is that which is inconstant easeful or stressfulStressful lordAnd is it proper to regard what is inconstant stressful subject to change as This is mineThis is my selfThis is what I amNo lordIs feeling constant or inconstantInconstant lordIs perception constant or inconstantInconstant lordAre fabrications constant or inconstantInconstant lordIs consciousness constant or

fabrications as the TathagataNo lordDo you regard consciousness as the TathagataNo lordWhat do you think Anuradha Do you regard the Tathagata as being in form Elsewhere than form In feeling Elsewhere

so Anuradha  when you cant pin down the Tathagata as a truth or reality even in the present life  is it proper for you to declare Friends the Tathagata  the supreme man the superlative man attainer of the superlative attainment  being described is described otherwise than with these four positions The Tathagata exists after death does not exist after death both does  does not exist after death neither exists nor does not exist after deathNo lordVery good AnuradhaVery goodBoth formerly  now it is only stress that I describe and the cessation of stressSee also The suttas in the Avyakata

teaching lineage of warriors that When a warrior strives  exerts himself in battle if others then strike him down  slay him while he is striving  exerting himself in battle then with the breakup of the body after death he is reborn in the company of devas slain in battle What does the Blessed One have to say about thatEnough headman put that asideDont ask me thatA second time A third time

down  slay him while he is striving  exerting himself in battle then with the breakup of the body after death he is reborn in the company of devas slain in battle What does the Blessed One have to say about thatApparently headman I havent been able to get past you by saying Enough headman put that asideDont ask me that So I will simply answer youWhen a warrior strives  exerts himself in battle his mind is already seized debased  misdirected by the thought May these beings be struck down or slaughtered or annihilated or destroyedMay they not exist If others then strike him down  slay him while he is thus striving  exerting himself in battle then with the breakup of the body after death he is reborn in the hell called the realm of those slain in battleBut if he holds such a view as this When a warrior strives  exerts himself in battle if others then strike him down  slay him while he is striving  exerting himself in battle then with the breakup of the body after death he is reborn in the company of devas slain in battle that is his wrong viewNow there are two destinations for a person with wrong view I tell you either hell or the animal wombWhen this was said Yodhajiva the headman sobbed  burst into tearsThat is what I couldnt get past you by saying Enough headman put that asideDont ask me that Im not crying lord because of what the Blessed One said to me but simply because I have been deceived cheated  fooled for a long time by that ancient teaching lineage of warriors who said When a warrior strives  exerts himself in battle if others then strike him down  slay him while

you any doubts VakkaliHave you any cause for regretIndeed Lord I have many doubtsI have much cause for regretHave you nothing to reproach yourself about as regards moralsNo Lord I have nothing to reproach myself about as regards moralsWell then Vakkali if you have nothing to reproach yourself about as regards morals you must have some worry or scruple that is troubling youFor a long time Lord I have wanted to come and set eyes on the Blessed One but I had not the strength in this body to come and see the Blessed OneEnough VakkaliWhat is there to see in this vile bodyHe who sees Dhamma Vakkali sees me he who sees me sees DhammaTruly seeing Dhamma one sees me seeing me one sees DhammaThen Vacchagotta the wanderer went to the Blessed One and on arrival exchanged courteous greetings with himAfter an exchange of friendly greetings  courtesies he sat to one sideAs he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One Master Gotama a few days ago a large number of contemplatives brahmans and wanderers of various sects were sitting together in the Debating Hall when this conversation arose among them This Purana Kassapa  the leader of a community the leader of a group the teacher of a group honored and famous esteemed as holy by the mass of people  describes a disciple who has died and passed on in terms of places of rebirth That one is reborn there that one is reborn there Even when the disciple is an ultimate person a foremost person attained to the foremost attainment Purana Kassapa describes him when he has died and passed on in terms of places of rebirth That one is reborn there that one is reborn thereThis Makkhali Gosala This Nigantha Nataputta This Sañjaya Velatthaputta This Pakudha Kaccana This Ajita Kesakambala  the leader of a community the leader of a group the teacher of a group honored and famous esteemed as holy by the mass of people  describes a disciple who has died and passed on in terms of places of rebirth That one is reborn there that one is reborn there Even when the disciple is an ultimate person a foremost person attained to the foremost attainment Ajita Kesakambala describes him when he has died and passed on in terms of places of rebirth That one is reborn there that one is reborn thereThis contemplative Gotama  the leader of a community the leader of a group the teacher of a group honored and famous esteemed as holy by the mass of people  describes a disciple who has died and passed on in terms of places of rebirth That one is reborn there that one is reborn there But when the disciple is an ultimate person a foremost person attained to the foremost attainment Gotama the contemplative does not describe him when he has died and passed on in terms of places of rebirth That one is reborn there that one is reborn there Instead he describes him thus He has cut through craving severed the fetter and by rightly breaking through conceit has made an end of suffering  stressSo I was simply befuddledI was uncertain How is the teaching of Gotama the contemplative to be understoodOf course you are befuddled VacchaOf course you are uncertainWhen there is a reason for befuddlement in you uncertainty arisesI designate the rebirth of one who has sustenance Vaccha and not of one without sustenanceJust as a fire burns with sustenance and not without sustenance even so I designate the rebirth of one who has sustenance and not of one without sustenanceBut Master Gotama at the moment a flame is being swept on by the wind and goes a far distance what do you designate as its sustenance thenVaccha when a flame is being swept on by the wind and goes a far distance I designate it as windsustained for the wind is its sustenance at that timeAnd at the moment when a being sets this body aside and is not yet reborn in another body what do you designate as its sustenance thenVaccha when a being sets this body aside and is not yet reborn in another body I designate it as cravingsustained for craving is its sustenance at that timeSee also other suttas in the Avyakata Samyutta ANThen Vacchagotta the wanderer went to the Blessed One and on arrival exchanged courteous greetings with himAfter an exchange of friendly greetings  courtesies he sat to one sideAs he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One Now then Master Gotama is the cosmos eternalThat has not been declared by me Vaccha The cosmos is eternal Well then Master Gotama is the cosmos not eternalVaccha that too has not been declared by me The cosmos is not eternal Then is the cosmos finite Is the cosmos infinite Is the body the same as the soul Is the body one thing and the soul another Does the Tathagata exist after death Does the Tathagata not exist after death Does the Tathagata both exist and not exist after death Does the Tathagata neither exist nor not exist after deathVaccha that too has not been declared by me The Tathagata neither exists nor does not exist after deathNow Master Gotama what is the cause what is the reason why  when wanderers of other sects are asked in this way they answer that The cosmos is eternal or The cosmos is not eternal or The cosmos is finite or The cosmos is infinite or The body is the same as the soul or The body is one thing and the soul another or The Tathagata exists after death or The Tathagata does not exist after death or The Tathagata both exists and does not exist after death or The Tathagata neither exists nor does not exist after death yet when Master Gotama is asked in this way he does not answer that The cosmos is eternal or The cosmos is not eternal or The cosmos is finite or The cosmos is infinite or The body is the same as the soul or The body is one thing and the soul another or The Tathagata exists after death or The Tathagata does not exist after death or The Tathagata both exists and does not exist after death or The Tathagata neither exists nor does not exist after deathVaccha the members of other sects assume form to be the self or the self as possessing form or form as in the self or the self as in formThey assume feeling to be the selfThey assume perception to be the selfThey assume fabrications to be the selfThey assume consciousness to be the self or the self as possessing consciousness or consciousness as in the self or the self as in consciousnessThat is why when asked in this way they answer that The cosmos is eternal or that The Tathagata neither exists nor does not exist after deathBut the Tathagata worthy and rightly selfawakened does not assume form to be the self or the self as possessing form or form as in the self or the self as in formHe does not assume feeling to be the selfHe does not assume perception to be the selfHe does not assume fabrications to be the selfHe does not assume consciousness to be the self or the self as possessing consciousness or consciousness as in the self or the self as in consciousnessThat is why when asked in this way he does not answer that The cosmos is eternal or that The Tathagata neither exists nor does not exist after death Then Vacchagotta the wanderer getting up from his seat went to VenMaha Moggallana and on arrival exchanged courteous greetings with himAfter an exchange of friendly greetings  courtesies he sat to one sideAs he was sitting there heAmazing Master MoggallanaAstoundingHow the meaning and phrasing of the teacher and disciple agree coincide and do not diverge from one another with regard to the supreme teachingJust now Master Moggallana I went to Gotama the contemplative and on arrival asked him about this matter and he answered me with the same words the same phrasing as Master MoggallanaAmazing Master MoggallanaAstoundingHow the meaning and phrasing of the teacher and disciple agree coincide and do not diverge from one another with regard to the supreme teachingSee also other suttas in the Avyakata Samyutta ANThis monks is the meanest of callings  that of one who goes beggingIt is a term of abuse in the world to say You scrapgatherer wandering about bowl in hand This is the life undertaken by young men of good family seeking their own good because it is good not compelled by rulers not compelled by robbers not on account of debts not through fear not for a livelihood but with the thought Here I am plunged into birth decayanddeath sorrow lamentation pain grief and despair thrown into suffering overcome with sufferingSurely there must be a way of bringing this entire mass of suffering to an endSo monks a young man of good family leaves the world but he is greedy for sense pleasures with fierce passions with hate in his heart corruptly motivated lacking in mindfulness inattentive unconcentrated scatterbrained his faculties uncontrolledJust as monks a funeraltorch lit at both ends and smeared in the middle with dung is no good as fuel either in the village or in the forest  that is how I would describe that man who has lost his home and wealth without satisfying the demands of the recluse lifeThere are monks three unskilled ways of thought thoughts of lust thoughts of illwill thoughts of hurtingAnd these three unskilled states disappear utterly in him whose heart is well established in the four foundations of mindfulness or who practices concentration on the signlessIndeed monks this concentration on the signless is greatly to be commended the concentration on the signless if developed and frequently practiced is of great fruit of great profitThere are monks these two views the existence view and the nonexistence viewAnd the welltaught Ariyan disciple deliberates Is there anything in the world that I can cling to without being at fault And he realizes There is nothing in the world that I can cling to without being at faultSuppose I were to grasp and cling to the body to feelings perceptions the mental formations consciousnessConditioned by my clinging becoming would arise conditioned by becoming birth conditioned by birth decayanddeath sorrow lamentation pain grief and despairIn that way the whole mass of suffering would ariseOn one occasion the Blessed One was staying among the Sakyans at Kapilavatthu in the Banyan ParkThen after having dismissed the community of monks over a particular incident he early in the morning put on his robes and carrying his bowl and outer robe went into Kapilavatthu for almsAfter having gone for alms in Kapilavatthu after his meal returning from his almsround he went to the Great Forest for the days abidingPlunging into the Great Forest he sat down at the root of a beluva sapling as his days abidingThen as he was alone in seclusion this line of thought arose in his awareness I have turned away the community of monksBut here there are monks who are new  not long gone forth only recently come to this Dhamma  disciplineIf they do not see me there may be alteration in them there may be changeJust as when a young calf does not see its mother there may be alteration in it there may be change in the same way there are monks who are new  not long gone forth only recently come to this Dhamma  disciplineIf they do not see me there may be alteration in them there may be changeJust as when young seedlings dont get water there may be alteration in them there may be change in the same way there are monks who are new  not long gone forth only recently come to this Dhamma  disciplineIf they do not see me there may be alteration in them there may be changeWhat if I were to aid the community of monks as I did beforeThen Brahma Sahampati  having known with his own awareness the line of thinking in the Blessed Ones awareness  just as a strong man might extend his flexed arm or flex his extended arm disappeared from the Brahmaworld and reappeared in front of the Blessed OneArranging his upper robe over one shoulder he knelt down with his right knee on the ground saluted the Blessed One with his hands before his heart and said to him So it is O Blessed OneSo it is O One WellgoneThe Blessed One has turned away the community of monksBut here there are monks who are new  not long gone forth only recently come to this Dhamma  disciplineIf they do not see the Blessed One there may be alteration in them there may be changeJust as when a young calf does not see its mother Just as when young seedlings dont get water in the same way there are monks who are new  not long gone forth only recently come to this Dhamma  disciplineIf they do not see the Blessed One there may be alteration in them there may be changeLet the Blessed One delight in the community of monksLet the Blessed One welcome the community of monksLet the Blessed One aid the community of monks as he did beforeThe Blessed One acquiesced with silenceThen Brahma Sahampati sensing the Blessed Ones acquiescence bowed down to the Blessed One and after circumambulating him disappeared right thereThen the Blessed One emerging from seclusion in the evening went to the Banyan ParkOn arrival he sat down on a seat made readyAfter he had sat down he worked a psychic feat such that the monks went to him contritely in ones and twosOn arrival they bowed down to him and sat to one sideAs they were sitting there the Blessed One said to them Monks this is the lowliest form of livelihood that of an almsgoerA term of abuse in the world is You go about as an almsgoer with a bowl in your hand And yet sons of good family take up with compelling reason in dependence on a compelling reason  not coerced by kings nor coerced by thieves nor from debt nor from fear nor to earn a livelihood but I am oppressed with birth aging  death with sorrows lamentations pains distresses  despairsI am oppressed with stress overcome with stressPerhaps an ending of this entire mass of suffering  stress might be foundAnd although this son of a good family has gone forth in this way he is covetous with strong passion for sensual desires with a mind of ill will of corrupt resolves his mindfulness muddled unalert unconcentrated his mind distracted loose in his sense facultiesJust as a log from a funeral pyre burning at both ends smeared with excrement in the middle fills no use as timber either in the village or in the wilderness I speak of this person with this comparisonHe has missed out on the enjoyments of the householder and yet does not fulfill the goal of the contemplative lifeMonks there are these three types of unskillful thinking thinking of sensuality thinking of ill will thinking of harmThese three types of unskillful thinking cease without remainder in one who dwells with his mind well established in the four frames of reference or who develops the themeless concentrationThis is reason enough monks to develop the themeless concentrationThe themeless concentration when developed  pursued is of great fruit great benefitMonks there are these two views the view of becoming and the view of nonbecomingThere the instructed disciple of the noble ones considers thus Is there anything in the world to which I could cling without being blameworthy He discerns There is nothing in the world to which I could cling without being blameworthy He discerns In clinging I would be clinging just to formIn clinging I would be clinging just to feeling perception fabricationsIn clinging I would be clinging just to consciousnessFrom that clinging of mine as a requisite condition would come becomingFrom becoming as a requisite condition birthFrom birth as a requisite condition then aging illness  death sorrow lamentation pain distress  despair would come into playThus would be the origination of this entire mass of suffering  stressWhat do you think monks  Is form constant or inconstantInconstant lordAnd is that which is inconstant easeful or stressfulStressful lordAnd is it fitting to regard what is inconstant stressful subject to change as This is mineThis is my selfThis is what I amNo lord Is feeling constant or inconstant  Inconstant lord Is perception constant or inconstant  Inconstant lord

feeling whatsoeverAny perception whatsoeverAny fabrications whatsoeverAny consciousness whatsoever that is past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or near

disenchanted with form disenchanted with feeling disenchanted with perception disenchanted with fabrications disenchanted with consciousnessThrough disenchantment he becomes dispassionateThrough dispassion he is fully releasedWith full release there is the knowledge Fully released He discerns that Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task doneThere is nothing further for this world See also ItiAt SavatthiMonks any brahmans or contemplatives who recollect their manifold past lives all recollect the five clingingaggregates or one among themWhich fiveWhen recollecting I was one with such a form in the past one is recollecting just formOr when recollecting I was one with such a feeling in the past one is recollecting just feelingOr when recollecting I was one with such a perception in the past one is recollecting just perceptionOr when recollecting I was one with such mental fabrications in the past one is recollecting just mental fabricationsOr when recollecting I

things they are called fabricationsAnd why do you call it consciousnessBecause it cognizes thus it is called consciousnessWhat does it cognizeIt cognizes what is sour bitter pungent sweet alkaline nonalkaline salty  unsaltyBecause it cognizes it is called consciousnessThus an instructed disciple of the noble ones reflects in this way I am now being chewed up by formBut in the past I was also chewed up by form in the same way I am now being chewed up by present formAnd if I delight in future form then in the future I will be chewed up by form in the same way I am now being chewed up by present form Having reflected in this way he becomes indifferent to past form does not delight in future form and is practicing for the sake of disenchantment dispassion and cessation with regard to present form I am now being chewed up by feeling perception fabrications consciousnessBut in the past I was also chewed up by consciousness in the same way I am now being chewed up by present consciousnessAnd if I delight in future consciousness then in the future I will be chewed up by consciousness in the same way I am now being chewed up by present consciousness Having reflected in this

wellinstructed disciple of the noble ones grows disenchanted with form disenchanted with feeling disenchanted with perception disenchanted with fabrications disenchanted with consciousnessDisenchanted he becomes dispassionateThrough dispassion he is fully releasedWith full release there is the knowledge Fully released He discerns that Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task doneThere is nothing further for this world That is what the Blessed One saidGratified the group of five monks delighted at his wordsAnd while this explanation was being given the hearts of the group of five monks through not clinging were fully released from fermentationeffluentsAt Savatthi Monks the Tathagata  the worthy one the rightly selfawakened one who from disenchantment with form from dispassion from cessation from lack of clinging is released  is termed rightly selfawakened And a discernmentreleased monk  who from disenchantment with form from dispassion from cessation from lack of clinging is released  is termed discernmentreleasedThe Tathagata  the worthy one the rightly selfawakened one who from disenchantment with feeling perception fabrication from dispassion from cessation from lack of clinging is released  is termed rightly selfawakened And a discernmentreleased monk  who from disenchantment with feeling perception fabrication from dispassion from cessation from lack of clinging is released  is termed discernmentreleasedThe Tathagata  the worthy one the rightly selfawakened one who from disenchantment with consciousness from dispassion from cessation from lack of clinging is released  is termed rightly selfawakened And a discernmentreleased monk  who from disenchantment with consciousness from dispassion from cessation from lack of clinging is released  is termed discernmentreleasedSo what difference what distinction what distinguishing factor is there between one rightly selfawakened and a monk discernmentreleasedFor us lord the teachings have the Blessed One as their root their guide  their arbitratorIt would be good if the Blessed One himself would explicate the meaning of this statementHaving heard it from the Blessed One the monks will remember itIn that case monks listen  pay close attentionI will speakAs you say lord the monks respondedThe Blessed One said The Tathagata  the worthy one the rightly selfawakened one  is the one who gives rise to the path unarisen who engenders the path unengendered who points out the path not pointed outHe knows the path is expert in the path is adept at the pathAnd his disciples now keep following the path and afterwards become endowed with the pathThis is the difference this the distinction this the distinguishing between one rightly selfawakened and a monk discernmentreleasedTranslators note The term seven bases here can also mean the seven notes of the musical scale and it is possible that the phrase three modes of investigation may also be borrowed from musical theory it may refer to three ways of testing a musical scale once it has been tunedThus in this discourse the Buddha may be borrowing terms commonly used to describe a consummate musician and applying them to his description of a consummate meditatorThe Commentary for its part singles out this discourse as being one that entices a serious meditator to practiceI have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying at Savatthi in Jetas Grove Anathapindikas MonasteryThere he addressed the monks MonksYes lord the monks replied to the Blessed OneThe Blessed One said Monks a monk who is skilled in seven bases and has three modes of investigation is fulfilled  fully accomplished in this doctrine  discipline  the ultimate personAnd how is a monk skilled in seven basesThere is the case where a monk discerns form the

One said Monks there are these five clingingaggregatesWhich fiveForm as a clingingaggregate feeling as a clingingaggregate perception as a clingingaggregate fabrications as a clingingaggregate

this world See also SN SNMonks those recluses and brahmans who regard the self in various ways do so in terms of the five groups of clinging or some of themWhich fiveHere monks the uninstructed worldling regards body as the self the self as having body body as being in the self or the self as being in the bodySo this way of regarding arises it occurs to him to think I amNow when it has occurred to him to think I am the five faculties come into play  the faculties of eye ear nose tongue and bodyMonks there is mind there are mindobjects there is the element of ignoranceThe uninstructed worldling touched by the feeling born of contact with ignorance thinks I am I am this things will be things will not be things will be embodied things will be disembodied things will be conscious things will be unconscious things will be neither consciousnorunconsciousIt is just in this way monks that the five faculties persistBut here for the well taught Ariyan disciple ignorance is abandoned and knowledge arisesWith the waning of ignorance and the arising of knowledge he does not come to think I am I am this things will be things will not be things will be embodied things will be disembodied things will be conscious things will be unconscious things will be neither consciousnorunconsciousAt SavatthiThere the Blessed One said Monks whatever contemplatives or brahmans who assume in various ways when assuming a self all assume the five clingingaggregates or a certain one of themWhich fiveThere is the case where an uninstructed runofthemill person  who has no regard for noble ones is not wellversed or disciplined in their Dhamma who has no regard for men of integrity is not wellversed or disciplined in their Dhamma  assumes form to be the self or the self as possessing form or form as in the self or the self as in formHe assumes feeling to be the self or the self as possessing feeling or feeling as in the self or the self as in feelingHe assumes perception to be the self or the self as possessing perception or perception as in the self or the self as in perceptionHe assumes fabrications to be the self or the self as possessing fabrications or fabrications as in the self or the self as in fabricationsHe assumes consciousness to be the self or the self as possessing consciousness or consciousness as in the self or the self as in

thus I shall be I shall not be I shall be possessed of form I shall be formless I shall be percipient I shall be nonpercipient or I shall be neither percipient nor nonpercipientThe five faculties monks continue as they wereAnd with regard to them the wellinstructed disciple of the noble ones abandons ignorance and gives rise to clear knowingOwing to the fading of ignorance and the arising of clear knowing  I am I am this I shall be I shall not be I shall be possessed of form I shall be formless I shall be percipient I shall be nonpercipient and I shall be neither percipient nor

granariesDighiti was the king of Kosala  poor not very prosperous with few possessions few troops few vehicles few territories with poorlystocked armories  granariesSo Brahmadatta the king of Kasi raising a fourfold army marched against Dighiti the king of KosalaDighiti the king of Kosala heard Brahmadatta the king of Kasi they say has raised a fourfold army and is marching against me Then the thought occurred to him King Brahmadatta is rich prosperous with fullystocked armories  granaries whereas I am poor with poorlystocked armories  granariesI am not competent to stand against even one attack by himWhy dont I slip out of the city beforehand So taking his chief consort he slipped out of the city beforehandThen King Brahmadatta conquering the troops vehicles lands armories  granaries of King Dighiti lived in lordship over themMeanwhile King Dighiti had set out for Varanasi together with his consort and traveling by stages arrived thereThere he lived with her on the outskirts of Varanasi in a potters house disguised as a wandererNot long afterwards she became pregnantShe had a pregnancy wish of this sort she wanted to see a fourfold army armed  arrayed standing on a parade ground at dawn and to drink the water used for washing the swordsShe said to King Dighiti Your majesty I am pregnant and I have a pregnancy wish of this sort I want to see a fourfold army armed  arrayed standing on a parade ground at dawn and to drink the water used for washing the swords He said My queen where is there for us  fallen on hard times  a fourfold army armed  arrayed standing on a parade ground and water used for washing the swordsIf I dont get this your majesty I will dieNow at that time the brahman adviser to King Brahmadatta was a friend of King DighitiSo King Dighiti went to him and on arrival said A lady friend of yours old friend is pregnant and she has a pregnancy wish of this sort she wants to see a fourfold army armed  arrayed standing on a parade ground at dawn and to drink the water used for washing the swordsIn that case let me see herSo King Dighitis consort went to King Brahmadattas brahman adviserWhen he saw her coming from afar he rose from his seat arranged his robe over one shoulder and with his hands raised in salutation to her exclaimed three times Surely the king of Kosala has come to your wombSurely the king of Kosala has come to your wombDont be worried my queenYou will get to see a fourfold army armed  arrayed standing on a parade ground at dawn and to drink the water used for washing the swordsThen he went to King Brahmadatta and on arrival said to him Your majesty signs have appeared such that tomorrow at dawn a fourfold army armed  arrayed should stand on a parade ground and that the swords should be washedSo King Brahmadatta ordered his people I say then Do as the brahman adviser says Thus King Dighitis chief consort got to see a fourfold army armed  arrayed standing on a parade ground at dawn and got to drink the water used for washing the swordsThen with the maturing of the fetus she gave birth to a son whom they named DighavuNot long afterwards Prince Dighavu reached the age of discretionThe thought occurred to King Dighiti This King Brahmadatta of Kasi has done us great harmHe has seized our troops vehicles lands armories  granariesIf he finds out about us he will have all three of us killedWhy dont I send Prince Dighavu to live outside of the city So Prince Dighavu having gone to live outside of the city learned all the craftsNow at that time King Dighitis barber had gone over to King BrahmadattaHe saw King Dighiti together with his consort living on the outskirts of Varanasi in a potters house disguised as a wandererOn seeing them he went to King Brahmadatta and on arrival said to him Your majesty King Dighiti of Kosala together with his consort is living on the outskirts of Varanasi in a potters house disguised as a wandererSo King Brahmadatta ordered his people I say then go fetch King Dighiti together with his consortResponding As you say your majesty they went and fetched King Dighiti together with his consortThen King Brahmadatta ordered his people I say then having bound King Dighiti  his consort with a stout rope with their arms pinned tightly against their backs and having shaved them bald march them to a harshsounding drum from street to street crossroads to crossroads evict them out the south gate of the city and there to the south of the city cut them into four pieces and bury them in holes placed in the four directionsResponding As you say your majesty the kings people bound King Dighiti  his consort with a stout rope pinning their arms tightly against their backs shaved them bald and marched them to a harshsounding drum from street to street crossroads to crossroadsThen the thought occurred to Prince Dighavu Its been a long time since I saw my mother  fatherWhat if I were to go see them So he entered Varanasi and saw his mother  father bound with a stout rope their arms pinned tightly against their backs their heads shaven bald being marched to a harshsounding drum from street to street crossroads to crossroadsSo he went to themKing Dighiti saw Prince Dighavu coming from afar and on seeing him said Dont my dear Dighavu be farsightedDont be nearsightedFor vengeance is not settled through vengeanceVengeance is settled through nonvengeanceWhen this was said the people said to him This King Dighiti has gone crazyHes talking nonsenseWho is DighavuWhy is he saying Dont my dear Dighavu be farsightedDont be nearsightedFor vengeance is not settled through vengeanceVengeance is settled through nonvengeanceIm not crazy or talking nonsenseHe who knows will understand Then a second time a third time he said Dont my dear Dighavu be farsightedDont be nearsightedFor vengeance is not settled through vengeanceVengeance is settled through nonvengeanceA third time the people said to him This King Dighiti has gone crazyHes talking nonsenseWho is DighavuWhy is he saying Dont my dear Dighavu be farsightedDont be nearsightedFor vengeance is not settled through vengeanceVengeance is settled through nonvengeanceIm not crazy or talking nonsenseHe who knows will understandThen the kings people having marched King Dighiti together with his chief consort to a harshsounding drum from street to street crossroads to crossroads evicted them out the south gate of the city and there to the south of the city cut them into four pieces buried them in holes placed in the four directions stationed guards and leftThen Prince Dighavu having entered Varanasi brought out some liquor and got the guards to drink itWhen they had fallen down drunk he collected sticks made a pyre raised the bodies of his mother  father onto the pyre set fire to it and then circumambulated it three times with his hands raised in salutationNow at that time King Brahmadatta had gone up to the terrace on top of his palaceHe saw Prince Dighavu circumambulating the pyre three times with his hands raised in salutation and on seeing him the thought occurred to him Doubtlessly this person is a relative or bloodkinsman of King DighitiAh how unfortunate for me for there is no one who will tell me what this meansThen Prince Dighavu having gone into the wilderness and having cried  wept as much as he needed to dried his tears and entered VaranasiGoing to an elephant stable next to the kings palace he said to the chief elephant trainer Teacher I want to learn this craftIn that case young man you may learn itThen rising in the last watch of the night Prince Dighavu sang in a sweet voice and played the lute in the elephant stableKing Brahmadatta also rising in the last watch of the night heard the sweetvoiced singing  luteplaying in the elephant stableOn hearing it he asked his people I say Who was that rising in the last watch of the night singing in a sweet voice and playing a lute in the elephant stableYour majesty a young man  the student of suchandsuch an elephant trainer rising in the last watch of the night was singing in a sweet voice and playing a lute in the elephant stableI say then go fetch that young manResponding As you say your majesty they went and fetched Prince DighavuThen King Brahmadatta said to Prince Dighavu I say Was that you rising in the last watch of the night singing in a sweet voice and playing a lute in the elephant stableYes your majestyI say then my young man sing and play the luteResponding As you say your majesty and seeking to win favor Prince Dighavu sang with a sweet voice and played the luteThen King Brahmadatta said to him I say You my young man are to stay and attend to meAs you say your majesty Prince Dighavu repliedThen he rose in the morning before King Brahmadatta went to bed in the evening after him did whatever the king ordered always acting to please him speaking politely to himAnd it was not long before King Brahmadatta placed the prince close to him in a position of trustThen one day King Brahmadatta said to Prince Dighavu I say then my young man harness the chariotIm going huntingResponding As you say your majesty Prince Dighavu harnessed the chariot and then said to King Brahmadatta Your chariot is harnessed your majestyNow is the time for you to do as you see fitThen King Brahmadatta mounted the chariot and Prince Dighavu drove itHe drove it in such a way that the kings entourage went one way and the chariot anotherThen after they had gone far King Brahmadatta said to Prince Dighavu I say then my young man unharness the chariotIm tiredIm going to lie downResponding As you say your majesty Prince Dighavu unharnessed the chariot and sat down crosslegged on the groundThen King Brahmadatta lay down placing his head on Prince Dighavus lapAs he was tired he went to sleep right awayThen the thought occurred to Prince Dighavu This King Brahmadatta of Kasi has done us great harmHe has seized our troops vehicles lands armories  granariesAnd it was because of him that my mother  father were killedNow is my chance to wreak vengeance He drew his sword from his scabbardBut then he thought My father told me as he was about to die Dont my dear Dighavu be farsightedDont be nearsightedFor vengeance is not settled through vengeanceVengeance is settled through nonvengeance It would not be proper for me to transgress my fathers words So he put his sword back in its scabbardA second time A third time the thought occurred to Prince Dighavu This King Brahmadatta of Kasi has done us great harmHe has seized our troops vehicles lands armories  granariesAnd it was because of him that my mother  father were killedNow is my chance to wreak vengeance He drew his sword from his scabbardBut then he thought My father told me as he was about to die Dont my dear Dighavu be farsightedDont be nearsightedFor vengeance is not settled through vengeanceVengeance is settled through nonvengeance It would not be proper for me to transgress my fathers words So once again he put his sword back in its scabbardThen King Brahmadatta suddenly got up  frightened agitated unnerved alarmedPrince Dighavu said to him Your majesty why have you gotten up suddenly  frightened agitated unnerved  alarmedI say my young man Just now as I was dreaming Prince Dighavu  son of Dighiti king of Kasi  struck me down with a sword Then Prince Dighavu grabbing King Brahmadatta by the head with his left hand and drawing his sword from its scabbard with his right said I your majesty am that very Prince Dighavu son of Dighiti king of KasiYou have done us great harmYou have seized our troops vehicles lands armories  granariesAnd it was because of you that my mother  father were killedNow is my chance to wreak vengeanceSo King Brahmadatta dropping his head down to Prince Dighavus feet said Grant me my life my dear DighavuGrant me my life my dear DighavuWho am I that I would dare grant life to your majestyIt is your majesty who should grant life to meIn that case my dear Dighavu you grant me my life and I grant you your lifeThen King Brahmadatta and Prince Dighavu granted one another their lives and taking one another by the hands swore an oath to do one another no harmThen King Brahmadatta said to Prince Dighavu In that case my dear Dighavu harness the chariotWe will go onResponding As you say your majesty Prince Dighavu harnessed the chariot and then said to King Brahmadatta Your chariot is harnessed your majestyNow is the time for you to do as you see fitThen King Brahmadatta mounted the chariot and Prince Dighavu drove itHe drove it in such a way that it was not long before they met up with the kings entourageThen King Brahmadatta having entered Varanasi had his ministers  councilors convened and said to them I say thenIf you were to see Prince Dighavu the son of Dighiti the king of Kasi what would you do to himDifferent ministers said We would cut of his hands your majesty  We would cut off his feet your majesty  We would cut off his hands  feet your majesty  We would cut off his ears your majesty  We would cut off his nose your majesty  We would cut off his ears  nose your majesty  We would cut off his head your majestyThen the king said This I say is Prince Dighavu the son of Dighiti the king of KasiYou are not allowed to do anything to himIt was by him that my life was granted to me and it was by me that his life was granted to himThen King Brahmadatta said to Prince Dighavu What your father said to you as he was about to die  Dont my dear Dighavu be farsightedDont be nearsightedFor vengeance is not settled through vengeanceVengeance is settled through nonvengeance  in reference to what did he say thatWhat my father said to me as he was about to die  Dont be farsighted  Dont bear vengeance for a long time is what he was saying to me as he was about to dieAnd what he said to me as he was about to die  Dont be nearsighted  Dont be quick to break with a friend is what he was saying to me as he was about to dieAnd what he said to me as he was about to die  For vengeance is not settled through vengeanceVengeance is settled through nonvengeance  My mother  father were killed by your majestyIf I were to deprive your majesty of life those who hope for your majestys wellbeing would deprive me of lifeAnd those who hope for my wellbeing would deprive them of lifeAnd in that way vengeance would not be settled by vengeanceBut now I have been granted my life by your majesty and your majesty has been granted your life by meAnd in this way vengeance has been settled by nonvengeanceThat is what my father was saying to me as he was about to dieThen King Brahmadatta said Isnt it amazingIsnt it astoundingHow wise this Prince Dighavu is in that he can understand in full the meaning of what his father said in brief So he returned his fathers troops vehicles lands armories  granaries and gave him his daughter in marriageSuch monks is the forbearance  gentleness of kings who wield the scepter who wield the swordSo now let your light shine forth so that you  who have gone forth in such a welltaught Dhamma  Discipline  will be their equal in forbearance  gentlenessThis chapter of the Cullavagga contains the fourteen sets of khandhakavatta or khandhaka duties which derive their name from their location in the Khandhaka section of the VinayaThese duties govern the daytoday life of the bhikkhus although some communities will observe them more closely than othersChanges in technology for example have had inevitably led to the dropping of some of the duties  the toilet duties for instance were designed for a very different kind of restroom than whats found in monasteries today even in Asia to say nothing of the WestStill these duties are important to know even when their precise details are dated for the more fully a bhikkhu knows them the better he is able to apply them in a useful way to modern situationsThe following passages consist of the complete lists of the fourteen sets of duties together with a few of the origin stories describing the events that led to the formulation of each setWhere the duties are identical to the rules of the Sekhiya section of the Patimokkha I have simply noted the fact without listing the rules hereThese rules may easily be found in The Buddhist Monastic CodeThe duties of a student to his teacher and of a teacher to his student are identical to those governing the relationship between mentor and pupil and so have not been repeatedI have included explanatory passages from the Commentary in brackets and marked with a capital C and from the Subcommentary in braces and marked with an SPassages in parentheses are my own observationsA section mark denotes passages where my translation differs from

his analysis of what we truly are and that because the aggregates are impermanent and interdependent we have an impermanent interdependent selfThis sutta however shows that we can be analyzed into the aggregates only if we feel obsession or attachment for themIf we dont feel these things theres no way we can be measured classified or definedAt SavatthiThen a certain monk went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one sideAs he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One It would be good lord if the Blessed One would teach me the Dhamma in brief such that having heard the Dhamma from the Blessed One I might dwell alone secluded heedful ardent  resoluteMonk whatever one stays obsessed with thats what one is measured byWhatever one is measured by thats how one is

to the Blessed One circled around him keeping the Blessed One to his right and departedThen dwelling alone secluded heedful ardent  resolute he in no long time reached  remained in the supreme goal of the holy life for which clansmen rightly go forth from home into homelessness knowing  realizing it for himself in the here  nowHe knew Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task doneThere is nothing further for the sake of this world And thus he became another one of the arahantsMonks I will explain to you grasping and worrying and also not grasping and not worrying Here monks the uninstructed worldling with no regard for Noble Ones unskilled and untrained in the Dhamma of the Noble Ones of those who are worthy regards body as the self the self as having body body as being in the self or the self as being in the bodyChange occurs to this mans body and it becomes differentBecause of this change and alteration in his body his consciousness is preoccupied with bodily changeDue to this preoccupation with bodily change worried thoughts arise and persist laying a firm hold on his mindThrough this mental obsession he becomes fearful and distressed and being full of desire and attachment he is worriedHe regards feeling as the self change occurs to his feeling he is worriedIn this way monks grasping and worrying ariseAnd how monks do not grasping and not worrying

occasion the Blessed One was living among the Bhaggas at Crocodile Haunt in the Bhesakala Grove at the Deer ParkThen the householder Nakulapita went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one sideAs he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One Lord I am a feeble old man aged advanced in years having come to the last stage of lifeI am afflicted in body  ailing with every momentAnd it is only rarely that I get to see the Blessed One  the monks who nourish the heartMay the Blessed One teach me may the Blessed One instruct me for my longterm benefit  happinessSo it

was sprinkled by the Blessed One with the deathless ambrosia of a Dhamma talkBut why didnt it occur to you to question the Blessed One further In what way is one afflicted in body  afflicted in mindAnd in what way is one afflicted in body but unafflicted in mindI would come from a long way away to hear the explication of these words in VenSariputtas presenceIt would be good if VenSariputta himself would enlighten me as to their meaningThen in that case householder listen  pay close attentionI will speakAs you say lord the householder Nakulapita respondedVenSariputta said Now how is one afflicted in body  afflicted in mindThere is the case where an uninstructed runofthemill person  who has no regard for noble ones is not wellversed or disciplined in their Dhamma who has no regard for men of integrity is not wellversed or disciplined in their Dhamma  assumes form to be the self or the self as possessing form or form as in the self or the self as in formHe is seized with the idea

over its change  alterationThis householder is how one is afflicted in body and afflicted in mindAnd how is one afflicted in body but unafflicted in mindThere is the case where a wellinstructed disciple of the noble ones  who has regard for noble ones is wellversed  disciplined in their Dhamma who has regard for men of integrity is wellversed  disciplined in their Dhamma  does not assume form to be the self or the self as possessing form or form as in the self or the self as in formHe is not seized with the idea that I am form or Form is mine As he is not seized with these ideas his

lamentation pain distress or despair over its change  alterationThis householder is how one is afflicted in body but unafflicted in mindThat is what VenSariputta saidGratified the householder Nakulapita delighted in VenSariputtas wordsOnce monks in this same Savatthi there was a lady of a household named VedehikaThis good report about Lady Vedehika had circulated Lady Vedehika is gentleLady Vedehika is eventemperedLady Vedehika is calm Now Lady Vedehika had a slave named Kali who was diligent deft  neat in her workThe thought occurred to Kali the slave This good report about my Lady Vedehika has circulated Lady Vedehika is eventemperedLady Vedehika is gentleLady Vedehika is calm Now is anger present in my lady without showing or is it absentOr is it just because my work is neat that the anger present in my lady doesnt showWhy dont I test herSo Kali the slave got up after daybreakThen Lady Vedehika said to her Hey KaliYes madamWhy did you get up after daybreakNo reason madamNo reason you wicked slave and yet you get up after daybreak Angered  displeased she scowledThen the thought occurred to Kali the slave Anger is present in my lady without showing and not absentAnd its just because my work is neat that the anger present in my lady doesnt showWhy dont I test her some moreSo Kali the slave got up later in the dayThen Lady Vedehika said to her Hey KaliYes madamWhy did you get up later in the dayNo reason madamNo reason you wicked slave and yet you get up later in the day Angered  displeased she grumbledThen the thought occurred to Kali the slave Anger is present in my lady without showing and not absentAnd its just because my work is neat that the anger present in my lady doesnt showWhy dont I test her some moreSo Kali the slave got up even later in the dayThen Lady Vedehika said to her Hey KaliYes madamWhy did you get up even later in the dayNo reason madamNo reason you wicked slave and yet you get up even later in the day Angered  displeased she grabbed hold of a rolling pin and gave her a whack over the head cutting it openThen Kali the slave with blood streaming from her cutopen head went and denounced her mistress to the neighbors See ladies the gentle ones handiworkSee the eventempered ones handiworkSee the calm ones handiworkHow could she angered  displeased with her only slave for getting up after daybreak grab hold of a rolling pin and give her a whack over the head cutting it openAfter that this evil report about Lady Vedehika circulated Lady Vedehika is viciousLady Vedehika is foultemperedLady Vedehika is violentIn the same way monks a monk may be ever so gentle ever so eventempered ever so calm as long as he is not touched by disagreeable aspects of speechBut its when disagreeable aspects of speech touch him that he can be known from experience as gentle eventempered  calmI dont call a monk easy to admonish if he is easy to admonish and makes himself easy to admonish only by reason of robes almsfood lodging  medicinal requisites for curing the sickWhy is thatBecause if he doesnt get robes almsfood lodging  medicinal requisites for curing the sick then he isnt easy to admonish and doesnt make himself easy to admonishBut if a monk is easy to admonish and makes himself easy to admonish purely out of esteem for the Dhamma respect for the Dhamma reverence for the Dhamma then I call him easy to admonishThus monks We will be easy to admonish and make ourselves easy to admonish purely out of esteem for the Dhamma respect for the Dhamma reverence for the Dhamma thats how you should train yourselvesMonks

slight or gross that you could not endureNo lordThen attend constantly to this admonition on the simile of the sawThat will be for your longterm welfare  happinessThat is what the Blessed One saidGratified the monks delighted in the Blessed Ones wordsThe body of this sutta consists of a narrative illustrating the power of skillful actionIn the past unskillful behavior was unknown among the human raceAs a result people lived for an immensely long time  years  endowed with great beauty wealth pleasure and strengthOver the course of time though they began behaving in various unskillful waysThis caused the human life span gradually to shorten to the point where it now stands at years with human beauty wealth pleasure and strength decreasing proportionatelyIn the future as morality continues to degenerate human life will continue to shorten to the point were the normal life span is years with people reaching sexual maturity at fiveAmong those human beings the ten courses of action will have entirely disappeared The word skillful will not exist so from where will there be anyone who does what is skillfulThose who lack the honorable qualities of motherhood fatherhood contemplativehood  brahmanhood will be the ones who receive homage Fierce hatred will arise fierce malevolence fierce rage  murderous thoughts mother for child child for mother father for child child for father brother for sister sister for brother Ultimately conditions will deteriorate to the point of a swordinterval in which swords appear in the hands of all human beings and they hunt one another like gameA few people however will take shelter in the wilderness to escape the carnage and when the slaughter is over they will come out of hiding and resolve to take up a life of skillful and virtuous action againWith the recovery of virtue the human life span will gradually increase again until it reaches years with people attaining sexual maturity atOnly three diseases will be known at that time desire lack of food and old ageAnother Buddha  Metteyya  will gain Awakening his monastic Sangha numbering in the thousandsThe greatest king of the time Sankha will go forth into homelessness and attain arahantship under Metteyyas guidanceThe story after chronicling the ups and downs of human wealth life span etc concludes with the following lesson on kamma and skillful action Monks live with yourself as your island yourself as your refuge with nothing else as your refugeLive with the Dhamma as your island the Dhamma as your refuge with nothing else as your refugeAnd how does a monk live with himself as his island himself as his refuge with nothing else as his refuge with the Dhamma as his island the Dhamma as his refuge with nothing else as his refugeThere is the case where a monk remains focused on the body in  of itself  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the worldHe remains focused on feelings in  of themselves mind in  of itself mental qualities in  of themselves  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the worldThis is how a monk lives with himself as his island himself as his refuge with nothing else as his refuge with the Dhamma as his island the Dhamma as his refuge with nothing else as his refugeWander monks in your proper range your own ancestral territoryWhen you wander in your proper range your own ancestral territory you will grow in long life beauty pleasure wealth  strengthAnd what constitutes a monks long lifeThere is the case where a monk develops the base of power endowed with concentration founded on desire  the fabrications of exertionHe develops the base of power endowed with concentration founded on persistence founded on intent He develops the base of power endowed with concentration founded on discrimination  the fabrications of exertionFrom the development  pursuit of these four bases of power he can stay for an aeon if he wants or for the remainder of an aeonThis constitutes a monks long lifeAnd what constitutes a monks beautyThere is the case where a monk is virtuousHe dwells restrained in accordance with the Patimokkha consummate in his behavior  sphere of activityHe trains himself having undertaken the training rules seeing danger in the slightest faultsThis constitutes a monks beautyAnd what constitutes a monks pleasureThere is the case where a monk  quite withdrawn from sensuality withdrawn from unskillful mental qualities  enters  remains in the first jhana rapture  pleasure born from withdrawal accompanied by directed thought  evaluationWith the stilling of directed thoughts  evaluations he enters  remains in the second jhana rapture  pleasure born of composure unification of awareness free from directed thought  evaluation  internal assuranceWith the fading of rapture he remains equanimous mindful  alert and senses pleasure with the bodyHe enters  remains in the third jhana of which the Noble Ones declare Equanimous  mindful he has a pleasant abiding With the abandoning of pleasure  pain  as with the earlier disappearance of elation  distress  he enters  remains in the fourth jhana purity of equanimity  mindfulness neither pleasure nor painThis constitutes a monks pleasureAnd what constitutes a monks wealthThere is the case where a monk keeps pervading the first direction  as well as the second direction the third  the fourth  with an awareness imbued with good willThus he keeps pervading above below  all around everywhere  in every respect the allencompassing world with an awareness imbued with good will abundant expansive immeasurable free from hostility free from ill willHe keeps pervading the first direction  as well as the second direction the third  the fourth  with an awareness imbued with compassion imbued with appreciationHe keeps pervading the first direction  as well as the second direction the third  the fourth  with an awareness imbued with equanimityThus he keeps pervading above below  all around everywhere  in every respect the allencompassing world with an awareness imbued with equanimity abundant expansive immeasurable free from hostility free from ill willThis constitutes a monks wealthAnd what constitutes a monks strengthThere is the case where a monk through the ending of the mental fermentations enters  remains in the fermentationfree awarenessrelease  discernmentrelease having directly known  realized them for himself right in the here  nowThis constitutes a monks strengthMonks I dont envision any other single strength so hard to overcome as this the strength of MaraAnd the adopting of skillful qualities is what causes this merit to increase That is what the Blessed One saidGratified the monks delighted in the Blessed Ones wordsMonks I will explain to you the burden the laying hold of the burden the holding on to the burden the laying down of the burdenListenWhat monks is the burdenThe five groups of clinging is the answerWhich fiveThey are the group of clinging to corporeality to feelings to perceptions to mental formations to consciousnessThis monks is called the burdenWhat is the laying hold of the burdenThe answer is that it is the person the Venerable Soandso of suchandsuch a familyThis monks is called the laying hold of the burdenWhat is the holding on to the burdenThe answer is that it is that craving which gives rise to fresh rebirth and bound up with lust and greed now here now there finds ever fresh delightIt is sensual craving craving for existence craving for nonexistenceThis monks is called the holding on to the burdenWhat is the laying down of the burdenIt is the complete fading away and extinction of this craving its forsaking and giving up liberation and detachment from itThis monks is called the laying down of the burden Thus said the Blessed One the Wellfarer spoke thus the Teacher then saidIt is easy to understand how this sutta could be misunderstood both in ancient and in modern times since one would expect the person to be described as the bearer rather than the bearing The explanation is that the person is in terms of relative truth what the khandhas are according to ultimate truthOne is tempted to think that this sutta was originally delivered for the benefit of one or other of the Bhaaradvaajas whose name appears to mean twiceborn burdenThus have I heardOnce while the Blessed One was staying in the vicinity of Saavatthi in the Jeta Grove in Anaathapindikas monastery a certain deity whose surpassing brilliance and beauty illumined the entire Jeta Grove late one night came to the presence of the Blessed One having come to him and offered profound salutations he stood on one side and spoke to him reverently in the following verseHere ends the Discourse on BlessingsThus have I heardOnce while the Blessed One was staying in the vicinity of Saavatthi in the Jeta Grove in Anaathapindikas monastery a certain deity whose surpassing brilliance

in the following verseHere ends the Discourse on BlessingsI have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying in the Kuru countryNow there is a town of the Kurus called KammasadhammaThere the Blessed One addressed the monks MonksLord the monks repliedThe Blessed One said this This is the direct path for the purification of beings for the overcoming of sorrow  lamentation for the disappearance of pain  distress for the attainment of the right method  for the realization of Unbinding  in other words the four frames of referenceWhich fourThere is the case where a monk remains

beings for the overcoming of sorrow  lamentation for the disappearance of pain  distress for the attainment of the right method  for the realization of Unbinding  in other words the four frames of reference Thus was it said and in reference to this was it saidThat is what the Blessed One saidGratified the monks delighted in the Blessed Ones wordsThus have I heardOn one occasion the Blessed One was living near Savatthi at Jetavana at Anathapindikas monasteryNow when the night was far advanced a certain deity whose surpassing radiance illuminated the whole of Jetavana approached the Blessed One respectfully saluted him and stood beside himStanding thus he addressed the Blessed One in verseMany deities and men longing for happiness have pondered on blessingsPray tell me what the highest blessings areNot to associate with the foolish but to associate with the wise and to honor those worthy of honor  this is the highest blessingTo reside in a suitable locality to have performed meritorious actions in the past and to set oneself in the right direction  this is the highest blessingVast learning skill in handicrafts well grounded in discipline and pleasant speech  this is the highest blessingTo support ones father and mother to cherish ones wife and children and to be engaged in peaceful occupations  this is the highest blessingLiberality righteous conduct rendering assistance to relatives and performance of blameless deeds  this is the highest blessingTo cease and abstain from evil to abstain from intoxicating drinks and diligent in performing righteous acts  this is the highest blessingReverence humility contentment gratitude and the timely hearing of the Dhamma the teaching of the Buddha  this is the highest blessingPatience obedience meeting the Samanas and timely discussions on the Dhamma  this is the highest blessingSelfcontrol chastity comprehension of the Noble Truths and the realization of Nibbana  this is the highest blessingThe mind that is not touched by the vicissitudes of life the mind that is free from sorrow stainless and secure  this is the highest blessingThose who have fulfilled the conditions are victorious everywhere and attain happiness everywhere  To them these are the highest blessingsThe word satipatthana is the name for an approach to meditation aimed at establishing sati or mindfulnessThe term sati is related to the verb sarati to remember or to keep in mindIt is sometimes translated as nonreactive awareness free from agendas simply present with whatever arises but the formula for satipatthana doesnt support that translationNonreactive awareness is actually an aspect of equanimity a quality fostered in the course of satipatthanaThe activity of satipatthana however definitely has a motivating agenda the desire for Awakening which is classed not as a cause of suffering but as part of the path to its endingThe role of mindfulness is to keep the mind properly grounded in the present moment in a way that will keep it on the pathTo make an analogy Awakening is like a mountain on the horizon the destination to which you are driving a carMindfulness is what remembers to keep attention focused on the road to the mountain rather than letting it stay focused on glimpses of the mountain or get distracted by other paths leading away from the roadAs a compound term satipatthana can be broken down in two ways either as satipatthana foundation of mindfulness or as satiupatthana establishing of mindfulnessScholars debate as to which is the proper interpretation but in practice both provide useful food for thoughtThe first interpretation focuses on the objects of the meditation practice the focal points that provide mindfulness with a foundation  or to use the more idiomatic English phrase adopted here a frame of referenceAltogether there are four the body in and of itself feelings in and of themselves mind in and of itself and mental qualities in and of themselvesThe in and of itself here is crucialIn the case of the body for instance it means viewing the body on its own terms rather than in terms of its function in the context of the worldDropping any concern for how the bodys beauty agility or strength fits into the world the meditator simply stays with the direct experience of its breathing its movements its postures its elementary properties and its inevitable decayA similar principle applies to the other frames of referenceThe second interpretation of satipatthana  satiupatthana  focuses on the process of the meditation practice on how a frame of reference is establishedThis sutta gives three stages for this process applied to each frame of referenceThe first stage as applied to the body is thisThe monk remains focused on the body in and of itself  ardent alert and mindful  putting aside greed and distress with reference to the worldRemaining focused refers to the element of concentration in the practice as the meditator holds to one particular frame of reference amid the conflicting currents of experienceArdent refers to the effort put into the practice trying to abandon unskillful states of mind and develop skillful ones in their stead all the while trying to discern the difference between the twoAlert means being clearly aware of what is happening in the presentMindful as mentioned above means being able to keep the frame of reference continually in mindAs these qualities work together they bring the mind to a solid state of concentrationAlthough satipatthana practice is often said to be separate from the practice of jhana a number of suttas equate the successful completion of this first stage with the attainment of the first level of jhanaThis point is confirmed by the many suttas  MN among them  describing how the practice of satipatthana brings to completion the factors for Awakening which coincide with the factors of jhanaThe second stage of satipatthana practice is thisThe phenomena of origination and passing away covers events either directly or indirectly related to ones chosen frame of referenceDirectly means changes in the frame of reference itselfFor instance when focused on the body one may notice the arising and passing away of breath sensations within itIndirectly here means events in any of the other three frames of reference as they relate to the bodyFor example one might notice the arising and passing away of feelings of pleasure or mental states of irritation in connection to events in the bodyOr one might notice lapses of mindfulness in ones focus on the bodyIn each of these cases if the origination and passing away is of neutral events such as the aggregates one is directed simply to be aware of them as events and to let them follow their natural course so as to see what factors accompany them and lead to their comings and goingsHowever when skillful or unskillful mental qualities  such as the factors for Awakening or the Hindrances  arise and pass away one is encouraged to foster the factors that strengthen jhana and eliminate the factors that weaken itThis means actively getting engaged in maximizing skillful mental qualities and minimizing unskillful onesOne thus develops insight into the process of origination and passing away by taking an active and sensitive role in the process just as you learn about eggs by trying to cook with them gathering experience from your successes and failures in attempting increasingly difficult dishesAs this process leads to stronger and more refined states of concentration it makes one sensitive to the fact that the grosser ones participation in the process of origination and passing away in the mind the grosser the level of stress that resultsThis leads one to let go of increasingly refined levels of participation as one is able to detect them leading to the third and final stage in satipatthana practiceOr his mindfulness that There is a body  is maintained to the extent of knowledge  recollectionAnd he remains independent unsustained by anything in the worldThis stage corresponds to a mode of perception that the Buddha in MN terms entry into emptinessThis is the culminating equipoise where the path of the practice opens to a state of nonfashioning and from there to the fruit of Awakening and releaseAt first glance the four frames of reference for satipatthana practice sound like four different meditation exercises but MN makes clear that they can all center on a single practice keeping the breath in mindWhen the mind is with the breath all four frames of reference are right thereThe difference lies simply in the subtlety of ones focusIts like learning to play the pianoAs you get more proficient at playing you also become sensitive in listening to ever more subtle levels in the musicThis allows you to play even more skillfullyIn the same way as a meditator gets more skilled in staying with the breath the practice of satipatthana gives greater sensitivity in peeling away ever more subtle layers of participation in the present moment until nothing is left standing in the way of total releaseI have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying in the Kuru countryNow there is a town of the Kurus called KammasadhammaThere the Blessed One addressed the monks MonksLord the monks repliedThe Blessed One said this This is the direct path for the purification of beings for the overcoming of sorrow  lamentation for the disappearance of pain  distress for the attainment of the right method  for the realization of Unbinding  in other words the

senses pleasure with the bodyHe enters  remains in the third jhana of which the Noble Ones declare Equanimous  mindful he has a pleasant abiding With the abandoning of pleasure  pain  as with the earlier disappearance of elation  distress  he enters  remains in the fourth jhana purity of equanimity  mindfulness neither pleasure nor painThis is called right concentrationThis is called the noble truth of the path of practice leading to the cessation of stressIn this way he remains focused internally on mental qualities in  of themselves or externally on mental qualities in  of themselves or both internally  externally on mental qualities in  of themselvesOr he remains focused on the phenomenon of origination with regard to mental qualities on the phenomenon of passing away with regard to mental qualities or on the phenomenon of origination  passing away with regard to mental qualitiesOr his mindfulness that There are mental qualities is maintained to the extent of knowledge  remembranceAnd he remains independent unsustained by anything in the worldThis is how a monk remains focused on mental qualities in  of themselves with reference to the four noble truthsNow if anyone would develop these four frames of reference in this way for seven years one of two fruits can be expected for him either gnosis right here  now or  if there be any remnant of clingingsustenance

inconstantWhat else is there to expect In the past lord the monks in all directions after ending the Rains retreat came to see the TathagataThus we got to see  attend to the monks who inspire the heartBut now after the Blessed One is gone we wont get to see or attend to the monks who inspire the heartAnanda there are these four places that merit being seen by a clansman with conviction that

four marvelous  amazing qualities in AnandaWhen this was said VenAnanda said to the Blessed One Lord may the Blessed One not be totally unbound in this little town this dusty town this branch townshipThere are other great cities Campa Rajagaha Savatthi Saketa Kosambi VanarasiMay the Blessed One be totally unbound thereIn those cities there are many wealthy noble warriors brahmans  householders who have high confidence in the TathagataThey will conduct the Tathagatas funeralDont say that AnandaDont say that this little town this dusty town this branch township In the past Ananda a king named Mahasudassana was a wheelturning monarch a righteous king ruling righteously who was a conqueror of the four directions a stabilizer of his country endowed with the seven treasuresThis Kusinara was his capital city named Kusavati twelve leagues long from east to west seven leagues wide from north to southKusavati was powerful rich  wellpopulated crowded with people  prosperousJust as the capital city of the devas named Alakamanda is powerful rich  wellpopulated crowded with yakkhas  prosperous in the same way Kusavati was powerful rich  wellpopulated crowded with people  prosperousBy day or by night it was never lacking in ten sounds the sound of elephants horses carts drums tabors lutes songs cymbals gongs with cries of EatDrinkSnack as the tenthNow Ananda go into Kusinara and announce to the Kusinara Mallans Tonight Vasitthas in the last watch of the night the total Unbinding of the Tathagata will occurCome out VasitthasCome out VasitthasDont later regret that The Tathagatas total Unbinding occurred within the borders of our very own town but we didnt get to see him in his final hour Responding As you say lord VenAnanda put on his robe and  carrying his bowl  outer robe  went unaccompanied into KusinaraNow at that time the Kusinara Mallans had met for some business in their assembly hallVenAnanda went to the assembly hall and on arrival announced to them Tonight Vasitthas in the last watch of the night the total Unbinding of the Tathagata will occurCome out VasitthasCome out VasitthasDont later regret that The Tathagatas total Unbinding occurred within the borders of our very own town but we didnt get to see him in his final hour When they heard VenAnanda the Mallans together with their sons daughters  wives were shocked saddened their minds overflowing with sorrowSome of them wept tearing at their hair they wept uplifting their armsAs if their feet were cut out from under them they fell down and rolled back  forth crying All too soon the Blessed One will be totally unboundAll too soon the One Wellgone will be totally unboundAll too soon the One with Eyes will disappear from the worldThen the Mallans together with their sons daughters  wives  shocked saddened their minds overflowing with sorrow  went to VenAnanda at Upavattana the Mallans salgrove near KusinaraThe thought occurred to VenAnanda If I let the Mallans pay reverence to the Blessed One one by one the night will be over before they have finished paying reverenceWhat if I were to have them pay reverence to the Blessed One arranging them family by family announcing Lord the Mallan named soso together with his children  wives servants  retainers bows down with his head at the Blessed Ones feet So VenAnanda arranging the Mallans family by family had them pay reverence to the Blessed One Lord the Mallan named soso together with his children  wives servants  retainers bows down with his head at the Blessed Ones feetIn this way VenAnanda got the Mallans to pay reverence to the Blessed One within the first watch of the nightNow at that time Subhadda the Wanderer was staying in KusinaraHe heard Tonight in the last watch of the night the total Unbinding of Gotama the contemplative will take place Then the thought occurred to him I have heard the elder wanderers teachers of teachers saying that only once in a long long time do Tathagatas  worthy ones rightly selfawakened  appear in the worldTonight in the last watch of the night the total Unbinding of Gotama the contemplative will occurNow there is a doubt that has arisen in me but I have faith that he could teach me the Dhamma in such a way that I might abandon that doubtSo he went to Upavattana the Mallans salgrove and on arrival said to VenAnanda I have heard the elder wanderers teachers of teachers saying that only once in a long long time do Tathagatas  worthy ones rightly selfawakened  appear in the worldTonight in the last watch of the night the total Unbinding of Gotama the contemplative will occurNow there is a doubt that has arisen in me but I have faith that he could teach me the Dhamma in such a way that I might abandon that doubtIt would be good VenAnanda if you would let me see himWhen this was said VenAnanda said to him Enough friend SubhaddaDont bother the Blessed OneThe Blessed One is tiredFor a second time For a third time Subhadda the Wanderer said to VenAnanda It would be good VenAnanda if you would let me see himFor a third time VenAnanda said to him Enough friend SubhaddaDont bother the Blessed OneThe Blessed One is tiredNow the Blessed One heard the exchange between VenAnanda  Subhadda the Wanderer and so he said to VenAnanda Enough AnandaDont stand in his wayLet him see the TathagataWhatever he asks me will all be for the sake of knowledge and not to be bothersomeAnd whatever I answer when asked he will quickly understandSo VenAnanda said to Subhadda the Wanderer Go ahead friend SubhaddaThe Blessed One gives you his leaveThen Subhadda went to the Blessed One and exchanged courteous greetings with himAfter an exchange of friendly greetings  courtesies he sat to one sideAs he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One Venerable sir these brahmans  contemplatives each with his group each with his community each the teacher of his group an honored leader wellregarded by people at large  ie Purana Kassapa Makkhali Gosala Ajita Kesakambalin Pakudha Kaccayana Sañjaya Belatthaputta  the Nigantha Nataputta Do they all have direct knowledge as they themselves claim or do they all not have direct knowledge or do some of them have direct knowledge and some of them notEnough SubhaddaPut this question asideI will teach you the DhammaListen and pay close attentionI will speakYes lord Subhadda answered and the Blessed One said In any doctrine  discipline where the noble eightfold path is not found no contemplative of the first second third fourth order is foundBut in any doctrine  discipline where the noble eightfold path is found contemplatives of the first second third fourth order are foundThe noble eightfold path is found in this doctrine  discipline and right here there are contemplatives of the first second third fourth orderOther teachings are empty of knowledgeable contemplativesAnd if the monks dwell rightly this world will not be empty of arahantsAnd no contemplative of the second third fourth orderOther teachings are empty of knowledgeable contemplativesAnd if the monks dwell rightly this world will not be empty of arahantsThen Subhadda the Wanderer said Magnificent lordMagnificentJust as if he were to place upright what was overturned to reveal what was hidden to point out the way to one who was lost or to carry a lamp into the dark so that those with eyes could see forms in the same way has the Blessed One  through many lines of reasoning  made the Dhamma clearI go to the Blessed One for refuge to the Dhamma  to the community of monksLet me obtain the going forth in the Blessed Ones presence let me obtain admissionAnyone Subhadda who has previously belonged to another sect and who desires the going forth  admission in this doctrine  discipline must first undergo probation for four monthsIf at the end of four months the monks feel so moved they give him the going forth  admit him to the monks stateBut I know distinctions among individuals in this matterLord if that is so I am willing to undergo probation for four yearsIf at the end of four years the monks feel so moved let them give me the going forth  admit me to the monks stateThen the Blessed One said to VenAnanda Very well then Ananda give Subhadda the going forthYes lord Ananda answeredThen Subhadda said to VenAnanda It is a gain for you Ananda a great gain that you have been anointed here in the Teachers presence with the pupils anointingThen Subhadda the Wanderer received the going forth  the admission in the Blessed Ones presenceAnd not long after his admission  dwelling alone secluded heedful ardent  resolute  he in no long time reached  remained in the supreme goal of the holy life for which clansmen rightly go forth from home into homelessness knowing  realizing it for himself in the here  nowHe knew Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task doneThere is nothing further for the sake of this world And thus VenSubhadda became another one of the arahants the last of the Blessed Ones facetoface disciplesThen the Blessed One said to VenAnanda Now if it occurs to any of you  The teaching has lost its authority we are without a Teacher  do not view it in that wayWhatever Dhamma  Vinaya I have pointed out  formulated for you that will be your Teacher when I am goneAt present the monks address one another as friend but after I am gone they are not to address one another that wayThe more senior monks are to address the newer monks by their name or clan or as friend The newer monks are to address the more senior monks as venerable or sirAfter I am gone the sangha  if it wants  may abolish the lesser  minor training rulesAfter I am gone the monk Channa should be given the brahma penaltyWhat lord is the brahma penaltyChanna may say what he wants Ananda but he is not to be spoken to instructed or admonished by the monksThen the Blessed One addressed the monks If even a single monk has any doubt or perplexity concerning the Buddha Dhamma or Sangha the path or the practice askDont later regret that The Teacher was facetoface with us but we didnt bring ourselves to crossquestion him in his presence When this was said the monks were silentA second time the Blessed One said If even a single monk has any doubt or perplexity concerning the Buddha Dhamma or Sangha the path or the practice askDont later regret that The Teacher was facetoface with us but we didnt bring ourselves to crossquestion him in his presence A second time the monks were silentA third time the Blessed One said If even a single monk has any doubt or perplexity concerning the Buddha Dhamma or Sangha the path or the practice askDont later regret that The Teacher was facetoface with us but we didnt bring ourselves to crossquestion him in his presence A third time the monks were silentThen the Blessed One addressed the monks Now if its out of respect for the Teacher that you dont ask let a friend inform a friendWhen this was said the monks were silentThen VenAnanda said to the Blessed One Its amazing lordIts marvelousIm confident that in this community of monks there is not even a single monk who has any doubt or perplexity concerning the Buddha Dhamma or Sangha the path or the practiceYou Ananda speak out of confidence while there is knowledge in the Tathagata that in this community of monks there is not even a single monk who has any doubt or perplexity concerning the Buddha Dhamma or Sangha the path or the practiceOf these monks the most backward is a streamwinner not destined for the planes of deprivation headed to selfawakening for sureThen the Blessed One addressed the monks Now then monks I exhort you All fabrications are subject to decayBring about completion by being heedful Those were the Tathagatas last wordsThen the Blessed One entered the first jhanaEmerging from that he entered the second jhanaEmerging from that he entered the third the fourth jhana the dimension of the infinitude of space the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness the dimension of nothingness the dimension of neither perception nor nonperceptionEmerging from that he entered the cessation of perception  feelingThen VenAnanda said to VenAnuruddha VenAnuruddha the Blessed One is totally unboundNo friend AnandaThe Blessed One isnt totally unboundHe has entered the cessation of perception  feelingThen the Blessed

monks present who were not without passion wept uplifting their armsAs if their feet were cut out from under them they fell down and rolled back  forth crying All too soon is the Blessed One totally

all things dear  appealing the state of becoming separate the state of becoming otherwiseWhat else is there to expectIts impossible that one could forbid anything born existent fabricated  subject to disintegration from disintegratingThe devatas friends are complainingBut VenAnuruddha what is the state of the devatas the Blessed One is referring toFriend Ananda there are devatas who perceive space

are inconstantWhat else is there to expect Then VenAnuruddha  VenAnanda spent the remainder of the night in Dhamma talkThen VenAnuruddha said to VenAnanda Go friend AnandaEntering Kusinara announce to the Kusinara Mallans The Blessed One Vasitthas is totally unboundNow is the time for you to do as you see fit Responding As you say sir VenAnanda in the early morning put on his robe and  carrying his bowl  outer robe  went unaccompanied into KusinaraNow at that time the Kusinara Mallans had met for some business in their assembly hallVenAnanda went to the assembly hall and on arrival announced to them The Blessed One Vasitthas is totally unboundNow is the time for you to do as you see fitWhen they heard VenAnanda the Mallans together with their sons daughters  wives were shocked saddened their minds overflowing with sorrowSome of them wept tearing at their hair they wept uplifting their armsAs if their feet were cut out from under them they fell down and rolled back  forth crying All too soon is the Blessed One totally unboundAll too soon is the One Wellgone totally unboundAll too soon the One with Eyes has disappeared from the worldThen the Kusinara Mallans ordered their men In that case I say gather scents garlands  all the musical instruments in Kusinara Then taking scents garlands  all the musical instruments in Kusinara along with lengths of cloth the Kusinara Mallans went to the Blessed Ones body in Upavattana the Mallans salgrove near KusinaraOn arrival they spent the entire day in worshipping honoring respecting  venerating the Blessed Ones body with dances songs music garlands  scents in making cloth canopies and arranging floral wreathsThen the thought occurred to them Its too late today to cremate the Blessed Ones bodyWell cremate the Blessed Ones body tomorrow And so they spent the second day the third day the fourth day the fifth day the sixth day in worshipping honoring respecting  venerating the Blessed Ones body with dances songs music garlands  scents in making cloth canopies and arranging floral wreathsThen on the seventh day the thought occurred to them Worshipping honoring respecting  venerating to the Blessed Ones body with dances songs music garlands  scents lets carry it to the south around the outside of the town and cremate it to the south of the townThen eight leading Mallans having bathed their heads and wearing new linen cloth thinking Well lift up the Blessed Ones body were unable to lift itSo the Kusinara Mallans asked VenAnuruddha What is the reason VenAnuruddha what is the cause why these eight leading Mallans having bathed their heads and wearing new linen cloth thinking Well lift up the Blessed Ones body are unable to lift itYour intention Vasitthas is one thingThe devas intention is anotherBut what VenAnuruddha is the devas intentionYour intention Vasitthas is Worshipping honoring respecting  venerating the Blessed Ones body with dances songs music garlands  scents lets carry it to the south around the outside of the town and cremate it to the south of the town The devas intention is Worshipping honoring respecting  venerating the Blessed Ones body with heavenly dances songs music garlands  scents lets carry it to the north of the town enter the town through the north gate carry it through the middle of the town and out the east gate to the Mallans memorial called Makutabandhana to cremate it there Then let it be venerable sir in line with the devas intentionNow at that time Kusinara  even to its rubbish heaps  cesspools  was strewn kneedeep in coraltree flowersSo the devas  the Kusinara Mallans worshipping honoring respecting  venerating the Blessed Ones body with heavenly  human dances songs music garlands  scents carried it to the north of the town entered the town through the north gate carried it through the middle of the town and out the east gate to the Mallans memorial called MakutabandhanaThere they set it downThen the Kusinara Mallans said to VenAnanda Venerable sir what course should we follow with regard to the Tathagatas bodyThe course they follow with regard to the body of a wheelturning monarch Vasitthas is the course that should be followed with regard to the body of the TathagataAnd what venerable sir is the course they follow with regard to the body of a wheelturning monarchVasitthas they wrap the body of a wheelturning monarch in new linen clothHaving wrapped it in new linen cloth they wrap it in teased cottonwoolHaving wrapped it in teased cottonwool they wrap it in new linen clothHaving done this times they place the body in an iron oilvat cover it with an iron lid make a pyre composed totally of perfumed substances and cremate the bodyThen they build a burial mound for the wheelturning monarch at a great fourway intersectionThat is the course that they follow with regard to the body of a wheelturning monarchThe course they follow with regard to the body of a wheelturning monarch Vasitthas is the course that should be followed with regard to the body of the TathagataA burial mound for the Tathagata is to be built at a great fourway intersectionAnd those who offer a garland a scent or a perfume powder there or bow down there or brighten their minds there that will be for their longterm welfare  happinessSo the Kusinara Mallans ordered their men In that case I say gather the Mallans teased cottonwoolThen they wrapped the Blessed Ones body in new linen clothHaving wrapped it in new linen cloth they wrapped it in teased cottonwoolHaving wrapped it in teased cottonwool they wrapped it in new linen clothHaving done this times they placed the body in an iron oilvat covered it with an iron lid made a pyre composed totally of perfumed substances and set the body on the pyreNow at that time VenMaha Kassapa was traveling on the highway from Pava to Kusinara with a large community of monks approximately monks in allLeaving the road he sat down at the foot of a treeMeanwhile a certain naked ascetic carrying a coraltree flower from Kusinara was traveling on the highway to PavaVenMaha Kassapa saw the naked ascetic coming from afar and on seeing him said to him Do you know our teacher friendYes friend I know himSeven days ago Gotama the contemplative was totally unboundThats how I got this coraltree flowerWith that some of the monks present who were not without passion wept uplifting their armsAs if their feet were cut out from under them they fell down and rolled back  forth crying All too soon is the Blessed One totally unboundAll too soon is the One Wellgone totally unboundAll too soon the One with Eyes has disappeared from the world But those monks who were free from passion acquiesced mindful  alert Fabrications are inconstantWhat else is there to expectNow at that time a monk named Subhadda who had gone forth when old was sitting among the groupHe said to the monks Enough friendsDont grieveDont lamentWere well rid of the Great ContemplativeWeve been harassed by This is allowableThis is not allowable But now we will do what we want to do and not do what we dont want to doThen VenMaha Kassapa addressed the monks Enough friendsDont grieveDont lamentHasnt the Blessed One already taught the state of growing different with regard to all things dear  appealing the state of becoming separate the state of becoming otherwiseWhat else is there to expectIts impossible that one could forbid anything born existent fabricated  subject to disintegration from disintegratingThen four leading Mallans having bathed their heads and wearing new linen cloth thinking Well ignite the Blessed Ones pyre were unable to ignite itSo the Kusinara Mallans asked VenAnuruddha What is the reason VenAnuruddha what is the cause why these four leading Mallans having bathed their heads and wearing new linen cloth thinking Well ignite the Blessed Ones pyre are unable to ignite itYour intention Vasitthas is one thingThe devas intention is anotherBut what VenAnuruddha is the devas intentionThe devas intention Vasitthas is This VenMaha Kassapa is traveling on the highway from Pava to Kusinara with a large community of monks approximately monks in allThe Blessed Ones pyre will not catch fire until VenMaha Kassapa has worshipped the Blessed Ones feet with his head Then let it be venerable sir in line with the devas intentionSo VenMaha Kassapa went to the Blessed Ones pyre at Makutabandhana the Mallans memorial near KusinaraOn arrival arranging his robe over one shoulder he placed his hands palmtopalm over his heart circumambulated the pyre uncovered the Blessed Ones feet and worshipped them with his headAnd the monks arranging their robes over one shoulder placed their hands palmtopalm over their hearts circumambulated the pyre and worshipped the Blessed Ones feet with their headsAs soon as it had been worshipped by VenMaha Kassapa and the monks the Blessed Ones pyre caught fire of its own accordIn the burning of the Blessed Ones body no cinder or ash of the outer skin inner skin flesh tendons or oil of the joints could be discernedOnly the bonerelics remainedJust as in the burning of ghee or oil no cinder or ash can be discerned in the same way in the burning of the Blessed Ones body no cinder or ash of the outer skin inner skin flesh tendons or oil of the joints could be discernedOnly the bonerelics remainedAnd of the twinwrappings only two were burnt the innermost  the outermostWhen the Blessed Ones body was consumed a cascade of water fell from the sky extinguishing the Blessed Ones pyreWater shot up from a saltree as well extinguishing the Blessed Ones pyreThe Kusinara Mallans with all kinds of scented water extinguished the Blessed Ones pyreThen for seven days they kept the bonerelics in their assembly hall  setting them round with a lattice of spears surrounded by ramparts of bows  worshipping honoring respecting  venerating them with dances songs music garlands  scentsThen King Ajatasattu Vedehiputta of Magadha heard The Blessed One they say has been totally unbound in Kusinara So he sent an envoy to the Kusinara Mallans The Blessed One was a noble warriorI too am a noble warriorI deserve a share of the Blessed Ones bonerelicsI too will build a burial mound and hold a ceremony for themThe Licchavis of Vesali heard The Blessed One they say has been totally unbound in Kusinara So they sent an envoy to the Kusinara Mallans The Blessed One was a noble warriorWe too are noble warriorsWe deserve a share of the Blessed Ones bonerelicsWe too will build a burial mound and hold a ceremony for themThe Sakyans of Kapilavatthu heard The Blessed One they say has been totally unbound in Kusinara So they sent an envoy to the Kusinara Mallans The Blessed One was the greatest of our relativesWe deserve a share of the Blessed Ones bonerelicsWe too will build a burial mound and hold a ceremony for themThe Buliyans of Allakappa The Koliyans of Ramagama heard The Blessed One they say has been totally unbound in Kusinara So they sent an envoy to the Kusinara Mallans The Blessed One was a noble warriorWe too are noble warriorsWe deserve a share of the Blessed Ones bonerelicsWe too will build a burial mound and hold a ceremony for themThe Brahman of Vetha Island heard The Blessed One they say has been totally unbound in Kusinara So he sent an envoy to the Kusinara Mallans The Blessed One was a noble warriorI am a brahmanI deserve a share of the Blessed Ones bonerelicsI too will build a burial mound and hold a ceremony for themThe Pava Mallans heard The Blessed One they say has been totally unbound in Kusinara So they sent an envoy to the Kusinara Mallans The Blessed One was a noble warriorWe too are noble warriorsWe deserve a share of the Blessed Ones bonerelicsWe too will build a burial mound and hold a ceremony for themWhen this was said the Kusinara Mallans said to the groups  factions The Blessed One was totally unbound within the borders of our own townWe will not give up a share of the Blessed Ones bonerelicsWhen this was said Dona the brahman addressed the groups  factionsIn that case brahman you yourself divide the Blessed Ones bonerelics into eight equal sharesResponding As you say good sirs to the groups  factions Dona the brahman divided the Blessed Ones bonerelics into eight equal shares and then said to the groups  factions Good sirs give me this urnI will build a burial mound and hold a ceremony for the urn They gave him the urnThen the Moriyans of Pipphalivana heard The Blessed One they say has been totally unbound in Kusinara So they sent an envoy to the Kusinara Mallans The Blessed One was a noble warriorWe too are noble warriorsWe deserve a share of the Blessed Ones bonerelicsWe too will build a burial mound and hold a ceremony for themThere is no share of the Blessed Ones bonerelicsThey have been dividedTake the embers from here They took the embers from thereThen King Ajatasattu Vedehiputta of Magadha built a burial mound and held a ceremony for the Blessed Ones relics in RajagahaThe Licchavis of Vesali built a burial mound and held a ceremony for the Blessed Ones relics in VesaliThe Sakyans of Kapilavattu built a burial mound and held a ceremony for the Blessed Ones relics in KapilavattuThe Buliyans of Allakappa built a burial mound and held a ceremony for the Blessed Ones relics in AllakappaThe Koliyans of Ramagama built a burial mound and held a ceremony for the Blessed Ones relics in RamagamaThe brahman of Vettha Island built a burial mound and held a ceremony for the Blessed Ones relics on Vettha IslandThe Pava Mallans built a burial mound and held a ceremony for the Blessed Ones relics in PavaThe Kusinara Mallans built a burial mound and held a ceremony for the Blessed Ones relics in KusinaraDona the brahman built a burial mound and held a ceremony for the urnThe Moriyans of Pipphalivana built a burial mound and held a ceremony for the embers in PipphalivanaThus there were eight burial mounds for the bonerelics a ninth for the urn and a tenth for the embersThat is how it was in the pastIt is sometimes assumed based on a passage in SN that the Pali canon is uniformly negative toward this aspect of Buddhist traditionThere VenVakkali who is ill states that For a long time have I wanted to come  see the Blessed One but I havent had the bodily strength to do so and the Buddha comforts him Enough VakkaliWhy do you want to see this filthy bodyWhoever sees the Dhamma sees me whoever sees me sees the Dhamma It should be noted however that the Buddhas treatment of this topic is sensitive to the contextIn SN he is talking to a monk who is too sick to come see the Buddha on his own strength and is on the verge of arahantshipHere in DN however the Buddha dismisses VenUpavana so as to honor the desire of the devas who want to see him in his last hour and he sends VenAnanda into Kusinara to inform the lay people there so that they too will be able to see him in his last hourHis motive here may be similar to that given for encouraging the building of a burial mound dedicated to him seeing him will help human  heavenly beings brighten their minds and that will be for their longterm welfare  happinessThus the attitudes expressed on this topic in the Pali canon when taken in their entirety are more complex than is generally recognizedThus have I heardOn one occasion the Blessed One was living in the abode of Alavaka the Yakkha at AlaviThen Alavaka approached the Blessed One and said Get out recluse  Very well friend so saying the Blessed One went outCome in recluse  Very well friend so saying the Blessed One enteredGet out recluse said Alavaka to the Blessed One a second time Very well friend so saying the Blessed One went outCome in recluse  Very well friend so saying the Blessed One enteredGet out recluse said Alavaka to the Blessed One a third time Very well friend so saying the Blessed One went outCome in recluse  Very well friend so saying the Blessed One enteredGet out recluse said Alavaka to the Blessed One a fourth time No O friend I will not get outDo what you willI will ask you a question recluseIf you do not answer me I will confound your mind or cleave your heart or take you by your feet and fling you over to the further shore of the oceanWell friend I do not see anyone in the world of Devas Maras Brahmas or among the generation of recluses brahmanas deities and humans who could either confound my mind or cleave my heart or take me by the feet and fling me over to the further shore of the ocean nevertheless friend ask what you willThen Alavaka addressed the Blessed One in verseHaving thus spoken Alavaka said to the Blessed OneMost excellent O Gotama is thy teaching most excellentJust as a man would set upright what is overturned reveal what is concealed point out the way to one gone astray bring an oil lamp into the darkness so that those with eyes could see objects even so the Dhamma has been declared in many a manner by the Venerable GotamaI take refuge in the Venerable Gotama in the Dhamma and in the SanghaMay the Venerable Gotama accept me as a disciple who has taken refuge from this day forth while life lastsWhile the Buddha was staying at Savatthi a band of monks having received subjects of meditation from the master proceeded to a forest to spend the rainy seasonThe tree deities inhabiting this forest were worried by their arrival as they had to descend from tree abodes and dwell on the groundThey hoped however the monks would leave soon but finding that the monks would stay the vassana period of three months harassed them in diverse ways during the night with the intention of scaring them awayLiving under such conditions being impossible the monks went to the Master and informed him of their difficultiesThereon the Buddha instructed them in the Metta sutta and advised their return equipped with this sutta for their protectionThe monks went back to the forest and practicing the instruction conveyed permeated the whole atmosphere with their radiant thoughts of metta or lovingkindnessThe deities so affected by this power of love henceforth allowed them to meditate in peaceThe discourse gets divided into two partsThe first detailing the standard of moral conduct required by one who wishes to attain Purity and Peace and the second the method of practice of mettaHe who is skilled in well being and who wishes to attain that state of Calm should act thus he should be dexterous upright exceedingly upright obedient gentle and humbleContented easily supportable with but few responsibilities of simple livelihood controlled in the senses prudent courteous and not hanker after association with familiesLet him not perform the slightest wrong for which wise men may rebuke himMay all beings be happy and safeMay they have happy mindsWhatever living beings there may be  feeble or strong long stout or of medium size short small large those seen or those unseen those dwelling far or near those who are born as well as those yet to be born  may all beings have happy mindsLet him not deceive another nor despise anyone anywhereIn anger or ill will let him not wish another illJust as a mother would protect her only child with her life even so let one cultivate a boundless love towards all beingsLet him radiate boundless love towards the entire world  above below and across  unhindered without ill will without enmityStanding walking sitting or reclining as long as he is awake let him develop this mindfulnessThis they say is Noble Living hereNot falling into wrong views  being virtuous endowed with insight lust in the senses discarded  verily never again will he return to conceive in a wombThus have I heardOn one occasion the Blessed One was living near Savatthi at Jetavana at Anathapindikas monasteryThen in the forenoon the Blessed One having dressed himself took bowl and robe and entered the city of Savatthi for almsNow at that time a fire was burning and an offering was being prepared in the house of the brahman AggikabharadvajaThen the Blessed One while on his alms round came to the brahmans residenceThe brahman seeing the Blessed One some way off said this Stay there you shaveling stay there you wretched monk stay there you outcast When he spoke thus the Blessed One said to the brahman Do you know brahman who an outcast is and what the conditions are that make an outcast No indeed Venerable Gotama I do not know who an outcast is nor the conditions that make an outcastIt is good if Venerable Gotama were to explain the Dhamma to me so that I may know who an outcast is and what the conditions are that make an outcastListen then brahman and pay attention I will speakYes Venerable Sir replied the brahmanWhosoever is angry harbors hatred and is reluctant to speak well of others perverted in views deceitful  know him as an outcastWhosoever in this world kills living beings once born or twice born in whom there is no sympathy for living beings  know him as an outcastWhosoever destroys and besieges villages and hamlets and becomes notorious as an oppressor  know him as an outcastBe it in the village or in the forest whosoever steals what belongs to others what is not given to him  know him as an outcastWhosoever having actually incurred a debt runs away when he is pressed to pay saying I owe no debt to you  know him as an outcastWhosoever coveting anything kills a person going along the road and grabs whatever that person has  know him as an outcastHe who for his own sake or for the sake of others or for the sake of wealth utters lies when questioned as a witness  know him as an outcastWhosoever by force or with consent associates with the wives of relatives or friends  know him as an outcastWhosoever being wealthy supports not his mother and father who have grown old  know him as an outcastWhosoever strikes and annoys by speech mother father brother sister or motherinlaw or fatherinlaw  know him as an outcastWhosoever when questioned about what is good says what is detrimental and talks in an evasive manner know him as an outcastWhosoever having committed an evil deed wishes that it may not be known to others and commits evil in secret  know him as an outcastWhosoever having gone to anothers house and partaken of choice food does not honor that host by offering food when he repays the visit  know him as an outcastWhosoever deceives by uttering lies a brahman or an ascetic or any other mendicant  know him as an outcastWhosoever when a brahman or ascetic appears during mealtime angers him by harsh speech and does not offer him  know him as an outcastWhosoever in this world shrouded in ignorance speaks harsh words or falsehood expecting to gain something  know him as an outcastWhosoever debased by his pride exalts himself and belittles other  know him as an outcastWhosoever is given to anger is miserly has base desires and is selfish deceitful shameless and fearless  know him as an outcastWhosoever reviles the Enlightened One or a disciple of the Buddha recluse or a householder  know him as an outcastWhosoever not being an arahant a Consummate One pretends to be so is a thief in the whole universe  he is the lowest of outcastsNot by birth is one an outcast not by birth is one a brahmanBy deed one becomes an outcast by deed one becomes a brahmanKnow ye by the example I now citeThere was an outcasts son Sopaka who became known as MatangaThis Matanga attained the highest fame so difficult to gainMany were the warriors and brahmans who went to attend on himMounting the celestial chariot along the passionfree high road reached the Brahma realm having given up sense desiresHis birth did not prevent him from being reborn in the Brahma realmThere are brahmans born in the family of preceptors kinsmen of hymnsThey are often seen committing evil deedsIn this life itself they are despised in the next they are born in an evil state of existenceHigh birth does not prevent them from falling into a woeful state or from censureNot by birth is one an outcast not by birth is one a brahmanBy deed one becomes an outcast by deed one becomes an brahmanWhen the Buddha had thus spoken the Brahman Aggikabharadvaja said to the Blessed One Excellent O Venerable Gotama excellentJust as O Venerable Gotama a man were to set upright what had been overturned or were to reveal what had been hidden or were to point the way to one who had gone astray or were to hold an oil lamp in the dark so that those with eyes may see things even so in many ways has the Venerable Gotama expounded the Dhamma the doctrineI take refuge in the Venerable Gotama the Dhamma and the Sangha the OrderMay the Venerable Gotama accept me as a lay follower who has taken refuge from this day onwards while life lastsThus have I heardOn one occasion the Blessed One was living at Dakkhinagiri in the brahmana village Ekanala in MagadhaNow at that time it being the sowing season five hundred plows of the brahman Kasibharadvaja were put to useThen in the forenoon the Blessed One having dressed himself took bowl and robe and went to the place where brahman Kasibharadvajas work was going onIt was the time of food distribution by the brahman and the Blessed One drew near and stood at one sideBharadvaja seeing the Blessed One standing there for alms said to himRecluse I do plow and do sow and having plowed and sown I eatYou also recluse should plow and sow having plowed and sown you should eatI too brahman plow and sow having plowed and sown I eatWe do not see the Venerable Gotamas yoke or plow or plowshare or goad or oxenNevertheless the Venerable Gotama says I too brahman plow and sow having plowed and sown I eat Thereupon the brahman addressed the Blessed One in a stanzaYou profess to be a plowman yet your plow we do not see asked about your plow and the rest tell us of them that we may knowFaith is my seed austerity the rain wisdom my yoke and plow modesty is the pole mind the strap mindfulness is my plowshare and goadControlled in speech and conduct guarded in deed and speech abstemious in food I make truth my weed cutter arahantship my deliverance completeExertion my team in yoke draws me to Nibbanas security and on it goes without stopping wither gone one does not sufferThuswise is this plowing plowed which bears the fruit of Deathlessness having plowed this plowing one is freed from every illThen brahman Kasibharadvaja filling a golden bowl with milkrice offered it to the Blessed One saying May the Venerable Gotama partake of this milk rice a plowman indeed is Venerable Gotama who plows a plow for the fruit of DeathlessnessWhat I receive by reciting verses O brahman I should not eatIt is not the tradition of those who practice right livelihoodThe Buddhas reject what is received by reciting versesThis brahman is the conduct as long as Dhamma reignsTo those wholly consummate taintless and welldisciplined great sages should thou offer other food and drink sure field is that for meritseeking menTo whom then Venerable Gotama shall I give this milk riceBrahman in the world of Devas Maras and Brahmas or among the generation of recluses brahmanas deities and humans there is no one by whom this milk rice if eaten could be wholly digested except by the Tathagata or the disciple of a TathagataTherefore brahman either cast this milk rice where there is no grass or into water where there are no living creaturesThereupon the brahman flung that milk rice into water where there were no living creatures and the milk rice thrown into the water smoked and steamed making the noise cicchita citicita just like a plowshare heated during the day when thrown into water smokes and steams making the noise cicchita citicitaThen the brahman Kasibharadvaja alarmed with hair standing on end approached and fell with his head at the Blessed Ones feet and said as followsMost excellent O Gotama is thy teaching most excellentJust as a man would set upright what is overturned reveal what is concealed point out the way to one gone astray bring an oil lamp into the darkness so that those with eyes could see objects even so the Dhamma has been declared in many a manner by the Venerable GotamaI take refuge in the Venerable Gotama in the Dhamma and in the SanghaI wish to receive the novices ordination and higher ordinationBrahman Kasibharadvaja duly received both the pabbajja and upasampada from the Blessed OneNot long after his upasampada the Venrable Bharadvaja dwelling alone and aloof diligent strenuous and resolute ere long by his own insight here and now realized and attained the highest perfection the end of the Noble Life  for the sake of which men of good family go forth from home to live the homeless lifeBirth is destroyed lived is the noble life done is what has to be done there is no more of this stateThe Venerable Bharadvaja became one of the arahantsThus have I heardOn one occasion the Blessed One was living near Savatthi at Jetavana at Anathapindikas monasteryNow when the night was far advanced a certain deity whose surpassing radiance illuminated the whole of Jetavana came to the presence of the Blessed One respectfully saluted him and stood beside himStanding thus he addressed the Blessed One in verseAbout the declining man we question thee GotamaWe have come to ask the Blessed One What is the cause of his downfallEasily known is the progressive one easily known is the declining oneThe lover of the Dhamma prospersThe hater of the Dhamma declinesWe understand this as explained this is the first cause of his downfallTell us the second O Blessed OneWhat is the cause of his downfallThe vicious are dear to himHe likes not the virtuous he approves the teachings of the illnatured  this is the cause of his downfallWe understand this as explained by thee this is the second cause of his downfallTell us the third O Blessed OneWhat is the cause of his downfallThe man who is fond of sleep and company inactive and lazy and manifesting anger this is the cause of his downfallWe understand this as explained by thee this is the third cause of his downfallTell us the fourth O Blessed OneWhat is the cause of his downfallWhoever being affluent does not support his mother and father who are old and past their prime  this is the cause of his downfallWe understand this as explained by thee this is the fourth cause of his downfallTell us the fifth O Blessed OneWhat is the cause of his downfallWhoever by falsehood deceives either a brahmana or a samana or any other mendicant  this is the cause of his downfallWe understand this as explained by thee this is the fifth cause of his downfallTell us the six O Blessed OneWhat is the cause of his downfallThe person who is possessed of much wealth who has gold and who has an abundance of food but enjoys his delicacies all by himself  this is the cause of his downfallWe understand this as explained by thee this is the sixth cause of his downfallTell us the seventh O Blessed OneWhat is the cause of his downfallThe man who proud of his birth of his wealth and of his clan despises his relations  this is the cause of his downfallWe understand this as explained by thee this is the seventh cause of his downfallTell us the eighth O Blessed OneWhat is the cause of his downfallThe man who is addicted to women is a drunkard a gambler and a squanderer of his earnings  this is the cause of his downfallWe understand this as explained by thee this is the eighth cause of his downfallTell us the ninth O Blessed OneWhat is the cause of his downfallNot satisfied with ones own wives he is seen among the whores and the wives of others  this is the cause of his downfallWe understand this as explained by thee this is the ninth cause of his downfallTell us the tenth O Blessed OneWhat is the cause of his downfallA person past his youth takes as wife a girl in her teens and sleeps not being jealous of her  this is the cause of his downfallWe understand this as explained by thee this is the tenth cause of his downfallTell us the eleventh O Blessed OneWhat is the cause of his downfallHe who places in authority a woman given to drink and squandering or a man of similar nature  this is the cause of his downfallWe understand this as explained by thee this is the eleventh cause of his downfallTell us the twelfth O Blessed OneWhat is the cause of his downfallHe who having but little possessions but great ambition is of warrior birth and aspires selfishly to sovereignty  this is the cause of his downfallFully realizing these causes of downfall in the world the sage endowed with ariyan insight shares a realm of securityThe occasion for this discourse in brief according to the commentary is as follows The city of Vesali was afflicted by a famine causing death especially to the poor folkDue to the presence of decaying corpses the evil spirits began to haunt the city this was followed by a pestilencePlagued by these three fears of famine nonhuman beings and pestilence the citizens sought the help of the Buddha who was then living at RajagahaFollowed by a large number of monks including the Venerable Ananda his attendant disciple the Buddha came to the city of VesaliWith the arrival of the Master there were torrential rains which swept away the putrefying corpsesThe atmosphere became purified the city was cleanThereupon the Buddha delivered this Jewel Discourse to the Venerable Ananda and gave him instructions as to how he should tour the city with the Licchavi citizens reciting the discourse as a mark of protection to the people of VesaliThe Venerable Ananda followed the instructions and sprinkled the sanctified water from the Buddhas own alms bowlAs a consequence the evil spirits were exorcised the pestilence subsidedThereafter the Venerable Ananda returned with the citizens of Vesali to the Public hall where the Buddha and his disciples had assembled awaiting his arrivalThere the Buddha recited the same Jewel Discourse to the gatheringWhatever beings are assembled here terrestrial or celestial may they all have peace of mind and may they listen attentively to these wordsO beings listen closelyMay you all radiate lovingkindness to those human beings who by day and night bring offerings to youWherefore protect them with diligenceWhatever treasure there be either here or in the world beyond whatever precious jewel there be in the heavenly worlds there is nought comparable to the TathagataThis precious jewel is the

living in the Pipphali Cave was afflicted with a disease was suffering therefrom and was gravely illThen the Blessed One arising from his solitude at eventide visited the Venerable Maha Kassapa and sat down on a seat made readyThus seated the Blessed One spoke to the Venerable Maha KassapaWell Kassapa how is it with youAre you bearing up are you enduringDo your pains decrease or increaseAre there signs of your pains decreasing and not of increasingNo VenSir I am not bearing up I am not enduring the pain is very greatThere is a sign not of pains decreasing but of their increasingKassapa

Kassapa are well expounded by me and are cultivated and fully developed by meThey conduce to perfect understanding to full realization and to NibbanaMost assuredly O Blessed One they are factor of enlightenmentMost assuredly O Welcome Being they are factors of enlightenmentThus said the Buddha and the Venerable Maha Kassapa glad at heart approved the utterances of the BuddhaThereupon the Venerable Kassapa recovered from that affliction and that affliction of the Venerable Kassapa disappearedOne time the Buddha was staying near Savatthi in Jetas grove at the garden of AnathapindikaAt that time he was seated under the open sky on a night of blinding darkness while oil lamps were burningAnd also at that time a great number of winged insects were flying around and falling into those oil lamps thus meeting with misfortune meeting with ruin meeting with both misfortune and ruinThe Buddha saw those great number of winged insects flying around and falling into those oil lamps And then the Buddha understanding the meaning of this gave utterance  at that moment  to this profound utteranceThis is a wonderful example of the Buddha using whatever situation presents itself as an opportunity for teaching and his remarks as usual can be taken on many different levelsThe insects are drawn irresistibly in the dark night to the shining lamps but in their zeal to approach the light they go too far and only meet their doomHumans likewise are drawn to the pleasures of the senses to what is seen and heard not realizing the dangers involvedWhen we get too close  when we hold on with too much attachment  we get burned by sufferingThe senses can still be enjoyed as the moth can stay circling the flame but only when one holds the proper distanceThis quality of stepping back or standing off from obsession with the senses is something that is cultivated with the practice of mindfulness meditationBut the fire can also be taken as a symbol of wisdomWe are naturally drawn to the light of truth to the teachings of the Buddha for example but must take care not to overshoot the markGetting too attached to views even if these views are correct can also lead to harm and the strengthening of bondageThe word translated here as point is sara which can mean the heart the essence or the crux of somethingThe subtle idea that seems to be expressed is that rushing or running will never reveal what is essential  the pith can never be approached headlongWhat is needed is the tranquility of mind that meditation brings and the ability to keep even wisdom in proper perspectiveThe passage is in the form of an Udana a solemn utterance and is in the tristubh meter of eleven syllables per lineThe order of the last two lines has been rearranged in translation to better reflect the syntax of EnglishThis tender poem of loss and recovery was composed by Patacara one of the leading women of the Buddhas order of nunsBorn the daughter of a wealthy banker Patacara fell in love with one of her fathers servants and ran off to live happily with him in a forest hamletThen through a series of tragic accidents she lost first her husband then two sons and finally her parents and brotherWandering destitute naked and mad with grief she in time met the Buddha face to face who showed her kindness when others would scorn herShe heard his teaching joined the order of nuns and went on to become one of the arahants or worthy onesPatacara helped many other women who were overcome by grief regain their sanity and quench the pain of their lossThe meter of the verse is based on eight syllables per line and there is an interesting wordplay in the fourth stanzaThe latter part of the phrase As he has come so has he gone corresponds to the word Tathagata  a favorite epithet of the BuddhaThis is a portion of a poem attributed to Talaputa a famous performer before joining the Buddhas sangha and undertaking the training of his mind for liberationSome people have said that the Theravada tradition shows little recognition of nature but these and many other verses in the Theragatha reveal a poignant appreciation of natures beautyThe forests and hills were favorite resorts of the Buddha and his followers and the wilderness was considered the most suitable setting for silent meditationAs the Buddha was so fond of sayingThus have I heardOn one occasion the Blessed One was living in the Deer Park at Isipatana near VaranasiThen he addressed the group of five monksMonks these two extremes ought not to be practiced by one who has gone forth from the household lifeThere is addiction to indulgence of sensepleasures which is low coarse the way of ordinary people unworthy and unprofitable and there is addiction to selfmortification which is painful unworthy and unprofitableAvoiding both these extremes the Tathagata has realized the Middle Path it gives vision gives knowledge and leads to calm to insight to enlightenment and to NibbanaAnd what is that Middle Path realized by the TathagataIt is the Noble Eightfold path and nothing else namely right understanding right thought right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness and right concentrationThis is the Middle Path realized by the Tathagata which gives vision which gives knowledge and leads to calm to insight to enlightenment and to NibbanaThe Noble Truth of Suffering monks is this Birth is suffering aging is suffering sickness is suffering death is suffering association with the unpleasant is suffering dissociation from the pleasant is suffering not to receive what one desires is suffering  in brief the five aggregates subject to grasping are sufferingThe Noble Truth of the Origin of Suffering is this It is this craving which produces rebecoming accompanied by passionate greed and finding fresh delight now here and now there namely craving for sense pleasure craving for existence and craving for nonexistenceThe Noble Truth of the Cessation of Suffering is this It is the complete cessation of that very craving giving it up relinquishing it liberating oneself from it and detaching oneself from itThe Noble Truth of the Path Leading to the Cessation of Suffering is this It is the Noble Eightfold Path and nothing else namely right understanding right thought right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness and right concentrationThis is the Noble Truth of Suffering such was the vision the knowledge the wisdom the science the light that arose in me concerning things not heard beforeThis suffering as a noble truth should be fully realized such was the vision the knowledge the wisdom the science the light that arose in me concerning things not heard beforeThis suffering as a noble truth has been fully realized such was the vision the knowledge the wisdom the science the light that arose in me concerning things not heard beforeThis is the Noble Truth of the Origin of Suffering

heard beforeThis Path leading to the cessation of suffering as a noble truth should be developed such was the vision the knowledge the wisdom the science the light that arose in me concerning things not heard beforeThis Path leading to the cessation of suffering as a noble truth has been developed such was the vision the knowledge the wisdom the science the light that arose in me concerning things not heard beforeAs long as my knowledge of seeing things as they really are was not quite clear in these three aspects in these twelve ways concerning the Four Noble Truths I did not claim to have realized the matchless supreme Enlightenment in this world with its gods with its Maras and Brahmas in this generation with its recluses and brahmanas with its Devas and humansBut when my knowledge of seeing things as they really are was quite clear in these three aspects in these twelve ways concerning the Four Noble Truths then I claimed to have realized the matchless supreme Enlightenment in this world with its gods with its Maras and Brahmas in this generation with its recluses and brahmanas with its Devas and humansAnd a vision of insight arose in me thus Unshakable is the deliverance of my heartThis is the last birthNow there is no more rebecoming This the Blessed One saidThe group of five monks was glad and they rejoiced at the words of the Blessed OneWhen this discourse was thus expounded there arose in the Venerable Kondañña the passionfree stainless vision of Truth dhammacakkhu in other words he attained sotapatti the first stage of sanctity and realized Whatever has the nature of arising has the nature of ceasingNow when the Blessed One set in motion the Wheel of Truth the Bhummattha devas proclaimed The Matchless Wheel of Truth that cannot be set in motion by recluse brahmana deva Mara Brahma or any one in the world is set in motion by the Blessed One in the Deer Park at Isipatana near VaranasiHearing these words of the earth deities all the Catummaharajika devas proclaimed The Matchless Wheel of Truth that cannot be set in motion by recluse brahmana deva Mara Brahma or any one in the world is set in motion by the Blessed One in the Deer Park at Isipatana near Varanasi These words were heard in the upper deva realms and from Catummaharajika it was proclaimed in Tavatimsa Yama Tusita Nimmanarati Paranimmitavasavatti and the Brahmas of Brahma Parisajja Brahma Purohita Maha Brahma Parittabha Appamanabha Abhassara Parittasubha Appamana subha Subhakinna Vehapphala Aviha Atappa Sudassa Sudassi and in Akanittha The Matchless Wheel of Truth that cannot be set in motion by recluse brahmana deva Mara Brahma or any one in the world is set in motion by the Blessed One in the Deer Park at Isipatana near VaranasiThus at that very moment at that instant the cry spread as far as Brahma realm the system of ten thousand worlds trembled and quaked and shookA boundless sublime radiance surpassing the effulgence of devas appeared in the worldThen the Blessed One uttered this paean of joy Verily Kondañña has realized verily Kondañña has realized Thus it was that the Venerable Kondañña received the name Añña Knondañña  Kondañña who realizesANreports a discussion among several elder monks as to what is meant in this poem by both sides and in between Six of the elders express the following separate opinionsThe issue is then taken to the Buddha who states that all six interpretations are wellspoken but the interpretation he had in mind when speaking the poem was the firstThe BuddhaOn one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Rajagaha in the Bamboo Grove the Squirrels SanctuaryThen Talaputa the head of an acting troupe went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one sideAs he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One Lord I have heard that it has been passed down by the ancient teaching lineage of actors that When an actor on the stage in the midst of a festival makes people laugh  gives them delight with his imitation of reality then with the breakup of the body after death he is reborn in the company of the laughing devas What does the Blessed One have to say about thatEnough headman put that asideDont ask me thatA second time A third time Talaputa the head of an acting troupe said Lord I have heard that it has been passed down by the ancient teaching lineage of actors that When an actor on the stage in the midst of a festival makes people laugh  gives them delight with his imitation of reality then with the breakup of the body after death he is reborn in the company of the laughing devas What does the Blessed One have to say about thatApparently headman I havent been able to get past you by saying Enough headman put that asideDont ask me that So I will simply answer youAny beings who are not devoid of passion to begin with who are bound by the bond of passion focus with even more passion on things inspiring passion presented by an actor on stage in the midst of a festivalAny beings who are not devoid of aversion to begin with who are bound by the bond of aversion focus with even more aversion on things inspiring aversion presented by an actor on stage in the midst of a festivalAny beings who are not devoid of delusion to begin with who are bound by the bond of delusion focus with even more delusion on things inspiring delusion presented by an actor on stage in the midst of a festivalThus the actor  himself intoxicated  heedless having made others intoxicated  heedless  with the breakup of the body after death is reborn in what is called the hell of laughterBut if he holds such a view as this When an actor on the stage in the midst of a festival makes people laugh  gives them delight with his imitation of reality then with the breakup of the body after death he is reborn in the company of the laughing devas that is his wrong viewNow there are two destinations for a person with wrong view I tell you either hell or the animal wombWhen this was said Talaputa the head of an acting troupe sobbed  burst into tearsThat is what I couldnt get past you by saying Enough headman put that asideDont ask me that Im not crying lord because of what the Blessed One said to me but simply because I have been deceived cheated  fooled for a long time by that ancient teaching lineage of actors who said When an actor on the stage in the midst of a festival makes people laugh  gives them delight with his imitation of reality then with the breakup of the body after death he is reborn in the company of the laughing devasMagnificent lordMagnificentJust as if he were to place upright what was overturned to reveal what was hidden to show the way to one who was lost or to carry a lamp into the dark so that those with eyes could see forms in the same way has the Blessed One  through many lines of reasoning  made the Dhamma clearI go to the Blessed One for refuge to the Dhamma and to the Community of monksMay the Blessed One remember me as a lay follower who has gone to him for refuge from this day forward for lifeSee also SNAs Subha the nun was going through Jivakas delightful mango grove a libertine blocked her path so

bright shiny bowlThe proper thing for you Nanda is to be a forestdweller to go for alms in ragged robes dwelling aloof from sensedesires After that the Venerable Nanda became a forestdweller going for

of dung gorged with dung with a huge pile of dung in front of me In the same way there is the case where a certain monk  conquered by gains offerings  fame his mind consumed  puts on his robes and carrying his bowl  outer robe goes into a village or town for almsHaving eaten there as much as he likes  full of almsfood  invited again for the next day  he goes to the monastery and in the midst of

illnessThese other monks though have next to no merit next to no influenceThey arent recipients of robes almsfood lodgings  medicinal requisites for curing illness Conquered by gains offerings  fame his mind consumed he looks down on other wellbehaved monksThat will be for this worthless mans longterm suffering  harmThats how cruel gains offerings  fame are a harsh bitter obstacle to the attainment of the unexcelled rest from bondageThus you should train yourselves We will put aside any gains offerings  fame that have arisen and we will not let any gains offerings  fame that have arisen keep our minds consumed Thats how you should train yourselvesSee also SN SNA fatal thing monks are gains favors and fame a bitter harsh impediment to the attainment of the unsurpassed freedom from bondageIt is just like a beetle feeding on dung full of dung gorged with dung standing before a great dunghill who might despise other beetles saying I am a dungeater full of dung gorged with dung and before me is this great dunghillIn the same way monks if some monk is overwhelmed with gains favors and fame so that his head is turned so having risen early and taken his robe and bowl and gone for alms to the village or market town he eats his fill gets invited again for next day and has a full bowlThen he goes to the monks park and boasts in the midst of the assembled monks I have had a good meal and I am invited again for tomorrowMy bowl is fullI have got a robe alms lodgings and medical requisitesBut these other monks have little merit and little influence they do not get requisites Thus this bhikkhu who is so overwhelmed with gains favors and fame that his head is turned despises other wellbehaved bhikkhusBut this will bring harm and sorrow to that wretched man for many a long dayThat shows you monks how disastrous gains favors and fame are what a bitter harsh impediment to the attainment of the unsurpassed freedom from bondageTherefore monks you should train yourselves thus Whatever gains favors and fame may come our way we will reject lest it turn our heads So monks you should train yourselvesWhat is the reason Lord and depending on what conditions is it that formerly there were fewer precepts yet more monks attained enlightenmentWhat is the reason Lord and depending on what conditions is it that nowadays there are more precepts and fewer monks attain enlightenmentIt is like this KassapaWhen beings are in decline and the true Dhamma is waning then there are more precepts and fewer monks attain enlightenmentBut there is no disappearance of the true Dhamma Kassapa till a counterfeit Dhamma arises in the world but when a counterfeit Dhamma arises then there is a disappearance of the true Dhamma just as there is no disappearing of gold so long as no counterfeit gold has arisen in the world The earthelement does not make the true Dhamma disappear the waterelement the fireelement the airelement But right here men of straw appear and it is they who bring about the disappearance of the true DhammaA ship Kassapa may sink all at once but it is not thus that the true Dhamma disappearsThere are five contributory factors Kassapa which lead to the adulteration and disappearance of the true DhammaWhich fiveIt is when monks and nuns male and female layfollowers behave disrespectfully and rebelliously towards the Teacher towards the Dhamma towards the Sangha towards the training towards meditationBut when monks and nuns male and female lay followers behave respectfully and deferentially towards the Dhamma towards the Sangha towards the training towards meditation then these five things conduce to the maintenance the purity and the preservation of the true DhammaOn one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Savatthi in Jetas Grove Anathapindikas monasteryThen VenMaha Kassapa went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one sideAs he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One What is the cause lord what is the reason why before there were fewer training rules and yet more monks established in final gnosis whereas now there are more training rules and yet fewer monks established in final gnosisThats the way it is KassapaWhen beings are degenerating and the true Dhamma is disappearing there are more training rules and yet fewer monks established in final gnosisThere is no disappearance of the true Dhamma as long as a counterfeit of the true Dhamma has not arisen in the world but there is the disappearance of the true Dhamma when a counterfeit of the true Dhamma has arisen in the worldJust as there is no disappearance of gold as long as a counterfeit of gold has not arisen in the world but there is the disappearance of gold when a counterfeit of gold has arisen in the world in the same way there is no disappearance of the true Dhamma as long as a counterfeit of the true Dhamma has not arisen in the world but there is the disappearance of the true Dhamma when a counterfeit

that for a long time I have lived in the wilderness and have extolled living in the wilderness that I have kept my persistence aroused and have extolled having persistence aroused seeing a pleasant abiding for myself in the here  now and feeling sympathy for later generations Perhaps later generations will take it as an example It seems that the disciples of the Awakened One and those who

without ardor and without taking care one is unable to gain enlightenment unable to gain Nibbaana unable to gain relief from bondage but that with ardor with taking care enlightenment can be gainedWhen friend a monk thinks Evil and unskilled states that have not arisen would if they were to arise be to my detriment and he does not arouse ardor when he thinks Evil and unskilled states that

that without ardor without taking care one is unable to gain enlightenment unable to gain Nibbaana unable to gain relief from bondageAnd how friend is one ardentWhen a monk thinks Evil and unskilled states Skilled states  this friend is arousing ardorThus it is friend that by arousing ardor and taking care one is able to gain enlightenment to gain Nibbaana to gain relief from bondageMonks Kassapa here is content with any old robeHe praises contentment with any robe nor does he commit any offense of unseemliness or impropriety on account of a robeIf he has not got a robe he does not worry if he

whatever lodging whatever requisites in the way of medicines for sickness he enjoys the use of these things without clinging or foolish attachment not committing any offense aware of the danger and

with the analogy of the extinguished fireThere is every reason to believe that in choosing this analogy he was referring to a concept of fire familiar to his listeners and as they had been educated in the Vedic tradition that he probably had the Vedic concept of fire in mindThis of course is not to say that he himself adhered to the Vedic concept or that he was referring to it in all its detailsHe was simply drawing on a particular aspect of fire as seen in the Vedas so that his listeners could have a familiar reference point for making sense of what he was sayingNow although the Vedic texts contain several different theories concerning the physics of fire there is at least one basic point on which they agree Fire even when not manifest continues to exist in a latent formThe Vedic view of all physical phenomena is that they are the manifestation of preexistent potencies inherent in natureEach type of phenomenon has its corresponding potency which has both personal  impersonal characteristics as a god and as the powers he wieldsIn the case of fire both the god  the phenomenon are called AgniAgni who is generated being produced by men through the agency of sahasSahas here is the potency the power of subjugation wielded by Agni himselfJan Gonda in discussing this passage comments The underlying theory must have been that a man and his physical strength are by no means able to produce a god or potency of Agnis rankOnly the cooperation or conjunction of that special principle which seems to have been central in the descriptions of Agnis character his power of subjugation his overwhelming power can lead to the result desired the appearance of sparks and the generation of fire Further a divine being like Agni was in a way already preexistent when being generated by a pair of kindling sticksAs fire burns Agni continues entering into the fireScattered in many places  as many separate fires  he is nevertheless one  the same thingOther fires are attached to him as branches to a treeWhen fire is extinguished Agni and his powers do not pass out of existenceInstead they go into hidingThis point is expressed in a myth mentioned frequently in the Vedic texts of Agnis trying to hide himself from the other gods in places where he thought they would never perceive himIn the version told in RV the gods finally find the hidden Agni as an embryo in the water Great was the membrane  firm that enveloped you when you entered the waters We searched for you in various places O Agni knower of creatures when you had entered into the waters  plantsAs Chauncey Blair notes The concept of Agni in the waters does not imply destruction of AgniHe is merely a hidden a potential Agni and no less capable of powerful actionThe implications of Agnis being an embryo are best understood in light of the theories of biological generation held in ancient IndiaThe husband after having entered his wife becomes an embryo and is born again of her Laws of ManuJust as ancient Indians saw an underlying identity connecting a father  his offspring so too did they perceive a single identity underlying the manifest  embryonic forms of fireIn this way Agni repeatedly reborn was seen as immortal and in fact the Vedas attribute immortality to him more frequently than to any other of the godsTo you immortalWhen you spring to life all the gods sing for joy By your powers they were made immortal who extended himself over all the worlds is the protector of immortalityNot only immortal but also omnipresent Agni in his manifest form is present in all three levels of the cosmos  heaven air  earth  as sun lightning  flamefireAs for his latent presence he states in the myth of his hiding my bodies entered various places a survey of the Vedas reveals a wide variety of places where his embryos may be foundSome of them  such as stone wood plants  kindling sticks  relate directly to the means by which fire is kindled  fueledOthers relate more to firelike qualities  powers such as brilliance  vitality present in water plants animals  all beingsIn the final analysis Agni fills the entire universe as the latent embryo of growth  vitalityAs Raimundo Panikkar writes Agni is one of the most comprehensive symbols of the reality that is allencompassingAgni pervades  decks the heaven  earth his forms are scattered everywhereHe who is the embryo of waters embryo of woods embryo of all things that move  do not moveIn plants  herbs in all existent beings I have deposited the embryo of increaseI have engendered all progeny on earth and sons in women hereafterYou have filled earth heaven  the air between and follow the whole cosmos like a shadowWe call upon the sage with holy verses Agni Vaiśvānara the everbeaming who has surpassed both heaven  earth in greatnessHe is a god below a god above usThis view that Agnifire in a latent state is immortal  omnipresent occurs also in the Upaniṣads that were composed circa  Band later accepted into the Vedic CanonThe authors of these texts use this view to illustrate by way of analogy the doctrines of a unitary identity immanent in all things and of the immortality of the soul in spite of apparent deathNow the light that shines higher than this heaven on the backs of all on the backs of everything in the highest worlds than which there are no higher  truly that is the same as the light here within a personThere is this hearing of it  when one closes ones ears and hears a sound a roar as of a fire blazingTruly this Brahma shines when fire blazes and disappears when it does not blazeIts brilliance goes to the sun its vital breath to the windThis Brahma shines when the sun is seen and disappears when it is not seenIts brilliance goes to the moon its vital breath to the windTruly all these divinities having entered into wind do not perish when they die in the wind indeed from there they come forth againIn the major noncanonical Upaniṣads  whose period of composition is believed to overlap with the time of the Buddha  the analogy is even more explicitOne interesting development in this stratum of the Vedic literature is the positive sense in which it comes to regard extinguished fireThe Vedic hymns  earlier Upaniṣads saw burning fire as a positive force the essence of life  vitalityThese texts though see the tranquility  inactivity of the extinguished fire as an ideal image for the souls desired destinationWhether this reevaluation of the image of fire  seeing its extinguishing as preferable to its burning  predated the founding of Buddhism was influenced by it or simply paralleled it no one can say for sure as there are no firm dates for any of the UpaniṣadsAt any rate in both stages of the Vedic attitude toward fire the thought of a fire going out carried no connotations of going out of existence at allInstead it implied a return to an omnipresent immortal stateThis has led some scholars to assume that in using the image of an extinguished fire to illustrate the goal he taught the Buddha was simply adopting the Vedic position wholesale and meant it to carry the same implications as the last quotation above a pleasant eternal existence for a tranquil soulBut when we look at how the Buddha actually used the image of extinguished fire in his teachings we find that he approached the Vedic idea of latent fire from another angle entirely If latent fire is everywhere all at once it is nowhere in particularIf it is conceived as always present in everything it has to be so loosely defined that it has no defining characteristics nothing by which it might be known at allThus instead of using the subsistence of latent fire as an image for immortality he uses the diffuse indeterminate nature of extinguished fire as understood by the Vedists to illustrate the absolute indescribability of the person who has reached the Buddhist goalBut Venerable Gotama the monk whose mind is thus released Where does he reappear Reappear Vaccha doesnt applyIn that case Venerable Gotama he does not reappear Does not reappear Vaccha doesnt applyboth does  does not reappeardoesnt applyneither does nor does not reappeardoesnt applyAt this point Venerable Gotama I am befuddled at this point confusedThe modicum of clarity coming to me from your earlier conversation is now obscuredOf course youre befuddled VacchaOf course youre confusedDeep Vaccha is this phenomenon hard to see hard to realize tranquil refined beyond the scope of conjecture subtle tobeexperienced by the wiseFor those with other views other practices other satisfactions other aims other teachers it is difficult to knowThat being the case I will now put some questions to youAnswer as you see fitHow do you construe this Vaccha If a fire were burning in front of you would you know that This fire is burning in front of meyesAnd suppose someone were to ask you Vaccha This fire burning in front of you dependent on what is it burning Thus asked how would you replyI would reply This fire burning in front of me is burning dependent on grass  timber as its sustenanceIf the fire burning in front of you were to go out would you know that This fire burning in front of me has gone outyesAnd suppose someone were to ask you This fire that has gone out in front of you in which direction from here has it goneEastWestNorthOr south Thus asked how would you replyThat doesnt apply Venerable GotamaAny fire burning dependent on a sustenance of grass  timber being unnourished  from having consumed that sustenance and not being offered any other  is classified simply as outEven so Vaccha any form by which one describing the Tathāgata would describe him That the Tathāgata has abandoned its root destroyed made like a palmyra stump deprived of the conditions of existence not destined for future arisingFreed from the classification of form Vaccha the Tathāgata is deep boundless hardtofathom like the seaReappears doesnt applyDoes not reappear doesnt applyBoth does  does not reappear doesnt applyNeither reappears nor does not reappear doesnt applyAny feeling Any perception Any fabricationAny consciousness by which one describing the Tathāgata would describe him That the Tathāgata has abandoned Freed from the classification of consciousness Vaccha the Tathāgata is deep boundless hardtofathom like the seaThe person who has attained the goal is thus indescribable because heshe has abandoned all things by which heshe could be describedThis point is asserted in even more thoroughgoing fashion in a pair of dialogues where two inexperienced monks who have attempted to describe the state of the Tathāgata after death are crossexamined on the matter by Sāriputta  the Buddha himselfSāriputta How do you construe this my friend Yamaka Do you regard form as the TathāgataYamaka No friendSāriputta Do you regard feeling as the TathāgataYamaka No friendSāriputta perceptionYamaka No friendSāriputta fabricationsYamaka No friendSāriputta consciousnessYamaka No friendSāriputta Do you regard the Tathāgata as being in formElsewhere than formIn feelingElsewhere than feelingIn perceptionElsewhere than perceptionIn fabricationsElsewhere than fabricationsIn consciousnessElsewhere than consciousnessYamaka No friendSāriputta Do you regard the Tathāgata as formfeelingperceptionfabricationsconsciousnessYamaka No friendSāriputta Do you regard the Tathāgata as that which is without form without feeling without perception without fabrications without consciousnessYamaka No friendSāriputta And so my friend Yamaka  when you cant pin down the Tathāgata as a truth or reality even in the present life  is it proper for you to declare As I understand the Teaching explained by the Blessed One a monk with no more effluents on the breakup of the body is annihilated perishes  does not exist after deathYamaka Previously friend Sāriputta I did foolishly hold that evil suppositionBut now having heard your explanation of the Teaching I have abandoned that evil supposition and the Teaching has become clearSāriputta Then friend Yamaka how would you answer if you are thus asked A monk a worthy one with no more effluents what is he on the breakup of the body after deathYamaka Thus asked I would answer Form feeling perception fabrications consciousness are inconstantThat which is inconstant is stressfulThat which is stressful has stopped and gone to its endThe Buddha puts the same series of questions to the monk Anurādha who  knowing that the Tathāgata after death could not be described in terms of existence nonexistence both or neither  had attempted to describe the Tathāgata in other termsAfter receiving the same answers as Yamaka had given Sāriputta the Buddha concludesAnd so Anurādha  when you cant pin down the Tathāgata as a truth or reality even in the present life  is it proper for you to declare Friend the Tathāgata  the supreme man the superlative man attainer of the superlative attainment  being described is described otherwise than with these four positions The Tathāgata exists after death does not exist after death both does  does not exist after death neither exists nor does not exist after deathNo lordVery good AnurādhaBoth formerly  now Anurādha it is only stress that I describe and the stopping of stressThus none of the four alternatives  reappearingexisting not reappearingexisting both  neither  can apply to the Tathāgata after death because even in this lifetime there is no way of defining or identifying what the Tathāgata isTo identify a person by the contents of his or her mind  such things as feelings perceptions or fabrications  there would have to be a way of knowing what those contents areIn ordinary cases the texts say this is possible through either of two cognitive skills that a meditator can develop through the practice of meditation and that beings on higher planes of existence can also share the ability to know where a living being is reborn after death and the ability to know another beings thoughtsIn both skills the knowledge is made possible by the fact that the ordinary mind exists in a state of dependency on its objectsWhen a being is reborn its consciousness has to become established at a certain point This point is what a master of the first skill perceivesWhen the ordinary mind thinks it needs a mental object to act as a prop or support for its thoughts This support is what a master of the second skill perceivesThe mind of a person who has attained the goal though is free from all dependencies and so offers no means by which a master of either skill can perceive itThen the Blessed One went with a large number of monks to the Black Rock on the slope of IsigiliFrom afar he saw VenVakkali lying dead on a couchNow at that time a smokiness a darkness was moving to the east moving to the west moving to the north the south above below moving to the intermediate directionsThe Blessed One said Monks do you see that smokiness that darknessYes lordThat is Māra the Evil OneHe is searching for the consciousness of Vakkali the clansman Where is the consciousness of Vakkali the clansman established But monks through unestablished consciousness Vakkali the clansman has attained total nibbānaThere is the case Sandha where for an excellent thoroughbred of a man the perception of earth with regard to earth has ceased to exist the perception of liquid with regard to liquid the perception of heat with regard to heat the perception of wind with regard to wind the perception of the dimension of the infinitude of space with regard to the dimension of the infinitude of space the perception of the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness with regard to the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness the perception of the dimension of nothingness with regard to the dimension of nothingness the perception of the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception with regard to the sphere of neither perception nor nonperception the perception of this world with regard to this world the next world with regard to the next world and whatever is seen heard sensed cognized attained sought after pondered by the intellect the perception with regard even to that has ceased to existAbsorbed in this way the excellent thoroughbred of a man is absorbed dependent neither on earth liquid heat wind the dimension of the infinitude of space the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness the dimension of nothingness the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception this world the next world nor on whatever is seen heard sensed cognized attained sought after or pondered by the intellect  and yet he is absorbedAnd to this excellent thoroughbred of a man absorbed in this way the gods together with Indra the Brahmās  their viceroys pay homage even from afarThus the mind that has attained the goal cannot be known or described from the outside because it is completely free of any dependency  any support or object inside it  by which it might be knownThis point forms the context for the dialogue in which the brāhman Upasīva asks the Buddha about the person who attains the goalThe important term in the last verse is pamāṇa criterionIt is a pregnant term with meanings both in philosophical and in ordinary usageIn philosophical discourse it refers to a means of knowledge or a standard used to assess the validity of an assertion or objectIn the Buddhas time and later various schools of thought specialized in discussing the nature and role of such criteriaThe Maitri Upaniṣad contains one of their basic tenetsBecause of its precision this is the criterion for timeFor without a criterion there is no ascertaining the things to be assessedThus when a mind has abandoned all phenomena there is no means or criterion by which anyone else could know or say anything about itThis much is obviousBut the verse also seems to be saying that the goal is indescribable from the inside  for the person experiencing it  as wellFirst the verse is in response to Upasīvas inquiry into the goal as the Buddha has known itSecondly the line for him it doesnt exist can mean not only that the person experiencing the goal offers no criteria to the outside by which anyone else might describe himher but also that the experience offers no criteria from the inside for describing it eitherAnd as we have already noted the outside criteria by which a person might be described are determined precisely by what is there inside the persons mindThus for the person experiencing the goal there would not even be any means of knowing whether or not there was a person having the experienceThere would simply be the experience in  of itselfThis is where the ordinary meaning of pamāṇa  as limit or measurement  comes inThis meaning goes back to the Vedic hymnsThere the act of measuring is seen as an essential part of the process of the creation of the cosmosIn one g Vedic hymn for example the creation of mind is followed by the appearance of a horizontal limit or measuring line separating male from femaleFrom this line the rest of the cosmos is laid outSo to say that no criterionmeasurementlimit exists for the person experiencing the goal means that the persons experience is totally free of all the most elementary perceptions  distinctions that underlie our knowledge of the cosmosAnd the word free  one of the few the Buddha uses in a straightforward way to describe the mind that has attained the goal  thus carries two meanings free from dependency as we have already seen and free from limitations even of the most abstruse  subtlest sortThis second reading of the verse  dealing with the limitlessness  indescribability of the goal for the person experiencing it  is supported by a number of other passages in the Pali Canon referring explicitly to the inner experience of the goalThere is monks that dimension where there is neither earth nor water nor fire nor wind nor dimension of the infinitude of space nor dimension of the infinitude of consciousness nor dimension of nothingness nor dimension of neither perception nor nonperception nor this world nor the next world nor sun nor moonAnd there I say there is neither coming nor going nor stasis nor passing away nor arising without stance without foundation without supportThis just this is the end of stressConsciousness without surface without end radiant all around is not experienced through the solidity of earth the liquidity of water the radiance of fire the windiness of wind the divinity of devas the allness of the AllThe phrase the allness of the All can best be understood with reference to the following three passagesWhat is the AllSimply the eye  forms ear  sounds nose  aromas tongue  flavors body  tactile sensations intellect  ideasThis monks is termed the AllAnyone who would say Repudiating this All I will describe another if questioned on what exactly might be the grounds for his statement would be unable to explain and furthermore would be put to griefWhyBecause it lies beyond rangeIf the six senses  their objects  sometimes called the six spheres of contact  constitute the All is there anything beyond the AllMahāKoṭṭhita With the remainderless stopping  fading of the six spheres of contact is it the case that there is anything elseSāriputta Dont say that my friendMahāKoṭṭhita With the remainderless stopping  fading of the six spheres of contact is it the case that there is not anything elseSāriputta Dont say that my friendMahāKoṭṭhita is it the case that there both is  is not anything elseSāriputta Dont say that my friendMahāKoṭṭhita is it the case that there neither is nor is not anything elseSāriputta Dont say that my friendMahāKoṭṭhita Being asked if there is anything else you say Dont say that my friend Being asked if there is not anything else if there both is  is not anything else if there neither is nor is not anything else you say Dont say that my friend Now how is the meaning of this statement to be understoodSāriputta Saying is it the case that there is anything else is it the case that there is not anything else is it the case that there both is  is not anything else is it the case the there neither is nor is not anything else one is objectifying the nonobjectifiedHowever far the six spheres of contact go that is how far objectification goesHowever far objectification goes that is how far the six spheres of contact goWith the remainderless fading  stopping of the six spheres of contact there comes to be the stopping the allaying of objectificationThe dimension of nonobjectification although it may not be described may be realized through direct experienceMonks that dimension should be experienced where the eye stops and the perception of form fadesThat dimension should be experienced where the ear stops and the perception of sound fades where the nose stops and the perception of aroma fades where the tongue stops and the perception of flavor fades where the body stops and the perception of tactile sensation fades where the intellect stops and the perception of ideaphenomenon fades That dimension should be experiencedThis experience of the goal  absolutely unlimited freedom beyond classification and exclusive of all else  is termed the elemental nibbāna property with no fuel remainingIt is one of two ways in which nibbāna is experienced the distinction between the two being expressed as followsMonks there are these two forms of the nibbāna propertyWhich twoThe nibbāna property with fuel remaining and the nibbāna property with no fuel remainingAnd what is the nibbāna property with fuel remainingThere is the case where a monk is an arahant whose effluents have ended who has attained completion finished the task laid down the burden attained the true goal destroyed the fetter of becoming and is released through right gnosisHis five faculties still remain and owing to their being intact he experiences the pleasing  the displeasing and is sensitive to pleasure  painHis ending of passion aversion  delusion is termed the nibbāna property with fuel remainingAnd what is the nibbāna property with no fuel remainingThere is the case where a monk is an arahant released through right gnosisFor him all that is sensed being unrelished will grow cold right hereThis is termed the nibbāna property with no fuel remainingThe phrase referring to the range of feeling as growing cold right here is a set expression describing death as experienced by one who has reached the goalThe verse following this passage states explicitly that this is what is meant hereThe Verses of the Elder Udāyin suggest a simile to illustrate the distinction between these two nibbāna propertiesHere VenUdāyin compares the nibbāna property with fuel remaining  the state of being absolutely free from passion aversion  delusion  to a fire whose flames have died out but whose embers are still glowingAlthough he does not complete the analogy he seems to imply that the nibbāna property without fuel remaining  when the Worthy One discards his body at death  is like a fire so totally out that its embers have grown coldThus the completely free  unadulterated experience we have been discussing is that of nibbāna after deathThere are though states of concentration which give a foretaste of this experience in the present life and which enabled the Buddha to say that he taught the goal on the basis of direct knowledgenanda In what way venerable sir might a monk attain concentration of such a form that he would have neither the perception of earth with regard to earth nor of water with regard to water nor of fire wind the dimension of the infinitude of space the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness the dimension of nothingness the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception this world nor of the next world with regard to the next world and yet he would still be percipientThe Buddha There is the case nanda where he would be percipient of this This is peace this is exquisite  the resolution of all fabrications the relinquishing of all acquisitions the ending of craving dispassion stopping nibbānananda But what were you percipient of at that timeSāriputta  The stopping of becoming  nibbāna  the stopping of becoming  nibbāna One perception arose in me as another perception stoppedJust as in a blazing woodchip fire one flame arises as another flame stops even so The stopping of becoming  nibbāna  the stopping of becoming  nibbāna One perception arose in me as another one stoppedI was percipient at that time of the stopping of becoming  nibbānananda It is amazing my friend it is marvelous how the Blessed One has attained  recognized the opportunity for the purification of beings and the direct realization of nibbāna where the eye will be and forms and yet one will not be sensitive to that dimension where the ear will be and sounds where the nose will be and aromas where the tongue will be and flavors where the body will be and tactile sensations and yet one will not be sensitive to that dimensionUdāyin Is one insensitive to that dimension percipient or not percipientnanda  percipientUdāyin  percipient of whatnanda There is the case where  with the complete transcending of perceptions of form and the passing away of perceptions of resistance and not attending to perceptions of diversity  infinite space one remains in the dimension of the infinitude of space Percipient in this way one is not sensitive to that dimensionFurther with the complete transcending of the dimension of the infinitude of space infinite consciousness one remains in the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness Percipient in this way one is not sensitive to that dimensionFurther with the complete transcending of the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness There is nothing one remains in the dimension of nothingness Percipient in this way one is not sensitive to that dimensionOnce friend when I was staying in Sāketa at the Game Refuge in the Black Forest the nun Jaṭilā Bhāgikā went to me and on arrival  having bowed to me  stood to one sideAs she was standing to one side she said to me Vennanda the concentration whereby  neither pressed down nor forced back nor with fabrications kept blocked or suppressed  still as a result of release contented as a result of stillness and as a result of contentment one is not agitated This concentration is said by the Blessed One to be the fruit of whatI said to her This concentration is said by the Blessed One to be the fruit of gnosis Percipient in this way friend one is not sensitive to that dimensionIn this extraordinary state of mental poise  neither pressed forced blocked or suppressed  nibbāna in the present life is experienced as freedom from all perception dealing with the six sensory spheres  the dimensions of meditative absorptionAlthough one is conscious and these dimensions are present one does not partake of themOn the level of ordinary sensory experience however nibbāna in the present life is experienced by the Worthy One as the passing away of passion aversion  delusionThis implies that these three states are analogous to fire and as we saw in the Introduction they are directly referred to as fires at various points in the CanonOn the surface the notion of passion  aversion as fires hardly requires explanation but in order to gain a fuller appreciation of the analogies that the Canon draws between fire on the one hand and passion aversion  delusion on the other we first need some background on the specifically Buddhist views on fire it containsAt SavatthiThere the Blessed One said From an inconstruable beginning comes transmigrationA beginning

monasteryThen VenPavittha said to VenMusila Musila my friend putting aside conviction putting aside preference putting aside tradition putting aside reasoning through analogies putting aside an

becoming is Unbinding Then VenMusila you are an arahant whose fermentations are endedWhen this was said VenMusila was silentThen VenNarada said Pavittha my friend it would be good if I were to get that questionAsk me that question and I will answer it for youThen VenNarada will get that questionI will ask VenNarada that question and may he answer that question for meThen VenNarada you are an arahant whose fermentations are endedMy friend although I have seen properly with right discernment as it actually is present that The cessation of becoming is Unbinding still I am not an arahant whose fermentations are endedIts as if there were a well along a road in a desert with neither rope nor water bucketA man would come along overcome by heat oppressed by the heat exhausted dehydrated  thirstyHe would look into the well and would have knowledge of water but he would not dwell touching it with his bodyIn the same way although I have seen properly with right discernment as it actually is present that The cessation of becoming is Unbinding still I am not an arahant whose fermentations are endedWhen this was said VenAnanda said to VenPavittha When he speaks in this way friend Pavittha what do you have to say about VenNaradaWhen VenNarada speaks in this way friend Ananda I have nothing to say about VenNarada except that admirable  skillfulTranslators note This discourse is sometimes cited as proof that a meditator can attain Awakening without having practiced the jhanas but a close reading shows that it does not support this assertion at allThe new arahants mentioned here do not deny that they have attained any of the four form jhanas that make up the definition of right concentrationInstead they simply deny that they have acquired any psychic powers or that they remain in physical contact with the higher levels of concentration the formless states beyond forms In this their definition of discernmentrelease is no different from that given in ANTaken in the context of the Buddhas many other teachings on right concentration theres every reason to believe that the new arahants mentioned in this discourse had reached at least the first jhana before attaining AwakeningI have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Rajagaha in the Bamboo Grove the squirrels sanctuaryNow at that time the Blessed One was worshipped revered honored venerated given homage  a recipient of robes almsfood lodgings  medical requisites for the sickThe community of monks was also worshipped revered honored venerated given homage  a recipient of robes almsfood lodgings  medical requisites for the sickBut the wanderers of other sects were not worshipped revered honored venerated or given homage nor were they recipients of robes almsfood lodgings or medical requisites for the sickNow at that time Susima the wanderer was living in Rajagaha with a large following of wanderersAnd so Susimas following of wanderers said to him Come now friend SusimaGo live the holy life under Gotama the contemplativeWhen you have completely mastered the Dhamma tell it to us when we have completely mastered it we will teach it to householders and then we too will be worshipped revered honored venerated given homage we too will become recipients of robes almsfood lodgings  medical requisites for the sickResponding As you say friends to his own following Susima the wanderer went to VenAnanda and on arrival exchanged courteous greetings with himAfter an exchange of friendly greetings  courtesies he sat to one sideAs he was sitting there he said to VenAnanda Friend Ananda I want to live the holy life in this Dhamma  DisciplineThen VenAnanda took Susima the wanderer to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to the Blessed One sat to one sideAs he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One Lord this wanderer Susima has said Friend Ananda I want to live the holy life in this Dhamma  Discipline Then in that case Ananda give him the Going Forth So Susima the wanderer gained the Going Forth in the presence of the Blessed One he gained the AcceptanceNow at that time a large number of monks had declared final gnosis in the Blessed Ones presence We discern that Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task doneThere is nothing further for the sake of this world VenSusima heard that A large number of monks it seems have declared final gnosis in the Blessed Ones presence We discern that Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task doneThere is nothing further for the sake of this world Then VenSusima went to those monks and on arrival exchanged courteous greetings with themAfter an exchange of friendly greetings  courtesies he sat to one sideAs he was sitting there he said to them Is it true as they say that

means of the divine eye purified  surpassing the human  beings passing away and reappearing and do you discern how they are inferior  superior beautiful  ugly fortunate  unfortunate in accordance with their kamma These beings  who were endowed with bad conduct of body speech  mind who reviled the noble ones held wrong views and undertook actions under the influence of wrong views  with the breakup of the body after death have reappeared in the plane of deprivation the bad destination the lower realms in hellBut these beings  who were endowed with good conduct of body speech  mind who did not revile the noble ones who held right views and undertook actions under the influence of right views  with the breakup of the body after death have reappeared in the good destinations in the heavenly worldNo friendThen having known thus having seen thus do you dwell touching with your body the peaceful emancipations the formless states beyond formNo friendSo just now friends didnt you make that declaration without having attained any of these DhammasWere released through discernment friend SusimaI dont understand the detailed meaning of your brief statementIt would be good if you would speak in such a way that I would understand its detailed meaningWhether or not you understand friend Susima we are still released through discernmentSo VenSusima got up from his seat and went to the Blessed OneOn arrival having bowed down to the Blessed One he sat to one sideAs he was sitting there he told the Blessed One the entire conversation he had had with those monksFirst Susima there is the knowledge of the regularity of the Dhamma after which there is the knowledge of UnbindingI dont understand the detailed meaning of the Blessed Ones brief statementIt would be good if the Blessed One would speak in such a way that I would understand its detailed meaningWhether or not you understand Susima it is still the case that first there is the knowledge of the regularity of the Dhamma after which there is the knowledge of UnbindingWhat do you think Susima Is form constant or inconstant  Inconstant lord  And is that which is inconstant easeful or stressful  Stressful lord  And is it fitting to regard what is inconstant stressful subject to change as This is mineThis is my selfThis is what I amNo lordIs feeling constant or inconstant  Inconstant lordIs perception constant or inconstant  Inconstant lordAre fabrications constant or inconstant  Inconstant lordWhat do you think Susima Is consciousness constant or inconstant  Inconstant lord  And is that which is inconstant easeful or stressful  Stressful lord  And is it fitting to regard what is inconstant stressful subject to change as This is mineThis is my selfThis is what I amNo lordThus Susima any form whatsoever that is past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or near every form is to be seen as it actually is with right discernment as This is not mineThis is not my selfThis is not what I amAny feeling whatsoeverAny perception whatsoeverAny fabrications whatsoeverAny consciousness whatsoever that is past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or near every consciousness is to be seen as it actually is with right discernment as This is not mineThis is not my selfThis is not what I amSeeing thus the wellinstructed disciple of the noble ones grows disenchanted with form disenchanted with feeling disenchanted with perception disenchanted with fabrications disenchanted with consciousnessDisenchanted he becomes dispassionateThrough dispassion he is fully releasedWith full release there is the knowledge Fully released He discerns that Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task doneThere is nothing

please accept this confession of my transgression as such so that I may restrain myself in the futureYes Susima a transgression overcame you in that you were so foolish so muddleheaded  so unskilled as to go forth as a thief of the Dhamma in this welltaught Dhamma  DisciplineSuppose Susima that a robber an evildoer having been caught were shown to a king This your majesty is a robber an evildoerDecree what punishment you want for him And so the king would say Go and  having bound him with a stout rope with his arms pinned tightly against his back having shaved him bald  march him to a harshsounding drum from street to street crossroads to crossroads evict him out the south gate of the city and there to the south of the city cut off his head Then the kings men having bound the man with a stout rope with his arms pinned tightly against his back would march him to a harshsounding drum from street to street crossroads to crossroads evict him out the south gate of the city and there to the south of the city cut off his headWhat do you think SusimaWouldnt that man for that reason experience pain  distressYes lordHowever much the pain  distress that man would experience for that reason Susima the Going Forth of a thief of the Dhamma in this welltaught Dhamma  Discipline is still more painful in its result more bitter in its result in that it leads even to the lower realmsBut because you see your transgression as such and make amends in accordance with the Dhamma we accept your confessionFor Susima it is a cause of growth in the Dhamma  Discipline of the noble

consciousness the fourthThese are the four nutriments for the maintenance of beings who have come into being or for the support of those in search of a place to be bornAnd how is physical food to be regardedSuppose a couple husband  wife taking meager provisions were to travel through a desertWith them would be their only baby son dear  appealingThen the meager provisions of the couple going through the desert would be used up  depleted while there was still a stretch of the desert yet to be crossedThe thought would occur to them Our meager provisions are used up  depleted while there is still a stretch of this desert yet to be crossedWhat if we were to kill this only baby son of ours dear  appealing and make dried meat  jerkyThat way  chewing on the flesh of our son  at least the two of us would make it through this desertOtherwise all three of us would perish So they would kill their only baby son loved  endearing and make dried meat  jerkyChewing on the flesh of their son they would make it through the desertWhile eating the flesh of their only son they would beat their breasts Where have you gone our only baby sonWhere have you gone our only baby son Now what do you think monks Would that couple eat that food playfully or for intoxication or for putting on bulk or for beautificationNo lordWouldnt they eat that food simply for the sake of making it through that desertYes lordIn the same way I tell you is the nutriment of physical food to be regardedWhen physical food is comprehended passion for the five strings of sensuality is comprehendedWhen passion for the five strings of sensuality is comprehended there is no fetter bound by which a disciple of the noble ones would come back again to this worldAnd how is the nutriment of contact to be regardedSuppose a flayed cow were to stand leaning against a wallThe creatures living in the wall would chew on itIf it were to stand leaning against a tree the creatures living in the tree would chew on itIf it were to stand exposed to water the creatures living in the water would chew on itIf it were to stand exposed to the air the creatures living in the air would chew on itFor wherever the flayed cow were to stand exposed the creatures living there would chew on itIn the same way I tell you is the nutriment of contact to be regardedWhen the nutriment of contact is comprehended the three feelings are comprehendedWhen the three feelings are comprehended I tell you there is nothing further for a disciple of the noble ones to doAnd how is the nutriment of intellectual intention to be regardedSuppose there were a pit of glowing embers deeper than a mans height full of embers that were neither flaming nor smoking and a man were to come along  loving life hating death loving pleasure abhorring pain  and two strong men having grabbed him by the arms were to drag him to the pit of embersTo get far away would be that mans intention far away would be his wish far away would be his aspirationWhy is thatBecause he would realize If I fall into this pit of glowing embers I will meet with death from that cause or with deathlike pain In the same way I tell you is the nutriment of intellectual intention to be regardedWhen the nutriment of intellectual intention is comprehended the three forms of craving are comprehendedWhen the three forms of craving are comprehended I tell you there is nothing further for a disciple of the noble ones to doAnd how is the nutriment of consciousness to be regardedSuppose that having arrested a thief a criminal they were to show him to the king This is a thief a criminal for you your majestyImpose on him whatever punishment you like So the king would say Go men and shoot him in the morning with a hundred spears So they would shoot him in the morning with a hundred spearsThen the king would say at noon Men how is that man Still alive your majesty So the king would say Go men and shoot him at noon with a hundred spears So they would shoot him at noon with a hundred spearsThen the king would say in the evening Men how is that man Still alive your majesty So the king would say Go men and shoot him in the evening with a hundred spears So they would shoot him in the evening with a hundred spearsNow what do you think monks Would that man being shot with three hundred spears a day experience pain  distress from that causeEven if he were to be shot with only one spear lord he would experience pain  distress from that cause to say nothing of three hundred spearsIn the same way I tell you monks is the nutriment of consciousness to be

appears profoundIt is through not knowing not understanding not penetrating this truth that this generation has become entangled like a knotted string covered with blight like grass and reeds and cannot pass over the downfall the woeful way the sorrowful state the cycle of birthanddeathI have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Savatthi in Jetas Grove Anathapindikas monasteryThere he addressed the monks Monks an uninstructed runofthemill person might grow disenchanted with this body composed of the four great elements might grow dispassionate toward it might gain release from itWhy is thatBecause the growth  decline the taking up  putting down of this body composed of the four great elements are apparentThus the uninstructed runofthemill person might grow disenchanted might grow dispassionate might gain release thereBut as for whats called mind intellect or consciousness the uninstructed runofthemill person is unable to grow disenchanted with it unable to grow dispassionate toward it unable to gain release from itWhy is thatFor a long time this has been relished appropriated and grasped by the uninstructed runofthemill person as This is me this is my self this is what I am Thus the uninstructed runofthemill person is unable to grow disenchanted with it unable to grow dispassionate toward it unable to gain release from itIt would be better for the uninstructed runofthemill person to hold to the body composed of the four great elements rather than the mind as the selfWhy is thatBecause this body composed of the four great elements is seen

Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task doneThere is nothing further for this world See also SN SNThis poem by the Elder Udayin evokes one of the most famous of Buddhist images and is laced with meaning on many levelsIn one sense  emerging from the psychological ethos of early Buddhist teaching  it can be taken to describe the ability of the awakened person to thrive in the world of sensory experience without clinging or attachmentThough the human condition is rooted in the desires that give rise to all life and selfhood one can learn to live in this world without being bound by the impulse to crave pleasure and avoid painOne gets drenched by the world when one succumbs to to the range of grasping behaviors which inevitably bring about suffering  the mind clings to an object like water that permeates something and drenches itHere we see a Buddha that does not transcend the world but lives in it for fortyfive years with a mind free of all attachmentsAs the tradition evolved the question of just what sort of being the Buddha was became of growing importanceThe image of the lotus emerging from the mud and blooming above the world became a popular way of expressing the Buddhas transcendenceIn the canonical passage upon which Udayin builds his verse the phrase having passed beyond the world is added and this becomes the basis for the Vetulyaka assertion that the Buddha was essentially a transcendent beingThis interpretation had profound implications for later Buddhism and set the stage for among other ideas the Three Bodies of the Buddha doctrine of Mahayana BuddhismIn this way of looking at things Awakening is something that happens again and again in all different places and times and is not limited to a single occurrence of it among the Sakyas of ancient IndiaThe tantric Buddhists of the Vajrayana were drawn to the contrast in this image between the ordinary defiling mud in which the plant is rooted and the sublime loveliness of the blossomRelentless in their nonattachment to dichotomies and their demolition of opposites the tantric approach is to be capable of embracing both extremes without clinging to eitherThough the emphasis changes we can see that the essential teaching of nonattachment or nonclinging  to the objects of senseperception to a particular mode of teaching or to conventional dualities  remains carried through the ages by this simple image of a lotus growing out of the waterThese lovely verses are attributed to Tissa Kumara the youngest brother of King Ashoka and if this is true it demonstrates how some of the poetry of the Theragatha entered into the Pali canon relatively late  at the time of the Third CouncilPrince Tissa was made Vice Regent when Ashoka was first consecrated KingBut within only a few years inspired by the example of a forestdwelling monk he encountered while hunting he renounced worldly life to live as a simple Buddhist monk in the wildernessHis monastic name translates as The Elder Who Lives AloneThe poem exudes the romantic yearning for the solitude of nature felt by someone who grew up no doubt in the court of the Maurya empireThe first five stanzas are said to have been uttered to Ashoka while expressing his wish to become a monk and the last two verses were composed upon ordinationA final verse not translated here attests to his eventual awakeningIt was quite a familyAshokas son and daughter were the ones to formally bring the Dhamma to the island of Lanka where Theravada Buddhism flourished for two and a half millenniaThe mountains named in the last stanza actually refer to the ring of hills surrounding Vultures Peak but since the previous stanza specifies the peak of a mountain I think it is appropriate to name the more wellknown siteThese verses are said to have been uttered by UdayinHe was the son of king Suddhodhanas chief minister and is said to have been the childhood companion of prince SiddharthaSoon after Gotamas awakening the king sent several messengers to ask his son to return homeEach one upon hearing the Buddhas teaching apparently joined his movement and gave up the kings missionFinally Suddhodhana sends Kaludayin who agrees on condition that he can become a follower of the Buddha upon getting him to return home for a visitThe Rohini river runs through the heart of the Buddhas homeland marking the border between the lands of the Sakyas and the KoliyasSince the verses are uttered in Rajagaha well to the southeast a returning journey would face the traveler westwardOne commentary says that Kaludayin went on for sixty stanzas of this beautiful nature poetry before asking the Buddha to return but we only have the first few of theseThe language is rich and evocative of spring sights and smellsIt is composed in a meter of eleven syllables per lineThe Buddha does indeed go home soon after his awakening where he picks up a number of family members to join his orderThese include his half brother several cousins and his sonEventually his wife stepmother and many other Sakyas will also become nuns and monksThese powerful words echo through twenty five centuries of humanity to reach our ears todayIt makes ones spine tingle to think how many voices  now long silent  have uttered these words in each of the one hundred generations that have come and gone since Sirimanda first composed themHow many have heeded their messageHow many can hear it todayThis is the kind of literature that leads some to view Buddhism as holding a pessimistic outlook on the worldBut in fact it is merely expressing in a forthright and dramatic manner some facts with which we are all quite familiarPerhaps we would prefer to ignore the facts of aging and death but the Buddhas compassion is manifest in his not leaving the world to wallow in the shallow happiness that comes from ignoring our dangerAbove all these stanzas are a call to action provoking us to wake up from the complacent slumber of our denial and urging us to dwell without confusion This is a reference to mindfulness the practice of insight meditationFor by nurturing awareness of what is actually going on in our experience  both what is pleasurable and what is painful  we sow the seeds of wisdomAnd wisdom according to the Buddhist tradition can help us see through the desires and cravings that obscure what is ageless and deathlessThe Sutta Nipata is probably one of the most diverse collections of discourses to be found in the Pali Tipitaka and the chapter from which this sutta is taken the Atthakavagga may well be the oldest portion of the entire canonIt is composed mostly in verse and includes some lovely poetryThere is something particularly moving for me about this poem perhaps because it is composed in the first person and appears to reveal the process through which the Buddha himself came to understanding perhaps because of the vulnerability expressed in the opening stanzas where he admits his fear and sense of dread over the nature of the human conditionOr maybe it is just the utter simplicity of first the problem and then its cause and finally its solutionHow easy he can so often make it all soundThe first line alone is a counterintuitive showstopperConventional wisdom suggests that arming oneself is a prudent response to fear of selfinjuryYet the Buddhas wisdom goes deeper to observe how this actually contributes to the generation of more fearDo we really feel more safe when we lash out at our critics and adversariesOur culture certainly assumes so but the Buddha is offering an alternative response emerging from his own experienceThe phrase translated here as arming oneself which serves as the title of the sutta is elsewhere rendered embracing violence or violent conductThe basic image is of a person taking up a stick the stick being a common symbol in Indian literature for both violence and punishmentThe reader can hardly help feeling swept up in the emotional turmoil of the authorThe tension mounts as the fear and despair builds and then breaks suddenly with the insight that like an animal driven to madness by an injury mankind is not evil by nature but is only driven to violence by the relentless pressure of desireThe latter half of the poem describes how to cultivate a state of mind  a stance within unfolding experience  that avoids the dysfunctional move of creating and projecting oneself on every situationThese few verses embrace the whole of the four noble truths the suffering manifest as violence its cause by the thorn in the heart the unbinding or crossing over this and the way to cultivate the selflessness that constitutes real freedomThese verses from the Sutta Nipata aptly state the paradox of illusionOur six senses spin threads of perception which we weave into a tapestry called myself and the world We then take this handiwork to be more solid and meaningful than it is and get caught in its intricate patterns and colorsFor those who are able to see through this illusory construction ordinary pleasures are seen as a snare that catches and reinforces the ego  that view we have of self as separate from which so much suffering arisesThe moderation or even renunciation of these pleasures on the other hand can be viewed as a powerful tool for gaining freedom from our selfcreated sufferingThe term nobles or noble ones is used in the Buddhist tradition not for people of a certain birth or social class but for any person who thinks speaks or acts nobly with generosity kindness and wisdom rather than with greed hatred or delusionA theme recurrent in the passages we have been considering is that the abandonment of clingingsustenance is effected through knowledgeThese four sustenance have what as their cause what as their origin from what are they born from what do they ariseThese four sustenance have craving as their cause craving as their origin are born from craving and arise from cravingAnd what does craving have as its cause feeling And what does feeling have as its cause contact And what does contact have as its cause the six sense spheres And what do the six sense spheres have as their cause name  form And what do name  form have as their cause consciousness And what does consciousness have as its cause fabrications And what do fabrications have as their cause ignoranceAnd monks as soon as ignorance is abandoned in a monk and clear knowing arises he  from the fading of ignorance and the arising of clear knowing  clings neither to sensuality as sustenance nor to views as sustenance nor to habits  practices as sustenance nor to doctrines of the self as sustenanceNot clinging he is not agitatedUnagitated he is totally unbound right withinHe discerns that Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task doneThere is nothing further for this worldThe word vijjā  translated here as clear knowing  also means science And just as science implies a method there is a method  a discipline  underlying the knowledge that leads to UnbindingThat method is described from a number of perspectives in the Canon each description stressing different aspects of the steps involvedThe standard formula though is the noble eightfold path also known as the middle wayThere are these two extremes that one who has gone forth is not to indulge inWhich twoThat which is devoted to sensuality with reference to sensual objects base vulgar common ignoble unprofitable and that which is devoted to selfaffliction painful ignoble unprofitableAvoiding both of these extremes the middle way realized by the Tathāgata  producing vision producing knowledge  leads to calm to direct knowledge to selfawakening to UnbindingAnd what is the middle way realized by the Tathāgata that  producing vision producing knowledge  leads to calm to direct knowledge to selfawakening to UnbindingPrecisely this noble eightfold path right view right resolve right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness right concentrationThe eight factors of the path fall under three headings the first two factors coming under discernment the next three under virtue and the final three under concentrationThese three headings are called the threefold training the dynamic among them leading to the knowledge  vision of release is one of natural cause  effectIt is natural that in a virtuous person one of consummate virtue freedom from remorse will arise It is natural that in a person free from remorse gladness will arise that in a glad person rapture will arise that for an enraptured person the body will be calmed that a person of calmed body will feel pleasure that the mind of a person feeling pleasure will become concentrated that a person whose mind is concentrated will see things as they have come to be that a person seeing things as they have come to be will grow disenchanted that a disenchanted person will grow dispassionate that a dispassionate person will realize the knowledge  vision of releaseAccording to the standard description of the noble eightfold path the heading of discernment includes seeing things in terms of the four noble truths about stress and maintaining the resolve to release oneself from sensuality to abandon ill will and to avoid doing harmVirtue includes abstaining from lying from divisive speech from harsh speech  from idle chatter from killing stealing  having illicit sex and from engaging in dishonest or abusive forms of making a living such as dealing in poison slaves weapons intoxicants or animal fleshThe factors that go into concentration though are somewhat more complexAnd what monks is right effortThere is the case where a monk generates desire endeavors arouses persistence upholds  exerts his intent for the sake of the nonarising of evil unskillful qualities that have not yet arisen for the sake of the abandoning of evil unskillful qualities that have arisen for the sake of the arising of skillful qualities that have not yet arisen for the maintenance nonconfusion increase plenitude development  culmination of skillful qualities that have arisenThis monks is right effortAnd what is right mindfulnessThere is the case where a monk remains focused on the body in  of itself  ardent alert  mindful  subduing greed  distress with reference to the worldHe remains focused on feelings in  of themselves He remains focused on the mind in  of itself He remains focused on mental qualities in  of themselves  ardent alert  mindful  subduing greed  distress with reference to the worldThus either internally he remains focused on the body in  of itself or externally or both internally  externally or else he remains focused on the phenomenon of origination with reference to the body or the phenomenon of passing away with reference to the body or the phenomenon of origination  passing away with reference to the bodyOr his mindfulness that There is a body is maintained just to the extent of knowledge  recollectionAnd he remains independent not sustained by anything in the worldRight concentration is the practice of the four basic levels of jhānaThese three factors are component parts of a single wholeIn fact their balanced interrelatedness is what makes them right The first level of jhāna requires the abandoning of unskillful mental qualities which is part of the duty of right effort and as we saw in the description of breath meditation jhāna begins with mindfulness of the presentAs jhāna is practiced  mastered skillful qualities are fostered  maintained physical processes are stilled so that mental qualities may become clearly apparent as they occur mindfulness is made pure on the attainment of the fourth level of jhāna and all four of the establishings of mindfulness are developedOn whatever occasion monks a monk breathing in long discerns that he is breathing in long or breathing out long discerns that he is breathing out long or breathing in short discerns that he is breathing in short or breathing out short discerns that he is breathing out short trains himself to breathe inout sensitive to the entire body trains himself to breathe inout calming bodily fabrication On that occasion monks the monk remains focused on the body in  of itself  ardent alert  mindful  subduing greed  distress with reference to the worldOn whatever occasion a monk trains himself to breathe in out sensitive to rapture trains himself to breathe in out sensitive to pleasure trains himself to breathe inout sensitive to mental fabrication trains himself to breathe in out calming mental fabrication On that occasion the monk remains focused on feelings in  of themselves  ardent alert  mindful  subduing greed  distress with reference to the worldOn whatever occasion a monk trains himself to breathe in out sensitive to the mind trains himself to breathe in out gladdening the mind trains himself to breathe in out steadying the mind trains himself to breathe in out releasing the mind On that occasion the monk remains focused on the mind in  of itself  ardent alert  mindful  subduing greed  distress with reference to the worldOn whatever occasion a monk trains himself to breathe in out focusing on inconstancy trains himself to breathe inout focusing on dispassion trains himself to breathe inout focusing on stopping trains himself to breathe inout focusing on relinquishing On that occasion the monk remains focused on mental qualities in  of themselves  ardent alert  mindful  subduing greed  distress with reference to the worldIn the Great Discourse on the Establishings of Mindfulness the Buddha describes mindfulness of mental qualities in  of themselves in part in terms of the hindrances and the factors for Awakening qualities that are respectively set aside  fostered in the practice of jhānaAnd how does a monk remain focused on mental qualities in  of themselves with reference to the five hindrancesThere is the case where there being sensual desire present within a monk discerns There is sensual desire present within me Or there being no sensual desire present within he discerns There is no sensual desire present within me He discerns how there is the arising of unarisen sensual desireAnd he discerns how there is the abandoning of sensual desire once it has arisenAnd he discerns how there is no further appearance in the future of sensual desire that has been abandonedAnd how does a monk remain focused on mental qualities in  of themselves with reference to the seven factors for AwakeningThere is the case where there being mindfulness as a factor for Awakening present within a monk discerns that Mindfulness as a factor for Awakening is present within me Or there being no mindfulness as a factor for Awakening present within a monk discerns that Mindfulness as a factor for Awakening is not present within me He discerns how there is the arising of unarisen mindfulness as a factor for AwakeningAnd he discerns how there is the development  consummation of mindfulness as a factor for Awakening once it has arisenThus the practice of right mindfulness does not repress undesirable mental qualities  ie it does not deny their presenceRather it notices them as they occur so that the phenomenon of their occurrence can be understoodOnce they are understood for what they are as phenomena they lose their power and can be abandonedHowever the practice of right mindfulness focuses not on the haphazard occurrence of mental qualities but on the elimination of undesirable qualities  the hindrances  that obstruct jhāna and on the development of desirable qualities  the factors for Awakening  that jhāna fosters
