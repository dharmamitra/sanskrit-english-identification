A facetoface verdict should be given
This means that the transaction settling the issue must be carried out in the presence of the Community in the presence of the individuals and in the presence of the Dhamma and Vinaya
A verdict of mindfulness may be given
This is the verdict of innocence given in an accusation based on the fact that the accused remembers fully that she did not commit the offense in question
A verdict of past insanity may be given
This is another verdict of innocence given in an accusation based on the fact that the accused was out of her mind when she committed the offense in question and so is absolved of any responsibility for it
Acting in accordance with what is admitted
This refers to the ordinary confession of offenses where no formal interrogation is involved
The confession is valid only if in accord with the facts eg a bhikkhunī actually commits a pācittiya offense and then confesses it as such and not as a stronger or lesser offense
If she were to confess it as a dukkata or a Saṅghādisesa that would be invalid
Acting in accordance with the majority
This refers to cases in which bhikkhunīs are unable to settle a dispute unanimously even after all the proper procedures are followed and  in the words of the Canon  are wounding one another with weapons of the tongue In cases such as these decisions can be made by majority vote
Acting for her further punishment
This refers to cases where a bhikkhunī admits to having committed the offense in question only after being formally interrogated about it
She is then to be reproved for her actions made to remember the offense and to confess it after which the Community carries out a further punishment transaction against her as an added punishment for being so uncooperative as to require the formal interrogation in the first place
Covering over as with grass
This refers to situations in which both sides of a dispute realize that in the course of their dispute they have done much that is unworthy of a contemplative
If they were to deal with one another for their offenses the only result would be greater divisiveness
Thus if both sides agree all the bhikkhunīs gather in one place
must attend
No one should send her consent and even sick bhikkhunīs must go A motion is made to the entire group that this procedure will be followed
One member of each side then makes a formal motion to the members of her faction that she will make a confession for them
When both sides are ready the representative of each side addresses the entire group and makes the blanket confession using the form of a motion and one announcement
There is also a good practical reason to follow the Commentary here in that if the Community of bhikkhus acting in unity suspended the bhikkhu in question in a transaction that was not in line with the Dhamma the Vinaya the teacher's instructions then there is no good reason that the bhikkhunī following him should be subject to this rule
In the nonoffense clauses BD translates attano veyyavaccakarassa as in doing household work for herself This omits the kara in the second term thus changing veyyavaccakara to veyyavacca
The correct translation is for her own choredoer
Thus the nonoffense clauses as a set read There is no offense in conjeydrink in a Community meal in homage to a chedi or if she cooks conjey or a meal or a nonstaple food or washes a piece of clothing or a headwrap for her own choredoer The Commentary explains In conjeydrink etc When people are making a Community meal or a conjeydrink for the purpose of the Community there is no offense in her doing any cooking at all in the position of being their friend
In homage to a chedi It is all right if being a friend she does homage with scents etc
For her own choredoer Even if mother and father come and are makingdoing something a fan or a broom handle and so stand in the position of a choredoer it is all right to cook anything
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Vesālī at the Gabled Hall in the Great Forest
Then early in the morning he adjusted his under robe and  carrying his bowl  robes  went into Vesālī for alms
Then having gone for alms in Vesālī after the meal returning from his alms round he addressed Ven
nanda Get a sitting cloth nanda
We will go to the Pāvāla shrine for the day's abiding
Responding As you say lord to the Blessed One Ven
nanda followed along behind the Blessed One carrying the sitting cloth
Then the Blessed One went to the Pāvāla shrine and on arrival sat down on the seat laid out
Seated the Blessed One addressed Ven
nanda Vesālī is refreshing nanda
Refreshing too are the Udena shrine the Gotamaka shrine the Sattamba shrine the ManySon shrine the Sāranda shrine the Pāvāla shrine
But Ven
nanda  even when the Blessed One had given such a blatant sign such a blatant hint  wasn't able to understand his meaning
He didn't request of him Lord may the Blessed One remain for an eon
May the OneWellGone remain for an eon  for the benefit of the many for the happiness of the many out of sympathy for the world for the welfare benefit  happiness of human and divine beings It was as if his mind was possessed by Māra
A second time A third time the Blessed One addressed Ven
nanda Vesālī is refreshing nanda
Refreshing too are the Udena shrine the Gotamaka shrine the Sattamba shrine the ManySon shrine the Sāranda shrine the Pāvāla shrine
Anyone nanda in whom the four bases of power are developed pursued given a means of transport given a grounding steadied consolidated and wellundertaken could  if he wanted  remain for an eon or the remainder of an eon
In the Tathāgata nanda the four bases of power are developed pursued given a means of transport given a grounding steadied consolidated and wellundertaken
He could  if he wanted  remain for an eon or the remainder of an eon
But Ven
nanda  even when the Blessed One had given such a blatant sign such a blatant hint  wasn't able to understand his meaning
He didn't request of him Lord may the Blessed One remain for an eon
May the OneWellGone remain for an eon  for the benefit of the many for the happiness of the many out of sympathy for the world for the welfare benefit  happiness of human and divine beings It was as if his mind was possessed by Māra
Then the Blessed One addressed Ven
nanda Go nanda
Do what you think it is now time to do
Responding As you say lord to the Blessed One Ven
nanda got up from his seat bowed down to the Blessed One and  after circling him to the right  went to sit under a tree not far from the Blessed One
Then not long after Ven
nanda had left Māra the Evil One went to the Blessed One and on arrival stood to one side
As he was standing there he said to the Blessed One May the Blessed One totally unbind now lord
May the OneWellGone totally unbind now lord
Now is the time for the Blessed One's total unbinding lord
After all these words were said by the Blessed One 'Evil One I will not totally unbind as long as my monk disciples are not yet experienced trained attained to confidence desiring rest from the yoke learned maintaining the Dhamma practicing the Dhamma in line with the Dhamma practicing masterfully living in line with the Dhamma declaring the Dhamma  after having learned it from their own teachers  teaching it describing it setting it forth revealing it explaining it making it plain wellrefuting in line with the Dhamma any opposing teachings that have arisen teaching the Dhamma with its marvels'
But now lord the Blessed One's monk disciples are experienced trained attained to confidence desiring rest from the yoke learned maintaining the Dhamma practicing the Dhamma in line with the Dhamma practicing masterfully living in line with the Dhamma declaring the Dhamma  after having learned it from their own teachers  teaching it describing it setting it forth revealing it explaining it making it plain wellrefuting in line with the Dhamma any opposing teachings that have arisen teaching the Dhamma with its marvels
May the Blessed One totally unbind now lord
May the OneWellGone totally unbind now lord
Now is the time for the Blessed One's total unbinding lord
After all these words were said by the Blessed One 'Evil One I will not totally unbind as long as my nun disciples my male layfollower disciples my female layfollower disciples are not yet experienced trained attained to maturity desiring rest from the yoke learned maintaining the Dhamma practicing the Dhamma in line with the Dhamma practicing masterfully living in line with the Dhamma declaring the Dhamma  after having learned it from their own teachers  teaching it describing it setting it forth revealing it explaining it making it plain wellrefuting in line with the Dhamma any opposing teachings that have arisen teaching the Dhamma with its marvels'
But now lord the Blessed One's female layfollower disciples are experienced trained attained to maturity desiring rest from the yoke learned maintaining the Dhamma practicing the Dhamma in line with the Dhamma practicing masterfully living in line with the Dhamma declaring the Dhamma  after having learned it from their own teachers  teaching it describing it setting it forth revealing it explaining it making it plain wellrefuting in line with the Dhamma any opposing teachings that have arisen teaching the Dhamma with its marvels
May the Blessed One totally unbind now lord
May the OneWellGone totally unbind now lord
Now is the time for the Blessed One's total unbinding lord
After all these words were said by the Blessed One 'Evil One I will not totally unbind as long as this holy life of mine is not powerful prosperous widelyspread disseminated among many people wellexpounded as far as there are devas  human beings' But now lord the Blessed One's holy life is powerful prosperous widelyspread disseminated among many people wellexpounded as far as there are devas  human beings
May the Blessed One totally unbind now lord
May the OneWellGone totally unbind now lord
Now is the time for the Blessed One's total unbinding lord
When this was said the Blessed One said to Māra the Most Evil One Relax Evil One
It won't be long until the Tathāgata's total unbinding
In three month's time from now the Tathāgata will totally unbind
Thus at the Pāvāla shrine  mindful  alert  the Blessed One relinquished the fabrications of life
And as the Blessed One relinquished the fabrications of life there was a great earthquake frightening  hairraising along with cracks of thunder
Then on realizing the significance of that the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed
And what is the development of the base of power
There is the case where a monk develops the base of power endowed with concentration founded on desire  the fabrications of exertion
He develops the base of power endowed with concentration founded on persistence concentration founded on intent concentration founded on discrimination  the fabrications of exertion
This is called the development of the base of power
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Sāvatthī at Jeta's Grove Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery
Now at that time a large number of monks after the meal on returning from their alms round were sitting gathered together at a pavilion when this discussion arose Who friends knows a craft
Who's studying which craft
Which is the supreme among crafts
With regard to that some said The elephantcraft is the supreme craft among crafts Some said The horsecraft is the supreme craft among crafts The chariotcraft Archery Swordsmanship Signaling Calculating Accounting Writing Literary composition Cosmology Some said Geomancy is the supreme craft among crafts And this discussion came to no conclusion
Then the Blessed One emerging from his seclusion in the late afternoon went to the pavilion and on arrival sat down on a seat laid out
As he was sitting there he addressed the monks For what topic are you sitting together here
And what was the discussion that came to no conclusion
Just now lord after the meal on returning from our alms round we were sitting gathered together here at the pavilion when this discussion arose 
It isn't proper monks that sons of good families on having gone forth out of faith from home to the homeless life should talk on such a topic
When you have gathered you have two duties either Dhammatalk or noble silence
Then on realizing the significance of that the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed
Indeed the Blessed One is worthy and rightly selfawakened consummate in knowledge  conduct wellgone an expert with regard to the world unexcelled as a trainer for those people fit to be tamed the Teacher of divine  human beings awakened blessed
The Dhamma is wellexpounded by the Blessed One to be seen here  now timeless inviting verification pertinent to be realized by the wise for themselves
The Sangha of the Blessed One's disciples who have practiced well who have practiced straightforwardly who have practiced methodically who have practiced masterfully  in other words the four types when taken as pairs the eight when taken as individual types  they are the Sangha of the Blessed One's disciples worthy of gifts worthy of hospitality worthy of offerings worthy of respect the incomparable field of merit for the world
There is the case where a disciple of the noble ones has gone to the Buddha for refuge
This is the first reward of merit reward of skillfulness nourishment of happiness celestial resulting in happiness leading to heaven leading to what is desirable pleasurable  appealing to welfare  to happiness
Furthermore the disciple of the noble ones has gone to the Dhamma for refuge
This is the second reward of merit
Furthermore the disciple of the noble ones has gone to the Sangha for refuge
This is the third reward of merit
When the Exalted One had spoken thus Sigala the young householder said as follows
Excellent Lord excellent
It is as if Lord a man were to set upright that which was overturned or were to reveal that which was hidden or were to point out the way to one who had gone astray or were to hold a lamp amidst the darkness so that those who have eyes may see
Even so has the doctrine been explained in various ways by the Exalted One
I take refuge Lord in the Buddha the Dhamma and the Sangha
May the Exalted One receive me as a lay follower as one who has taken refuge from this very day to life's end
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Kuṇḍiya in the Kuṇḍiṭṭhāna forest
And on that occasion Suppavāsā the Koliyandaughter had been seven years pregnant and seven days in difficult labor
She  touched by fierce sharp pains  endured them with three thoughts How rightly selfawakened is the Blessed One who abandoning this sort of suffering teaches the Dhamma
How wellpracticed is the community of the Blessed One's disciples who practice abandoning this sort of suffering
How truly blissful is unbinding where this sort of pain is not found
Then Suppavāsā said to her husband Come young master
Go to the Blessed One and on arrival showing reverence with your head to his feet in my name ask whether he is free from illness  affliction is carefree strong  living in comfort saying 'Suppavāsā the Koliyandaughter lord shows reverence with her head to your feet and asks whether you are free from illness  affliction are carefree strong  living in comfort' And say this 'Suppavāsā has been seven years pregnant and seven days in difficult labor
She  touched by fierce sharp pains  endures them with three thoughts How rightly selfawakened is the Blessed One who abandoning this sort of suffering teaches the Dhamma
How wellpracticed is the community of the Blessed One's disciples who practice abandoning this sort of suffering
How truly blissful is unbinding where this sort of pain is not found' Responding Excellent to Suppavāsā the Koliyandaughter the Koliyanson went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to the Blessed One sat to one side
As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One Suppavāsā the Koliyandaughter lord shows reverence with her head to your feet and asks whether you are free from illness  affliction are carefree strong  living in comfort
And she says this 'Suppavāsā has been seven years pregnant and seven days in difficult labor
She  touched by fierce sharp pains  endures them with three thoughts How rightly selfawakened is the Blessed One who abandoning this sort of suffering teaches the Dhamma
How wellpracticed is the community of the Blessed One's disciples who practice abandoning this sort of suffering
How truly blissful is unbinding where this sort of pain is not found' May Suppavāsā the Koliyandaughter be well  free from disease
And may she deliver a son free from disease And at the same time as the Blessed One's statement Suppavāsā the Koliyandaughter  well  free from disease  delivered a son free from disease
Saying Very well lord the Koliyanson delighting in  approving of the Blessed One's words got up from his seat bowed down to the Blessed One and  circling him to the right  returned to his home
He saw that Suppavāsā the Koliyandaughter  well  free from disease  had delivered a son free from disease
On seeing this the thought occurred to him How amazing
How astounding
 the Tathāgata's great power great might in that at the same time as the Blessed One's statement Suppavāsā the Koliyandaughter  well  free from disease  would deliver a son free from disease Gratified he was joyful rapturous  happy
Then Suppavāsā said to her husband Come young master
Go to the Blessed One and on arrival showing reverence with your head to his feet in my name saying 'Suppavāsā the Koliyandaughter lord shows reverence with her head to your feet' And say this 'Suppavāsā who was seven years pregnant and seven days in difficult labor has now  well  free from disease  delivered a son free from disease
She invites the community of monks with the Buddha at its head for seven days of meals
May the Blessed One acquiesce to Suppavāsā's seven meals together with the community of monks' Responding Excellent to Suppavāsā the Koliyandaughter the Koliyanson went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to the Blessed One sat to one side
As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One Suppavāsā the Koliyandaughter lord shows reverence with her head to your feet
And she says this 'Suppavāsā who was seven years pregnant and seven days in difficult labor has now  well  free from disease  delivered a son free from disease
She invites the community of monks with the Buddha at its head for seven days of meals
May the Blessed One acquiesce to Suppavāsā's seven meals together with the community of monks' Now at that time a certain lay follower had invited the community of monks with the Buddha at its head for the next day's meal
That lay follower was a supporter of Ven
Mahā Moggallāna
So the Blessed One addressed Ven
Mahā Moggallāna Come Moggallāna
Go to the lay follower and on arrival say to him 'Suppavāsā the Koliyandaughter who was seven years pregnant and seven days in difficult labor has now  well  free from disease  delivered a son free from disease
She has invited the community of monks with the Buddha at its head for seven days of meals
Let Suppavāsā do seven meals
Afterward you will do yours' He's your supporter
Responding As you say lord to the Blessed One Ven
Moggallāna went to the lay follower and on arrival said to him Suppavāsā the Koliyandaughter who was seven years pregnant and seven days in difficult labor has now  well  free from disease  delivered a son free from disease
She has invited the community of monks with the Buddha at its head for seven days of meals
Let Suppavāsā do seven meals afterward you will do yours
Venerable sir if Ven
Moggallāna will be my guarantor for three things  wealth life  faith  then let Suppavāsā do seven meals afterward I will do mine
For two things friend will I be your guarantor your wealth  life
Only you are the guarantor of your faith
Venerable sir if Ven
Moggallāna will be my guarantor for two things  wealth  life  then let Suppavāsā do seven meals afterward I will do mine
Then Ven
Moggallāna having conciliated the lay follower went to the Blessed One and on arrival said The lay follower lord has been conciliated
Let Suppavāsā do seven meals afterward he will do his
So for seven days Suppavāsā the Koliyandaughter with her own hand served  satisfied the community of monks with the Buddha at its head with exquisite staple  nonstaple food
And she had the child show reverence to the Blessed One and the community of monks
Then Ven
Sāriputta said to the child I trust child that things are bearable for you
I trust that things are comfortable for you
I trust that there's no pain
From where Ven
Sāriputta would things be bearable for me
From where would they be comfortable for me living seven years in a belly of blood
Then Suppavāsā  My son is conversing with the Dhamma General  was gratified joyful rapturous  happy
The Blessed One knowing that Suppavāsā was gratified joyful rapturous  happy said to her Suppavāsā would you like to have another son like this
O Blessed One lord I would like to have seven more sons like this
Then on realizing the significance of that the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Rājagaha at the Bamboo Grove the Squirrels' refuge
Now at on that occasion Ven
Pilindavaccha went around addressing the monks as if they were outcastes
So a large number of monks went to the Blessed One and on arrival bowed down to him and sat to one side
As they were sitting there they said to him Lord Ven
Pilindavaccha goes around addressing the monks as if they were outcastes
Then the Blessed One told a certain monk Come monk
In my name call Pilindavaccha saying 'The Teacher calls you friend Vaccha' Responding As you say lord to the Blessed One the monk went to Ven
Pilindavaccha and on arrival said to him The Teacher calls you friend Vaccha
Responding As you say my friend to the monk Ven
Pilindavaccha went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side
As he was sitting there the Blessed One said to him Is it true Pilindavaccha that you go around addressing the monks as if they were outcastes
Yes lord
Then the Blessed One having directed attention to Ven
Pilindavaccha's previous lives said to the monks Don't take offense at the monk Vaccha
It's not out of inner hatred that he goes around addressing the monks as if they were outcastes
For consecutive lifetimes the monk Vaccha has been born in brahman families
For a long time he has been accustomed to addressing people as outcastes
That's why he goes around addressing the monks as if they were outcastes
Then on realizing the significance of that the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying at Uruvelā on the bank of the Nerañjarā River at the root of the Bodhi tree  the tree of awakening  newly awakened
And on that occasion he sat at the root of the Bodhi tree for seven days in one session sensitive to the bliss of release
At the end of seven days he emerged from that concentration
Then a certain overbearing brahman went to the Blessed One and on arrival exchanged courteous greetings with him
After an exchange of friendly greetings  courtesies he stood to one side
As he was standing there he said to the Blessed One To what extent Master Gotama is one a brahman
And which are the qualities that make one a brahman
Then on realizing the significance of that the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed
Kisa Gotami has two of the most heartrending stories in the Buddhist tradition associated with her name
The Commentary to this verse tells that when her young child had died she refused to believe it was dead
After asking many people  in vain  for medicine that would revive the child she was finally directed to the Buddha
When she told him her story he offered to provide medicine for the child but he would need some mustard seed  the cheapest Indian spice  obtained from a family in which no one had died
She went from house to house asking for mustard seed and no one refused to give it to her
But when she asked if anyone had died in the family the universal response was always Oh yes of course After a while the message sunk in Death is universal
On abandoning the child's body to a charnel ground she returned to the Buddha and asked to be ordained as a nun and afterwards became an arahant
The canonical verses associated with Kisa Gotami's name however tell a different story which is identical to the story that the Commentary attributes to Patacara Pregnant with her second child she was returning to her parents' home along with her husband and small firstborn child to give birth
Along the way a great storm blew up and she asked her husband to provide shelter for the family
As he was cutting grass and sticks to build a shelter a snake bit him and he died of the poison
Unsheltered and wondering at her husband's long absence Patacara gave birth and had to spend the night sheltering both her children against the rain and wind with nothing more than her body
The next morning she found her husband dead
Distraught she decided to return to her parents' home
However a river  swollen from the rain of the previous night  ran across her way
Unable to carry both children across the river she left her firstborn on the near bank and waded through the raging current carrying her baby
Placing the baby on the far bank she turned back to fetch her firstborn
A hawk seeing the baby took it for a piece of flesh and swooped down on it
Seeing this Patacara raised her hands and tried to chase it away but to no avail The hawk picked up the baby and carried it off
Meanwhile her firstborn  seeing his mother raising her hands  took it for a signal to cross the river
As he jumped into the raging current he was carried off to his death
Overwhelmed with grief Patacara returned to her parents' home only to learn that it had burned down from a lightning strike in the previous night's storm
Her parents and brother were at that moment being cremated on a single pyre
At this point she went mad and began wandering around halfnaked
Only on coming into the Buddha's presence did she recover her senses
He taught her the Dhamma and eventually she ordained and became an arahant
Why this story is attributed to Patacara in the Commentary when it is obviously Kisa Gotami's in the Canon is hard to tell
Some scholars have suggested that the tales in the Pali commentaries were imported from other Buddhist traditions such as the Mulasarvastivadin
Thus the differences between the canonical verses and the commentarial tales stem from the fact that the different traditions attributed particular stories to different elder monks and nuns
For instance the Pali Canon attributed the story of the woman whose family was destroyed in a single day to Kisa Gotami while the tradition from which the Commentary drew attributed it to Patacara
If that's the case it's interesting to note how the commentators who adopted these tales nevertheless remained faithful to their Canon
Instead of trying to change the Pali to fit with the commentarial source on which they drew they allowed the discrepancies between the two sources to stand one of many instances in which the discrepancies between the Canon and the commentaries suggest that the monks who handed down the Pali Canon tried to keep it intact even when they didn't agree with it

Later Theravadin texts have tried to cover over the discrepancies between Kisa Gotami's verses and the Commentary to those verses by insisting that the passage in the verses beginning Going along about to give birth and ending my husband dead I reached the Deathless is actually Patacara speaking but this seems unlikely Why would one arahant butt in on another one's tale
At any rate regardless of which story is Patacara's and which Kisa Gotami's both speak to the universality of death and the power of the path of practice that in the midst of this human world with all its sorrows there is still a way to find that which is free from grieving aging and illness the Deathless
The Suttavibhanga contains the basic training rules for bhikkhus and bhikkhunis along with the origin story for each one
These rules are summarized in the Patimokkha and amount to rules for the bhikkhus for the bhikkhunis
The Patimokkkha rules are grouped as follows
Translator's note The verses here fall into three sections with the first two relating to Ratthapala's story as told in MN
In the first Ratthapala is addressing his father after the latter had tried to use wealth and Ratthapala's former wives to lure Ratthapala into disrobing
In the second section Ratthapala is talking to King Koravya who had asked him why he had ordained when he was still young and healthy and had suffered no loss of relatives or wealth
The third section of verses here does not occur in MN
Translator's note This discourse mentions the metaphorical notion of heartwood three times
Although sara as a metaphor is often translated as essence this misses some of the metaphor's implications
When x is said to have y as its heartwood that means that the proper development of x yields y and that y is the most valuable part of x  just as a tree as it matures develops heartwood and the heartwood is the most valuable part of the tree
Translator's note Although it is often lost in translation this poem in the Pali has a clearly articulated overall structure
The first seven verses  coming under the because  state reasons while the last verse under the so draws the conclusion find a good teacher and practice the Dhamma
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Savatthi in the Eastern Monastery the palace of Migara's mother
Now on that occasion  the Uposatha day of the fifteenth the fullmoon night  the Blessed One was sitting in the open air surrounded by the community of monks
Surveying the silent community of monks he addressed them Monks if there are any who ask 'Your listening to teachings that are skillful noble leading onward going to selfawakening is a prerequisite for what' they should be told 'For the sake of knowing qualities of dualities as they actually are' 'What duality are you speaking about' 'This is stress
This is the origination of stress' this is one contemplation
'This is the cessation of stress
This is the path of practice leading to the cessation of stress' this is a second contemplation
For a monk rightly contemplating this duality in this way  heedful ardent  resolute  one of two fruits can be expected either gnosis right here  now or  if there be any remnant of clingingsustenance  nonreturn
That is what the Blessed One said
Having said that the One Wellgone the Teacher said further
Now if there are any who ask 'Would there be the right contemplation of dualities in yet another way' they should be told 'There would' 'How would that be' 'Whatever stress comes into play is all from acquisition as a requisite condition' this is one contemplation
'From the remainderless fading  cessation of that very acquisition there is no coming into play of stress' this is a second contemplation
For a monk rightly contemplating this duality in this way  heedful ardent  resolute  one of two fruits can be expected either gnosis right here  now or  if there be any remnant of clingingsustenance  nonreturn
That is what the Blessed One said
Having said that the One Wellgone the Teacher said further
Now if there are any who ask 'Would there be the right contemplation of dualities in yet another way' they should be told 'There would' 'How would that be' 'Whatever stress comes into play is all from ignorance as a requisite condition' this is one contemplation
'From the remainderless fading  cessation of that very ignorance there is no coming into play of stress' this is a second contemplation
For a monk rightly contemplating this duality in this way  heedful ardent  resolute  one of two fruits can be expected either gnosis right here  now or  if there be any remnant of clingingsustenance  nonreturn
That is what the Blessed One said
Having said that the One Wellgone the Teacher said further
Now if there are any who ask 'Would there be the right contemplation of dualities in yet another way' they should be told 'There would' 'How would that be' 'Whatever stress comes into play is all from fabrication as a requisite condition' this is one contemplation
'From the remainderless fading  cessation of that very fabrication there is no coming into play of stress' this is a second contemplation
For a monk rightly contemplating this duality in this way  heedful ardent  resolute  one of two fruits can be expected either gnosis right here  now or  if there be any remnant of clingingsustenance  nonreturn
That is what the Blessed One said

Gratified the monks delighted in the Blessed One's words
And while this explanation was being given the minds of monks through lack of clinging were fully released from fermentation
I have heard that at one time the Blessed One was staying in Savatthi at Jeta's Grove Anathapindika's monastery
Then a certain deva in the far extreme of the night her extreme radiance lighting up the entirety of Jeta's Grove approached the Blessed One
On approaching having bowed down to the Blessed One she stood to one side
As she stood to one side she addressed him with a verse
This the first book in the Khuddaka Nikaya appears to have been designed as a primer for novice monks and nuns
In nine short passages it covers the basic topics that one would need to know in beginning Buddhist monastic life many of the passages also serve as useful introductions to Buddhist practice in general
Passages and cover the ceremony for taking ordination as a novice
Passage gives preliminary guidance in the contemplation of the body a meditation exercise designed to overcome lust
Passage introduces many of the basic categories of analysis through which discernment can be developed beginning with the most basic formulation of the causal principle so central to the Buddha's teaching
Passage gives an overview of the practice as a whole  beginning with the need to associate with wise people and ending with the attainment of Unbinding
This overview is presented in the context of the concept of protective rituals and makes the point that  given the nature of human action and its results  the best protection comes not from rituals but from acting in a generous moral and wise manner
Passage expands both on Passage and Passage detailing some of the virtues of the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha while at the same time elaborating on the practice of meditation and the attainment of streamentry  the point at which the meditator has hisher first glimpse of Unbinding
Passage elaborates on the theme of generosity showing how gifts to the Sangha can be dedicated to the welfare of one's dead relatives
Passage presents meritorious action in general as an investment more reliable and longerlasting than material investments
Passage returns to the subject of meditation focusing on the development of goodwill and lovingkindness
These nine passages in different contexts are frequently chanted in Theravada countries even today
Lay and ordained Buddhists chant Passage daily as an affirmation of their refuge in the Triple Gem
Monks will often chant Passages  as blessings when lay people make merit and frequently use verses from Passage as sermon themes
Thus the passages contained in this book serve as a useful introduction both to early Buddhist training and to modern Theravada practices

There are beings with diversity of body and diversity of perception such as human beings some devas and some beings in the lower realms
This is the first station of consciousness
There are beings with diversity of body and singularity of perception such as the devas of the Brahma hosts generated by the first
This is the second station of consciousness
There are beings with singularity of body and diversity of perception such as the Radiant Devas
This is the third station of consciousness
There are beings with singularity of body and singularity of perception such as the Beautifully Lustrous Devas
This is the fourth station of consciousness
There are beings who with the complete transcending of perceptions of form with the disappearance of perceptions of resistance and not heeding perceptions of diversity 'Infinite space' arrive at the dimension of the infinitude of space
This is the fifth station of consciousness
There are beings who with the complete transcending of the dimension of the infinitude of space 'Infinite consciousness' arrive at the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness
This is the sixth station of consciousness
There are beings who with the complete transcending of the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness 'There is nothing' arrive at the dimension of nothingness
This is the seventh station of consciousness
The dimension of nonpercipient beings and second the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception
These are the two spheres

I have heard that at one time the Blessed One was staying in Savatthi at Jeta's Grove Anathapindika's monastery
Then a certain deva in the far extreme of the night her extreme radiance lighting up the entirety of Jeta's Grove approached the Blessed One
On approaching having bowed down to the Blessed One she stood to one side
As she stood to one side she addressed him with a verse
Possessed of form one sees forms
This is the first emancipation
Not percipient of form internally one sees forms externally
This is the second emancipation
One is intent only on the beautiful
This is the third emancipation
With the complete transcending of perceptions of form with the disappearance of perceptions of resistance and not heeding perceptions of diversity 'Infinite space' one enters and remains in the dimension of the infinitude of space
This is the fourth emancipation
With the complete transcending of the dimension of the infinitude of space 'Infinite consciousness' one enters and remains in the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness
This is the fifth emancipation
With the complete transcending of the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness 'There is nothing' one enters and remains in the dimension of nothingness
This is the sixth emancipation
With the complete transcending of the dimension of nothingness one enters and remains in the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception
This is the seventh emancipation
With the complete transcending of the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception one enters and remains in the cessation of perception and feeling
This is the eighth emancipation
Now when a monk attains these eight emancipations in forward order in reverse order in forward and reverse order when he attains them and emerges from them wherever he wants however he wants and for as long as he wants when through the ending of the mental fermentations he enters and remains in the fermentationfree awarenessrelease and discernmentrelease having directly known it and realized it in the here and now he is said to be a monk released in both ways
And as for another release in both ways higher or more sublime than this there is none
This was said by the Blessed One said by the Arahant so I have heard I am a brahman responsive to requests openhanded bearing my last body an unsurpassed doctor  surgeon
You are my children my sons born from my mouth born of the Dhamma created by the Dhamma heirs to the Dhamma not heirs in material things
There are these two kinds of gifts a gift of material things  a gift of the Dhamma
Of the two this is supreme a gift of the Dhamma
There are these two kinds of sharing sharing of material things  sharing of the Dhamma
Of the two this is supreme sharing of the Dhamma
There are these two kinds of assistance assistance with material things  assistance with the Dhamma
Of the two this is supreme help with the Dhamma
There are these two kinds of massdonations a massdonation of material things  a massdonation of the Dhamma
Of the two this is supreme a massdonation of the Dhamma
This was said by the Blessed One said by the Arahant so I have heard These four things are next to nothing both easy to gain  blameless
Which four
Castoff cloth is next to nothing both easy to gain  blameless
Alms food is next to nothing both easy to gain  blameless
The root of a tree as a dwelling place is next to nothing both easy to gain  blameless
Medicine made of smelly urine is next to nothing both easy to gain  blameless
These are the four things that are next to nothing both easy to gain  blameless
When a monk is content with what is next to nothing easy to gain  blameless then I say that he has one of the component factors of the contemplative life
This was said by the Blessed One said by the Arahant so I have heard For one knowing  seeing I tell you there is the ending of fermentations not for one not knowing  seeing
For one knowing what  seeing what is there the ending of fermentations
For one knowing  seeing 'This is stress' there is the ending of fermentations
For one knowing  seeing 'This is the origination of stress' there is the ending of fermentations
For one knowing  seeing 'This is the cessation of stress' there is the ending of fermentations
For one knowing  seeing 'This is the path of practice leading to the cessation of stress' there is the ending of fermentations
For one knowing in this way and seeing in this way is there the ending of fermentations
This was said by the Blessed One said by the Arahant so I have heard Any brahmans or contemplatives who do not discern as it actually is present that 'This is stress' that 'This is the origination of stress' that 'This is the cessation of stress' who do not discern as it actually is present that 'This is the path of practice leading to the cessation of stress' to me these brahmans  contemplatives do not count as brahmans among brahmans or as contemplatives among contemplatives
Furthermore they do not enter  remain in the goal of the priestly life or the goal of the contemplative life having directly known  made it manifest for themselves right in the present life
But any brahmans or contemplatives who discern as it actually is present that 'This is stress' that 'This is the origination of stress' that 'This is the cessation of stress' who discern as it actually is present that 'This is the path of practice leading to the cessation of stress' to me these brahmans  contemplatives count as brahmans among brahmans and as contemplatives among contemplatives
Furthermore they enter  remain in the goal of the priestly life  the goal of the contemplative life having directly known  made it manifest for themselves right in the present life
This was said by the Blessed One said by the Arahant so I have heard Those monks who are consummate in virtue consummate in concentration consummate in discernment consummate in release consummate in the knowledge  vision of release who exhort demonstrate instruct urge rouse  encourage who are competent rightly to point out the true Dhamma seeing them I tell you accomplishes a great deal listening to them approaching them attending to them recollecting them following them in going forth accomplishes a great deal
Why is that
By associating with monks of this sort sharing with them attending on them the asyetunculminated aggregate of virtue goes to the culmination of its development the asyetunculminated aggregate of concentration goes to the culmination of its development the asyetunculminated aggregate of discernment goes to the culmination of its development the asyetunculminated aggregate of release goes to the culmination of its development the asyetunculminated aggregate of knowledge  vision of release goes to the culmination of its development
Monks of this sort are said to be teachers leaders abandoners of harm dispellers of darkness makers of light makers of radiance makers of brightness makers of brilliance bringers of illumination noble ones endowed with eyes that see
This was said by the Blessed One said by the Arahant so I have heard There are these four birthplaces of craving where a monk's craving when taking birth takes birth
Which four
Either for the sake of cloth a monk's craving when taking birth takes birth
Or for the sake of alms food a monk's craving when taking birth takes birth
Or for the sake of lodging a monk's craving when taking birth takes birth
Or for the sake of becoming or not becoming this or that a monk's craving when taking birth takes birth
These are the four birthplaces of craving where a monk's craving when taking birth takes birth
This was said by the Blessed One said by the Arahant so I have heard Living with Brahma are those families where in the home mother  father are revered by the children
Living with the first devas are those families where in the home mother  father are revered by the children
Living with the first teachers are those families where in the home mother  father are revered by the children
Living with those worthy of gifts are those families where in the home mother  father are revered by the children
'Brahma' is a designation for mother  father
'The first devas' is a designation for mother  father
'The first teachers' is a designation for mother  father
'Those worthy of gifts' is a designation for mother  father
Why is that
Mother  father do much for their children
They care for them nourish them introduce them to this world

This was said by the Blessed One said by the Arahant so I have heard Monks brahmans  householders are very helpful to you as they provide you with the requisites of robes alms food lodgings  medical requisites for the sick
And you monks are very helpful to brahmans  householders as you teach them the Dhamma admirable in the beginning admirable in the middle admirable in the end as you expound the holy life both in letter  meaning entirely complete surpassingly pure
In this way the holy life is lived in mutual dependence for the purpose of crossing over the flood for making a right end to stress
This was said by the Blessed One said by the Arahant so I have heard Any monks who are deceitful stubborn talkers frauds arrogant  uncentered are not followers of mine
They have turned away from this DhammaVinaya
They attain in terms of this DhammaVinaya no growth increase or abundance
But any monks who are not deceitful not talkers who are enlightened pliant  wellcentered they are followers of mine
They have not turned away from this DhammaVinaya
They attain in terms of this DhammaVinaya growth increase  abundance
This was said by the Blessed One said by the Arahant so I have heard Suppose a man was being carried along by the flow of a river lovely  alluring
And then another man with good eyesight standing on the bank on seeing him would say 'My good man even though you are being carried along by the flow of a river lovely  alluring further down from here is a pool with waves  whirlpools with monsters  demons
On reaching that pool you will suffer death or deathlike pain' Then the first man on hearing the words of the second man would make an effort with his hands  feet to go against the flow
I have given you this simile to illustrate a meaning
The meaning is this the flow of the river stands for craving
Lovely  alluring stands for the six internal sensemedia
The pool further down stands for the five lower fetters
The waves stand for anger  distress
The whirlpools stand for the five strings of sensuality
The monsters  demons stand for the opposite sex
Against the flow stands for renunciation
Making an effort with hands  feet stands for the arousing of persistence
The man with good eyesight standing on the bank stands for the Tathagata worthy  rightly selfawakened
This was said by the Blessed One said by the Arahant so I have heard If while he is walking there arises in a monk a thought of sensuality a thought of illwill or a thought of harmfulness and he does not quickly abandon dispel demolish or wipe that thought out of existence then a monk walking with such a lack of ardency  concern is called continually  continuously lethargic  low in his persistence
If while he is standing

If while he is lying down there arises in a monk a thought of sensuality a thought of illwill or a thought of harmfulness and he does not quickly abandon dispel demolish or wipe that thought out of existence then a monk lying down with such a lack of ardency  concern is called continually  continuously lethargic  low in his persistence
But if while he is walking there arises in a monk a thought of sensuality a thought of illwill or a thought of harmfulness and he quickly abandons dispels demolishes  wipes that thought out of existence then a monk walking with such ardency  concern is called continually  continuously resolute one with persistence aroused

This was said by the Blessed One said by the Arahant so I have heard Be consummate in virtue monks and consummate in the Patimokkha
Dwell restrained in accordance with the Patimokkha consummate in your behavior  sphere of activity
Train yourselves having undertaken the training rules seeing danger in the slightest faults
When one is consummate in virtue consummate in the Patimokkha dwelling restrained in accordance with the Patimokkha consummate in one's behavior  sphere of activity training oneself having undertaken the training rules seeing danger in the slightest faults  what more is to be done
If while he is walking any greed in a monk is done away with any ill will any sloth  drowsiness any restlessness  anxiety any uncertainty is done away with if his persistence is aroused and not lax if his mindfulness is established  unmuddled if his body is calm  unaroused if his mind is centered  unified then a monk walking with such ardency  concern is called continually  continuously resolute one with persistence aroused

This was said by the Blessed One said by the Arahant so I have heard The world has been fully awakened to by the Tathagata
From the world the Tathagata is disjoined
The origination of the world has been fully awakened to by the Tathagata
The origination of the world has by the Tathagata been abandoned
The cessation of the world has been fully awakened to by the Tathagata
The cessation of the world has by the Tathagata been realized
The path leading to the cessation of the world has been fully awakened to by the Tathagata
The path leading to the cessation of the world has by the Tathagata been developed
Whatever in this world  with its devas Maras  Brahmas its generations complete with contemplatives  brahmans princes  men  is seen heard sensed cognized attained sought after pondered by the intellect that has been fully awakened to by the Tathagata
Thus he is called the Tathagata
From the night the Tathagata fully awakens to the unsurpassed Right Selfawakening to the night he is totally unbound in the Unbinding property with no fuel remaining whatever the Tathagata has said spoken explained is just so and not otherwise
Thus he is called the Tathagata
The Tathagata is one who does in line with what he teaches one who teaches in line with what he does
Thus he is called the Tathagata
In this world with its devas Maras  Brahmas its generations complete with contemplatives  brahmans princes  men the Tathagata is the unconquered conqueror allseeing the wielder of power
Thus he is called the Tathagata This is the meaning of what the Blessed One said

Thinking 'I have not done what is admirable' he feels remorse

These are the two things that cause remorse
This was said by the Blessed One said by the Arahant so I have heard There are these two things that cause no remorse

This was said by the Blessed One said by the Arahant so I have heard A person without ardor without concern is incapable of selfawakening incapable of Unbinding incapable of attaining the unsurpassed safety from bondage
A person ardent  concerned is capable of selfawakening capable of Unbinding capable of attaining the unsurpassed safety from bondage
This was said by the Blessed One said by the Arahant so I have heard Monks this holy life is lived not for the sake of deceiving people not for the sake of inveigling people not for the sake of the rewards of gain offerings  tribute nor with the thought 'Thus may people know me' This holy life is lived for the sake of restraint  abandoning
This was said by the Blessed One said by the Arahant so I have heard Monks this holy life is lived not for the sake of deceiving people not for the sake of inveigling people not for the sake of the rewards of gain offerings  tribute nor with the thought 'Thus may people know me' This holy life is lived for the sake of direct knowledge  full comprehension
This was said by the Blessed One said by the Arahant so I have heard Endowed with two things a monk lives in ease in the present life and is appropriately aroused for the ending of the fermentations
Which two
A sense of urgency  awe toward things that should inspire urgency  awe and feeling urgency  awe appropriate exertion
Endowed with two things a monk lives in ease in the present life and is appropriately aroused for the ending of the fermentations
This was said by the Blessed One said by the Arahant so I have heard Two trains of thought often occur to the Tathagata worthy  rightly selfawakened the thought of safety  that of seclusion
The Tathagata enjoys nonill will delights in nonill will
To him  enjoying nonill will delighting in nonill will  this thought often occurs 'By this activity I harm no one at all whether weak or firm'
The Tathagata enjoys seclusion delights in seclusion
To him  enjoying seclusion delighting in seclusion  this thought often occurs 'Whatever is unskillful is abandoned'
Thus monks you too should live enjoying nonill will delighting in nonill will
To you  enjoying nonill will delighting in nonill will  this thought will often occur 'By this activity we harm no one at all whether weak or firm'
You too should live enjoying seclusion delighting in seclusion
To you  enjoying seclusion delighting in seclusion  this thought will often occur 'What is unskillful
What is not yet abandoned
What are we abandoning' This was said by the Blessed One said by the Arahant so I have heard The Tathagata  worthy  rightly selfawakened  has two Dhamma discourses given in sequence
Which two
'See evil as evil' This is the first Dhamma discourse
'Having seen evil as evil become disenchanted there dispassionate there released' This is the second Dhamma discourse
These are the two Dhamma discourses that the Tathagata  worthy  rightly selfawakened  has given in sequence
This was said by the Blessed One said by the Arahant so I have heard Ignorance precedes the arrival of unskillful qualities lack of conscience  lack of concern follow after
Clear knowing precedes the arrival of skillful qualities conscience  concern follow after
This was said by the Blessed One said by the Arahant so I have heard Those beings are truly deprived who are deprived of noble discernment
They live in stress in the present life  troubled distressed  feverish  and at the breakup of the body after death a bad destination can be expected
Those beings are not deprived who are not deprived of noble discernment
They live in ease in the present life  untroubled undistressed  not feverish  and at the breakup of the body after death a good destination can be expected
This was said by the Blessed One said by the Arahant so I have heard There are these two bright qualities that safeguard the world
Which two
Conscience  concern
If these two bright qualities did not guard the world there would be no recognition of 'mother' here no recognition of 'mother's sister' 'uncle's wife' 'teacher's wife' or 'wife of those who deserve respect' The world would be immersed in promiscuity like rams with goats roosters with pigs or dogs with jackals
But because these two bright qualities guard the world there is recognition of 'mother' 'mother's sister' 'uncle's wife' 'teacher's wife'  'wife of those who deserve respect' This was said by the Blessed One said by the Arahant so I have heard There is monks an unborn  unbecome  unmade  unfabricated
If there were not that unborn  unbecome  unmade  unfabricated there would not be the case that emancipation from the born  become  made  fabricated would be discerned
But precisely because there is an unborn  unbecome  unmade  unfabricated emancipation from the born  become  made  fabricated is thus discerned
This was said by the Blessed One said by the Arahant so I have heard Monks there are these two forms of the Unbinding property
Which two
The Unbinding property with fuel remaining  the Unbinding property with no fuel remaining
And what is the Unbinding property with fuel remaining
There is the case where a monk is an arahant whose fermentations have ended who has reached fulfillment finished the task laid down the burden attained the true goal ended the fetter of becoming and is released through right gnosis

Which three
Among whatever beings there may be  footless twofooted fourfooted many footed with form or formless percipient nonpercipient neither percipient nor nonpercipient  the Tathagata worthy  rightly selfawakened is considered supreme

This was said by the Blessed One said by the Arahant so I have heard This is a lowly means of livelihood alms gathering
It's a form of abuse in the world 'You go around as an alms gatherer with a bowl in your hand' Yet sensible young men of good families have taken it up for a compelling reason
They have not been forced into it by kings or robbers nor through debt through fear nor through the loss of their livelihood but through the thought 'We are beset by birth aging  death by sorrows lamentations pains distresses  despairs beset by stress overcome with stress
O that the end of this entire mass of suffering  stress might be known' But this young man of good family having gone forth in this way may be greedy for sensual pleasures strong in his passions malevolent in mind corrupt in his resolves his mindfulness muddled unalert uncentered his mind scattered  his faculties uncontrolled
Just as a firebrand from a funeral pyre  burning at both ends covered with excrement in the middle  is used as fuel neither in a village nor in the wilderness I tell you that this is a simile for this person
He has missed out on the householder's enjoyments and does not fulfill the purpose of the contemplative life

This was said by the Blessed One said by the Arahant so I have heard Even if a monk taking hold of my outer cloak were to follow right behind me placing his feet in my footsteps yet if he were to be greedy for sensual pleasures strong in his passions malevolent in mind corrupt in his resolves his mindfulness muddled unalert uncentered his mind scattered  his faculties uncontrolled then he would be far from me and I from him
Why is that
Because he does not see the Dhamma
Not seeing the Dhamma he does not see me
But even if a monk were to live one hundred leagues away yet if he were to have no greed for sensual objects were not strong in his passions not malevolent in mind uncorrupt in his resolves his mindfulness established alert centered his mind at singleness  his faculties wellrestrained then he would be near to me and I to him
Why is that
Because he sees the Dhamma
Seeing the Dhamma he sees me

Untied from the yoke of sensuality but tied by the yoke of becoming one is a nonreturner not returning to this state
Untied from the yoke of sensuality  from the yoke of becoming one is an arahant whose fermentations are ended

And how is it on the strength of Dhamma that I describe a brahman with threefold knowledge and not another as measured by citing  reciting
There is the case where a monk recollects his manifold past lives ie one birth two five ten fifty a hundred a thousand a hundred thousand many aeons of cosmic contraction many aeons of cosmic expansion many aeons of cosmic contraction  expansion 'There I had such a name belonged to such a clan had such an appearance
Such was my food such my experience of pleasure  pain such the end of my life
Passing away from that state I rearose there
There too I had such a name belonged to such a clan had such an appearance
Such was my food such my experience of pleasure  pain such the end of my life
Passing away from that state I rearose here' Thus he recollects his manifold past lives in their modes  details
This is the first knowledge he has attained
Ignorance has been destroyed knowledge has arisen darkness has been destroyed light has arisen  as happens in one who is heedful ardent  resolute
Then again the monk sees  by means of the divine eye purified  surpassing the human  beings passing away  reappearing and I discerned how they are inferior  superior beautiful  ugly fortunate  unfortunate in accordance with their actions 'These beings  who were endowed with bodily misconduct verbal misconduct  mental misconduct who reviled noble ones held wrong views and undertook actions under the influence of wrong views  at the breakup of the body after death have reappeared in the plane of deprivation the bad destination the lower realms in hell
But these beings  who were endowed with bodily good conduct verbal good conduct  mental good conduct who did not revile noble ones who held right views and undertook actions under the influence of right views  at the breakup of the body after death have reappeared in the good destinations in the heavenly world' Thus  by means of the divine eye purified  surpassing the human  he sees beings passing away  reappearing and discerns how they are inferior  superior beautiful  ugly fortunate  unfortunate in accordance with their actions

Monks do not wage wordy warfare saying 'You don't understand this Dhamma and discipline I understand this Dhamma and discipline' 'How could you understand it
You have fallen into wrong practices I have the right practice' 'You have said afterwards what you should have said first and you have said first what you should have said afterwards' 'What I say is consistent what you say isn't' 'What you have thought out for so long is entirely reversed' 'Your statement is refuted' 'You are talking rubbish' 'You are in the wrong' 'Get out of that if you can'
Why should you not do this
Such talk monks is not related to the goal it is not fundamental to the holy life does not conduce to disenchantment dispassion cessation tranquillity higher knowledge enlightenment or to Nibbana
When you have discussions monks you should discuss Suffering the Arising of Suffering its Cessation and the Path that leads to its Cessation
Why is that
Because such talk is related to the goal it conduces to disenchantment to Nibbana
This is the task you must accomplish
Monks these three are causes for the origination of actions
Which three
Greed is a cause for the origination of actions
Aversion is a cause for the origination of actions
Delusion is a cause for the origination of actions
Any action performed with greed  born of greed caused by greed originating from greed wherever one's selfhood turns up there that action will ripen
Where that action ripens there one will experience its fruit either in this very life that has arisen or further along in the sequence
Any action performed with aversion  born of aversion caused by aversion originating from aversion wherever one's selfhood turns up there that action will ripen
Where that action ripens there one will experience its fruit either in this very life that has arisen or further along in the sequence
Any action performed with delusion  born of delusion caused by delusion originating from delusion wherever one's selfhood turns up there that action will ripen
Where that action ripens there one will experience its fruit either in this very life that has arisen or further along in the sequence
Just as when seeds are not broken not rotten not damaged by wind  heat capable of sprouting wellburied planted in wellprepared soil and the raingod would offer good streams of rain
Those seeds would thus come to growth increase  abundance
In the same way any action performed with greed performed with aversion performed with delusion  born of delusion caused by delusion originating from delusion wherever one's selfhood turns up there that action will ripen
Where that action ripens there one will experience its fruit either in this very life that has arisen or further along in the sequence
These are three causes for the origination of actions
Now these three are causes for the origination of actions
Which three
Nongreed is a cause for the origination of actions
Nonaversion is a cause for the origination of actions
Nondelusion is a cause for the origination of actions
Any action performed with nongreed  born of nongreed caused by nongreed originating from nongreed When greed is gone that action is thus abandoned its root destroyed made like a palmyra stump deprived of the conditions of development not destined for future arising
Any action performed with nonaversion  born of nonaversion caused by nonaversion originating from nonaversion When aversion is gone that action is thus abandoned destroyed at the root made like a palmyra stump deprived of the conditions of development not destined for future arising
Any action performed with nondelusion  born of nondelusion caused by nondelusion originating from nondelusion When delusion is gone that action is thus abandoned its root destroyed made like a palmyra stump deprived of the conditions of development not destined for future arising
Just as when seeds are not broken not rotten not damaged by wind  heat capable of sprouting wellburied planted in wellprepared soil and a man would burn them with fire and burning them with fire would make them into fine ashes
Having made them into fine ashes he would winnow them before a high wind or wash them away in a swiftflowing stream
Those seeds would thus be destroyed at the root made like a palmyra stump deprived of the conditions of development not destined for future arising
In the same way any action performed with nongreed performed with nonaversion performed with nondelusion  born of nondelusion caused by nondelusion originating from nondelusion When delusion is gone that action is thus abandoned its root destroyed made like a palmyra stump deprived of the conditions of development not destined for future arising
These monks are three causes for the origination of action
The Commentary notes that this verse refers to the attainment of arahantship and that an arahant  in reaching nibbana  sheds not only bad destinations but also good ones
The word sheds acts as a lamp in this verse  it appears only once but functions in two phrases as I have rendered it in the translation
On the use of the lamp as a literary figure of speech see the Introduction to Dhammapada A Translation

The great earth is far greater lord
The little bit of dust the Blessed One has picked up with the tip of his fingernail is next to nothing
It doesn't even count
It's no comparison
It's not even a fraction this little bit of dust the Blessed One has picked up with the tip of his fingernail when compared with the great earth
In the same way monks few are the beings who on passing away from the human realm are reborn among human beings
Far more are the beings who on passing away from the human realm are reborn in hell
Therefore your duty is the contemplation 'This is stress This is the origination of stress This is the cessation of stress' Your duty is the contemplation 'This is the path of practice leading to the cessation of stress' Then the Blessed One picking up a little bit of dust with the tip of his fingernail said to the monks What do you think monks

Monks suppose that a man were to cut down all the grass sticks branches  leaves in India and to gather them into a heap
Having gathered them into a heap he would make stakes from them and having made stakes he would impale all the large animals in the sea on large stakes all the mediumsized animals in the sea on mediumsized stakes  all the minute animals in the sea on minute stakes
Before he had come to the end of all the sizable animals in the sea all the grass sticks branches  leaves here in India would have been used up and exhausted
It wouldn't be feasible for him to impale on stakes the evenmorenumerous minute animals in the sea
Why is that
Because of the minuteness of their bodies
So great is the plane of deprivation
Freed from this great plane of deprivation is the individual consummate in view who discerns as it has come to be that 'This is stress This is the origination of stress This is the cessation of stress This is the path of practice leading to the cessation of stress'
Therefore your duty is the contemplation 'This is stress This is the origination of stress This is the cessation of stress This is the path of practice leading to the cessation of stress'
Monks these four things are real not unreal not otherwise
Which four
'This is stress' is real not unreal not otherwise

Therefore your duty is the contemplation 'This is stress This is the origination of stress This is the cessation of stress This is the path of practice leading to the cessation of stress'
Monks suppose there was a man whose life span was years who would live to
Someone would say to him 'Look here fellow
They will stab you at dawn with spears at noon with spears  again at evening with spears
You thus stabbed day after day with spears will have a lifespan of years will live to be and at the end of years you will realize the four noble truths that you have never realized before'
Monks a person who desired his own true benefit would do well to take up
Why is that
From an inconceivable beginning comes transmigration
A beginning point is not evident for the blows from spears swords  axes
Even if this were to occur I tell you that the realization of the four noble truths would not be accompanied by pain  distress
Instead I tell you the realization of the four noble truths would be accompanied by pleasure  happiness
Which four
The noble truth of stress the noble truth of the origination of stress the noble truth of the cessation of stress and the noble truth of the path of practice leading to the cessation of stress
Therefore your duty is the contemplation 'This is stress This is the origination of stress This is the cessation of stress This is the path of practice leading to the cessation of stress'
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying at Varanasi in the Game Refuge at Isipatana
There he addressed the group of five monks
There are these two extremes that are not to be indulged in by one who has gone forth
Which two
That which is devoted to sensual pleasure with reference to sensual objects base vulgar common ignoble unprofitable and that which is devoted to selfaffliction painful ignoble unprofitable
Avoiding both of these extremes the middle way realized by the Tathagata  producing vision producing knowledge  leads to calm to direct knowledge to selfawakening to Unbinding
And what is the middle way realized by the Tathagata that  producing vision producing knowledge  leads to calm to direct knowledge to selfawakening to Unbinding
Precisely this Noble Eightfold Path right view right resolve right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness right concentration
This is the middle way realized by the Tathagata that  producing vision producing knowledge  leads to calm to direct knowledge to selfawakening to Unbinding
Now this monks is the noble truth of stress Birth is stressful aging is stressful death is stressful sorrow lamentation pain distress  despair are stressful association with the unbeloved is stressful separation from the loved is stressful not getting what is wanted is stressful
In short the five clingingaggregates are stressful
And this monks is the noble truth of the origination of stress the craving that makes for further becoming  accompanied by passion  delight relishing now here  now there  ie craving for sensual pleasure craving for becoming craving for nonbecoming
And this monks is the noble truth of the cessation of stress the remainderless fading  cessation renunciation relinquishment release  letting go of that very craving
And this monks is the noble truth of the way of practice leading to the cessation of stress precisely this Noble Eightfold Path  right view right resolve right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness right concentration
Vision arose insight arose discernment arose knowledge arose illumination arose within me with regard to things never heard before 'This is the noble truth of stress' Vision arose insight arose discernment arose knowledge arose illumination arose within me with regard to things never heard before 'This noble truth of stress is to be comprehended' Vision arose insight arose discernment arose knowledge arose illumination arose within me with regard to things never heard before' This noble truth of stress has been comprehended'
Vision arose insight arose discernment arose knowledge arose illumination arose within me with regard to things never heard before 'This is the noble truth of the origination of stress' 'This noble truth of the origination of stress is to be abandoned' 'This noble truth of the origination of stress has been abandoned'

And monks as long as this  my threeround twelvepermutation knowledge  vision concerning these four noble truths as they have come to be  was not pure I did not claim to have directly awakened to the right selfawakening unexcelled in the cosmos with its deities Maras  Brahmas with its contemplatives  brahmans its royalty  commonfolk
But as soon as this  my threeround twelvepermutation knowledge  vision concerning these four noble truths as they have come to be  was truly pure then I did claim to have directly awakened to the right selfawakening unexcelled in the cosmos with its deities Maras  Brahmas with its contemplatives  brahmans its royalty  commonfolk
Knowledge  vision arose in me 'Unprovoked is my release
This is the last birth
There is now no further becoming' That is what the Blessed One said
Gratified the group of five monks delighted at his words
And while this explanation was being given there arose to Ven
Kondañña the dustless stainless Dhamma eye Whatever is subject to origination is all subject to cessation
And when the Blessed One had set the Wheel of Dhamma in motion the earth devas cried out At Varanasi in the Game Refuge at Isipatana the Blessed One has set in motion the unexcelled Wheel of Dhamma that cannot be stopped by brahman or contemplative deva Mara or God or anyone in the cosmos On hearing the earth devas' cry the devas of the Four Kings' Heaven took up the cry the devas of the Thirtythree the Yama devas the Tusita devas the Nimmanarati devas the Paranimmitavasavatti devas the devas of Brahma's retinue took up the cry At Varanasi in the Game Refuge at Isipatana the Blessed One has set in motion the unexcelled Wheel of Dhamma that cannot be stopped by brahman or contemplative deva Mara or God or anyone at all in the cosmos
So in that moment that instant the cry shot right up to the Brahma worlds
And this tenthousand fold cosmos shivered  quivered  quaked while a great measureless radiance appeared in the cosmos surpassing the effulgence of the devas
Then the Blessed One exclaimed So you really know Kondañña
So you really know And that is how Ven
Kondañña acquired the name AññaKondañña  Kondañña who knows

Now at that time Sarakaani the Sakyan who had died was proclaimed by the Blessed One to be a StreamWinner not subject to rebirth in states of woe assured of enlightenment
At this a number of the Sakyans whenever they met each other or came together in company were indignant and angry and said scornfully A fine thing a marvelous thing
Nowadays anyone can become a StreamWinner if the Blessed One has proclaimed Sarakaani who died to be StreamWinner assured of enlightenment
Why Sarakaani failed in his training and took to drink
Mahaanaama a layfollower who has for a long time taken refuge in the Buddha the Dhamma and the Sangha  how could he go to states of woe
How could he go to states of woe
Mahaanaama take the case of a man endowed with unwavering devotion to the Buddha declaring 'He is the Blessed One' the Dhamma the Sangha He is joyous and swift in wisdom one who has gained release
By the destruction of the cankers he has by his own realization gained the cankerless heart's release the release through wisdom in this very life and abides in it
The man is entirely released from the hellstate from rebirth as an animal he is free from the realm of hungry ghosts fully freed from the downfall the evil way from states of woe
Take the case of another man
He is endowed with unwavering devotion to the Buddha the Dhamma the Sangha he is joyous and swift in wisdom but has not gained release
Having destroyed the five lower fetters he is reborn spontaneously where he will attain Nibbaana without returning from that world
That man is entirely released from states of woe
Take the case of another man
He is endowed with unwavering devotion to the Buddha the Dhamma the Sangha
But he is not joyous in wisdom and has not gained release
Yet by destroying three fetters and weakening lust hatred and delusion he is a Oncereturner who will return once more to this world and put an end to suffering
That man is entirely freed from states of woe
Take the case of another man
He is endowed with unwavering devotion to the Buddha the Dhamma the Sangha
But he is not joyous in wisdom and has not gained release
Yet by destroying three fetters he is a StreamWinner not subject to rebirth in states of woe assured of enlightenment
That man is entirely freed from states of woe
Take the case of another man
He is not even endowed with unwavering devotion to the Buddha the Dhamma the Sangha
He is not joyous and swift in wisdom and has not gained release
But perhaps he has these things the faculty of faith of energy of mindfulness of concentration of wisdom
And the things proclaimed by the Tathaagata are moderately approved by him with insight
That man does not go to the realm of hungry ghosts to the downfall to the evil way to states of woe
Take the case of another man
He is not even endowed with unwavering devotion to the Buddha the Dhamma the Sangha
He is not joyous and swift in wisdom and has not gained release
But he has just these things the faculty of faith of energy of mindfulness of concentration of wisdom
Yet if he has merely faith merely affection for the Tathaagata that man too does not go to states of woe
Why Mahaanaama if these great sal trees could distinguish what is well spoken from what is ill spoken I would proclaim these great sal trees to be StreamWinners bound for enlightenment how much more so then Sarakaani the Sakyan
Mahaanaama Sarakaani the Sakyan fulfilled the training at the time of death'
At Savatthi
There the Blessed One said Monks even though a wheelturning emperor having exercised sovereign lordship over the four continents on the breakup of the body after death reappears in the good destination the heavenly world in the company of the devas of the Thirtythree and enjoys himself there in the Nandana grove surrounded by a consort of nymphs supplied and endowed with the five strings of heavenly sensual pleasure still  because he is not endowed with four qualities  he is not freed from hell not freed from the animal womb not freed from the realm of hungry shades not freed from the plane of deprivation the bad destinations the lower realms
And even though a disciple of the noble ones lives off lumps of alms food and wears ragrobes still  because he is endowed with four qualities  he is freed from hell freed from the animal womb freed from the realm of hungry shades freed from the plane of deprivation the bad destinations the lower realms
And what are the four

And between the gaining of the four continents and the gaining of these four qualities the gaining of the four continents is not equal to one sixteenth of the gaining of these four qualities
Monks concentration through mindfulness of inout breathing when developed  pursued is of great fruit of great benefit
And how is concentration through mindfulness of inout breathing developed  pursued so as to be of great fruit of great benefit
There is the case where a monk having gone to the wilderness to the shade of a tree or to an empty building sits down folding his legs crosswise holding his body erect and setting mindfulness to the fore
Always mindful he breathes in mindful he breathes out
Breathing in long he discerns 'I am breathing in long' or breathing out long he discerns 'I am breathing out long' Or breathing in short he discerns 'I am breathing in short' or breathing out short he discerns 'I am breathing out short' He trains himself 'I will breathe in sensitive to the entire body' He trains himself 'I will breathe out sensitive to the entire body' He trains himself 'I will breathe in calming bodily fabrication' He trains himself 'I will breathe out calming the bodily fabrication'
He trains himself 'I will breathe in sensitive to rapture' He trains himself 'I will breathe out sensitive to rapture' He trains himself 'I will breathe in sensitive to pleasure' He trains himself 'I will breathe out sensitive to pleasure' He trains himself 'I will breathe in sensitive to mental fabrication' He trains himself 'I will breathe out sensitive to mental fabrication' He trains himself 'I will breathe in calming mental fabrication' He trains himself 'I will breathe out calming mental fabrication'
He trains himself 'I will breathe in sensitive to the mind' He trains himself 'I will breathe out sensitive to the mind' He trains himself 'I will breathe in gladdening the mind' He trains himself 'I will breathe out gladdening the mind' He trains himself 'I will breathe in steadying the mind' He trains himself 'I will breathe out steadying the mind
He trains himself 'I will breathe in releasing the mind' He trains himself 'I will breathe out releasing the mind'
He trains himself 'I will breathe in focusing on inconstancy' He trains himself 'I will breathe out focusing on inconstancy' He trains himself 'I will breathe in focusing on dispassion' He trains himself 'I will breathe out focusing on dispassion' He trains himself 'I will breathe in focusing on cessation' He trains himself 'I will breathe out focusing on cessation' He trains himself 'I will breathe in focusing on relinquishment' He trains himself 'I will breathe out focusing on relinquishment'
This is how concentration through mindfulness of inout breathing is developed  pursued so as to be of great fruit of great benefit
I too monks before my awakening when I was an unawakened bodhisatta frequently remained with this abiding
When I frequently remained with this abiding neither my body was fatigued nor were my eyes and my mind through lack of clingingsustenance was released from fermentations
So if a monk should wish 'May neither my body be fatigued nor my eyes and may my mind through lack of clingingsustenance be released from fermentations' then he should attend carefully to this same concentration through mindfulness of inout breathing
If a monk should wish 'May my memories  resolves related to the household life be abandoned' then he should attend carefully to this same concentration through mindfulness of inout breathing
If a monk should wish 'May I remain percipient of loathsomeness in the presence of what is not loathsome' then he should attend carefully to this same concentration through mindfulness of inout breathing
If a monk should wish 'May I remain percipient of unloathsomeness in the presence of what is loathsome' then he should attend carefully to this same concentration through mindfulness of inout breathing
If a monk should wish 'May I remain percipient of loathsomeness in the presence of what is not loathsome  what is' then he should attend carefully to this same concentration through mindfulness of inout breathing
If a monk should wish 'May I remain percipient of unloathsomeness in the presence of what is loathsome  what is not' then he should attend carefully to this same concentration through mindfulness of inout breathing
If a monk should wish 'May I  in the presence of what is loathsome  what is not  cutting myself off from both  remain equanimous mindful  alert' then he should attend carefully to this same concentration through mindfulness of inout breathing
If a monk should wish 'May I  quite secluded from sensuality secluded from unskillful qualities  enter  remain in the first jhana rapture  pleasure born from seclusion accompanied by directed thought  evaluation' then he should attend carefully to this same concentration through mindfulness of inout breathing
If a monk should wish 'May I with the stilling of directed thoughts  evaluations enter  remain in the second jhana rapture  pleasure born of concentration unification of awareness free from directed thought  evaluation  internal assurance' then he should attend carefully to this same concentration through mindfulness of inout breathing
If a monk should wish 'May I with the fading of rapture remain equanimous mindful  alert sense pleasure with the body and enter  remain in the third jhana of which the noble ones declare Equanimous  mindful he has a pleasant abiding' then he should attend closely to this very same concentration through mindfulness of inout breathing
If a monk should wish 'May I with the abandoning of pleasure  pain  as with the earlier disappearance of elation  distress  enter  remain in the fourth jhana purity of equanimity  mindfulness neitherpleasurenorpain' then he should attend closely to this very same concentration through mindfulness of inout breathing
If a monk should wish 'May I with the complete transcending of perceptions of form with the disappearance of perceptions of resistance and not heeding perceptions of diversity 'Infinite space' enter  remain in the dimension of the infinitude of space' then he should attend carefully to this same concentration through mindfulness of inout breathing
If a monk should wish 'May I with the complete transcending of the dimension of the infinitude of space 'Infinite consciousness' enter  remain in the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness' then he should attend carefully to this same concentration through mindfulness of inout breathing
If a monk should wish 'May I with the complete transcending of the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness 'There is nothing' enter  remain in the dimension of nothingness' then he should attend carefully to this same concentration through mindfulness of inout breathing
If a monk should wish 'May I with the complete transcending of the dimension of nothingness enter  remain in the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception' then he should attend carefully to this same concentration through mindfulness of inout breathing
If a monk should wish 'May I with the complete transcending of the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception enter  remain in the cessation of perception  feeling' then he should attend carefully to this same concentration through mindfulness of inout breathing
When concentration through mindfulness of inout breathing is thus developed thus pursued then if he senses a feeling of pleasure he discerns that it is inconstant not grasped at not relished
If he senses a feeling of pain he discerns that it is inconstant not grasped at not relished
If he senses a feeling of neitherpleasurenorpain he discerns that it is inconstant not grasped at not relished
If he senses a feeling of pleasure he senses it disjoined from it
If he senses a feeling of pain he senses it disjoined from it
If he senses a feeling of neitherpleasurenorpain he senses it disjoined from it
When sensing a feeling limited to the body he discerns that 'I am sensing a feeling limited to the body' When sensing a feeling limited to life he discerns that 'I am sensing a feeling limited to life' He discerns that 'With the breakup of the body after the termination of life everything that is experienced not being relished will grow cold right here'
Just as an oil lamp burns in dependence on oil  wick and from the termination of the oil  wick  and from not being provided any other sustenance  it goes out unnourished in the same way when sensing a feeling limited to the body he discerns that 'I am sensing a feeling limited to the body' When sensing a feeling limited to life he discerns that 'I am sensing a feeling limited to life' He discerns that 'With the breakup of the body after the termination of life everything that is sensed not being relished will grow cold right here' See also MN SN
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Savatthi in Jeta's Grove Anathapindika's monastery
Then Ven
Ananda went to the Blessed One and on arrival bowed down to him and sat to one side
As he was sitting there he addressed the Blessed One saying Is there one quality that when developed  pursued brings four qualities to completion
And four qualities that when developed  pursued bring seven qualities to completion
And seven qualities that when developed  pursued bring two qualities to completion
Yes Ananda there is one quality that when developed  pursued brings four qualities to completion and four qualities that when developed  pursued bring seven qualities to completion and seven qualities that when developed  pursued bring two qualities to completion
And what is the one quality that when developed  pursued brings four qualities to completion
What are the four qualities that when developed  pursued bring seven qualities to completion
What are the seven qualities that when developed  pursued bring two qualities to completion
Mindfulness of inout breathing when developed  pursued brings the four frames of reference to completion
The four frames of reference when developed  pursued bring the seven factors for Awakening to completion
The seven factors for Awakening when developed  pursued bring clear knowing  release to completion
Now how is mindfulness of inout breathing developed  pursued so as to bring the four frames of reference to their culmination
There is the case where a monk having gone to the wilderness to the shade of a tree or to an empty building sits down folding his legs crosswise holding his body erect and setting mindfulness to the fore
Always mindful he breathes in mindful he breathes out
 Breathing in long he discerns 'I am breathing in long' or breathing out long he discerns 'I am breathing out long' Or breathing in short he discerns 'I am breathing in short' or breathing out short he discerns 'I am breathing out short' He trains himself 'I will breathe in sensitive to the entire body' He trains himself 'I will breathe out sensitive to the entire body' He trains himself 'I will breathe in calming bodily fabrication' He trains himself 'I will breathe out calming bodily fabrication'
 He trains himself 'I will breathe in sensitive to rapture' He trains himself 'I will breathe out sensitive to rapture' He trains himself 'I will breathe in sensitive to pleasure' He trains himself 'I will breathe out sensitive to pleasure' He trains himself 'I will breathe in sensitive to mental fabrication' He trains himself 'I will breathe out sensitive to mental fabrication' He trains himself 'I will breathe in calming mental fabrication' He trains himself 'I will breathe out calming mental fabrication'
 He trains himself 'I will breathe in sensitive to the mind' He trains himself 'I will breathe out sensitive to the mind' He trains himself 'I will breathe in satisfying the mind' He trains himself 'I will breathe out satisfying the mind' He trains himself 'I will breathe in steadying the mind' He trains himself 'I will breathe out steadying the mind' He trains himself 'I will breathe in releasing the mind' He trains himself 'I will breathe out releasing the mind'
 He trains himself 'I will breathe in focusing on inconstancy' He trains himself 'I will breathe out focusing on inconstancy' He trains himself 'I will breathe in focusing on dispassion' He trains himself 'I will breathe out focusing on dispassion' He trains himself 'I will breathe in focusing on cessation' He trains himself 'I will breathe out focusing on cessation' He trains himself 'I will breathe in focusing on relinquishment' He trains himself 'I will breathe out focusing on relinquishment'
 Now on whatever occasion a monk breathing in long discerns that he is breathing in long or breathing out long discerns that he is breathing out long or breathing in short discerns that he is breathing in short or breathing out short discerns that he is breathing out short trains himself to breathe in  out sensitive to the entire body trains himself to breathe in  out calming the bodily processes On that occasion the monk remains focused on the body in  of itself  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the world
I tell you that this  the inout breath  is classed as a body among bodies which is why the monk on that occasion remains focused on the body in  of itself  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the world
 On whatever occasion a monk trains himself to breathe in  out sensitive to rapture trains himself to breathe in  out sensitive to pleasure trains himself to breathe in  out sensitive to mental processes trains himself to breathe in  out calming mental processes On that occasion the monk remains focused on feelings in  of themselves  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the world
I tell you that this  close attention to inout breaths  is classed as a feeling among feelings which is why the monk on that occasion remains focused on feelings in  of themselves  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the world
 On whatever occasion a monk trains himself to breathe in  out sensitive to the mind trains himself to breathe in  out satisfying the mind trains himself to breathe in  out steadying the mind trains himself to breathe in  out releasing the mind On that occasion the monk remains focused on the mind in  of itself  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the world
I don't say that there is mindfulness of inout breathing in one of confused mindfulness and no alertness which is why the monk on that occasion remains focused on the mind in  of itself  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the world
 On whatever occasion a monk trains himself to breathe in  out focusing on inconstancy trains himself to breathe in  out focusing on dispassion trains himself to breathe in  out focusing on cessation trains himself to breathe in  out focusing on relinquishment On that occasion the monk remains focused on mental qualities in  of themselves  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the world
He who sees clearly with discernment the abandoning of greed  distress is one who oversees with equanimity which is why the monk on that occasion remains focused on mental qualities in  of themselves  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the world
This is how mindfulness of inout breathing is developed  pursued so as to bring the four frames of reference to their culmination
And how are the four frames of reference developed  pursued so as to bring the seven factors for Awakening to their culmination
 On whatever occasion the monk remains focused on the body in  of itself  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the world on that occasion his mindfulness is steady  without lapse
When his mindfulness is steady  without lapse then mindfulness as a factor for Awakening becomes aroused
He develops it and for him it goes to the culmination of its development
 Remaining mindful in this way he examines analyzes  comes to a comprehension of that quality with discernment
When he remains mindful in this way examining analyzing  coming to a comprehension of that quality with discernment then analysis of qualities as a factor for Awakening becomes aroused
He develops it and for him it goes to the culmination of its development
 In one who examines analyzes  comes to a comprehension of that quality with discernment unflagging persistence is aroused
When unflagging persistence is aroused in one who examines analyzes  comes to a comprehension of that quality with discernment then persistence as a factor for Awakening becomes aroused
He develops it and for him it goes to the culmination of its development
 In one whose persistence is aroused a rapture notoftheflesh arises
When a rapture notoftheflesh arises in one whose persistence is aroused then rapture as a factor for Awakening becomes aroused
He develops it and for him it goes to the culmination of its development
 For one who is enraptured the body grows calm and the mind grows calm
When the body  mind of an enraptured monk grow calm then serenity as a factor for Awakening becomes aroused
He develops it and for him it goes to the culmination of its development
 For one who is at ease  his body calmed  the mind becomes concentrated
When the mind of one who is at ease  his body calmed  becomes concentrated then concentration as a factor for Awakening becomes aroused
He develops it and for him it goes to the culmination of its development
 He oversees the mind thus concentrated with equanimity
When he oversees the mind thus concentrated with equanimity equanimity as a factor for Awakening becomes aroused
He develops it and for him it goes to the culmination of its development
This is how the four frames of reference are developed  pursued so as to bring the seven factors for Awakening to their culmination
And how are the seven factors for Awakening developed  pursued so as to bring clear knowing  release to their culmination
There is the case where a monk develops mindfulness as a factor for Awakening dependent on seclusion dispassion cessation resulting in relinquishment
He develops analysis of qualities as a factor for Awakening persistence as a factor for Awakening rapture as a factor for Awakening serenity as a factor for Awakening concentration as a factor for Awakening equanimity as a factor for Awakening dependent on seclusion dispassion cessation resulting in relinquishment
This is how the seven factors for Awakening when developed  pursued bring clear knowing  release to their culmination
That is what the Blessed One said
Gratified Ven
Ananda delighted in the Blessed One's words
I have heard that on one occasion Ven
Anuruddha was staying near Savatthi in the Dark Forest  diseased in pain severely ill
Then a large number of monks went to Ven
Anuruddha and on arrival said to him What dwelling are you dwelling in so that the pains that have arisen in the body do not invade or remain in the mind
When I dwell with my mind wellestablished in the four frames of reference the pains that have arisen in the body do not invade or remain in the mind
Which four
There is the case where I remain focused on the body in  of itself  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the world
I remain focused on feelings in  of themselves mind in  of itself mental qualities in  of themselves  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the world
When I dwell with my mind wellestablished in these four frames of reference the pains that have arisen in the body do not invade or remain in the mind
These four bases of power when developed  pursued are of great fruit  great benefit
And how are the four bases of power developed  pursued so as to be of great fruit  great benefit
There is the case where a monk develops the base of power endowed with concentration founded on desire  the fabrications of exertion thinking 'This desire of mine will be neither overly sluggish nor overly active neither inwardly restricted nor outwardly scattered' He keeps perceiving what is in front  behind so that what is in front is the same as what is behind what is behind is the same as what is in front
What is below is the same as what is above what is above is the same as what is below
by night as by day and by day as by night
By means of an awareness thus open  unhampered he develops a brightened mind
He develops the base of power endowed with concentration founded on persistence
He develops the base of power endowed with concentration founded on intent
He develops the base of power endowed with concentration founded on discrimination  the fabrications of exertion thinking 'This discrimination of mine will be neither overly sluggish nor overly active neither inwardly restricted nor outwardly scattered' He keeps perceiving what is in front  behind so that what is in front is the same as what is behind what is behind is the same as what is in front
What is below is the same as what is above what is above is the same as what is below
by night as by day and by day as by night
By means of an awareness thus open  unhampered he develops a brightened mind
And how is desire overly sluggish
Whatever desire is accompanied by laziness conjoined with laziness that is called overly sluggish desire
And how is desire overly active
Whatever desire is accompanied by restlessness conjoined with restlessness that is called overly active desire
And how is desire inwardly restricted
Whatever desire is accompanied by sloth  drowsiness conjoined with sloth  drowsiness that is called inwardly restricted desire
And how is desire outwardly scattered
Whatever desire is stirred up by the five strings of sensuality outwardly dispersed  dissipated that is called outwardly scattered desire
And how does a monk dwell perceiving what is in front  behind so that what is in front is the same as what is behind and what is behind is the same as what is in front
There is the case where a monk's perception of what is in front  behind is well in hand wellattended to wellconsidered welltuned by means of discernment
This is how a monk keeps perceiving what is in front and behind so that what is in front is the same as what is behind and what is behind is the same as what is in front
And how does a monk dwell so that what is below is the same as what is above and what is above is the same as what is below
There is the case where a monk reflects on this very body from the soles of the feet on up from the crown of the head on down surrounded by skin  full of various kinds of unclean things 'In this body there are head hairs body hairs nails teeth skin flesh tendons bones bone marrow kidneys heart liver pleura spleen lungs large intestines small intestines gorge feces bile phlegm pus blood sweat fat tears skinoil saliva mucus fluid in the joints urine' This is how a monk dwells so that what is below is the same as what is above and what is above is the same as what is below
And how does a monk dwell by night as by day and by day as by night
There is the case where a monk at night develops the base of power endowed with concentration founded on desire  the fabrications of exertion by means of the same modes  signs  themes that he uses by day and by day he develops the base of power endowed with concentration founded on desire  the fabrications of exertion by means of the same modes  signs  themes that he uses by night
This is how a monk dwells by night as by day and by day as by night
And how does a monk  by means of an awareness open  unhampered  develop a brightened mind
There is the case where a monk has the perception of light the perception of daytime well in hand  wellestablished
This is how a monk  by means of an awareness open  unhampered  develops a brightened mind
When a monk has thus developed  pursued the four bases of power he experiences manifold supranormal powers
Having been one he becomes many having been many he becomes one
He appears
He vanishes
He goes unimpeded through walls ramparts  mountains as if through space
He dives in  out of the earth as if it were water
He walks on water without sinking as if it were dry land
Sitting crosslegged he flies through the air like a winged bird
With his hand he touches  strokes even the sun  moon so mighty  powerful
He exercises influence with his body even as far as the Brahma worlds
He hears  by means of the divine earelement purified  surpassing the human  both kinds of sounds divine  human whether near or far
He knows the awareness of other beings other individuals having encompassed it with his own awareness
He discerns a mind with passion as a mind with passion and a mind without passion as a mind without passion
He discerns a mind with aversion as a mind with aversion and a mind without aversion as a mind without aversion
He discerns a mind with delusion as a mind with delusion and a mind without delusion as a mind without delusion
He discerns a restricted mind as a restricted mind and a scattered mind as a scattered mind
He discerns an enlarged mind as an enlarged mind and an unenlarged mind as an unenlarged mind
He discerns an excelled mind as an excelled mind and an unexcelled mind as an unexcelled mind
He discerns a concentrated mind as a concentrated mind and an unconcentrated mind as an unconcentrated mind
He discerns a released mind as a released mind and an unreleased mind as an unreleased mind
He recollects his manifold past lives ie one birth two births three births four five ten twenty thirty forty fifty one hundred one thousand one hundred thousand many aeons of cosmic contraction many aeons of cosmic expansion many aeons of cosmic contraction  expansion 'There I had such a name belonged to such a clan had such an appearance
Such was my food such my experience of pleasure  pain such the end of my life
Passing away from that state I rearose there
There too I had such a name belonged to such a clan had such an appearance
Such was my food such my experience of pleasure  pain such the end of my life
Passing away from that state I rearose here' Thus he remembers his manifold past lives in their modes  details
He sees  by means of the divine eye purified  surpassing the human  beings passing away and reappearing and he discerns how they are inferior  superior beautiful  ugly fortunate  unfortunate in accordance with their kamma 'These beings  who were endowed with bad conduct of body speech  mind who reviled the noble ones held wrong views and undertook actions under the influence of wrong views  with the breakup of the body after death have reappeared in the plane of deprivation the bad destination the lower realms in hell
But these beings  who were endowed with good conduct of body speech  mind who did not revile the noble ones who held right views and undertook actions under the influence of right views  with the breakup of the body after death have reappeared in the good destinations in the heavenly world' Thus  by means of the divine eye purified  surpassing the human  he sees beings passing away and reappearing and he discerns how they are inferior  superior beautiful  ugly fortunate  unfortunate in accordance with their kamma
Through the ending of the mental effluents he remains in the effluentfree awarenessrelease  discernmentrelease knowing  realizing it for himself in the here  now
This is how these four bases of power when developed  pursued are of great fruit  great benefit
I have heard that on one occasion Ven
Ananda was staying in Kosambi at Ghosita's Park
Then the Brahman Unnabha went to where Ven
Ananda was staying and on arrival greeted him courteously
After an exchange of friendly greetings  courtesies he sat to one side
As he was sitting there he said to Ven
Ananda Master Ananda what is the aim of this holy life lived under Gotama the contemplative
Brahman the holy life is lived under the Blessed One with the aim of abandoning desire
Is there a path is there a practice for the abandoning of that desire
Yes there is a path there is a practice for the abandoning of that desire
What is the path the practice for the abandoning of that desire
Brahman there is the case where a monk develops the base of power endowed with concentration founded on desire  the fabrications of exertion
He develops the base of power endowed with concentration founded on persistence concentration founded on intent concentration founded on discrimination  the fabrications of exertion
This Brahman is the path this is the practice for the abandoning of that desire
If that's so Master Ananda then it's an endless path and not one with an end for it's impossible that one could abandon desire by means of desire
In that case brahman let me question you on this matter
Answer as you see fit
What do you think Didn't you first have desire thinking 'I'll go to the park' and then when you reached the park wasn't that particular desire allayed
Yes sir
Didn't you first have persistence thinking 'I'll go to the park' and then when you reached the park wasn't that particular persistence allayed
Yes sir
Didn't you first have the intent thinking 'I'll go to the park' and then when you reached the park wasn't that particular intent allayed
Yes sir
Didn't you first have discrimination thinking 'I'll go to the park' and then when you reached the park wasn't that particular act of discrimination allayed
Yes sir
So it is with an arahant whose mental effluents are ended who has reached fulfillment done the task laid down the burden attained the true goal totally destroyed the fetter of becoming and who is released through right gnosis
Whatever desire he first had for the attainment of arahantship on attaining arahantship that particular desire is allayed
Whatever persistence he first had for the attainment of arahantship on attaining arahantship that particular persistence is allayed
Whatever intent he first had for the attainment of arahantship on attaining arahantship that particular intent is allayed
Whatever discrimination he first had for the attainment of arahantship on attaining arahantship that particular discrimination is allayed
So what do you think brahman
Is this an endless path or one with an end
You're right Master Ananda
This is a path with an end and not an endless one
Magnificent Master Ananda
Magnificent
Just as if he were to place upright what was overturned to reveal what was hidden to show the way to one who was lost or to carry a lamp into the dark so that those with eyes could see forms in the same way has Master Ananda  through many lines of reasoning  made the Dhamma clear
I go to Master Gotama for refuge to the Dhamma and to the Sangha of monks
May Master Ananda remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge from this day forward for life
Monks when one quality is established in a monk the five faculties are developed  developed well
Which one quality
Heedfulness
And what is heedfulness
There is the case where a monk guards his mind with regard to fermentations and mental qualities accompanied by fermentations
When his mind is guarded with regard to fermentations and mental qualities accompanied by fermentations the faculty of conviction goes to the culmination of its development
The faculty of persistence mindfulness concentration discernment goes to the culmination of its development
This is how when one quality is established in a monk the five faculties are developed  developed well

Just as monks all the footcharacteristics of all jungle creatures are combined in the elephant's and the elephant's foot is reckoned chief of them in size so too monks of all the elements that conduce to enlightenment the faculty of wisdom is reckoned their chief as regards the attainment of enlightenment

The faculty of faith monks conduces to enlightenment the faculties of energy mindfulness concentration and wisdom conduce to enlightenment

I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Savatthi in the Eastern Monastery the palace of Migara's mother
Now on that occasion the Blessed One on emerging from seclusion in the late afternoon sat warming his back in the western sun
Then Ven
Ananda went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to the Blessed One massaged the Blessed One's limbs with his hand and said It's amazing lord
It's astounding how the Blessed One's complexion is no longer so clear  bright his limbs are flabby  wrinkled his back bent forward there's a discernible change in his faculties  the faculty of the eye the faculty of the ear the faculty of the nose the faculty of the tongue the faculty of the body
That's the way it is Ananda
When young one is subject to aging when healthy subject to illness when alive subject to death
The complexion is no longer so clear  bright the limbs are flabby  wrinkled the back bent forward there's a discernible change in the faculties  the faculty of the eye the faculty of the ear the faculty of the nose the faculty of the tongue the faculty of the body
That is what the Blessed One said
Having said that the One Wellgone the Teacher said further
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying in Savatthi at the Eastern Gatehouse
There he addressed Ven
Sariputta Sariputta do you take it on conviction that the faculty of conviction when developed  pursued gains a footing in the Deathless has the Deathless as its goal  consummation
Do you take it on conviction that the faculty of persistence mindfulness concentration discernment when developed  pursued gains a footing in the Deathless has the Deathless as its goal  consummation
Lord it's not that I take it on conviction in the Blessed One that the faculty of conviction persistence mindfulness concentration discernment when developed  pursued gains a footing in the Deathless has the Deathless as its goal  consummation
Those who have not known seen penetrated realized or attained it by means of discernment would have to take it on conviction in others that the faculty of conviction persistence mindfulness concentration discernment when developed  pursued gains a footing in the Deathless has the Deathless as its goal  consummation whereas those who have known seen penetrated realized  attained it by means of discernment would have no doubt or uncertainty that the faculty of conviction persistence mindfulness concentration discernment when developed  pursued gains a footing in the Deathless has the Deathless as its goal  consummation
And as for me I have known seen penetrated realized  attained it by means of discernment
I have no doubt or uncertainty that the faculty of conviction persistence mindfulness concentration discernment when developed  pursued gains a footing in the Deathless has the Deathless as its goal  consummation
Excellent Sariputta
Excellent
Those who have not known seen penetrated realized or attained it by means of discernment would have to take it on conviction in others that the faculty of conviction persistence mindfulness concentration discernment when developed  pursued gains a footing in the Deathless has the Deathless as its goal  consummation whereas those who have known seen penetrated realized  attained it by means of discernment would have no doubt or uncertainty that the faculty of conviction persistence mindfulness concentration discernment when developed  pursued gains a footing in the Deathless has the Deathless as its goal  consummation
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying in Kosambi at Ghosita's Park
There he addressed the monks Monks is there a manner of reckoning whereby a monk who is a learner standing at the level of a learner can discern that 'I am a learner' and whereby a monk who is an adept standing at the level of an adept can discern that 'I am an adept'
For us lord the teachings have the Blessed One as their root their guide  their arbitrator
It would be good if the Blessed One himself would explicate the meaning of this statement
Having heard it from the Blessed One the monks will remember it
In that case monks listen  pay close attention
I will speak
As you say lord the monks responded
The Blessed One said There is a manner of reckoning whereby a monk who is a learner standing at the level of a learner can discern that 'I am a learner' and whereby a monk who is an adept standing at the level of an adept can discern that 'I am an adept'
And what is the manner of reckoning whereby a monk who is a learner standing at the level of a learner can discern that 'I am a learner'
There is the case where a monk is a learner
He discerns as it actually is that 'This is stress This is the origination of stress This is the cessation of stress This is the path of practice leading to the cessation of stress' This is a manner of reckoning whereby a monk who is a learner standing at the level of a learner can discern that 'I am a learner'
Furthermore the monk who is a learner reflects 'Is there outside of this any brahman or contemplative who teaches the true genuine  accurate Dhamma like the Blessed One' And he discerns 'No there is no brahman or contemplative outside of this doctrine  discipline who teaches the true genuine  accurate Dhamma like the Blessed One' This too is a manner of reckoning whereby a monk who is a learner standing at the level of a learner can discern that 'I am a learner'
Furthermore the monk who is a learner discerns the five faculties the faculty of conviction persistence mindfulness concentration discernment
He sees clear through with discernment their destiny excellence rewards  consummation but he does not touch them with his body
This too is a manner of reckoning whereby a monk who is a learner standing at the level of a learner can discern that 'I am a learner'
And what is the manner of reckoning whereby a monk who is an adept standing at the level of an adept can discern that 'I am an adept'
There is the case where a monk who is an adept discerns the five faculties the faculty of conviction persistence mindfulness concentration discernment
He touches with his body and sees clear through with discernment what their destiny excellence rewards  consummation are
This is a manner of reckoning whereby a monk who is an adept standing at the level of an adept can discern that 'I am an adept'
Furthermore the monk who is an adept discerns the six sense faculties the faculty of the eye ear nose tongue body intellect
He discerns 'These six sense faculties will disband entirely everywhere  in every way without remainder and no other set of six sense faculties will arise anywhere or in any way' This too is a manner of reckoning whereby a monk who is an adept standing at the level of an adept can discern that 'I am an adept'
There are these five sense faculties good Gotama of different spheres different action and they do not share in each other's sphere of action
Which five
The sense of sight hearing smelling tasting and touching
As these five faculties are of different scope and range and do not share in each other's sphere of action what is their resort and who profits from their combined activity
There are Brahman these five sensefaculties which do not share in each other's sphere of action
Mind is their resort and it is mind that profits from their combined activity
But good Gotama what is mind's resort
Mind's resort Brahman is mindfulness
Then good Gotama what is the resort of mindfulness
The resort of mindfulness Brahman is liberation
Then good Gotama what is the resort of liberation
The resort of liberation is Nibbaana
Then good Gotama what is the resort of Nibbaana
That question goes too far Brahman
No answer can encompass it
The aim of the holy life Brahman is immersion in Nibbaana it has Nibbaana for its final end Nibbaana for its conclusion
The Brahman Unnaabha was delighted with the words of the Blessed One and rejoiced in them
He rose saluted the Blessed One and departed
Not long after his departure the Blessed One said to the monks
Monks imagine a house or a pavilion with a peaked roof with a window to the east
When the sun rises and its rays strike through the window what do they rest on
On the western wall Lord
Just so monks the faith of the Brahman Unnaabha is settled on the Tathaagata rooted in him established in him
It is strong and cannot be uprooted by any recluse or Brahman deva or Maara Brahmaa or anyone else in the world
Monks if the Brahman Unnaabha were to die now there is no fetter to bind the Brahman Unnaabha and cause him to return to this world
The dewdrop slips into the shining sea
Monks there are these five faculties
Which five
The pleasurefaculty the painfaculty the happinessfaculty the distressfaculty the equanimityfaculty
And what is the pleasurefaculty
Any physical pleasure physical comfort born of bodycontact to be experienced as pleasure  comfort
That is called the pleasurefaculty
And what is the painfaculty
Any physical pain physical discomfort born of bodycontact to be experienced as pain  discomfort
That is called the painfaculty
And what is the happinessfaculty
Any mental pleasure mental comfort born of intellectcontact to be experienced as pleasure  comfort
That is called the happinessfaculty
And what is the distressfaculty
Any mental pain mental discomfort born of intellectcontact to be experienced as pain  discomfort
That is called the distressfaculty
And what is the equanimityfaculty
Anything physical or mental to be experienced as neither comfort nor discomfort
That is called the equanimityfaculty
With regard to this the pleasurefaculty  happinessfaculty are to be seen as a feeling of pleasure
The painfaculty  distressfaculty are to be seen as a feeling of pain
The equanimityfaculty is to be seen as a feeling of neither pleasure nor pain
Thus by this exposition the five are three and the three five
It would be well for me Lord if the Blessed One would teach me briefly a doctrine so that having heard it I might dwell alone in seclusion unwearied ardent and resolute
Well then monk you should purify the rudiments of skill
And what are the rudiments of skill
In this monk you must dwell restrained according to the restraint of the Obligations having perfected the scope of your practice aware of danger in the slightest faults undertaking the precepts and training yourself in them
Having done this then monk with morality as your support established in morality you must practice the four foundations of mindfulness
Which four
In this monk you must dwell in contemplation of body feelings mind mindobjects ardent clearly aware mindful having got rid of worldly longing and depression
Then monk when with morality as your support established in morality you have cultivated the four foundations of mindfulness then you will obtain by night and by day that hopedfor increase in skilled states which will not decline
In this Aananda a monk dwells contemplating the body ardent clearly aware and mindful putting aside worldly desire and dejection
As he thus dwells contemplating the body some bodily object arises or physical discomfort or mental drowsiness causes his mind to wander to external things
Then Aananda that bhikkhu's attention should be directed to some inspiring object of thought
As he thus directs it to some inspiring object of thought delight springs up in him
When he is thus delighted rapture arises
When he experiences rapture his body is calmed down
With body so calmed down he experiences joy
Being joyful his mind is concentrated
He reflects thus 'The aim on which I set my mind has been achieved
Let me now withdraw my mind' So he does so without starting or continuing the thoughtprocess
And he is aware of being free from initial or sustained thought inwardly mindful and joyful

Such Aananda is the practice for the direction of mind
And what Aananda is the practice for the nondirection of mind
A monk who does not direct his mind to external things is aware 'My mind is not directed to external things' Then he is aware 'My mind is not concentrated on before or after it is set free and undirected' And then he is aware 'I dwell in contemplation of the body ardent clearly aware and mindful
I am joyful' 
This Aananda is the practice for the nondirection of mind

On one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Alavi on a spread of leaves by a cattle track in a simsapa forest
Then Hatthaka of Alavi out roaming  rambling for exercise saw the Blessed One sitting on a spread of leaves by the cattle track in the simsapa forest
On seeing him he went to him and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side
As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One Lord I hope the Blessed One has slept in ease
Yes young man
I have slept in ease
Of those in the world who sleep in ease I am one
But cold lord is the winter night
The 'BetweentheEights' is a time of snowfall
Hard is the ground trampled by cattle hooves
Thin is the spread of leaves
Sparse are the leaves in the trees
Thin are your ochre robes
And cold blows the Verambha wind
Yet still the Blessed One says 'Yes young man
I have slept in ease
Of those in the world who sleep in ease I am one' In that case young man I will question you in return
Answer as you see fit
Now what do you think Suppose a householder or householder's son has a house with a gabled roof plastered inside  out draftfree with closefitting door  windows shut against the wind
Inside he has a horsehair couch spread with a longfleeced coverlet a white wool coverlet an embroidered coverlet a rug of kadalideer hide with a canopy above  red cushions on either side
And there a lamp would be burning and his four wives with their many charms would be attending to him
Would he sleep in ease or not
Or how does this strike you
Yes lord he would sleep in ease
Of those in the world who sleep in ease he would be one
But what do you think young man
Might there arise in that householder or householder's son any bodily fevers or fevers of mind born of passion so that  burned with those passionborn fevers  he would sleep miserably
Yes lord
As for those passionborn fevers  burned with which the householder or householder's son would sleep miserably  that passion has been abandoned by the Tathagata its root destroyed made like a palmyra stump deprived of the conditions of development not destined for future arising
Therefore he sleeps in ease
Now what do you think young man
Might there arise in that householder or householder's son any bodily fevers or fevers of mind born of aversion so that  burned with those aversionborn fevers  he would sleep miserably
Yes lord
As for those aversionborn fevers  burned with which the householder or householder's son would sleep miserably  that aversion has been abandoned by the Tathagata its root destroyed made like a palmyra stump deprived of the conditions of development not destined for future arising
Therefore he sleeps in ease
Now what do you think young man
Might there arise in that householder or householder's son any bodily fevers or fevers of mind born of delusion so that  burned with those delusionborn fevers  he would sleep miserably
Yes lord
As for those delusionborn fevers  burned with which the householder or householder's son would sleep miserably  that delusion has been abandoned by the Tathagata its root destroyed made like a palmyra stump deprived of the conditions of development not destined for future arising
Therefore he sleeps in ease

Monks there are these five faculties
Which five
The faculty of conviction the faculty of persistence the faculty of mindfulness the faculty of concentration the faculty of discernment
Now what is the faculty of conviction
There is the case where a monk a disciple of the noble ones has conviction is convinced of the Tathagata's Awakening 'Indeed the Blessed One is worthy and rightly selfawakened consummate in knowledge  conduct wellgone an expert with regard to the world unexcelled as a trainer for those people fit to be tamed the Teacher of divine  human beings awakened blessed' This is called the faculty of conviction
And what is the faculty of persistence
There is the case where a monk a disciple of the noble ones keeps his persistence aroused for abandoning unskillful mental qualities and taking on skillful mental qualities
He is steadfast solid in his effort not shirking his duties with regard to skillful mental qualities
He generates desire endeavors arouses persistence upholds  exerts his intent for the sake of the nonarising of evil unskillful qualities that have not yet arisen for the sake of the abandoning of evil unskillful qualities that have arisen for the sake of the arising of skillful qualities that have not yet arisen for the maintenance nonconfusion increase plenitude development  culmination of skillful qualities that have arisen
This is called the faculty of persistence
And what is the faculty of mindfulness
There is the case where a monk a disciple of the noble ones is mindful highly meticulous remembering  able to call to mind even things that were done  said long ago
He remains focused on the body in  of itself  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the world
He remains focused on feelings in  of themselves the mind in  of itself mental qualities in  of themselves  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the world
This is called the faculty of mindfulness
And what is the faculty of concentration
There is the case where a monk a disciple of the noble ones making it his object to let go attains concentration attains singleness of mind
Quite withdrawn from sensuality withdrawn from unskillful mental qualities he enters  remains in the first jhana rapture  pleasure born from withdrawal accompanied by directed thought  evaluation
With the stilling of directed thoughts  evaluations he enters  remains in the second jhana rapture  pleasure born of composure unification of awareness free from directed thought  evaluation  internal assurance
With the fading of rapture he remains equanimous mindful  alert and senses pleasure with the body
He enters  remains in the third jhana of which the Noble Ones declare 'Equanimous  mindful he has a pleasant abiding' With the abandoning of pleasure  pain  as with the earlier disappearance of elation  distress  he enters  remains in the fourth jhana purity of equanimity  mindfulness neither pleasure nor pain
This is called the faculty of concentration
And what is the faculty of discernment
There is the case where a monk a disciple of the noble ones is discerning endowed with discernment of arising  passing away  noble penetrating leading to the right ending of stress
He discerns as it has come to be 'This is stress This is the origination of stress This is the cessation of stress This is the path of practice leading to the cessation of stress' This is called the faculty of discernment
These are the five faculties

The Blessed One said And what monks is the origination of the body
From the origination of nutriment is the origination of the body
From the cessation of nutriment is the subsiding of the body
From the origination of contact is the origination of feeling
From the cessation of contact is the subsiding of feeling
From the origination of nameform is the origination of the mind
From the cessation of nameform is the cessation of the mind
Mental qualities  dhammas
SN
discusses the ways in which inappropriate attention feeds such unskillful mental qualities as the hindrances whereas appropriate attention feeds such skillful mental qualities as the factors for awakening
Dhammas can also mean phenomena events or actions It is apparently in connection with these three meanings that AN
lists three factors underlying the appearance of dhammas
All phenomena are rooted in desire
All phenomena come into play through attention
All phenomena have contact as their origination
I will teach you the frames of reference their development and the path of practice leading to their development
Listen  pay close attention

I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was living among the Sumbhas
Now there is a Sumbhan town named Sedaka
There the Blessed One addressed the monks Monks
Yes lord the monks responded
The Blessed One said Suppose monks that a large crowd of people comes thronging together saying 'The beauty queen
The beauty queen' And suppose that the beauty queen is highly accomplished at singing  dancing so that an even greater crowd comes thronging saying 'The beauty queen is singing
The beauty queen is dancing' Then a man comes along desiring life  shrinking from death desiring pleasure  abhorring pain
They say to him 'Now look here mister
You must take this bowl filled to the brim with oil and carry it on your head in between the great crowd  the beauty queen
A man with a raised sword will follow right behind you and wherever you spill even a drop of oil right there will he cut off your head' Now what do you think monks Will that man not paying attention to the bowl of oil let himself get distracted outside
No lord
I have given you this parable to convey a meaning
The meaning is this The bowl filled to the brim with oil stands for mindfulness immersed in the body
Thus you should train yourselves 'We will develop mindfulness immersed in the body
We will pursue it hand it the reins and take it as a basis give it a grounding steady it consolidate it and undertake it well' That is how you should train yourselves
Why is it good Gotama how does it come about that sometimes sacred words I have long studied are not clear to me not to mention those I have not studied
And how is it too that sometimes other sacred words that I have not so studied are clear to me not to mention those I have studied
Well Brahman when a man dwells with his heart possessed and overwhelmed by sensedesires and does not know as it really is the way of escape from sensedesires that have arisen then he cannot know or see as it really is what is to his own profit nor can he know and see what is to the profit of others or of both himself and others
Then even sacred words he has long studied are not clear to him not to mention those he has not studied
Imagine Brahman a bowl of water mixed with lac turmeric dark green or crimson dye
If a man with good eyesight were to look at the reflection of his own face in it he would not know or see it as it really was
In the same way Brahman when a man dwells with his heart possessed and overwhelmed by sensedesires then he cannot know or see as it really is what is to his own profit to the profit of others to the profit of both
Then even sacred words he has long studied are not clear to him not to mention those he has not studied
Again Brahman when a man dwells with his heart possessed and overwhelmed with illwill then he cannot know or see
Imagine a bowl of water heated on a fire boiling up and bubbling over
If a man with good eyesight were to look at the reflection of his own face in it he would not know or see it as it really was
Again Brahman when a man dwells with his heart possessed and overwhelmed by slothandtorpor then he cannot know or see
Imagine a bowl of water covered over with slimy moss and waterplants
If a man with good eyesight were to look at the reflection of his own face in it he would not know or see it as it really was
Again Brahman when a man dwells with his heart possessed and overwhelmed by worryandflurry then he cannot know or see
Imagine a bowl of water ruffled by the wind so that the water trembled eddied and rippled
If a man with good eyesight were to look at the reflection of his own face in it he would not know or see it as it really was
Again Brahman when a man dwells with his heart possessed and overwhelmed by doubtandwavering he cannot know or see
Imagine a bowl of water agitated stirred up muddied put in a dark place
If a man with good eyesight were to look at the reflection of his own face in it he would not know or see it as it really was
In the same way Brahman when a man dwells with his heart possessed and overwhelmed by doubtandwavering then he cannot know or see as it really is what is to his own profit to the profit of others to the profit of both
Then even sacred words he has long studied are not clear to him not to mention those he has studied
But Brahman when a man dwells with his heart not possessed not overwhelmed by sensedesires illwill slothandtorpor worryandflurry doubtandwavering then he knows and sees as it really is what is to his own profit to the profit of others to the profit of both himself and others
Then even sacred words he has not long studied are clear to him not to mention those he has studied
There are in the Himalayas the king of mountains difficult uneven areas where neither monkeys nor human beings wander
There are difficult uneven areas where monkeys wander but not human beings
There are level stretches of land delightful where both monkeys and human beings wander
In such spots hunters set a tar trap in the monkeys' tracks in order to catch some monkeys
Those monkeys who are not foolish or careless by nature when they see the tar trap avoid it from afar
But any monkey who is foolish  careless by nature comes up to the tar trap and grabs it with its paw
He gets stuck there
Thinking 'I'll free my paw' he grabs it with his other paw
He gets stuck there
Thinking 'I'll free both of my paws' he grabs it with his foot
He gets stuck there
Thinking 'I'll free both of my paws and my foot' he grabs it with his other foot
He gets stuck there
Thinking 'I'll free both of my paws and my feet as well' he grabs it with his mouth
He gets stuck there
So the monkey snared in five ways lies there whimpering having fallen on misfortune fallen on ruin a prey to whatever the hunter wants to do with him
Then the hunter without releasing the monkey skewers him right there picks him up and goes off as he likes
This is what happens to anyone who wanders into what is not his proper range and is the territory of others
For this reason you should not wander into what is not your proper range and is the territory of others
In one who wanders into what is not his proper range and is the territory of others Mara gains an opening Mara gains a foothold
And what for a monk is not his proper range and is the territory of others
The five strands of sensuality
Which five
Forms cognizable by the eye  agreeable pleasing charming endearing fostering desire enticing
Sounds cognizable by the ear Aromas cognizable by the nose Flavors cognizable by the tongue Tactile sensations cognizable by the body  agreeable pleasing charming endearing fostering desire enticing
These for a monk are not his proper range and are the territory of others
Wander monks in what is your proper range your own ancestral territory
In one who wanders in what is his proper range his own ancestral territory Mara gains no opening Mara gains no foothold
And what for a monk is his proper range his own ancestral territory
The four frames of reference

Another translation of the Dhammapada
Many other English translations are already available  the fingers of at least five people would be needed to count them  so I suppose that a new translation has to be justified to prove that it's not just another one
In doing so though I'd rather not criticize the efforts of earlier translators for I owe them a great deal
Instead I'll ask you to read the Introduction and Historical Notes to gain an idea of what is distinctive about the approach I have taken and the translation itself which I hope will stand on its own merits
The original impulse for making the translation came from my conviction that the text deserved to be offered freely as a gift of Dhamma
As I knew of no existing translations available as gifts I made my own
The explanatory material is designed to meet with the needs of two sorts of readers those who want to read the text as a text in the context of the religious history of Buddhism  viewed from the outside  and those who want to read the text as a guide to the personal conduct of their lives
Although there is no clear line dividing these groups the Introduction is aimed more at the second group and the Historical Notes more at the first
The End Notes and Glossary contain material that should be of interest to both
Verses marked with an asterisk in the translation are discussed in the End Notes
Pali terms  as well as English terms used in a special sense such as effluent enlightened one fabrication stress and Unbinding  when they appear in more than one verse are explained in the Glossary
In addition to the previous translators and editors from whose work I have borrowed I owe a special debt of gratitude to Jeanne Larsen for her help in honing down the language of the translation
Also John Bullitt Gil Fronsdal Charles Hallisey Karen King Andrew Olendzki Ruth Stiles Clark Strand Paula Trahan and Jane Yudelman offered many helpful comments that improved the quality of the book as a whole
Any mistakes that remain of course are my own responsibility
The Dhammapada an anthology of verses attributed to the Buddha has long been recognized as one of the masterpieces of early Buddhist literature
Only more recently have scholars realized that it is also one of the early masterpieces in the Indian tradition of kavya or belles lettres
This translation of the Dhammapada is an attempt to render the verses into English in a way that does justice to both of the traditions to which the text belongs
Although it is tempting to view these traditions as distinct dealing with form and content the ideals of kavya aimed at combining form and content into a seamless whole
At the same time the early Buddhists adopted and adapted the conventions of kavya in a way that skillfully dovetailed with their views of how teaching and listening played a role in their path of practice
My hope is that the translation presented here will convey the same seamlessness and skill
As an example of kavya the Dhammapada has a fairly complete body of ethical and aesthetic theory behind it for the purpose of kavya was to instruct in the highest ends of life while simultaneously giving delight
The ethical teaching of the Dhammapada is expressed in the first pair of verses the mind through its actions is the chief architect of one's happiness and suffering both in this life and beyond
The first three chapters elaborate on this point to show that there are two major ways of relating to this fact as a wise person who is heedful enough to make the necessary effort to train hisher own mind to be a skillful architect and as a fool who is heedless and sees no reason to train the mind
The work as a whole elaborates on this distinction showing in more detail both the path of the wise person and that of the fool together with the rewards of the former and the dangers of the latter the path of the wise person can lead not only to happiness within the cycle of death and rebirth but also to total escape into the Deathless beyond the cycle entirely the path of the fool leads not only to suffering now and in the future but also to further entrapment within the cycle
The purpose of the Dhammapada is to make the wise path attractive to the reader so that heshe will follow it  for the dilemma posited by the first pair of verses is not one in the imaginary world of fiction it is the dilemma in which the reader is already placed by the fact of being born
To make the wise path attractive the techniques of poetry are used to give savor to the message
Ancient Indian aesthetic treatises devoted a great deal of discussion to the notion of savor and how it could be conveyed
The basic theory was this Artistic composition expressed states of emotion or states of mind called bhava The standard list of basic emotions included love humor grief anger energy fear disgust and astonishment
The reader or listener exposed to these presentations of emotion did not participate in them directly rather heshe savored them as an aesthetic experience at one remove from the emotion
Thus the savor of grief is not grief but compassion
The savor of energy is not energy itself but admiration for heroism
The savor of love is not love but an experience of sensitivity
The savor of astonishment is a sense of the marvelous
The proof of the indirectness of the aesthetic experience was that some of the basic emotions were decidedly unpleasant while the savor of the emotion was to be enjoyed
Although a work of art might depict many emotions and thus  like a good meal  offer many savors for the readerlistener to taste one savor was supposed to dominate
Writers made a common practice of announcing the savor they were trying to produce usually stating in passing that their particular savor was the highest of all
The Dhammapada states explicitly that the savor of Dhamma is the highest savor which indicates that that is the basic savor of the work
Classic aesthetic theory lists the savor of Dhamma or justice as one of the three basic varieties of the heroic savor thus we would expect the majority of the verses to depict energy and in fact they do with their exhortations to action strong verbs repeated imperatives and frequent use of the imagery from battles races and conquests
Dhamma in the Buddhist sense implies more than the justice of Dhamma in aesthetic theory
However the long section of the Dhammapada devoted to The Judge  beginning with a definition of a good judge and continuing with examples of good judgment  shows that the Buddhist concept of Dhamma has room for the aesthetic meaning of the term as well
Classic theory also holds that the heroic savor should especially at the end of a piece shade into the marvelous
This in fact is what happens periodically throughout the Dhammapada and especially at the end where the verses express astonishment at the amazing and paradoxical qualities of a person who has followed the path of heedfulness to its end becoming pathless  totally indescribable transcending conflicts and dualities of every sort
Thus the predominant emotions that the verses express in Pali  and should also express in translation  are energy and astonishment so as to produce qualities of the heroic and marvelous for the reader to savor
This savor is then what inspires the reader to follow the path of wisdom with the result that heshe will reach a direct experience of the true happiness transcending all dualities found at the end of the path
Classic aesthetic theory lists a variety of rhetorical features that can produce savor
Examples from these lists that can be found in the Dhammapada include accumulation admonitions ambiguity benedictions distinctions encouragement etymology examples explanations of cause and effect illustrations implications rhetorical questions praise prohibitions and ornamentation
Of these ornamentation is the most complex including four figures of speech and ten qualities The figures of speech are simile extended metaphor rhyme and lamps
This last figure is a peculiarity of Pali  a heavily inflected language  that allows say one adjective to modify two different nouns or one verb to function in two separate sentences
In English the closest we have to this is parallelism combined with ellipsis
An example from the translation is in verse 
 where overcomes functions as the verb in both clauses even though it is elided from the second
This is how I have rendered lamps in most of the verses although in two cases I found it more effective to repeat the lampword
The ten qualities are more general attributes of sound syntax and sense including such attributes as charm clarity delicacy evenness exaltation sweetness and strength
The ancient texts are not especially clear on what some of these terms mean in practice
Even where they are clear the terms deal in aspects of PaliSanskrit syntax not always applicable to English
What is important though is that some qualities are seen as more suited to a particular savor than others strength and exaltation for example best convey a taste of the heroic and marvelous
Of these characteristics strength is the easiest to quantify for it is marked by long compounded words
In the Dhammapada approximately one tenth of the verses contain compounds that are as long as a whole line of verse and one verse has three of its four lines made up of such compounds
By the standards of later Sanskrit verse this is rather mild but when compared with verses in the rest of the Pali Canon and other early masterpieces of kavya the Dhammapada is quite strong
The text also explicitly adds to the theory of characteristics in saying that sweetness is not just an attribute of words but of the person speaking
If the person is a true example of the virtue espoused hisher words are sweet
This point could be generalized to cover many of the other qualities as well
Another point from classic aesthetic theory that may be relevant to the Dhammapada is the principle of how a literary work is given unity
Although the text does not provide a stepbystep sequential portrait of the path of wisdom as a lyric anthology it is much more unified than most Indian examples of that genre
The classic theory of dramatic plot construction may be playing an indirect role here
On the one hand a plot must exhibit unity by presenting a conflict or dilemma and depicting the attainment of a goal through overcoming that conflict
This is precisely what unifies the Dhammapada it begins with the duality between heedless and heedful ways of living and ends with the final attainment of total mastery
On the other hand the plot must not show smooth systematic progress otherwise the work would turn into a treatise
There must be reversals and diversions to maintain interest
This principle is at work in the fairly unsystematic ordering of the Dhammapada's middle sections
Verses dealing with the beginning stages of the path are mixed together with those dealing with later stages and even stages beyond the completion of the path
One more point is that the ideal plot should be constructed with a subplot in which a secondary character gains hisher goal and in so doing helps the main character attain his or hers
In addition to the aesthetic pleasure offered by the subplot the ethical lesson is one of human cooperation people attain their goals by working together
In the Dhammapada the same dynamic is at work
The main plot is that of the person who masters the principle of kamma to the point of total release from kamma and the round of rebirth the subplot depicts the person who masters the principle of kamma to the point of gaining a good rebirth on the human or heavenly planes
The second person gains hisher goal in part by being generous and respectful to the first person thus enabling the first person to practice to the point of total mastery
In return the first person gives counsel to the second person on how to pursue hisher goal
In this way the Dhammapada depicts the play of life in a way that offers two potentially heroic roles for the reader to choose from and delineates those roles in such a way that all people can choose to be heroic working together for the attainment of their own true well being
Perhaps the best way to summarize the confluence of Buddhist and kavya traditions in the Dhammapada is in light of a teaching from another early Buddhist text the Samyutta Nikaya on the factors needed to attain one's first taste of the goal of the Buddhist path
Those factors are four associating with people of integrity listening to their teachings using appropriate attention to inquire into the way those teachings apply to one's life and practicing in line with the teachings in a way that does them justice
Early Buddhists used the traditions of kavya  concerning savor rhetoric structure and figures of speech  primarily in connection with the second of these factors in order to make the teachings appealing to the listener
However the question of savor is related to the other three factors as well
The words of a teaching must be spoken by a person of integrity who embodies their message in hisher actions if their savor is to be sweet
The listener must reflect on them appropriately and then put them into practice if they are to have more than a passing superficial taste
Thus both the speaker and listener must act in line with the words of a teaching if it is to bear fruit
This point is reflected in a pair of verses from the Dhammapada itself
Appropriate reflection the first step a listener should follow in carrying out the wellspoken word means contemplating one's own life to see the dangers of following the path of foolishness and the need to follow the path of wisdom
The Buddhist tradition recognizes two emotions as playing a role in this reflection
The first is samvega a strong sense of dismay that comes with realizing the futility and meaningless of life as it is normally lived together with a feeling of urgency in trying to find a way out of the meaningless cycle
The second emotion is pasada the clarity and serenity that come when one recognizes a teaching that presents the truth of the dilemma of existence and at the same time points the way out
One function of the verses in the Dhammapada is to provide this sense of clarity which is why verse states that the wise grow serene on hearing the Dhamma and states that the most worthwhile verse is the meaningful one that on hearing brings peace
However the process does not stop with these preliminary feelings of peace and serenity
The listener must carry through with the path of practice that the verses recommend
Although much of the impetus for doing so comes from the emotions of samvega and pasada sparked by the content of the verses the heroic and marvelous savor of the verses plays a role as well by inspiring the listener to rouse within him or herself the energy and strength that the path will require
When the path is brought to fruition it brings the peace and delight of the Deathless
This is where the process initiated by hearing or reading the Dhamma bears its deepest savor surpassing all others
It is the highest sense in which the meaningful verses of the Dhammapada bring peace
In preparing the following translation I have kept the above points in mind motivated both by a firm belief in the truth of the message of the Dhammapada and by a desire to present it in a compelling way that will induce the reader to put it into practice
Although trying to stay as close as possible to the literal meaning of the text I've also tried to convey its savor
I'm operating on the classic assumption that although there may be a tension between giving instruction and giving delight the best translation is one that plays with that tension without submitting totally to one side at the expense of the other
To convey the savor of the work I have aimed at a spare style flexible enough to express not only its dominant emotions  energy and astonishment  but also its transient emotions such as humor delight and fear
Although the original verses conform to metrical rules the translations are in free verse
This is the form that requires the fewest deviations from literal accuracy and allows for a terse directness that conforms with the heroic savor of the original
The freedom I have used in placing words on the page also allows many of the poetic effects of Pali syntax  especially the parallelism and ellipsis of the lamps  to shine through
I have been relatively consistent in choosing English equivalents for Pali terms especially where the terms have a technical meaning
Total consistency although it may be a logical goal is by no means a rational one especially in translating poetry
Anyone who is truly bilingual will appreciate this point
Words in the original were chosen for their sound and connotations as well as their literal sense so the same principles  within reasonable limits  have been used in the translation
Deviations from the original syntax are rare and have been limited primarily to six sorts
The first four are for the sake of immediacy occasional use of the American you for one occasional use of imperatives for optatives substituting active for passive voice and replacing he who does this with he does this in many of the verses defining the true brahman in Chapter
The remaining two deviations are making minor adjustments in sentence structure to keep a word at the beginning or end of a verse when this position seems important and changing the number from singular to plural when talking about personality types both to streamline the language and to lighten the gender bias of the original Pali

In verses where I sense that a particular Pali word or phrase is meant to carry multiple meanings I have explicitly given all of those meanings in the English even where this has meant a considerable expansion of the verse
Otherwise I have tried to make the translation as transparent as possible in order to allow the light and energy of the original to pass through with minimal distortion
The Dhammapada has for centuries been used as an introduction to the Buddhist point of view
However the text is by no means elementary either in terms of content or style
Many of the verses presuppose at least a passing knowledge of Buddhist doctrine others employ multiple levels of meaning and wordplay typical of polished kavya
For this reason I have added notes to the translation to help draw out some of the implications of verses that might not be obvious to people who are new to either of the two traditions that the text represents
I hope that whatever delight you gain from this translation will inspire you to put the Buddha's words into practice so that you will someday taste the savor not just of the words but of the Deathless to which they point
There are many versions of the Dhammapada now extant several recensions of the Pali Dhammapada from Burma Cambodia Laos Sri Lanka and Thailand two incomplete manuscripts of a Gandhari Dharmapada found in central Asia and a manuscript of a Buddhist HybridSanskrit Dharmapada found in a library in Tibet called the Patna Dharmapada because photographs of this manuscript are now kept in Patna India
There is also a Chinese translation of the Dharmapada made in the third century CE
from a Prakrit original now no longer extant similar to  but not identical with  the Pali Dhammapada
Parts of a Dharmapada text are included in the Mahavastu a text belonging to the Lokottaravadin Mahasanghika school
In addition there are Sanskrit Tibetan and Chinese versions of a text called the Udanavarga which is known in at least four recensions all of them containing many verses in common with the DhammapadaDharmapada texts
To further complicate matters there are Jain anthologies that contain verses clearly related to some of those found in these Buddhist anthologies as well
Despite the many similarities among these texts they contain enough discrepancies to have fueled a small scholarly industry
The different recensions of the Pali Dhp contain so many variant readings that there isn't yet  even after more than a century of Western scholarship on the topic  a single edition covering them all
The discrepancies among the Pali and nonPali versions are even greater
They arrange verses in different orders each contains verses not found in the others and among the verses in different versions that are related the similarity in terms of imagery or message is sometimes fairly tenuous
Fortunately for anyone looking to the Dhp for spiritual guidance the differences among the various recensions  though many in number  range in importance from fairly minor to minor in the extreme
Allowing for a few obvious scribal errors none of them fall outside the pale of what has long been accepted as standard early Buddhist doctrine as derived from the Pali discourses
For example does the milk in verse come out or does it curdle
Is the bond in verse subtle slack or elastic
Is the brahman in verse happy or is he pure
For all practical purposes these questions hardly matter
They become important only when one is forced to take sides in choosing which version to translate and even then the nature of the choice is like that of a conductor deciding which of the many versions of a Handel oratorio to perform
Unfortunately for the translator though the scholarly discussions that have grown around these issues have tended to blow them all out of proportion to the point where they call into question the authenticity of the Dhp as a whole
Because the scholars who have devoted themselves to this topic have come up with such contradictory advice for the potential translator  including the suggestion that it's a waste of time to translate some of the verses at all  we need to sort through the discussions to see what if any reliable guidance they give
Those who have worked on the issues raised by the variant versions of Dhp have by and large directed the discussion to figuring out which version is the oldest and most authentic and which versions are later and more corrupt
Lacking any outside landmarks against which the versions can be sighted scholars have attempted to reconstruct what must have been the earliest version by triangulating among the texts themselves
This textual trigonometry tends to rely on assumptions from among the following three types
 Assumptions concerning what is inherently an earlier or later form of a verse
These assumptions are the least reliable of the three for they involve no truly objective criteria
If for instance two versions of a verse differ in that one is more internally consistent than the other the consistent version will seem more genuine to one scholar whereas another scholar will attribute the consistency to later efforts to clean up the verse
Similarly if one version contains a rendition of a verse different from all other renditions of the same verse one scholar will see that as a sign of deviance another as a sign of the authenticity that may have predated a later standardization among the texts
Thus the conclusions drawn by different scholars based on these assumptions tell us more about the scholars' presuppositions than they do about the texts themselves
 Assumptions concerning the meter of the verses in question
One of the great advances in recent Pali scholarship has been the rediscovery of the metrical rules underlying early Pali poetry
As the Buddha himself is quoted as saying Meter is the structural framework of verses Knowledge of metrical rules thus helps the editor or translator spot which readings of a verse deviate from the structure of a standard meter and which ones follow it
Theoretically the obvious choice would be to adopt the latter and reject the former
In practice however the issue is not so clearcut
Early Pali poetry dates from a time of great metrical experimentation and so there is always the possibility that a particular poem was composed in an experimental meter that never achieved widespread recognition
There is also the possibility that  as the poetry was spontaneous and oral  a fair amount of metrical license was allowed
This means that the more correct forms of a verse may have been the products of a later attempt to fit the poetry into standard molds
Thus the conclusions based on the assumption of standard meters are not as totally reliable as they might seem
 Assumptions concerning the language in which the original Dhp was first composed
These assumptions require an extensive knowledge of Middle Indic dialects
A scholar will assume a particular dialect to have been the original language of the text and will further make assumptions about the types of translation mistakes that might have been common when translating from that dialect into the languages of the texts we now have
The textual trigonometry based on these assumptions often involves such complicated methods of sighting and computation that it can produce an original version of the text that is just that very original coinciding with none of the versions extant
In other words where the current variants of a verse might be a b and c the added assumption about the Dhp's original language and the ineptitude of ancient translators and copyists leads to the conclusion that the verse must have been d
However for all the impressive erudition that this method involves not even the most learned scholar can offer any proof as to what the Dhp's original language was
In fact as we will consider below it is possible that the Buddha  assuming that he was the author of the verses  composed poetry in more than one language and more than one version of a particular verse
So as with the first set of assumptions the methods of triangulation based on an assumed original language of the Dhp tell us more about the individual scholar's position than they do about the position of the text
Thus although the scholarship devoted to the different recensions of the Dhp has provided a useful service in unearthing so many variant readings of the text none of the assumptions used in trying to sort through those readings for the original Dhp have led to any definite conclusions
Their positive success has been limited mainly to offering food for academic speculation and educated guesses
On the negative side though they have succeeded in accomplishing something totally useless a wholesale sense of distrust for the early Buddhist texts and the poetic texts in particular
If the texts contain so many varying reports the feeling goes and if their translators and transmitters were so incompetent how can any of them be trusted
This distrust comes from accepting unconsciously the assumptions concerning authorship and authenticity within which our modern predominately literate culture operates that only one version of a verse could have been composed by its original author and that all other versions must be later corruptions
In terms of the Dhp this comes down to assuming that there was only one original version of the text and that it was composed in a single language
However these assumptions are totally inappropriate for analyzing the oral culture in which the Buddha taught and in which the verses of the Dhp were first anthologized
If we look carefully at the nature of that culture  and in particular at clear statements from the early Buddhist texts concerning the events and principles that shaped those texts  we will see that it is perfectly natural that there should be a variety of reports about the Buddha's teachings all of which might be essentially correct
In terms of the Dhp we can view the multiple versions of the text as a sign not of faulty transmission but of an allegiance to their oral origins
Oral prose and poetry are very different from their written counterparts
This fact is obvious even in our own culture
However we have to make an active effort of the imagination to comprehend the expectations placed on oral transmission between speakers and listeners in a culture where there is no written word to fall back on
In such a setting the verbal heritage is maintained totally through repetition and memorization
A speaker with something new to say has to repeat it often to different audiences  who if they feel inspired by the message are expected to memorize at least its essential parts
Because communication is facetoface a speaker is particularly prized for an ability to tailor hisher message to the moment of communication in terms of the audience's background from the past its state of mind at present and its hopedfor benefits in the future
This puts a double imperative on both the speaker and the listener
The speaker must choose hisher words with an eye both to how they will affect the audience in the present and to how they will be memorized for future reference
The listener must be attentive both to appreciate the immediate impact of the words and to memorize them for future use
Although originality in teaching is appreciated it is only one of a constellation of virtues expected of a teacher
Other expected virtues include a knowledge of common culture and an ability to play with that knowledge for the desired effect in terms of immediate impact or memorability
The Pali Dhp itself makes this point in comparing the act of teaching not to creating something totally new out of nothing but to selecting among available flowers to create a pleasing arrangement just right for the occasion
Of course there are situations in an oral culture where either immediate impact or memorability is emphasized at the expense of the other
In a classroom listening for impact is sacrificed to the needs of listening for memorization whereas in a theater the emphasis is reversed
All indications show however that the Buddha as a teacher was especially sensitive to both aspects of oral communication and that he trained his listeners to be sensitive to both as well
On the one hand the repetitious style of many of his recorded teachings seems to have been aimed at hammering them into the listener's memory also at the end of many of his discourses he would summarize the main points of the discussion in an easytomemorize verse
On the other hand there are many reports of instances in which his listeners gained immediate Awakening while listening to his words
And there is a delightful section in one of his discourses satirizing the teachers of other religious sects for their inability to break away from the formulaic mode of their teachings to give a direct answer to specific questions The Buddha in contrast was famous for his ability to speak directly to his listeners' needs
This sensitivity to both present impact and future use is in line with two wellknown Buddhist teachings first the basic Buddhist principle of causality that an act has repercussions both in the present and on into the future second the Buddha's realization early on in his teaching career that some of his listeners would attain Awakening immediately on hearing his words whereas others would be able to awaken only after taking his words contemplating them and putting them into prolonged practice
A survey of the Buddha's prose discourses recorded in the Pali Canon gives an idea of how the Buddha met the double demands placed on him as a teacher
In some cases to respond to a particular situation he would formulate an entirely original teaching
In others he would simply repeat a formulaic answer that he kept in store for general use either teachings original with him or more traditional teachings  sometimes lightly tailored sometimes not  that fit in with his message
In still others he would take formulaic bits and pieces and combine them in a new way for the needs at hand
A survey of his poetry reveals the same range of material original works set pieces  original or borrowed occasionally altered in line with the occasion and recyclings of old fragments in new juxtapositions
Thus although the Buddha insisted that all his teachings had the same taste  that of release  he taught different variations on the theme of that taste to different people on different occasions in line with his perception of their short and longterm needs
In reciting a verse to a particular audience he might change a word a line or an image to fit in with their backgrounds and individual needs
Adding to this potential for variety was the fact that the people of northern India in his time spoke a number of different dialects each with its own traditions of poetry and prose
The Pali Cullavagga records the Buddha as insisting that his listeners memorize his teachings not in a standardized lingua franca but in their own dialects
There is no way of knowing whether he himself was multilingual enough to teach all of his students in their own dialects or expected them to make the translations themselves
Still it seems likely that as a welleducated aristocrat of the time he would have been fluent in at least two or three of the most prevalent dialects
Some of the discourses  such as DN  depict the Buddha as an articulate connoisseur of poetry and song so we can expect that he would also have been sensitive to the special problems involved in the effective translation of poetry  alive for instance to the fact that skilled translation requires more than simply substituting equivalent words
The Mahavagga reports that the Buddha listened with appreciation as a monk from the southern country of Avanti recited some of his teachings  apparently in the Avanti dialect  in his presence
Although scholars have often raised questions about which language the Buddha spoke it might be more appropriate to remain open to the possibility that he spoke  and could compose poetry in  several
This possibility makes the question of the original language or the original text of the Dhp somewhat irrelevant
The texts suggest that even during the Buddha's lifetime his students made efforts to collect and memorize a standardized body of his teachings under a rubric of nine categories dialogues narratives of mixed prose and verse explanations verses spontaneous exclamations quotations birth stories amazing events question and answer sessions
However the act of collecting and memorizing was pursued by only a subgroup among his monks while other monks nuns and lay people doubtlessly had their own individual memorized stores of teachings they had heard directly from the Buddha or indirectly through the reports of their friends and acquaintances
The Buddha had the foresight to ensure that this less standardized fund of memories not be discounted by later generations at the same time he established norms so that mistaken reports deviating from the principles of his teachings would not be allowed to creep into the accepted body of doctrine
To discourage fabricated reports of his words he warned that anyone who put words in his mouth was slandering him
This however could in no way prevent mistaken reports based on honest misunderstandings
So shortly before his death he summarized the basic principles of his teachings the Wings to Awakening in the general framework of the development of virtue concentration and discernment leading to release
Then he announced the general norms by which reports of his teachings were to be judged
The Mahaparinibbana Suttanta quotes him as saying
Thus a report of the Buddha's teachings was to be judged not on the authority of the reporter or his sources but on the principle of consistency did it fit in with what was already known of the doctrine
This principle was designed to ensure that nothing at odds with the original would be accepted into the standard canon but it did open the possibility that teachings in line with the Buddha's yet not actually spoken by him might find their way in
The early redactors of the canon seem to have been alert to this possibility but not overly worried by it
As the Buddha himself pointed out many times he did not design or create the Dhamma
He simply found it in nature
Anyone who developed the pitch of mental strengths and abilities needed for Awakening could discover the same principles as well
Thus the Dhamma was by no means exclusively his
This attitude was carried over into the passages of the Vinaya that cite four categories of Dhamma statements spoken by the Buddha spoken by his disciples spoken by seers spoken by heavenly beings
As long as a statement was in accordance with the basic principles the question of who first stated it did not matter
In an oral culture where a saying might be associated with a person because he authored it approved it repeated it often or inspired it by hisher words or actions the question of authorship was not the overriding concern it has since become in literate cultures
The recent discovery of evidence that a number of teachings associated with the Buddha may have pre or postdated his time would not have fazed the early Buddhists at all as long as those teachings were in accordance with the original principles
Shortly after the Buddha's passing away the Cullavagga reports his disciples met to agree on a standardized canon of his teachings abandoning the earlier ninefold classification and organizing the material into something approaching the canon we have today
There is clear evidence that some of the passages in the extant canon do not date to the first convocation as they report incidents that took place afterwards
The question naturally arises as to whether there are any other later additions not so obvious
This question is particularly relevant with regard to texts like the Dhp whose organization differs considerably from redaction to redaction and leads naturally to the further question of whether a later addition to the canon can be considered authentic
The Cullavagga recounts an incident that sheds light on this issue
In other words Ven
Purana maintained  and undoubtedly taught to his followers  a record of the Buddha's teachings that lay outside the standardized version but was nevertheless authentic
As we have already noted there were monks nuns and lay people like him even while the Buddha was alive and there were probably others like him who continued maintaining personal memories of the Buddha's teachings even after the latter's death
This story shows the official early Buddhist attitude toward such differing traditions each accepted the trustworthiness of the others
As time passed some of the early communities may have made an effort to include these external records in the standardized canon resulting in various collections of prose and verse passages
The range of these collections would have been determined by the material that was available in or could be effectively translated into each individual dialect
Their organization would have depended on the taste and skill of the individual collectors
Thus for instance we find verses in the Pali Dhp that do not exist in other Dhps as well as verses in the Patna and Gandhari Dhps that the Pali tradition assigns to the Jataka or Sutta Nipata
We also find verses in one redaction composed of lines scattered among several verses in another
In any event the fact that a text was a later addition to the standardized canon does not necessarily mean that it was a later invention
Given the ad hoc way in which the Buddha sometimes taught and the scattered nature of the communities who memorized his teachings the later additions to the canons may simply represent earlier traditions that escaped standardization until relatively late
When Buddhists began committing their canons to writing approximately at the beginning of the common era they brought a great change to the dynamic of how their traditions were maintained
The advantages of written over oral transmission are obvious the texts are saved from the vagaries of human longterm memory and do not die out if those who have memorized them die before teaching others to memorize them as well
The disadvantages of written transmission however are less obvious but no less real
Not only is there the possibility of scribal error but  because transmission is not facetoface  there can also be the suspicion of scribal error
If a reading seems strange to a student he has no way of checking with the scribe perhaps several generations distant to see if the reading was indeed a mistake
When confronted with such problems he may correct the reading to fit in with his ideas of what must be right even in cases where the reading was correct and its perceived strangeness was simply a result of changes in the spoken dialect or of his own limited knowledge and imagination
The fact that manuscripts of other versions of the text were also available for comparison in such instances could have led scribes to homogenize the texts removing unusual variants even when the variants themselves may have gone back to the earliest days of the tradition
These considerations of how the Dhp may have been handed down to the present  and especially the possibility that variant recensions might all be authentic and that agreement among the recensions might be the result of later homogenization  have determined the way in which I have approached this translation of the Pali Dhp
Unlike some other recent translators I am treating the Pali Dhp as a text with its own integrity  just as each of the alternative traditions has its own integrity  and have not tried to homogenize the various traditions
Where the different Pali recensions are unanimous in their readings even in cases where the reading seems strange I have stuck with the Pali without trying to rectify it in light of less unusual readings given in the other traditions
Only in cases where the different Pali redactions are at variance with one another and the variants seem equally plausible have I checked the nonPali texts to see which variant they support
The translation here is drawn from three editions of the text the Pali Text Society edition edited by O
von Hinber and KR
Norman the Oxford edition edited by John Ross Carter and Mahinda Palihawadana together with its extensive notes and the Royal Thai edition of the Pali Canon
The pts edition gives the most extensive list of variant readings among the Pali recensions but even it is not complete
The Royal Thai edition for example contains preferred and variant readings not given in the PTS version at all
Passages where I have differed from the PTS reading are cited in the End Notes
Drawing selectively on various recensions in this way I cannot guarantee that the resulting reading of the Dhp corresponds exactly to the Buddha's words or to any one text that once existed in ancient India
However as I mentioned at the beginning of this note all the recensions agree in their basic principles so the question is immaterial
The true test of the reading  and the resulting translation  is if the reader feels engaged enough by the verses to put their principles into practice and finds that they do indeed lead to the release that the Buddha taught
In the final analysis nothing else really counts
The fact that the word mano is paired here with dhamma would seem to suggest that it is meant in its role as intellect the sense medium that conveys knowledge of ideas or mental objects
However the illustrations in the second sentence of each verse show that it is actually meant in its role as the mental factor responsible for the quality of one's actions the factor of will and intention shaping not only mental events but also physical reality
Thus following a Thai tradition I have rendered it here as heart
The images in these verses are carefully chosen
The cart representing suffering is a burden on the ox pulling it and the weight of its wheels obliterates the ox's track
The shadow representing happiness is no weight on the body at all
All Pali recensions of this verse give the reading manomaya  made of the heart while all other recensions give the reading manojava  impelled by the heart
The question raised in this verse is answered in SN
DhpA House  selfhood housebuilder  craving
House may also refer to the nine abodes of beings  the seven stations of consciousness and two spheres
The word anibbisam in can be read either as the negative gerund of nibbisati or as the negative gerund of nivisati altered to fit the meter meaning coming to a rest settled situated Both readings make sense in the context of the verse so the word is probably intended to have a double meaning without reward without rest
The Buddha
No outside contemplative No true contemplative defined as a person who has attained any of the four stages of Awakening exists outside of the practice of the Buddha's teachings
In DN the Buddha is quoted as teaching his final student In any doctrine  discipline where the noble eightfold path is not found no contemplative of the first second third fourth order is found
But in any doctrine  discipline where the noble eightfold path is found contemplatives of the first second third fourth order are found
The noble eightfold path is found in this doctrine  discipline and right here there are contemplatives of the first second third fourth order
Other teachings are empty of knowledgeable contemplatives
And if the monks dwell rightly this world will not be empty of arahants 
On objectification see note 
I have taught you this path reading akkhato vo maya maggo with the Thai edition a reading supported by the Patna Dhp
Having known  for your knowing two ways of interpreting what is apparently a play on the Pali word aññaya which can be either be the gerund of ajanati or the dative of añña
On the extraction of arrows as a metaphor for the practice see MN and MN
Astute in expression knowing the combination of sounds  which comes first  which after Some arahants in addition to their ability to overcome all of their defilements are also endowed with four forms of acumen one of which is acumen with regard to expression ie a total mastery of linguistic expression
This talent in particular must have been of interest to the anthologist who put together the Dhp
Lastbody Because an arahant will not be reborn this present body is hisher last
DhpA This verse refers to a person who has no sense of I or mine either for the senses or their objects
The passage may also refer to the sense of total limitlessness that makes the experience of Unbinding totally ineffable as reflected in the following conversation

Suppose that there is a foolish inexperienced unskillful cook who has presented a king or a king's minister with various kinds of curry mainly sour mainly bitter mainly peppery mainly sweet alkaline or nonalkaline salty or nonsalty
He does not take note of his master thinking 'Today my master likes this curry or he reaches out for that curry or he takes a lot of this curry or he praises that curry
Today my master likes mainly sour curry Today my master likes mainly bitter curry mainly peppery curry mainly sweet curry alkaline curry nonalkaline curry salty curry Today my master likes nonsalty curry or he reaches out for nonsalty curry or he takes a lot of nonsalty curry or he praises nonsalty curry' As a result he is not rewarded with clothing or wages or gifts
Why is that
Because the foolish inexperienced unskillful cook does not pick up on the theme of his own master
In the same way there are cases where a foolish inexperienced unskillful monk remains focused on the body in  of itself  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the world
As he remains thus focused on the body in  of itself his mind does not become concentrated his defilements are not abandoned
He does not take note of that fact
He remains focused on feelings in  of themselves the mind in  of itself mental qualities in  of themselves  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the world
As he remains thus focused on mental qualities in  of themselves his mind does not become concentrated his defilements are not abandoned
He does not take note of that fact
As a result he is not rewarded with a pleasant abiding here  now nor with mindfulness  alertness
Why is that
Because the foolish inexperienced unskillful monk does not take note of his own mind
Now suppose that there is a wise experienced skillful cook who has presented a king or a king's minister with various kinds of curry mainly sour mainly bitter mainly peppery mainly sweet alkaline or nonalkaline salty or nonsalty
He takes note of his master thinking 'Today my master likes this curry or he reaches out for that curry or he takes a lot of this curry or he praises that curry
Today my master likes mainly sour curry Today my master likes mainly bitter curry mainly peppery curry mainly sweet curry alkaline curry nonalkaline curry salty curry Today my master likes nonsalty curry or he reaches out for nonsalty curry or he takes a lot of nonsalty curry or he praises nonsalty curry' As a result he is rewarded with clothing wages  gifts

As he remains thus focused on mental qualities in  of themselves his mind becomes concentrated his defilements are abandoned
He takes note of that fact

On one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Savatthi in Jeta's Grove Anathapindika's monastery
Now at that time Ven
Sariputta was staying among the Magadhans in Nalaka village  diseased in pain severely ill
Cunda the novice was his attendant
Then because of that illness Ven
Sariputta attained total Unbinding
So Cunda the novice taking Ven
Sariputta's bowl  robes went to Ven
Ananda in Jeta's Grove Anathapindika's monastery near Savatthi and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side
As he was sitting there he said to Ven
Ananda Venerable sir Ven
Sariputta has attained total Unbinding
Here are his bowl  robes
Cunda my friend this news is reason for seeing the Blessed One
Come let's go to the Blessed One and report this matter to him
Yes venerable sir Cunda the novice replied
So Ven
Ananda  Cunda the novice went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side
As they were sitting there Ven
Ananda said to him Lord just now Cunda the novice said to me 'Venerable sir Ven
Sariputta has attained total Unbinding
Here are his bowl  robes' It was as if my body were drugged I lost my bearings things weren't clear to me on hearing that Ven
Sariputta had attained total Unbinding
But Ananda when he attained total Unbinding did Sariputta take the aggregate of virtue along with him
Did he take the aggregate of concentration discernment release the aggregate of knowledge  vision of release along with him
No lord when he attained total Unbinding Ven
Sariputta didn't take the aggregate of virtue concentration discernment release the aggregate of knowledge  vision of release along with him
It's just that he was my instructor  counselor one who exhorted urged roused  encouraged me
He was tireless in teaching the Dhamma a help to his companions in the holy life
We miss the nourishment of his Dhamma the wealth of his Dhamma his help in the Dhamma
But Ananda haven't I already taught you the state of growing different with regard to all things dear  appealing the state of becoming separate the state of becoming otherwise
What else is there to expect
It's impossible that one could forbid anything born existent fabricated  subject to disintegration from disintegrating
Just as if the largest limb were to fall off of a great tree composed of heartwood standing firm in the same way Sariputta has attained total Unbinding from this great community of monks composed of heartwood standing firm
What else is there to expect
It's impossible that one could forbid anything born existent fabricated  subject to disintegration from disintegrating
Therefore Ananda each of you should remain with your self as an island your self as your refuge without anything else as a refuge
Remain with the Dhamma as an island the Dhamma as your refuge without anything else as a refuge
And how does a monk remain with his self as an island his self as his refuge without anything else as a refuge
How does he remain with the Dhamma as an island the Dhamma as his refuge without anything else as a refuge
There is the case where a monk remains focused on the body in  of itself  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the world
He remains focused on feelings mind mental qualities in  of themselves  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the world
This is how a monk remains with his self as an island his self as his refuge without anything else as a refuge with the Dhamma as an island the Dhamma as his refuge without anything else as a refuge
For those who  now or after I am gone  remain with their self as an island their self as their refuge without anything else as a refuge with the Dhamma as an island the Dhamma as their refuge without anything else as a refuge they will be the highest of the monks who desire training

On one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Savatthi in Jeta's Grove Anathapindika's monastery
Then early in the morning a large number of monks adjusted their under robes and  carrying their bowls  robes  went into Savatthi for alms
Then the thought occurred to them It's still too early to go for alms in Savatthi
Why don't we go to the park of the wanderers of other sects
So the monks went to the park of the wanderers of other sects
On arrival they exchanged courteous greetings with the wanderers of other sects
After an exchange of friendly greetings  courtesies they sat to one side
As they were sitting there the wanderers of other sects said to them Friends Gotama the contemplative teaches the Dhamma to his disciples in this way 'Come monks  abandoning the five hindrances the corruptions of awareness that weaken discernment  develop the seven factors for awakening as they have come to be'
Now friends we too teach our disciples in this way 'Come you friends  abandoning the five hindrances the corruptions of awareness that weaken discernment  develop the seven factors for awakening as they have come to be'
So friends what difference what distinction what distinguishing factor is there here between Gotama the contemplative and us when comparing Dhamma teaching with Dhamma teaching instruction with instruction
Then the monks neither delighted in the words of the wanderers of other sects nor did they reject them
Without delighting or rejecting they got up from their seats and left We will learn the meaning of these words in the presence of the Blessed One
So having gone for alms in Savatthi after the meal returning from their alms round the monks went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side
As they were sitting there they 
Monks when wanderers of other sects speak in that way they should be addressed in this way 'Friends on any occasion when the mind is sluggish which of the factors of awakening is that the wrong time to develop
Which of the factors of awakening is that the right time to develop
And on any occasion when the mind is restless which of the factors of awakening is that the wrong time to develop
Which of the factors of awakening is that the right time to develop'
Being asked in this way the wanderers of other sects will be unable to respond and on top of that will fall into vexation
Why is that
Because it lies beyond their range
Monks I don't see anyone in this cosmos  with its devas Maras and Brahmas with its people with their contemplatives  brahmans their royalty  commonfolk  who would satisfy the mind with their answer to these questions aside from the Tathagata a disciple of the Tathagata or one who had heard it from them
Now monks on any occasion when the mind is sluggish that is the wrong time to develop calm as a factor for awakening concentration as a factor for awakening equanimity as a factor for awakening
Why is that
The sluggish mind is hard to raise up by those mental qualities
Just as if a man wanting to make a small fire blaze up were to place wet grass in it wet cow dung  wet sticks were to give it a spray of water and smother it with dust
Is it possible that he would make the small fire blaze up
No lord
In the same way monks on any occasion the mind is sluggish that is the wrong time to develop calm as a factor for awakening concentration as a factor for awakening equanimity as a factor for awakening
Why is that
The sluggish mind is hard to raise up by those mental qualities
Now on any occasion when the mind is sluggish that is the right time to develop analysis of qualities as a factor for awakening persistence as a factor for awakening rapture as a factor for awakening
Why is that
The sluggish mind is easy to raise up by those mental qualities
Just as if a man wanting to make a small fire blaze up were to place dry grass in it dry cow dung  dry sticks were to blow on it with his mouth and not smother it with dust
Is it possible that he would make the small fire blaze up
Yes lord
In the same way monks on any occasion when the mind is sluggish that is the right time to develop analysis of qualities as a factor for awakening persistence as a factor for awakening rapture as a factor for awakening
Why is that
The sluggish mind is easy to raise up by those mental qualities
Now on any occasion when the mind is restless that is the wrong time to develop analysis of qualities as a factor for awakening persistence as a factor for awakening rapture as a factor for awakening
Why is that
The restless mind is hard to still with those mental qualities
Just as if a man wanting to put out a large fire were to place dry grass in it dry cow dung  dry sticks were to blow on it with his mouth and not smother it with dust
Is it possible that he would put it out
No lord
In the same way monks on any occasion when the mind is restless that is the wrong time to develop analysis of qualities as a factor for awakening persistence as a factor for awakening rapture as a factor for awakening
Why is that
The restless mind is hard to still with those mental qualities
Now on occasions when the mind is restless that is the right time to develop calm as a factor for awakening concentration as a factor for awakening equanimity as a factor for awakening
Why is that
The restless mind is easy to still with those mental qualities
Just as if a man wanting to put out a large fire were to place wet grass in it wet cow dung  wet sticks were to give it a spray of water and smother it with dust
Is it possible that he would put it out
Yes lord
In the same way monks when the mind is restless that is the right time to develop calm as a factor for awakening concentration as a factor for awakening equanimity as a factor for awakening
Why is that
The restless mind is easy to still with those mental qualities
As for mindfulness I tell you that serves every purpose
On one occasion the Blessed One was staying among the Koliyans
Now there is a Koliyan town named Haliddavasa
Then early in the morning a large number of monks adjusted their under robes and  carrying their bowls  robes  went into Haliddavasana for alms
Then the thought occurred to them It's still too early to go for alms in Haliddavasana
Why don't we go to the park of the wanderers of other sects
So the monks went to the park of the wanderers of other sects
On arrival they exchanged courteous greetings with the wanderers of other sects

As they were sitting there the wanderers of other sects said to them Friends Gotama the contemplative teaches the Dhamma to his disciples in this way 'Come monks  abandoning the five hindrances the corruptions of awareness that weaken discernment  keep pervading the first direction with an awareness imbued with good will likewise the second likewise the third likewise the fourth
Thus above below  all around everywhere in its entirety keep pervading the allencompassing cosmos with an awareness imbued with good will  abundant expansive immeasurable without hostility without ill will
'Keep pervading the first direction with an awareness imbued with compassion
'Keep pervading the first direction with an awareness imbued with empathetic joy
'Keep pervading the first direction with an awareness imbued with equanimity likewise the second likewise the third likewise the fourth
Thus above below  all around everywhere in its entirety keep pervading the allencompassing cosmos with an awareness imbued with equanimity  abundant expansive immeasurable without hostility without ill will'
Now friends we too teach our disciples in this way 'Come you friends  abandoning the five hindrances the corruptions of awareness that weaken discernment  keep pervading the first direction with an awareness imbued with good will likewise the second likewise the third likewise the fourth

At such times monks as the mind is sluggish that is the wrong time to cultivate the enlightenmentfactor of tranquillity the enlightenmentfactor of concentration the enlightenmentfactor of equanimity
What is the reason
A sluggish mind is hard to arouse by these factors
Suppose a man wants to make a small fire blaze
If he heaps wet grass wet cowdung and wet sticks on it if he exposes it to wind and rain and sprinkles it with dust can he make that small fire blaze
No indeed Lord
Just so when the mind is sluggish it is the wrong time to cultivate the enlightenmentfactors of tranquillity concentration and equanimity because a sluggish mind is hard to arouse through these factors
But monks when the mind is sluggish that is the right time to cultivate the enlightenmentfactor of investigationofstates the enlightenmentfactor of energy the enlightenmentfactor of rapture
What is the reason
A sluggish mind is easy to arouse by these factors
Suppose a man wants to make a small fire blaze
If he heaps dry grass dry cowdung and dry sticks on it blows on it with his mouth and does not sprinkle it with dust can he make that fire blaze
Yes indeed Lord
 a sluggish mind is easy to arouse through these factors
Monks when the mind is agitated that is the wrong time to cultivate the enlightenmentfactors of investigationofstates of energy of rapture
Why
An agitated mind is hard to calm through these factors
Suppose a man wants to put a big fire out
If he heaps dry cowdung and dry sticks on it blow on it with his mouth and does not sprinkle it with dust can he put that fire out
No indeed Lord
 an agitated mind is not easy to calm through these factors
When the mind is agitated that is the right time to cultivate the enlightenmentfactors of tranquillity concentration equanimity
Why
Because an agitated mind is easy to calm through these factors
Suppose a man wants to put out a big fire
If he heaps wet grass wet cowdung wet sticks on it and if he exposes it to wind and rain if he sprinkles it with dust can he put that big fire out
Yes indeed Lord
Just so monks when the mind is agitated that is the right time to cultivate the enlightenmentfactors of tranquillity concentration equanimity
An agitated mind is easy to calm through these factors
But as for mindfulness monks I declare that it is always useful
And how monks does a monk cultivate the heart's release by lovingkindness
What is its goal its excellence its fruit and its outcome
In this case monks a monk cultivates the enlightenmentfactor of mindfulness accompanied by lovingkindness and similarly the enlightenmentfactors of investigationofstates energy rapture tranquillity concentration equanimity accompanied by lovingkindness which is based on detachment dispassion leading to maturity of surrender
If he wishes to dwell perceiving the repulsive in what is not repulsive he dwells thus perceiving the repulsive
If he wishes to dwell perceiving the unrepulsive in what is repulsive he dwells thus perceiving the unrepulsive
If he wishes to dwell perceiving the repulsive both in what is repulsive and what is not repulsive if he wishes to dwell perceiving the unrepulsive in both he dwells thus
If he wishes avoiding both the repulsive and unrepulsive to dwell equanimous mindful and clearly aware he dwells thus equanimous mindful and clearly aware or attaining the heart's release called 'beautiful' he abides there
I declare that the heart's release by lovingkindness has the beautiful for its excellence
This is the attainment of a wise monk who penetrates to no higher release
And how monks does a monk cultivate release by compassion
What is its goal its excellence its fruit and its outcome
And how monks does a monk cultivate the heart's release by sympathetic joy
What is its goal its excellence its fruit and its outcome
In this monks a monk cultivates the enlightenmentfactors of mindfulness equanimity accompanied by sympathetic joy he dwells thus equanimous mindful clearly aware or by passing utterly beyond the sphere of infinite space thinking 'consciousness is infinite' he attains and dwells in the sphere of infinite consciousness
I declare that the heart's release by sympathetic joy has the sphere of infinite consciousness for its excellence
This is the attainment of a wise monk who penetrates to no higher release
And how monks does a monk cultivate the heart's release by equanimity
What is its goal its excellence its fruit and its outcome
In this case monks a monk cultivates the enlightenmentfactors of mindfulness investigationofstates energy rapture tranquillity concentration equanimity accompanied by equanimity which is based on detachment dispassion leading to maturity of surrender
If he wishes to dwell he dwells thus equanimous mindful and clearly aware
Or by passing utterly beyond the sphere of infinite consciousness thinking 'there is nothing' he attains and dwells in the sphere of nothingness
I declare that the heart's release by equanimity had the sphere of nothingness for its excellence
This is the attainment of a wise monk who penetrates to no higher release

I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying in Rajagaha in the Bamboo Grove the Squirrels' Sanctuary
And on that occasion Ven
Maha Kassapa was staying in the Pepper Tree Cave diseased in pain severely ill
Then the Blessed One in the late afternoon left his seclusion and went to where Ven
Maha Kassapa was staying
On arrival he sat down on a prepared seat and said to Ven
Maha Kassapa I hope you are getting better Kassapa
I hope you are comfortable
I hope that your pains are lessening and not increasing
I hope that there are signs of their lessening and not of their increasing
I am not getting better lord
I am not comfortable
My extreme pains are increasing not lessening
There are signs of their increasing and not of their lessening
Kassapa these seven factors for Awakening rightly taught by me when developed and pursued lead to direct knowledge to selfAwakening to Unbinding
Which seven
Mindfulness as a factor for Awakening rightly taught by me when developed and pursued leads to direct knowledge to selfAwakening to Unbinding
Analysis of qualities as a factor for Awakening rightly taught by me when developed and pursued leads to direct knowledge to selfAwakening to Unbinding
Persistence as a factor for Awakening
Rapture as a factor for Awakening
Serenity as a factor for Awakening
Concentration as a factor for Awakening
Equanimity as a factor for Awakening rightly taught by me when developed and pursued leads to direct knowledge to selfAwakening to Unbinding
Kassapa these are the seven factors for Awakening rightly taught by me that  when developed and pursued  lead to direct knowledge to selfAwakening to Unbinding
They are indeed factors for Awakening O Blessed One
They are indeed factors for Awakening O One WellGone
That is what the Blessed One said
Gratified Ven
Maha Kassapa delighted in the Blessed One's words
And Ven
Maha Kassapa recovered from his disease
That was how Ven
Maha Kassapa's disease was abandoned
Monks there are these three kinds of suffering
What three
Suffering caused by pain suffering caused by the formations suffering due to change
It is for the full comprehension clear understanding ending and abandonment of these three forms of suffering that the Noble Eightfold Path is to be cultivated See also SN
And what is meant by admirable friendship
There is the case where a lay person in whatever town or village he may dwell spends time with householders or householders' sons young or old who are advanced in virtue
He talks with them engages them in discussions
He emulates consummate conviction in those who are consummate in conviction consummate virtue in those who are consummate in virtue consummate generosity in those who are consummate in generosity and consummate discernment in those who are consummate in discernment
This is called admirable friendship
With regard to external factors I don't envision any other single factor like friendship with admirable people as doing so much for a monk in training who has not attained the heart's goal but remains intent on the unsurpassed safety from bondage
A monk who is a friend with admirable people abandons what is unskillful and develops what is skillful
These are the four drains on one's store of wealth being debauched in sex being debauched in drink being debauched in gambling and having evil people as friends associates and companions
Just as if there were a great reservoir with four inlets and four drains and a man were to close the inlets and open the drains and the sky were not to pour down proper showers the depletion of that great reservoir could be expected not its increase
In the same way these are the four drains on one's store of wealth being debauched in sex being debauched in drink being debauched in gambling and having evil people as friends associates and companions
If wanderers who are members of other sects should ask you 'What friend are the prerequisites for the development of the wings to selfawakening' you should answer 'There is the case where a monk has admirable people as friends companions  colleagues
This is the first prerequisite for the development of the wings to selfawakening'
As he was sitting there Ven
Ananda said to the Blessed One This is half of the holy life lord admirable friendship admirable companionship admirable camaraderie
Don't say that Ananda
Don't say that
Admirable friendship admirable companionship admirable camaraderie is actually the whole of the holy life
When a monk has admirable people as friends companions  colleagues he can be expected to develop  pursue the noble eightfold path
And how does a monk who has admirable people as friends companions  colleagues develop  pursue the noble eightfold path
There is the case where a monk develops right view dependent on seclusion dependent on dispassion dependent on cessation resulting in relinquishment
He develops right resolveright speechright actionright livelihoodright effortright mindfulnessright concentration dependent on seclusion dependent on dispassion dependent on cessation resulting in relinquishment
This is how a monk who has admirable people as friends companions  colleagues develops  pursues the noble eightfold path
And through this line of reasoning one may know how admirable friendship admirable companionship admirable camaraderie is actually the whole of the holy life It is in dependence on me as an admirable friend that beings subject to birth have gained release from birth that beings subject to aging have gained release from aging that beings subject to death have gained release from death that beings subject to sorrow lamentation pain distress  despair have gained release from sorrow lamentation pain distress  despair
It is through this line of reasoning that one may know how having admirable friendship admirable companionship admirable camaraderie is actually the whole of the holy life

This monks is called right concentration
That is what the Blessed One said
Gratified the monks delighted at his words
Suppose monks there is a guesthouse
Travelers come from the east the west the north the south to lodge here nobles and Brahmans merchants and serfs
In the same way monks a monk who cultivates the Noble Eightfold Path who assiduously practices the Noble Eightfold Path comprehends with higher knowledge those states that are to be so comprehended abandons with higher knowledge those states that are to be so abandoned comes to experience with higher knowledge those states that are to be so experienced and cultivates with higher knowledge those states that are to be so cultivated
What monks are the states to be comprehended with higher knowledge
They are the five groups of clinging
Which five
The bodygroup the feelinggroup the perceptiongroup the mentalformation group the consciousnessgroup
What monks are the states to be abandoned with higher knowledge
They are ignorance and the desire for becoming
And what monks are the states to be experienced with higher knowledge
They are knowledge and liberation
And what monk are the states to be cultivated with higher knowledge
They are calm and insight
And how does a monk who cultivates the Noble Eightfold Path who assiduously practices the Noble Eightfold Path comprehend abandon come to experience cultivate with higher knowledge those states that are to be so comprehended abandoned experienced cultivated
In this monks a monk cultivates Right View Right Concentration that is based on detachment dispassion leading to maturity of surrender
In this way he comprehends abandons comes to experience cultivates with higher knowledge those states that are to be so comprehended abandoned experienced cultivated

I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was living among the Sakyans
Now there is a Sakyan town named Sakkara
There Ven
Ananda went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to the Blessed One sat to one side
As he was sitting there Ven
Ananda said to the Blessed One This is half of the holy life lord admirable friendship admirable companionship admirable camaraderie
Don't say that Ananda
Don't say that
Admirable friendship admirable companionship admirable camaraderie is actually the whole of the holy life
When a monk has admirable people as friends companions  comrades he can be expected to develop  pursue the noble eightfold path
And how does a monk who has admirable people as friends companions  comrades develop  pursue the noble eightfold path
There is the case where a monk develops right view dependent on seclusion dependent on dispassion dependent on cessation resulting in relinquishment
He develops right resolve right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness right concentration dependent on seclusion dependent on dispassion dependent on cessation resulting in relinquishment
This is how a monk who has admirable people as friends companions  colleagues develops  pursues the noble eightfold path
And through this line of reasoning one may know how admirable friendship admirable companionship admirable camaraderie is actually the whole of the holy life It is in dependence on me as an admirable friend that beings subject to birth have gained release from birth that beings subject to aging have gained release from aging that beings subject to death have gained release from death that beings subject to sorrow lamentation pain distress  despair have gained release from sorrow lamentation pain distress  despair
It is through this line of reasoning that one may know how admirable friendship admirable companionship admirable camaraderie is actually the whole of the holy life

There he addressed the monks Monks
Yes lord the monks responded

Then the wanderer Vacchagotta went to the Blessed One and on arrival exchanged courteous greetings with him
After an exchange of friendly greetings  courtesies he sat to one side
As he was sitting there he asked the Blessed One Now then Venerable Gotama is there a self
When this was said the Blessed One was silent
Then is there no self
A second time the Blessed One was silent
Then Vacchagotta the wanderer got up from his seat and left
Then not long after Vacchagotta the wanderer had left Ven
Ananda said to the Blessed One Why lord did the Blessed One not answer when asked a question by Vacchagotta the wanderer
Ananda if I  being asked by Vacchagotta the wanderer if there is a self  were to answer that there is a self that would be conforming with those brahmans  contemplatives who are exponents of eternalism
If I  being asked by Vacchagotta the wanderer if there is no self  were to answer that there is no self that would be conforming with those brahmans  contemplatives who are exponents of annihilationism
If I  being asked by Vacchagotta the wanderer if there is a self  were to answer that there is a self would that be in keeping with the arising of knowledge that all phenomena are notself
No lord
And if I  being asked by Vacchagotta the wanderer if there is no self  were to answer that there is no self the bewildered Vacchagotta would become even more bewildered 'Does the self I used to have now not exist' See also other suttas in the Avyakata Samyutta AN
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Vesali in the Great Wood at the Hall of the Gabled Pavilion
At that time Ven
Anuradha was staying not far from the Blessed One in a wilderness hut
Then a large number of wandering sectarians went to Ven
Anuradha and on arrival exchanged courteous greetings with him
After an exchange of friendly greetings  courtesies they sat to one side
As they were sitting there they said to Ven
Anuradha Friend Anuradha the Tathagata  the supreme man the superlative man attainer of the superlative attainment  being described is described with these four positions The Tathagata exists after death does not exist after death both does  does not exist after death neither exists nor does not exist after death
When this was said Ven
Anuradha said to the wandering sectarians Friends the Tathagata  the supreme man the superlative man attainer of the superlative attainment  being described is described otherwise than with these four positions The Tathagata exists after death does not exist after death both does  does not exist after death neither exists nor does not exist after death
When this was said the wandering sectarians said to Ven
Anuradha This monk is either a newcomer not long gone forth or else an elder who is foolish  inexperienced So the wandering sectarians addressing Ven
Anuradha as they would a newcomer or a fool got up from their seats and left
Then not long after the wandering sectarians had left this thought occurred to Ven
Anuradha If I am questioned again by those wandering sectarians how will I answer in such a way that will I speak in line with what the Blessed One has said will not misrepresent the Blessed One with what is unfactual will answer in line with the Dhamma so that no one whose thinking is in line with the Dhamma will have grounds for criticizing me
Then Ven
Anuradha went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to the Blessed One sat to one side
As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One Just now I was staying not far from the Blessed One in a wilderness hut
Then a large number of wandering sectarians came and said to me 'Friend Anuradha the Tathagata  the supreme man the superlative man attainer of the superlative attainment  being described is described with these four positions The Tathagata exists after death does not exist after death both does  does not exist after death neither exists nor does not exist after death'
When this was said I said to them 'Friends the Tathagata  the supreme man the superlative man attainer of the superlative attainment  being described is described otherwise than with these four positions The Tathagata exists after death does not exist after death both does  does not exist after death neither exists nor does not exist after death'

Inconstant lord
And is that which is inconstant easeful or stressful
Stressful lord
And is it proper to regard what is inconstant stressful subject to change as 'This is mine
This is my self
This is what I am'
No lord
Is feeling constant or inconstant
Inconstant lord
Is perception constant or inconstant
Inconstant lord
Are fabrications constant or inconstant
Inconstant lord
Is consciousness constant or inconstant
Inconstant lord
And is that which is inconstant easeful or stressful
Stressful lord
And is it proper to regard what is inconstant stressful subject to change as 'This is mine
This is my self
This is what I am'
No lord
What do you think Anuradha Do you regard form as the Tathagata
No lord
Do you regard feeling as the Tathagata
No lord
Do you regard perception as the Tathagata
No lord
Do you regard fabrications as the Tathagata
No lord
Do you regard consciousness as the Tathagata
No lord
What do you think Anuradha Do you regard the Tathagata as being in form Elsewhere than form In feeling Elsewhere than feeling In perception Elsewhere than perception In fabrications Elsewhere than fabrications In consciousness Elsewhere than consciousness
No lord
What do you think Do you regard the Tathagata as formfeelingperceptionfabricationsconsciousness
No lord
Do you regard the Tathagata as that which is without form without feeling without perception without fabrications without consciousness
No lord
And so Anuradha  when you can't pin down the Tathagata as a truth or reality even in the present life  is it proper for you to declare 'Friends the Tathagata  the supreme man the superlative man attainer of the superlative attainment  being described is described otherwise than with these four positions The Tathagata exists after death does not exist after death both does  does not exist after death neither exists nor does not exist after death'
No lord
Very good Anuradha

This samyutta is organized around questions that the Buddha left unanswered
Most of the discourses here focus on questions in a standard list of ten that were apparently the hot issues for philosophers in the Buddha's day Is the cosmos eternal
Is it not eternal
Is it finite
Is it infinite
Is the body the same as the soul
Is the body one thing and the soul another
Does the Tathagata exist after death
Does he not exist after death
Both
Neither
MN lists the reasons why the Buddha does not take a position on any of these questions
In each case he says that such a position is a thicket of views a wilderness of views a contortion of views a writhing of views a fetter of views
It is accompanied by suffering distress despair  fever and it does not lead to disenchantment dispassion cessation to calm direct knowledge full awakening Unbinding
These reasons fall into two categories
The first concerns the present drawbacks of taking such a position It is accompanied by suffering distress despair and fever
The second category concerns the effects of such a position over time It does not lead to awakening or Unbinding
AN
further explores the first category of reasons
MN further explores the second
Some of the discourses in this samyutta explore a third category of reasons for why the Buddha does not take a position on any of these questions Such a position is based on attachment to and misunderstanding of the aggregates and sense media
When one sees these things for what they are as they're actually present the idea of forming them into any of these positions simply does not occur to one
Of the discourses here SN
and SN
are special cases
SN
focuses specifically on the questions that try to describe the status of the Tathagata after death and explains that having been released from the classification of the aggregates the Tathagata defies description in the same way that the sands of the river Ganges cannot be numbered and the waters of the oceans cannot be calculated in gallons
The Commentary to this passage tries to fathom the Tathagata's infathomability but its attempt is controversial
See the note to that sutta
Even more controversial is SN which addresses an issue not included in the standard list of ten undeclared questions Is there a self
Is there no self
Many scholars have been uncomfortable with the fact that the Buddha leaves this question unanswered believing that his statement that all phenomena are notself implicitly states that there is no self
Thus they have tried to explain away the Buddha's silence on the existence or nonexistence of the self usually by pointing to the fourth of his reasons for not answering the question his bewildered interlocutor Vacchagotta would have become even more bewildered
Had the Buddha been asked by someone less bewildered these commentators say he would have given the straight answer that there is no self
However these commentators ignore two points
The Buddha's first two reasons for not answering the questions have nothing to do with Vacchagotta
To say that there is a self he says would be siding with the wrong views of the eternalists
To say that there is no self would be siding with the wrong views of the annihilationists
Immediately after Vacchagotta leaves Ven
Ananda asks the Buddha to explain his silence
Had the Buddha really meant to declare that there is no self this would have been the perfect time to do so for bewildered people were now out of the way
But again he did not take that position
One peculiarity of this approach to the Buddha's silence on this issue is that many commentators noting the Buddha's desire not to bewilder Vacchagotta assume somehow that their readers and listeners at present would not be bewildered by a doctrine that there is no self and feel free to jump into the breach stating baldly what they believe the Buddha was simply too reticent to say
Another attempt to explain the Buddha's silence on this issue focuses on the second reason for his silence saying that the annihilationists had laid claim to the slogan that there is no self so  because the Buddha did not want his own doctrine of no self to be confused with theirs  he avoided their slogan
This explanation however is not supported by the Canon
The doctrines of the annihilationists are presented in a fair amount of detail in the Canon and nowhere are they quoted as saying outright that there is no self
Thus there is no basis for saying that it was their slogan
Second there are many instances where the Buddha when asked a categorical question concerning an issue where he wanted to give a nuanced answer showed himself perfectly capable of rephrasing the question in more nuanced terms before giving his reply
Had he held a nuanced doctrine that there is no self he could have easily rephrased Vacchagotta's question before answering it
The fact that he chose not to do so either in Vacchagotta's or Ven
Ananda's presence indicates that he felt that this issue too was a thicket of views based on a misunderstanding accompanied by suffering and not leading to awakening
So how is the statement all phenomena are not self to be taken
As a path to awakening
According to Dhp when one sees this fact with discernment to the point of becoming disenchanted with stress it forms the path to purity
Here the term phenomena covers fabricated and unfabricated phenomena
The fabricated phenomena encountered along the path include the aggregates elements and sense media
The unfabricated phenomenon encountered when these fabricated phenomena cease is the deathless
AN however points out that it is possible on encountering the deathless to feel a dhammapassion and dhammadelight for it thus preventing full awakening
At this point the realization that all phenomena are notself would be needed to overcome this last obstacle to total release
And once there is release one becomes like the Tathagata indescribable deep boundless hard to fathom like the ocean At that point the path is abandoned like a raft after it has been used to cross a river and positions that there is a self and there is no self would not apply
On one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Rajagaha at the Squirrels' Sanctuary
Now at that time when the king's assembly had gathered and was sitting together in the royal palace this topic of conversation arose Money is allowable for the Sakyanson contemplatives
The Sakyanson contemplatives consent to money
The Sakyanson contemplatives accept money
At that time Maniculaka the headman was sitting in that assembly so he said to them Don't say that masters
Money is not allowable for the Sakyanson contemplatives
The Sakyanson contemplatives do not consent to money
The Sakyanson contemplatives do not accept money
The Sakyanson contemplatives have given up gold  jewelry have renounced money And he was able to convince the assembly
Then he went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side
As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One Just now lord when the king's assembly had gathered and was sitting together in the royal palace this topic of conversation arose 'Money is allowable for the Sakyanson contemplatives
The Sakyanson contemplatives consent to money
The Sakyanson contemplatives accept money' When this was said I said to them 'Don't say that masters
Money is not allowable for the Sakyanson contemplatives
The Sakyanson contemplatives do not consent to money
The Sakyanson contemplatives do not accept money
The Sakyanson contemplatives have given up gold  jewelry have renounced money' And I was able to convince the assembly
Answering in this way lord am I speaking in line with what the Blessed One has said am I not misrepresenting the Blessed One with what is unfactual am I answering in line with the Dhamma so that no one whose thinking is in line with the Dhamma will have grounds for criticizing me
Yes headman in answering in this way you are speaking in line with what I have said you are not misrepresenting me with what is unfactual and you are answering in line with the Dhamma so that no one whose thinking is in line with the Dhamma will have grounds for criticizing you
For money is not allowable for the Sakyanson contemplatives the Sakyanson contemplatives do not consent to money the Sakyanson contemplatives do not accept money the Sakyanson contemplatives have given up gold  jewelry have renounced money
For anyone for whom money is allowable the five strings of sensuality are also allowable
For anyone for whom the five strings of sensuality are allowable money is allowable
That you can unequivocally recognize as not the quality of a contemplative not the quality of a Sakyan son
Now I do say that thatch may be sought for by one needing thatch wood may be sought for by one needing wood a cart may be sought for by one needing a cart a workman may be sought for by one needing a workman but by no means do I say that money may be consented to or sought for in any way at all
On one occasion the Blessed One was staying among the Mallans in a Mallan town named Uruvelakappa
Then Gandhabhaka the headman went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side
As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One It would be good lord if the Blessed One would teach me the origination  ending of stress
Headman if I were to teach you the origination  ending of stress with reference to the past saying 'Thus it was in the past' you would be doubtful and perplexed
If I were to teach you the origination  ending of stress with reference to the future saying 'Thus it will be in the future' you would be doubtful and perplexed
So instead I  sitting right here  will teach you sitting right there the origination  ending of stress
Listen  pay close attention
I will speak
As you say lord Gandhabhaka the headman replied
The Blessed One said Now what do you think headman Are there any people in Uruvelakappa who if they were murdered or imprisoned or fined or censured would cause sorrow lamentation pain distress or despair to arise in you
Yes lord there are people in Uruvelakappa who if they were murdered or imprisoned or fined or censured would cause sorrow lamentation pain distress or despair to arise in me
And are there any people in Uruvelakappa who if they were murdered or imprisoned or fined or censured would cause no sorrow lamentation pain distress or despair to arise in you
Yes lord there are people in Uruvelakappa who if they were murdered or imprisoned or fined or censured would cause no sorrow lamentation pain distress or despair to arise in me
Now what is the cause what is the reason why the murder imprisonment fining or censure of some of the people in Uruvelakappa would cause you sorrow lamentation pain distress or despair whereas the murder imprisonment fining or censure of others would cause you no sorrow lamentation pain distress or despair
Those people in Uruvelakappa whose murder imprisonment fining or censure would cause me sorrow lamentation pain distress or despair are those for whom I feel desire  passion
Those people in Uruvelakappa whose murder imprisonment fining or censure would cause me no sorrow lamentation pain distress or despair are those for whom I feel no desire or passion
Now headman from what you have realized fathomed attained right now in the present without regard to time you may draw an inference with regard to the past and future 'Whatever stress in arising arose for me in the past all of it had desire as its root had desire as its cause  for desire is the cause of stress
And whatever stress in arising will arise for me in the future all of it will have desire as the root will have desire as its cause  for desire is the cause of stress' Amazing lord
Stupendous
How well the Blessed One has put it 'Whatever stress in arising arose for me in the past all of it had desire as its root had desire as its cause  for desire is the cause of stress
And whatever stress in arising will arise for me in the future all of it will have desire as the root will have desire as its cause  for desire is the cause of stress' I have a son lord named Ciravasi who lives far away from here
When I get up in the morning I send a man saying 'Go learn how Ciravasi is doing' And as long as that man has not returned I am simply beside myself 'Don't let Ciravasi be sick' Now headman what do you think If Ciravasi were to be murdered or imprisoned or fined or censured would you feel sorrow lamentation pain distress  despair
Lord if my son Ciravasi were to be murdered or imprisoned or fined or censured my very life would be altered
So how could I not feel sorrow lamentation pain distress  despair
Thus headman by this line of reasoning it may be realized how stress when arising arises All of it has desire as its root has desire as its cause  for desire is the cause of stress
Now what do you think headman Before you had seen or heard of Ciravasi's mother did you feel desire passion or love for her
No lord
And after you had seen or heard of Ciravasi's mother did you feel desire passion or love for her
Yes lord
What do you think If Ciravasi's mother were to be murdered or imprisoned or fined or censured would you feel sorrow lamentation pain distress  despair
Lord if Ciravasi's mother were to be murdered or imprisoned or fined or censured my very life would be altered
So how could I not feel sorrow lamentation pain distress  despair
Thus headman by this line of reasoning it may be realized how stress when arising arises All of it has desire as its root has desire as its cause  for desire is the cause of stress

On one occasion the Blessed One while wandering on tour among the Kosalans together with a large community of monks arrived at Nalanda
There he stayed at Nalanda in Pavarika's Mango Grove
Now at that time Nalanda was in the midst of famine a time of scarcity the crops white with blight and turned to straw
And at that time Nigantha Nataputta was staying in Nalanda together with a large following of niganthas
Then Asibandhakaputta the headman a disciple of the niganthas went to Nigantha Nataputta and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side
As he was sitting there Nigantha Nataputta said to him Come now headman
Refute the words of Gotama the contemplative and this admirable report about you will spread afar 'The words of Gotama the contemplative  so mighty so powerful  were refuted by Asibandhakaputta the headman' But how venerable sir will I refute the words of Gotama the contemplative  so mighty so powerful
Come now headman
Go to Gotama the contemplative and on arrival say this 'Venerable sir doesn't the Blessed One in many ways praise kindness protection  sympathy for families' If Gotama the contemplative thus asked answers 'Yes headman the Tathagata in many ways praises kindness protection  sympathy for families' then you should say 'Then why venerable sir is the Blessed One together with a large community of monks wandering on tour around Nalanda in the midst of famine a time of scarcity when the crops are white with blight and turned to straw
The Blessed One is practicing for the ruin of families
The Blessed One is practicing for the demise of families
The Blessed One is practicing for the downfall of families' When Gotama the contemplative is asked this twopronged question by you he won't be able to swallow it down or spit it up
Responding As you say venerable sir Asibandhakaputta the headman got up from his seat bowed down to Nigantha Nataputta circumambulated him and then went to the Blessed One
On arrival he bowed down to the Blessed One and sat to one side
As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One Venerable sir doesn't the Blessed One in many ways praise kindness protection  sympathy for families
Yes headman the Tathagata in many ways praises kindness protection  sympathy for families
Then why venerable sir is the Blessed One together with a large community of monks wandering on tour around Nalanda in the midst of famine a time of scarcity when the crops are white with blight and turned to straw
The Blessed One is practicing for the ruin of families
The Blessed One is practicing for the demise of families
The Blessed One is practicing for the downfall of families
Headman recollecting back over aeons I do not know any family to have been brought to downfall through the giving of cooked alms
On the contrary Whatever families are rich  with much wealth many possessions a great deal of money a great many accoutrements of wealth a great many commodities  all have become so from giving from truth from restraint
Headman there are eight causes eight reasons for the downfall of families
Families go to their downfall because of kings or families go to their downfall because of thieves or families go to their downfall because of fire or families go to their downfall because of floods or their storedup treasure disappears or their mismanaged undertakings go wrong or in the family a wastrel is born who squanders scatters  shatters its wealth and inconstancy itself is the eighth
These are the eight causes the eight reasons for the downfall of families
Now when these eight causes these eight reasons are to be found if anyone should say of me 'The Blessed One is practicing for the ruin of families the Blessed One is practicing for the demise of families the Blessed One is practicing for the downfall of families'  without abandoning that statement without abandoning that intent without relinquishing that view  then as if he were to be carried off he would thus be placed in hell
When this was said Asibandhakaputta the headman said to the Blessed One Magnificent lord
Magnificent
Just as if he were to place upright what was overturned to reveal what was hidden to show the way to one who was lost or to carry a lamp into the dark so that those with eyes could see forms in the same way has the Blessed One  through many lines of reasoning  made the Dhamma clear
I go to the Blessed One for refuge to the Dhamma  to the community of monks
May the Blessed One remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge from this day forward for life

Translator's note Although the Jains like the Buddhists teach a doctrine of the moral consequences of actions the teachings of the two traditions differ in many important details
This discourse points out two of the major points where the Buddhist teaching is distinctive its understanding of the complexity of the kammic process and its application of that understanding to the psychology of teaching
The Buddha shows that a simplistic fatalistic view of the kammic process is logically inconsistent and also leads to unfortunate results for any person who with a background of bad kamma believes in it
The actual complexity of kamma however allows for a way in which past evil deeds can be overcome through refraining from evil now and into the future and through developing expansive mindstates of good will compassion appreciation  equanimity
In such an expansive mind state the unavoidable consequences of past evil actions count for next to nothing
The Buddha also shows how his method of teaching is better than that of the Jains in that it actually can help free the mind from debilitating feelings of guilt and remorse and lead to the overcoming of past kamma
For a fuller discussion of the complexity of the kammic process see Kamma and the Ending of Kamma in The Wings to Awakening
On one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Nalanda in the Pavarika Mango Grove
Then Asibandhakaputta the headman a disciple of the Niganthas went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side
As he was sitting there the Blessed One said to him Headman how does Nigantha Nataputta teach the Dhamma to his disciples
Nigantha Nataputta teaches the Dhamma to his disciples in this way lord 'All those who take life are destined for a state of deprivation are destined for hell
All those who steal All those who indulge in illicit sex All those who tell lies are destined for a state of deprivation are destined for hell
Whatever one keeps doing frequently by that is one led' That's how Nigantha Nataputta teaches the Dhamma to his disciples
If it's true that 'Whatever one keeps doing frequently by that is one led' then no one is destined for a state of deprivation or destined to hell in line with Nigantha Nataputta's words
What do you think headman If a man is one who takes life then taking into consideration time spent doing  not doing whether by day or by night which time is more the time he spends taking life or the time he spends not taking life
If a man is one who takes life lord then taking into consideration time spent doing  not doing whether by day or by night then the time he spends taking life is less and the time he spends not taking life is certainly more
If it's true that 'Whatever one keeps doing frequently by that is one led' then no one is destined for a state of deprivation or destined to hell in line with Nigantha Nataputta's words
What do you think headman If a man is one who steals indulges in illicit sex tells lies then taking into consideration time spent doing  not doing whether by day or by night which time is more the time he spends telling lies or the time he spends not telling lies
If a man is one who tells lies lord then taking into consideration time spent doing  not doing whether by day or by night then the time he spends telling lies is less and the time he spends not telling lies is certainly more
If it's true that 'Whatever one keeps doing frequently by that is one led' then no one is destined for a state of deprivation or destined to hell in line with Nigantha Nataputta's words
There's the case headman where a certain teacher holds this doctrine holds this view 'All those who take life are destined for a state of deprivation are destined for hell
All those who steal All those who indulge in illicit sex All those who tell lies are destined for a state of deprivation are destined for hell' A disciple has faith in that teacher and the thought occurs to him 'Our teacher holds this doctrine holds this view All those who take life are destined for a state of deprivation are destined for hell There are living beings that I have killed
I too am destined for a state of deprivation am destined for hell' He fastens onto that view
If he doesn't abandon that doctrine doesn't abandon that state of mind doesn't relinquish that view then as if he were to be carried off he would thus be placed in hell
 'Our teacher holds this doctrine holds this view 'All those who steal All those who indulge in illicit sex All those who tell lies are destined for a state of deprivation are destined for hell' There are lies that I have told
I too am destined for a state of deprivation am destined for hell' He fastens onto that view
If he doesn't abandon that doctrine doesn't abandon that state of mind doesn't relinquish that view then as if he were to be carried off he would thus be placed in hell
There is the case headman where a Tathagata appears in the world worthy and rightly selfawakened consummate in clear knowing  conduct wellgone a knower of the cosmos unexcelled trainer of those to be tamed teacher of human  divine beings awakened blessed
He in various ways criticizes  censures the taking of life and says 'Abstain from taking life' He criticizes  censures stealing and says 'Abstain from stealing' He criticizes  censures indulging in illicit sex and says 'Abstain from indulging in illicit sex' He criticizes  censures the telling of lies and says 'Abstain from the telling of lies'
A disciple has faith in that teacher and reflects 'The Blessed One in a variety of ways criticizes  censures the taking of life and says Abstain from taking life There are living beings that I have killed to a greater or lesser extent
That was not right
That was not good
But if I become remorseful for that reason that evil deed of mine will not be undone' So reflecting thus he abandons right then the taking of life and in the future refrains from taking life
This is how there comes to be the abandoning of that evil deed
This is how there comes to be the transcending of that evil deed
 'The Blessed One in a variety of ways criticizes  censures stealing indulging in illicit sex the telling of lies and says Abstain from the telling of lies There are lies that I have told to a greater or lesser extent
That was not right
That was not good
But if I become remorseful for that reason that evil deed of mine will not be undone' So reflecting thus he abandons right then the telling of lies and in the future refrains from telling lies
This is how there comes to be the abandoning of that evil deed
This is how there comes to be the transcending of that evil deed
Having abandoned the taking of life he refrains from taking life
Having abandoned stealing he refrains from stealing
Having abandoned illicit sex he refrains from illicit sex
Having abandoned lies he refrains from lies
Having abandoned divisive speech he refrains from divisive speech
Having abandoned harsh speech he refrains from harsh speech
Having abandoned idle chatter he refrains from idle chatter
Having abandoned covetousness he becomes uncovetous
Having abandoned ill will  anger he becomes one with a mind of no ill will
Having abandoned wrong views he becomes one who has right views
That disciple of the noble ones headman  thus devoid of covetousness devoid of ill will unbewildered alert mindful  keeps pervading the first direction with an awareness imbued with good will likewise the second likewise the third likewise the fourth
Thus above below  all around everywhere in its entirety he keeps pervading the allencompassing cosmos with an awareness imbued with good will  abundant expansive immeasurable without hostility without ill will
Just as a strong conchtrumpet blower can notify the four directions without any difficulty in the same way when the awarenessrelease through good will is thus developed thus pursued any deed done to a limited extent no longer remains there no longer stays there
That disciple of the noble ones  thus devoid of covetousness devoid of ill will unbewildered alert mindful  keeps pervading the first direction with an awareness imbued with compassion appreciation equanimity likewise the second likewise the third likewise the fourth
Thus above below  all around everywhere in its entirety he keeps pervading the allencompassing cosmos with an awareness imbued with equanimity  abundant expansive immeasurable without hostility without ill will
Just as a strong conchtrumpet blower can notify the four directions without any difficulty in the same way when the awarenessrelease through equanimity is thus developed thus pursued any deed done to a limited extent no longer remains there no longer stays there
When this was said Asibandhakaputta the headman the disciple of the Niganthas said to the Blessed One Magnificent lord
Magnificent
Just as if he were to place upright what was overturned to reveal what was hidden to point out the way to one who was lost or to carry a lamp into the dark so that those with eyes could see forms in the same way has the Blessed One  through many lines of reasoning  made the Dhamma clear
I go to the Blessed One for refuge to the Dhamma  to the community of monks
May the Blessed One remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge from this day forward for life

Does not the Blessed One dwell in compassion for all living beings
Indeed headman the Tathaagata does dwell in compassion for all living beings
Well then Lord does not the Blessed One teach Dhamma in full to some but not so fully to others
I will reply to this question headman with another
Answer as seems proper to you
What do you think
Suppose a peasant farmer has three fields one excellent one middling and one poor sandy salty with bad soil
Tell me when the farmer wants to sow his seed which field would he sow first the excellent one the middling one or the poor one that is sandy salty and with bad soil
Lord the farmer who wanted to sow his seed would sow the excellent field first
Having done that he would sow the middling field next and the one that was poor sandy salty with bad soil he might or might not sow
Why
Well it might do for cattlefood
Well headman that excellent field is like my monks and nuns
To them I teach the Dhamma which is lovely in its beginning lovely in its middle and lovely in its ending in spirit and in letter I display to them the holy life perfectly fulfilled and purified
Why
Because these people adhere to me as their island their shelter their resort their refuge
The middling field is like my male and female layfollowers
To these too I teach the Dhamma which is lovely in its beginning lovely in its middle and lovely in its ending in spirit and in letter I display to them the holy life perfectly fulfilled and purified
Why
Because these people adhere to me as their island their shelter their resort their refuge
The poor field that is sandy salty and with bad soil is like my wandering recluses and Brahmans of other sects
To them I also teach the Dhamma which is lovely in its beginning lovely in its middle and lovely in its ending in spirit and in letter I display to them the holy life perfectly fulfilled and purified
Why
Because if they only understand a single phrase it would long be for their profit
At that time Citta the householder was a sick man suffering from a serious illness
Then a number of devas that dwell in gardens forests and trees the devas of healing herbs and of great trees in the forest gathered together and said to Citta the householder Make a resolve householder 'In some future time may I be a king a worldruler' To this Citta replied That is something impermanent something to be rejected and passed over
Now Citta's friends colleagues and bloodrelations heard him say this and they said to him Sir
Set up mindfulness don't ramble
What have I said that makes you tell me to set up mindfulness and not to ramble
Why sir you just said 'That is something impermanent something to be rejected and passed over' Yes but I said that to the devas who dwell in gardens who bade me make a resolve that in some future time I might be a king a worldruler
Sir what purpose did those devas have in mind in urging you to make such a resolve
This is what those devas thought 'This householder Citta is a virtuous man of noble disposition
If he makes a resolve that in some future time he may be a king a worldruler this will be profitable to that virtuous man having made such a resolve with a pure heart and will bring the just man a just and great reward' So then I said 'That is something impermanent something to be rejected and passed over'
On one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Nalanda in the Pavarika Mango Grove
Then Asibandhakaputta the headman went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side
As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One The brahmans of the Western lands lord  those who carry water pots wear garlands of water plants purify with water  worship fire  can take a dead person lift it out instruct it  send it to heaven
But the Blessed One worthy  rightly selfawakened can arrange it so that all the world at the breakup of the body after death reappears in a good destination the heavenly world
Very well then headman I will question you on this matter
Answer as you see fit
What do you think There is the case where a man is one who takes life steals indulges in illicit sex is a liar one who speaks divisive speech harsh speech  idle chatter is greedy bears thoughts of illwill  holds to wrong views
Then a great crowd of people gathering  congregating would pray praise  circumambulate with their hands palmtopalm over the heart 'May this man at the breakup of the body after death reappear in a good destination the heavenly world' What do you think would that man  because of the prayers praise  circumambulation of that great crowd of people  at the breakup of the body after death reappear in a good destination the heavenly world
No lord
Suppose a man were to throw a large boulder into a deep lake of water and a great crowd of people gathering  congregating would pray praise  circumambulate with their hands palmtopalm over the heart 'Rise up O boulder
Come floating up O boulder
Come float to the shore O boulder' What do you think would that boulder  because of the prayers praise  circumambulation of that great crowd of people  rise up come floating up or come float to the shore
No lord
So it is with any man who takes life steals indulges in illicit sex is a liar one who speaks divisive speech harsh speech  idle chatter is greedy bears thoughts of illwill  holds to wrong views
Even though a great crowd of people gathering  congregating would pray praise  circumambulate with their hands palmtopalm over the heart  'May this man at the breakup of the body after death reappear in a good destination the heavenly world'  still at the breakup of the body after death he would reappear in destitution a bad destination the lower realms hell
Now what do you think There is the case where a man is one who refrains from taking life from stealing  from indulging in illicit sex he refrains from lying from speaking divisive speech from harsh speech  from idle chatter he is not greedy bears no thoughts of illwill  holds to right view
Then a great crowd of people gathering  congregating would pray praise  circumambulate with their hands palmtopalm over the heart 'May this man at the breakup of the body after death reappear in destitution a bad destination the lower realms hell' What do you think would that man  because of the prayers praise  circumambulation of that great crowd of people  at the breakup of the body after death reappear in destitution a bad destination the lower realms hell
No lord
Suppose a man were to throw a jar of ghee or a jar of oil into a deep lake of water where it would break
There the shards  jarfragments would go down while the ghee or oil would come up
Then a great crowd of people gathering  congregating would pray praise  circumambulate with their hands palmtopalm over the heart 'Sink O gheeoil
Submerge O gheeoil
Go down O gheeoil' What do you think would that gheeoil because of the prayers praise  circumambulation of that great crowd of people sink submerge or go down
No lord
So it is with any man who refrains from taking life from stealing  from indulging in illicit sex refrains from lying from speaking divisive speech from harsh speech  from idle chatter is not greedy bears no thoughts of illwill  holds to right view
Even though a great crowd of people gathering  congregating would pray praise  circumambulate with their hands palmtopalm over the heart  'May this man at the breakup of the body after death reappear in a destitution a bad destination the lower realms hell'  still at the breakup of the body after death he would reappear in a good destination the heavenly world

On one occasion Ven
Godatta was living near Macchikasanda in the Wild Mango Grove
Then Citta the householder went to him and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side
As he was sitting there Ven
Godatta said to him Householder the immeasurable awarenessrelease the nothingness awarenessrelease the emptiness awarenessrelease the themeless awarenessrelease Are these phenomena different in meaning and different in name or are they one in meaning and different only in name
Venerable sir there is a line of reasoning by which these phenomena are different in meaning and different in name and there is a line of reasoning by which they are one in meaning and different only in name
And what is the line of reasoning by which they are different in meaning and different in name
There is the case where a monk keeps pervading the first direction with an awareness imbued with good will likewise the second likewise the third likewise the fourth
Thus above below  all around everywhere in its entirety he keeps pervading the allencompassing cosmos with an awareness imbued with good will  abundant expansive immeasurable without hostility without ill will
He keeps pervading the first direction with an awareness imbued with compassion appreciation equanimity likewise the second likewise the third likewise the fourth
Thus above below  all around everywhere in its entirety he keeps pervading the allencompassing cosmos with an awareness imbued with equanimity  abundant expansive immeasurable without hostility without ill will
This is called the immeasurable awarenessrelease
And what is the nothingness awarenessrelease
There is the case where a monk with the complete transcending of the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness 'There is nothing' enters  remains in the dimension of nothingness
This is called the nothingness awarenessrelease
And what is the emptiness awarenessrelease
There is the case where a monk having gone into the wilderness to the root of a tree or into an empty dwelling considers this 'This is empty of self or of anything pertaining to self' This is called the emptiness awarenessrelease
And what is the themeless awarenessrelease
There is the case where a monk not attending to any theme enters  remains in the themeless concentration of awareness
This is called the themeless awarenessrelease
This venerable sir is the line of reasoning by which these phenomena are different in meaning and different in name
And what venerable sir is the line of reasoning by which they are one in meaning and different only in name
Passion venerable sir is a making of measurement aversion a making of measurement delusion a making of measurement
For a monk whose fermentations are ended these have been abandoned their root destroyed made like a palmyra stump deprived of the conditions of development not destined for future arising
To the extent that there are immeasurable awarenessreleases the unprovoked awarenessrelease is declared supreme
And that unprovoked awarenessrelease is empty of passion empty of aversion empty of delusion
Passion is a something aversion a something delusion a something
For a monk whose fermentations are ended these have been abandoned their root destroyed made like a palmyra stump deprived of the conditions of development not destined for future arising
To the extent that there are nothingness awarenessreleases the unprovoked awarenessrelease is declared supreme
And that unprovoked awarenessrelease is empty of passion empty of aversion empty of delusion
Passion is a making of themes aversion a making of themes delusion a making of themes

It's a gain for you householder a great gain what your eye of discernment plumbs in the deep word of the Buddha
Translator's note This discourse is a slightly expanded version of a discussion of the same topic given in MN
On one occasion Ven
Kamabhu was living near Macchikasanda in the Wild Mango Grove
Then Citta the householder went to him and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side
As he was sitting there he said to Ven
Kamabhu Venerable sir how many fabrications are there
There are three fabrications householder bodilyfabrications verbal fabrications  mental fabrications
Very good venerable sir And delighting in and approving of Ven
Kamabhu's answer Citta asked him a further question But what are bodilyfabrications
What are verbal fabrications
What are mental fabrications
Inout breaths are bodily fabrications
Directed thought  evaluation are verbal fabrications
Perceptions  feelings are mental fabrications
Very good venerable sir And delighting in and approving of Ven
Kamabhu's answer Citta asked him a further question But why are inout breaths bodily fabrications
Why are directed thought  evaluation verbal fabrications
Why are perceptions  feelings mental fabrications
Inout breaths are bodily these are things tied up with the body
That's why inout breaths are bodily fabrications
Having first directed one's thoughts and made an evaluation one then breaks out into speech
That's why directed thought  evaluation are verbal fabrications
Perceptions  feelings are mental these are things tied up with the mind
That's why perceptions  feelings are mental fabrications
Very good venerable sir And delighting in and approving of Ven
Kamabhu's answer Citta asked him a further question Now how does the attainment of the cessation of perception  feeling come about
The thought does not occur to a monk as he is attaining the cessation of perception  feeling that 'I am about to attain the cessation of perception  feeling' or that 'I am attaining the cessation of perception  feeling' or that 'I have attained the cessation of perception  feeling' Instead the way his mind has previously been developed leads him to that state
Very good venerable sir And delighting in and approving of Ven
Kamabhu's answer Citta asked him a further question When a monk is attaining the cessation of perception  feeling which things cease first bodily fabrications verbal fabrications or mental fabrications
When a monk is attaining the cessation of perception  feeling verbal fabrications cease first then bodily fabrications then mental fabrications
Very good venerable sir And delighting in and approving of Ven
Kamabhu's answer Citta asked him a further question What is the difference between a monk who has died  passed away and a monk who has attained the cessation of perception  feeling
In the case of a monk who has died  passed away his bodily fabrication has ceased  subsided verbal fabrication has ceased  subsided mental fabrication has ceased  subsided his life force is totally ended his heat is dissipated and his faculties are shut down
But in the case of a monk who has attained the cessation of perception  feeling his bodily fabrication has ceased  subsided verbal fabrication has ceased  subsided mental fabrication has ceased  subsided his life force is not ended his heat is not dissipated and his faculties are bright  clear
This is the difference between a monk who has died  passed away and a monk who has attained the cessation of perception  feeling
Very good venerable sir And delighting in and approving of Ven
Kamabhu's answer Citta asked him a further question Now how does emergence from the cessation of perception  feeling come about
The thought does not occur to a monk as he is emerging from the cessation of perception  feeling that 'I am about to emerge from the cessation of perception  feeling' or that 'I am emerging from the cessation of perception  feeling' or that 'I have emerged from the cessation of perception  feeling' Instead the way his mind has previously been developed leads him to that state
Very good venerable sir And delighting in and approving of Ven
Kamabhu's answer Citta asked him a further question When a monk is emerging from the cessation of perception  feeling which things arise first bodily fabrications verbal fabrications or mental fabrications
When a monk is emerging from the cessation of perception  feeling mental fabrications arise first then bodily fabrications then verbal fabrications
Very good venerable sir And delighting in and approving of Ven
Kamabhu's answer Citta asked him a further question When a monk has emerged from the cessation of perception  feeling how many contacts make contact
When a monk has emerged from the cessation of perception  feeling three contacts make contact contact with emptiness contact with the signless  contact with the undirected
Very good venerable sir And delighting in and approving of Ven
Kamabhu's answer Citta asked him a further question When a monk has emerged from the cessation of perception  feeling to what does his mind lean to what does it tend to what does it incline
When a monk has emerged from the cessation of perception  feeling his mind leans to seclusion tends to seclusion inclines to seclusion
Very good venerable sir And delighting in and approving of Ven
Kamabhu's answer Citta asked him a further question How many mental qualities are of great help in the attainment of the cessation of perception  feeling
Actually householder you have asked last what should have been asked first
Nevertheless I will answer you
Two qualities are of great help in the attainment of the cessation of perception  feeling tranquillity  insight
On one occasion Ven
Sariputta was staying in Magadha in Nalaka Village
Then Jambukhadika the wanderer went to Ven
Sariputta and on arrival exchanged courteous greetings with him
After this exchange of friendly greetings  courtesies he sat to one side
As he was sitting there he said to Ven
Sariputta 'Stress stress' it is said my friend Sariputta
Which type of stress
There are these three forms of stressfulness my friend the stressfulness of pain the stressfulness of fabrication the stressfulness of change
These are the three forms of stressfulness
But is there a path is there a practice for the full comprehension of these forms of stressfulness
Yes there is a path there is a practice for the full comprehension of these forms of stressfulness
Then what is the path what is the practice for the full comprehension of these forms of stressfulness
Precisely this Noble Eightfold Path my friend  right view right resolve right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness right concentration
This is the path this is the practice for the full comprehension of these forms of stressfulness
It's an auspicious path my friend an auspicious practice for the full comprehension of these forms of stressfulness  enough for the sake of heedfulness
On one occasion a large number of senior monks were living near Macchikasanda in the Wild Mango Grove
Then Citta the householder went to them and on arrival having bowed down to them sat to one side
As he was sitting there he said to them Venerable sirs may the senior monks acquiesce to tomorrow's meal from me
The senior monks acquiesced by silence
Then Citta the householder sensing the senior monks' acquiescence got up from his seat and having bowed down to them circumambulated them  keeping them to his right  and left
When the night had passed the senior monks put on their robes in the early morning and  taking their bowls  outer robes  went to Citta's residence
There they sat down on the appointed seats
Citta the householder went to them and having bowed down to them sat to one side
As he was sitting there he said to the most senior monk
Venerable sir concerning the various views that arise in the world  'The cosmos is eternal' or 'The cosmos isn't eternal' 'The cosmos is finite' or 'The cosmos is infinite' 'The soul and the body are the same' or 'The soul is one thing the body another' 'A Tathagata exists after death' or 'A Tathagata doesn't exist after death' or 'A Tathagata both exists  doesn't exist after death' or 'A Tathagata neither exists nor doesn't exist after death' these along with the sixtytwo views mentioned in the Brahmajala  when what is present do these views come into being and when what is absent do they not come into being
When this was said the senior monk was silent
A second time A third time Citta the householder asked Concerning the various views that arise in the world when what is present do they come into being and what is absent do they not come into being A third time the senior monk was silent
Now on that occasion Ven
Isidatta was the most junior of all the monks in that Community
Then he said to the senior monk Allow me venerable sir to answer Citta the householder's question
You may answer it friend Isidatta
Now householder are you asking this 'Concerning the various views that arise in the world when what is present do they come into being and what is absent do they not come into being'
Yes venerable sir
Concerning the various views that arise in the world householder when selfidentity view is present these views come into being when selfidentity view is absent they don't come into being
But venerable sir how does selfidentity view come into being
There is the case householder where an uninstructed runofthemill person  who has no regard for noble ones is not wellversed or disciplined in their Dhamma who has no regard for men of integrity is not wellversed or disciplined in their Dhamma  assumes form to be the self or the self as possessing form or form as in the self or the self as in form
He assumes feeling to be the self or the self as possessing feeling or feeling as in the self or the self as in feeling
He assumes perception to be the self or the self as possessing perception or perception as in the self or the self as in perception
He assumes fabrications to be the self or the self as possessing fabrications or fabrications as in the self or the self as in fabrications
He assumes consciousness to be the self or the self as possessing consciousness or consciousness as in the self or the self as in consciousness
This is how selfidentity view comes into being
And venerable sir how does selfidentity view not come into being
There is the case householder where a wellinstructed disciple of the noble ones  who has regard for noble ones is wellversed  disciplined in their Dhamma who has regard for men of integrity is wellversed  disciplined in their Dhamma  does not assume form to be the self or the self as possessing form or form as in the self or the self as in form
He does not assume feeling to be the self He does not assume perception to be the self He does not assume fabrications to be the self He does not assume consciousness to be the self or the self as possessing consciousness or consciousness as in the self or the self as in consciousness
This is how selfidentity view does not come into being
Venerable sir where does Master Isidatta come from
I come from Avanti householder
There is venerable sir a clansman from Avanti named Isidatta an unseen friend of mine who has gone forth
Have you ever seen him
Yes householder
Where is he living now venerable sir
When this was said Ven
Isidatta was silent
Are you my Isidatta
Yes householder
Then may Master Isidatta delight in the charming Wild Mango Grove at Macchikasanda
I will be responsible for your robes almsfood lodgings  medicinal requisites
That is admirably said householder
Then Citta the householder  having delighted  rejoiced in Ven
Isidatta's words  with his own hand served  satisfied the senior monks with choice staple  nonstaple foods
When the senior monks had finished eating and had removed their hands from their bowls they got up from their seats and left
Then the most senior monk said to Ven
Isidatta It was excellent friend Isidatta the way that question inspired you to answer
It didn't inspire an answer in me at all
Whenever a similar question comes up again may it inspire you to answer as you did just now
Then Ven
Isidatta  having set his lodging in order and taking his bowl  robes  left Macchikasanda
And in leaving Macchikasanda he was gone for good and never returned

These are called feelings
Contact is the origination of feeling
Craving is the path of practice leading to feeling
From the cessation of contact is the cessation of feeling
This very noble eightfold path is the path of practice leading to the cessation of feeling
In other words right view right resolve right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness right concentration
Whatever pleasure  happiness arise in dependence on feeling That is the allure of feeling
The fact that feeling is inconstant stressful subject to change That is the drawback of feeling
The subduing of desirepassion for feeling the abandoning of desirepassion for feeling That is the escape from feeling

And what are the six kinds of household equanimity
The equanimity that arises when a foolish deluded person  a runofthemill untaught person who has not conquered his limitations or the results of action  who is blind to danger  sees a form with the eye
Such equanimity does not go beyond the form which is why it is called household equanimity

And what are the six kinds of renunciation equanimity
The equanimity that arises when  experiencing the inconstancy of those very forms their change fading  cessation  one sees with right discernment as it actually is that all forms past or present are inconstant stressful subject to change This equanimity goes beyond form which is why it is called renunciation equanimity

Then a certain monk went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side
As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One Just now lord while I was alone in seclusion this train of thought arose in my awareness 'Three feelings have been spoken of by the Blessed One a feeling of pleasure a feeling of pain  a feeling of neither pleasure nor pain
These are the three feelings spoken of by the Blessed One
But the Blessed One has said Whatever is felt comes under stress Now in what connection was this stated by the Blessed One Whatever is felt comes under stress' Excellent monk
Excellent
These three feelings have been spoken of by me a feeling of pleasure a feeling of pain  a feeling of neither pleasure nor pain
These are the three feelings spoken of by me
But I have also said 'Whatever is felt comes under stress' That I have stated simply in connection with the inconstancy of fabrications
That I have stated simply in connection with the nature of fabrications to end in connection with the nature of fabrications to fall away to fade away to cease in connection with the nature of fabrications to change
And I have also taught the stepbystep cessation of fabrications
When one has attained the first jhāna speech has ceased
When one has attained the second jhāna directed thought  evaluation have ceased
When one has attained the third jhāna rapture has ceased
When one has attained the fourth jhāna inandout breathing has ceased
When one has attained the dimension of the infinitude of space the perception of forms has ceased
When one has attained the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness the perception of the dimension of the infinitude of space has ceased
When one has attained the dimension of nothingness the perception of the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness has ceased
When one has attained the dimension of neitherperception nor nonperception the perception of the dimension of nothingness has ceased
When one has attained the cessation of perception  feeling perception  feeling have ceased
When a monk's effluents have ended passion has ceased aversion has ceased delusion has ceased
Then monk I have also taught the stepbystep stilling of fabrications
When one has attained the first jhāna speech has been stilled
When one has attained the second jhāna directed thought  evaluation have been stilled
When one has attained the third jhāna rapture has been stilled
When one has attained the fourth jhāna inandout breathing has been stilled

When one has attained the fourth jhāna inandout breathing has been calmed
When one has attained the cessation of perception  feeling perception  feeling have been calmed
When a monk's effluents have ended passion has been calmed aversion has been calmed delusion has been calmed

Translator's note Some people have interpreted this sutta as stating that there are many experiences that cannot be explained by the principle of kamma
A casual glance of the alternative factors here  drawn from the various causes for pain that were recognized in the medical treatises of his time  would seem to support this conclusion
However if we compare this list with his definition of old kamma in SN we see that many of the alternative causes are actually the result of past actions
Those that aren't are the result of new kamma
For instance MN counts asceticism  which produces pain in the immediate present  under the factor harsh treatment
The point here is that old and new kamma do not override other causal factors operating in the universe  such as those recognized by the physical sciences  but instead find their expression within those factors
A second point is that some of the influences of past kamma can be mitigated in the present  a disease caused by bile for instance can be cured by medicine that brings the bile back to normal
Similarly with the mind suffering caused by physical pain can be ended by understanding and abandoning the attachment that led to that suffering
In this way the Buddha's teaching on kamma avoids determinism and opens the way for a path of practice focused on eliminating the causes of suffering in the here and now
On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling near Rajagaha in the Bamboo Grove Monastery the Squirrel's Feeding Place
There Moliyasivaka the wanderer went to the Blessed One and on arrival exchanged courteous greetings with him
After an exchange of friendly greetings  courtesies he sat to one side
As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One Master Gotama there are some brahmans  contemplatives who are of this doctrine this view Whatever an individual feels  pleasure pain neitherpleasurenorpain  is entirely caused by what was done before
Now what does Master Gotama say to that
There are cases where some feelings arise based on bile
You yourself should know how some feelings arise based on bile
Even the world is agreed on how some feelings arise based on bile
So any brahmans  contemplatives who are of the doctrine  view that whatever an individual feels  pleasure pain neitherpleasurenorpain  is entirely caused by what was done before  slip past what they themselves know slip past what is agreed on by the world
Therefore I say that those brahmans  contemplatives are wrong
There are cases where some feelings arise based on phlegm based on internal winds based on a combination of bodily humors from the change of the seasons from uneven care of the body from harsh treatment from the result of kamma
You yourself should know how some feelings arise from the result of kamma
Even the world is agreed on how some feelings arise from the result of kamma
So any brahmans  contemplatives who are of the doctrine  view that whatever an individual feels  pleasure pain neither pleasurenorpain  is entirely caused by what was done before  slip past what they themselves know slip past what is agreed on by the world
Therefore I say that those brahmans  contemplatives are wrong
When this was said Moliyasivaka the wanderer said to the Blessed One Magnificent lord
Magnificent
Just as if he were to place upright what was overturned to reveal what was hidden to point out the way to one who was lost or to carry a lamp into the dark so that those with eyes could see forms in the same way has the Blessed One  through many lines of reasoning  made the Dhamma clear
I go to the Blessed One for refuge to the Dhamma  to the community of monks
May the Blessed One remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge from this day forward for life

Monks an uninstructed runofthemill person feels feelings of pleasure feelings of pain feelings of neitherpleasurenorpain
A wellinstructed disciple of the noble ones also feels feelings of pleasure feelings of pain feelings of neitherpleasurenorpain
So what difference what distinction what distinguishing factor is there between the wellinstructed disciple of the noble ones and the uninstructed runofthemill person
For us lord the teachings have the Blessed One as their root their guide  their arbitrator
It would be good if the Blessed One himself would explicate the meaning of this statement
Having heard it from the Blessed One the monks will remember it
In that case monks listen  pay close attention
I will speak
As you say lord the monks responded
The Blessed One said When touched with a feeling of pain the uninstructed runofthemill person sorrows grieves  laments beats his breast becomes distraught
So he feels two pains physical  mental
Just as if they were to shoot a man with an arrow and right afterward were to shoot him with another one so that he would feel the pains of two arrows in the same way when touched with a feeling of pain the uninstructed runofthemill person sorrows grieves  laments beats his breast becomes distraught
So he feels two pains physical  mental
As he is touched by that painful feeling he is resistant
Any resistanceobsession with regard to that painful feeling obsesses him
Touched by that painful feeling he delights in sensual pleasure
Why is that
Because the uninstructed runofthemill person does not discern any escape from painful feeling aside from sensual pleasure
As he is delighting in sensual pleasure any passionobsession with regard to that feeling of pleasure obsesses him
He does not discern as it actually is present the origination passing away allure drawback or escape from that feeling
As he does not discern the origination passing away allure drawback or escape from that feeling then any ignoranceobsession with regard to that feeling of neitherpleasurenorpain obsesses him
Sensing a feeling of pleasure he senses it as though joined with it
Sensing a feeling of pain he senses it as though joined with it
Sensing a feeling of neitherpleasurenorpain he senses it as though joined with it
This is called an uninstructed runofthemill person joined with birth aging  death with sorrows lamentations pains distresses  despairs
He is joined I tell you with suffering  stress
Now the wellinstructed disciple of the noble ones when touched with a feeling of pain does not sorrow grieve or lament does not beat his breast or become distraught
So he feels one pain physical but not mental
Just as if they were to shoot a man with an arrow and right afterward did not shoot him with another one so that he would feel the pain of only one arrow
In the same way when touched with a feeling of pain the wellinstructed disciple of the noble ones does not sorrow grieve or lament does not beat his breast or become distraught
He feels one pain physical but not mental
As he is touched by that painful feeling he is not resistant
No resistanceobsession with regard to that painful feeling obsesses him
Touched by that painful feeling he does not delight in sensual pleasure
Why is that
Because the wellinstructed disciple of the noble ones discerns an escape from painful feeling aside from sensual pleasure
As he is not delighting in sensual pleasure no passionobsession with regard to that feeling of pleasure obsesses him
He discerns as it actually is present the origination passing away allure drawback and escape from that feeling
As he discerns the origination passing away allure drawback and escape from that feeling no ignoranceobsession with regard to that feeling of neitherpleasurenorpain obsesses him
Sensing a feeling of pleasure he senses it disjoined from it
Sensing a feeling of pain he senses it disjoined from it
Sensing a feeling of neitherpleasurenorpain he senses it disjoined from it
This is called a wellinstructed disciple of the noble ones disjoined from birth aging  death from sorrows lamentations pains distresses  despairs
He is disjoined I tell you from suffering  stress
This is the difference this the distinction this the distinguishing factor between the wellinstructed disciple of the noble ones and the uninstructed runofthemill person

Then Pañcakanga the carpenter went to Ven
Udayin and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side
As he was sitting there he said to Ven
Udayin Venerable sir how many feelings has the Blessed One spoken of
Householder the Blessed One has spoken of three feelings a feeling of pleasure a feeling of pain a feeling of neither pleasure nor pain
These are the three feelings the Blessed One has spoken of
When this was said Pañcakanga the carpenter said to Ven
Udayin The Blessed One has not spoken of three feelings
He has spoken of two feelings a feeling of pleasure and a feeling of pain
As for the feeling of neither pleasure nor pain the Blessed One has spoken of it as a refined pleasure
A second time Ven
Udayin said to Pañcakanga the carpenter Householder the Blessed One has not spoken of two feelings
He has spoken of three feelings
A second time Pañcakanga the carpenter said to Ven
Udayin The Blessed One has not spoken of three feelings
He has spoken of two feelings
A third time Ven
Udayin said to Pañcakanga the carpenter Householder the Blessed One has not spoken of two feelings
He has spoken of three feelings
A third time Pañcakanga the carpenter said to Ven
Udayin The Blessed One has not spoken of three feelings
He has spoken of two feelings
Neither was Ven
Udayin able to convince Pañcakanga the carpenter nor was Pañcakanga the carpenter able to convince Ven
Udayin
Now Ven
Ananda overheard this discussion between Ven
Udayin and Pañcakanga
So he went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side
As he was sitting there he told the Blessed One of the entire discussion between Ven
Udayin and Pañcakanga
Ananda true was the exposition that Pañcakanga the carpenter would not accept from Ven
Udayin
And true was the exposition that Ven
Udayin would not accept from Pañcakanga the carpenter
There is the exposition by which I have spoken of two feelings the exposition by which I have spoken of three feelings five feelings six feelings eighteen feelings feelings feelings
Thus I have taught the Dhamma by means of exposition
When I have taught the Dhamma by means of exposition it can be expected that when there are those who do not consent to assent to or accept what is wellsaid and wellstated by one another there will be arguing quarreling  disputing and they will dwell wounding one another with the sword of the tongue
Thus I have taught the Dhamma by means of exposition
When I have taught the Dhamma by means of exposition it can be expected that when there are those who do consent to assent to  accept what is wellsaid and wellstated by one another they will live in harmony with courtesy without quarreling like milk mixed with water regarding one another with friendly eyes
Ananda there are these five strings of sensuality
Which five
Forms cognizable via the eye  agreeable pleasing charming endearing fostering desire enticing
Sounds cognizable via the ear Aromas cognizable via the nose Flavors cognizable via the tongue Tactile sensations cognizable via the body  agreeable pleasing charming endearing fostering desire enticing
Now whatever pleasure or happiness arises in dependence on these five strands of sensuality that is called sensual pleasure
Though some might say 'That is the highest pleasure that beings experience' I would not grant them that
Why is that
Because there is another pleasure more extreme  refined than that
And what Ananda is another pleasure more extreme  refined than that
There is the case where a monk  quite withdrawn from sensual pleasures withdrawn from unskillful qualities  enters  remains in the first jhana rapture  pleasure born from withdrawal accompanied by directed thought  evaluation
This is another pleasure more extreme  refined than that
Though some might say 'That is the highest pleasure that beings experience' I would not grant them that
Why is that
Because there is another pleasure more extreme  refined than that
And what Ananda is another pleasure more extreme  refined than that
There is the case where a monk with the stilling of directed thoughts  evaluations enters  remains in the second jhana rapture  pleasure born of composure unification of awareness free from directed thought  evaluation  internal assurance
This is another pleasure more extreme  refined than that
Though some might say 'That is the highest pleasure that beings experience' I would not grant them that
Why is that
Because there is another pleasure more extreme  refined than that
And what Ananda is another pleasure more extreme  refined than that
There is the case where a monk with the fading of rapture he remains equanimous mindful  alert and senses pleasure with the body
He enters  remains in the third jhana of which the Noble Ones declare 'Equanimous  mindful he has a pleasant abiding' This is another pleasure more extreme  refined than that
Though some might say 'That is the highest pleasure that beings experience' I would not grant them that
Why is that
Because there is another pleasure more extreme  refined than that
And what Ananda is another pleasure more extreme  refined than that
There is the case where a monk with the abandoning of pleasure  stress  as with the earlier disappearance of elation  distress  enters  remains in the fourth jhana purity of equanimity  mindfulness neitherpleasurenorpain
This is another pleasure more extreme  refined than that
Though some might say 'That is the highest pleasure that beings experience' I would not grant them that
Why is that
Because there is another pleasure more extreme  refined than that
And what Ananda is another pleasure more extreme  refined than that
There is the case where a monk with the complete transcending of perceptions of form with the disappearance of perceptions of resistance and not heeding perceptions of diversity 'Infinite space' enters  remains in the dimension of the infinitude of space
This is another pleasure more extreme  refined than that
Though some might say 'That is the highest pleasure that beings experience' I would not grant them that
Why is that
Because there is another pleasure more extreme  refined than that
And what Ananda is another pleasure more extreme  refined than that
There is the case where a monk with the complete transcending of the dimension of the infinitude of space 'Infinite consciousness' enters  remains in the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness
This is another pleasure more extreme  refined than that
Though some might say 'That is the highest pleasure that beings experience' I would not grant them that
Why is that

There is the case where a monk with the complete transcending of the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness 'There is nothing' enters  remains in the dimension of nothingness
This is another pleasure more extreme  refined than that
Though some might say 'That is the highest pleasure that beings experience' I would not grant them that
Why is that
Because there is another pleasure more extreme  refined than that
And what Ananda is another pleasure more extreme  refined than that
There is the case where a monk with the complete transcending of the dimension of nothingness enters  remains in the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception
This is another pleasure more extreme  refined than that
Though some might say 'That is the highest pleasure that beings experience' I would not grant them that
Why is that
Because there is another pleasure more extreme  refined than that
And what Ananda is another pleasure more extreme  refined than that
There is the case where a monk with the complete transcending of the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception enters  remains in the cessation of perception  feeling
This is another pleasure more extreme  refined than that
Now it's possible Ananda that some wanderers of other persuasions might say 'Gotama the contemplative speaks of the cessation of perception  feeling and yet describes it as pleasure
What is this
How can this be' When they say that they are to be told 'It's not the case friends that the Blessed One describes only pleasant feeling as included under pleasure
Wherever pleasure is found in whatever terms the Blessed One describes it as pleasure' See also MN AN
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Vesali in the Great Forest at the Gabled Pavilion
Then in the late afternoon he left his seclusion and went to the sick ward and on arrival sat down on a prepared seat
As he was sitting there he addressed the monks A monk should approach the time of death mindful  alert
This is our instruction to you all
And how is a monk mindful
There is the case where a monk remains focused on the body in  of itself  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the world
He remains focused on feelings in  of themselves mind in  of itself mental qualities in  of themselves  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the world
This is how a monk is mindful
And how is a monk alert
When going forward  returning he makes himself fully alert when looking toward  looking away when bending  extending his limbs when carrying his outer cloak his upper robe  his bowl when eating drinking chewing  savoring when urinating  defecating when walking standing sitting falling asleep waking up talking  remaining silent he makes himself fully alert
This is how a monk is alert
So a monk should approach the time of death mindful  alert
This is our instruction to you all
As a monk is dwelling thus mindful  alert  heedful ardent  resolute  a feeling of pleasure arises in him
He discerns that 'A feeling of pleasure has arisen in me
It is dependent on a requisite condition not independent
Dependent on what
Dependent on this body
Now this body is inconstant fabricated dependently coarisen
Being dependent on a body that is inconstant fabricated  dependently coarisen how can this feeling of pleasure that has arisen be constant' He remains focused on inconstancy with regard to the body  to the feeling of pleasure
He remains focused on dissolution dispassion cessation relinquishment with regard to the body  to the feeling of pleasure
As he remains focused on inconstancy dissolution dispassion cessation relinquishment with regard to the body  to the feeling of pleasure he abandons any passionobsession with regard to the body  the feeling of pleasure
As he is dwelling thus mindful  alert  heedful ardent  resolute  a feeling of pain arises in him
He discerns that 'A feeling of pain has arisen in me
It is dependent on a requisite condition not independent
Dependent on what
Dependent on this body
Now this body is inconstant fabricated dependently coarisen
Being dependent on a body that is inconstant fabricated  dependently coarisen how can this feeling of pain that has arisen be constant' He remains focused on inconstancy with regard to the body  to the feeling of pain
He remains focused on dissolution dispassion cessation relinquishment with regard to the body  to the feeling of pain
As he remains focused on inconstancy dissolution dispassion cessation relinquishment with regard to the body  to the feeling of pain he abandons any resistanceobsession with regard to the body  the feeling of pain
As he is dwelling thus mindful  alert  heedful ardent  resolute  a feeling of neitherpleasurenorpain arises in him
He discerns that 'A feeling of neitherpleasurenorpain has arisen in me
It is dependent on a requisite condition not independent
Dependent on what
Dependent on this body
Now this body is inconstant fabricated dependently coarisen
Being dependent on a body that is inconstant fabricated  dependently coarisen how can this feeling of neitherpleasurenorpain that has arisen be constant' He remains focused on inconstancy with regard to the body  to the feeling of neitherpleasurenorpain
He remains focused on dissolution dispassion cessation relinquishment with regard to the body  to the feeling of neitherpleasurenorpain
As he remains focused on inconstancy dissolution dispassion cessation relinquishment with regard to the body  to the feeling of neitherpleasurenorpain he abandons any ignoranceobsession with regard to the body  the feeling of neitherpleasurenorpain
Sensing a feeling of pleasure he discerns that it is inconstant not grasped at not relished
Sensing a feeling of pain Sensing a feeling of neitherpleasurenorpain he discerns that it is inconstant not grasped at not relished
Sensing a feeling of pleasure he senses it disjoined from it
Sensing a feeling of pain Sensing a feeling of neitherpleasurenorpain he senses it disjoined from it
When sensing a feeling limited to the body he discerns that 'I am sensing a feeling limited to the body' When sensing a feeling limited to life he discerns that 'I am sensing a feeling limited to life' He discerns that 'With the breakup of the body after the termination of life all that is sensed not being relished will grow cold right here'
Just as an oil lamp burns in dependence on oil  wick and from the termination of the oil  wick  and from not being provided any other sustenance  it goes out unnourished in the same way when sensing a feeling limited to the body he discerns that 'I am sensing a feeling limited to the body' When sensing a feeling limited to life he discerns that 'I am sensing a feeling limited to life' He discerns that 'With the breakup of the body after the termination of life all that is sensed not being relished will grow cold right here' See also Straight from the Heart
Suppose monks a man catches six animals of different domains and different resorts of living  a snake a crocodile a bird a dog a jackal and a monkey tethering each with a stout rope
Having tethered them with a stout rope he fastens the ropes together in the middle he lets go of them
Now monks these six animals of different domains and feeding habits would swing around and struggle each trying to get to his natural domain
The snake would struggle thinking 'I'll get to the anthill' the crocodile 'I'll get into the water' the bird 'I'll fly up in the air'' the dog 'I'll make for the village' the jackal 'I'll make for the charnelground' the monkey 'I'll head for the forest'
Now monks when those six hungry animals grew weary they would yield to the one that was the strongest go his way and be under his power
In the same way monks whenever a monk fails to practice and develop mindfulness as to body the eye struggles to draw him towards attractive objects while unattractive objects are repellent to him The mind struggles to draw him towards attractive objects of thought while unattractive objects of thought are repellent to him
This monks is lack of restraint
And what monks is restraint
In this a monk seeing objects with the eye is not drawn to attractive objects is not repelled by unattractive objects
He remains with firmly established mindfulness as to body his mind being unrestricted
He knows in truth that liberation of the heart that liberation by wisdom through which those evil unskilled states that have arisen pass away without remainder
Suppose a man catches six animals and he fastens the rope together to a stout post or pillar Then when those six animals grow weary they would have to stand crouch or lie down by the stout post or pillar
In the same way monks when a monk practices and develops mindfulness as to the body the eye does not struggle to draw him towards attractive visual objects nor are unattractive visual objects repellent to him the mind does not struggle to draw him towards attractive objects of thought nor are unattractive objects of thought repellent to him
This monks is restraint
'Tethered to a stout post or pillar' monks denotes mindfulness as to body
Therefore monks this is how you must train yourselves 'We shall practice mindfulness as to body develop it make it our vehicle our dwellingplace our resort we will build it up and undertake it thoroughly' This monks is how you must train yourselves
Suppose that a man wounded and festering were to go into a swampy jungle
Its sharpbladed grasses would pierce his feet its thorns would scratch his festering sores
And so from that cause he would experience an even greater measure of pain and unhappiness
In the same way there is the case where a certain monk having gone to a village or to the wilderness meets up with someone who upbraids him 'This venerable one acting in this way undertaking practices in this way is a thorn of impurity in this village' Knowing this person to be a thorn one should understand restraint and lack of restraint
And what is lack of restraint
There is the case where a monk seeing a form with the eye is obsessed with pleasing forms is repelled by unpleasing forms and remains with bodymindfulness unestablished with limited awareness
He does not discern as it actually is present the awarenessrelease the discernmentrelease where any evil unskillful mental qualities that have arisen utterly cease without remainder
Hearing a sound with the ear
Smelling an aroma with the nose
Tasting a flavor with the tongue
Touching a tactile sensation with the body
Cognizing an idea with the intellect he is obsessed with pleasing ideas is repelled by unpleasing ideas and remains with bodymindfulness unestablished with limited awareness
He does not discern as it actually is present the awarenessrelease the discernmentrelease where any evil unskillful mental qualities that have arisen utterly cease without remainder
Just as if a person catching six animals of different ranges of different habitats were to bind them with a strong rope
Catching a snake he would bind it with a strong rope
Catching a crocodile a bird a dog a hyena a monkey he would bind it with a strong rope
Binding them all with a strong rope and tying a knot in the middle he would set chase to them
Then those six animals of different ranges of different habitats would each pull toward its own range  habitat
The snake would pull thinking 'I'll go into the anthill' The crocodile would pull thinking 'I'll go into the water' The bird would pull thinking 'I'll fly up into the air' The dog would pull thinking 'I'll go into the village' The hyena would pull thinking 'I'll go into the charnel ground' The monkey would pull thinking 'I'll go into the forest' And when these six animals became internally exhausted they would submit they would surrender they would come under the sway of whichever among them was the strongest
In the same way when a monk whose mindfulness immersed in the body is undeveloped  unpursued the eye pulls toward pleasing forms while unpleasing forms are repellent
The ear pulls toward pleasing sounds The nose pulls toward pleasing aromas The tongue pulls toward pleasing flavors The body pulls toward pleasing tactile sensations The intellect pulls toward pleasing ideas while unpleasing ideas are repellent
This monks is lack of restraint
And what is restraint
There is the case where a monk seeing a form with the eye is not obsessed with pleasing forms is not repelled by unpleasing forms and remains with bodymindfulness established with immeasurable awareness
He discerns as it actually is present the awarenessrelease the discernmentrelease where all evil unskillful mental qualities that have arisen utterly cease without remainder
Hearing a sound with the ear
Smelling an aroma with the nose
Tasting a flavor with the tongue
Touching a tactile sensation with the body
Cognizing an idea with the intellect he is not obsessed with pleasing ideas is not repelled by unpleasing ideas and remains with bodymindfulness established with immeasurable awareness
He discerns as it actually is present the awarenessrelease the discernmentrelease where all evil unskillful mental qualities that have arisen utterly cease without remainder
Just as if a person catching six animals of different ranges of different habitats were to bind them with a strong rope
Catching a snake he would bind it with a strong rope
Catching a crocodile a bird a dog a hyena a monkey he would bind it with a strong rope
Binding them all with a strong rope he would tether them to a strong post or stake
Then those six animals of different ranges of different habitats would each pull toward its own range  habitat
The snake would pull thinking 'I'll go into the anthill' The crocodile would pull thinking 'I'll go into the water' The bird would pull thinking 'I'll fly up into the air' The dog would pull thinking 'I'll go into the village' The hyena would pull thinking 'I'll go into the charnel ground' The monkey would pull thinking 'I'll go into the forest' And when these six animals became internally exhausted they would stand sit or lie down right there next to the post or stake
In the same way when a monk whose mindfulness immersed in the body is developed  pursued the eye does not pull toward pleasing forms and unpleasing forms are not repellent
The ear does not pull toward pleasing sounds The nose does not pull toward pleasing aromas The tongue does not pull toward pleasing flavors The body does not pull toward pleasing tactile sensations The intellect does not pull toward pleasing ideas and unpleasing ideas are not repellent
This monks is restraint
Thus you should train yourselves 'We will develop mindfulness immersed in the body
We will pursue it hand it the reins and take it as a basis give it a grounding
We will steady it consolidate it and set about it properly' That's how you should train yourselves
Suppose monks there is some ripe corn and a lazy guardian
And an ox fond of corn gets into the field and eats his fill with ravenous delight
In the same way monks the ignorant worldling being uncontrolled in the six sensespheres eats his fill with ravenous delight among the five kinds of sensepleasure
But suppose monks there is some ripe corn and a vigilant guardian
And an ox fond of corn gets into the field
The guardian seizes him firmly by the muzzle
Holding him by the muzzle he gets a firm grip on his forehead and holds him fast
He then gives him a sound thrashing with a stick and then lets him go So it comes about monks that that ox fond of corn though he wanders about in the village or the forest whether he stands still or lies down will not go into that field again because he remember the beating he got there before
In the same way monks when a monk's mind is strongly stirred by the six sensespheres nevertheless he stands firm inwardly becomes calm onepointed and concentrated
Monks in whatever monk or nun there arises desire passion aversion delusion or mental resistance with regard to forms cognizable via the eye heshe should hold the mind in check
'It's dangerous  dubious that path thorny  overgrown a miserable path a devious path impenetrable
It's a path followed by people of no integrity not a path followed by people of integrity
It's not worthy of you' heshe should hold the mind in check with regard to forms cognizable via the eye
In whatever monk or nun there arises desire passion aversion delusion or mental resistance with regard to sounds cognizable via the ear aromas cognizable via the nose flavors cognizable via the tongue tactile sensations cognizable via the body ideas cognizable via the intellect heshe should hold the mind in check
'It's dangerous  dubious that path thorny  overgrown a miserable path a devious path impenetrable
It's a path followed by people of no integrity not a path followed by people of integrity
It's not worthy of you' heshe should hold the mind in check with regard to ideas cognizable via the intellect
Suppose that corn had ripened and the watchman was heedless
A corneating ox invading the corn to eat it would intoxicate itself as much as it liked
In the same way an uninstructed runofthemill person not exercising restraint with regard to the six media of sensual contact intoxicates himself with the five strings of sensuality as much as he likes
Now suppose that corn had ripened and the watchman was heedful
The corneating ox would invade the corn to eat it but then the watchman would grab it firmly by the muzzle
Having grabbed it firmly by the muzzle he would pin it down by the forehead
Having pinned it down by the forehead he would give it a sound thrashing with a stick
Having given it a sound thrashing with a stick he would let it go
A second time A third time the corneating ox would invade the corn to eat it but then the watchman would grab it firmly by the muzzle
Having grabbed it firmly by the muzzle he would pin it down by the forehead
Having pinned it down by the forehead he would give it a sound thrashing with a stick
Having given it a sound thrashing with a stick he would let it go
As a result the corneating ox  regardless of whether it went to the village or to the wilds was standing still or lying down  wouldn't invade the corn again because it would recall the earlier taste it got of the stick
In the same way when a monk's mind is held back thoroughly held back from the six media of sensory contact his mind settles inwardly grows steady unified  concentrated
Suppose there were a king or king's minister who had never heard the sound of a lute before
He might hear the sound of a lute and say 'What my good men is that sound  so delightful so tantalizing so intoxicating so ravishing so enthralling' They would say 'That sire is called a lute whose sound is so delightful so tantalizing so intoxicating so ravishing so enthralling' Then he would say 'Go  fetch me that lute' They would fetch the lute and say 'Here sire is the lute whose sound is so delightful so tantalizing so intoxicating so ravishing so enthralling' He would say 'Enough of your lute
Fetch me just the sound' Then they would say 'This lute sire is made of numerous components a great many components
It's through the activity of numerous components that it sounds that is in dependence on the body the skin the neck the frame the strings the bridge and the appropriate human effort
Thus it is that this lute  made of numerous components a great many components  sounds through the activity of numerous components'
Then the king would split the lute into ten pieces a hundred pieces
Having split the lute into ten pieces a hundred pieces he would shave it to splinters
Having shaved it to splinters he would burn it in a fire
Having burned it in a fire he would reduce it to ashes
Having reduced it to ashes he would winnow it before a high wind or let it be washed away by a swiftflowing stream
He would then say 'A sorry thing this lute  whatever a lute may be  by which people have been so thoroughly tricked  deceived'
In the same way a monk investigates form however far form may go
He investigates feeling perception fabrications consciousness however far consciousness may go
As he is investigating form feeling perception fabrications consciousness however far consciousness may go any thoughts of 'me' or 'mine' or 'I am' do not occur to him
A certain monk visited another monk and said Tell me friend how does a monk's vision become fully purified
Friend when a monk fully comprehends as they really are the arising and passing away of the six spheres of contact to that extent his vision becomes fully purified
But that monk was dissatisfied with the other's answer so he went to another monk
Friend when a monk fully comprehends as they really are the arising and passing away of the five groups of clinging to that extent his vision becomes fully purified
But that monk was dissatisfied with the other's answer and he went to another monk
Friend when a monk fully comprehends as they really are the arising and passing away of the four great elements to that extent his vision becomes fully purified
But that monk was dissatisfied with the other's answer so he went to another monk
Friend when a monk fully comprehends as it really is that whatever is of a nature to arise is bound to pass away to that extent his vision becomes fully purified
But that monk was dissatisfied with the other's answer and he went to the Blessed One
Suppose monk a man had never seen a 'what's it' tree
So he went to someone who had seen one and said 'Tell me good sir what does a what's it tree look like' The other man replied 'Well now a what's it tree is sort of blackish like a burnt stump' But that man was not long satisfied with this answer so he went to another man 'Well now a what's it tree is sort of reddish like a lump of meat' But that man was not long satisfied with this answer so he went to another man 'Well now a what's it tree is stripped of its bark with burst pods rather like an acacia' But that man was not long satisfied with this answer so he went to another man 'Well now a what's it tree has very thick leaves
It gives close shade like a banyan' So for a while he sees the 'what's it' tree as that man sees it
In the same way monk according to the way the vision of these wise monks has become purified so they explain it each according to his disposition
It is monk just like some king's bordercity with strong walls and arches and with six gates
And there is a wise skilled and experienced gatekeeper who keeps out the unknown and admits the known
From the east there come a swift pair of messengers and they say to the gatekeeper 'Where is the lord of this city'  'He is over there sirs at the crossroads in the center' Then the two messengers take a truthful report to the lord of the city and return the way they came

I have given you a parable monk and so that you can understand it this is the explanation 'The city' is a name for the body composed of the four great elements born of mother and father an accumulation of rice and gruel impermanent subject to abrasion dissolution and disintegration
'The six gates' denote the six internal sensespheres
'The gatekeeper' denotes mindfulness
'The two swift messengers' denote calm and insight
'The lord of the city' denotes consciousness
'The crossroads at the center' denotes the four great elements the earthelement the waterelement the fireelement the airelement
'The truthful report' denotes Nibbaana
'The way they came' monk denotes the Noble Eightfold Path that is to say Right View Right Thought Right Speech Right Action Right Livelihood Right Effort Right Mindfulness Right Concentration
A certain monk went to another monk and on arrival said to him To what extent my friend is a monk's vision said to be wellpurified
When a monk discerns as it actually is the origination  passing away of the six media of sensory contact my friend it is to that extent that his vision is said to be wellpurified
The first monk dissatisfied with the other monk's answer to his question went to still another monk and on arrival said to him To what extent my friend is a monk's vision said to be wellpurified
When a monk discerns as it actually is the origination  passing away of the five clingingaggregates my friend it is to that extent that his vision is said to be wellpurified
The first monk dissatisfied with this monk's answer to his question went to still another monk and on arrival said to him To what extent my friend is a monk's vision said to be wellpurified
When a monk discerns as it actually is the origination  passing away of the four great elements my friend it is to that extent that his vision is said to be wellpurified
The first monk dissatisfied with this monk's answer to his question went to still another monk and on arrival said to him To what extent my friend is a monk's vision said to be wellpurified
When a monk discerns as it actually is that whatever is subject to origination is all subject to cessation my friend it is to that extent that his vision is said to be wellpurified
The first monk dissatisfied with this monk's answer to his question then went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side
As he was sitting there he 
Monk it's as if there were a man who had never seen a riddle tree
He would go to another man who had seen one and on arrival would say to him 'What my good man is a riddle tree like
The other would say 'A riddle tree is black my good man like a burnt stump' For at the time he saw it that's what the riddle tree was like
Then the first man dissatisfied with the other man's answer went to still another man who had seen a riddle tree and on arrival said to him 'What my good man is a riddle tree like'
The other would say 'A riddle tree is red my good man like a lump of meat' For at the time he saw it that's what the riddle tree was like
Then the first man dissatisfied with this man's answer went to still another man who had seen a riddle tree and on arrival said to him 'What my good man is a riddle tree like'
The other would say 'A riddle tree is stripped of its bark my good man and has burst pods like an acacia tree' For at the time he saw it that's what the riddle tree was like
Then the first man dissatisfied with this man's answer went to still another man who had seen a riddle tree and on arrival said to him 'What my good man is a riddle tree like'
The other would say 'A riddle tree has thick foliage my good man and gives a dense shade like a banyan' For at the time he saw it that's what the riddle tree was like
In the same way monk however those intelligent men of integrity were focused when their vision became well purified is the way in which they answered
Suppose monk that there were a royal frontier fortress with strong walls  ramparts and six gates
In it would be a wise experienced intelligent gatekeeper to keep out those he didn't know and to let in those he did
A swift pair of messengers coming from the east would say to the gatekeeper 'Where my good man is the commander of this fortress' He would say 'There he is sirs sitting in the central square' The swift pair of messengers delivering their accurate report to the commander of the fortress would then go back by the route by which they had come
Then a swift pair of messengers coming from the west the north the south would say to the gatekeeper 'Where my good man is the commander of this fortress' He would say 'There he is sirs sitting in the central square' The swift pair of messengers delivering their accurate report to the commander of the fortress would then go back by the route by which they had come
I have given you this simile monk to convey a message
The message is this The fortress stands for this body  composed of four elements born of mother  father nourished with rice  barley gruel subject to constant rubbing  abrasion to breaking  falling apart
The six gates stand for the six internal sense media
The gatekeeper stands for mindfulness
The swift pair of messengers stands for tranquillity and insight
The commander of the fortress stands for consciousness
The central square stands for the four great elements the earthproperty the liquidproperty the fireproperty  the windproperty
The accurate report stands for Unbinding
The route by which they had come stands for the noble eightfold path right view right resolve right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness right concentration
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Savatthi in Jeta's Grove
Then he addressed the monks Monks suppose there were four vipers of utmost heat  horrible venom
Then a man would come along  desiring life desiring not to die desiring happiness  loathing pain  and people would tell him 'Good man these four vipers of utmost heat  horrible venom are yours
Time after time they must be lifted up time after time they must be bathed time after time they must be fed time after time put to rest
And if any of these vipers ever gets angered with you then you will meet with death or deathlike suffering
Do what you think should be done'
Then the man  afraid of the four vipers of utmost heat  horrible venom  would flee this way or that
They would tell him 'Good man there are five enemy executioners chasing right on your heels Wherever we see him we'll kill him right on the spot Do what you think should be done'
Then the man  afraid of the four vipers of utmost heat  horrible venom afraid of the five enemy executioners  would flee this way or that
They would tell him 'Good man there is a sixth executioner a fellowtraveler chasing right on your heels with upraised sword Wherever I see him I'll kill him right on the spot Do what you think should be done'
Then the man  afraid of the four vipers of utmost heat  horrible venom afraid of the five enemy executioners afraid of the sixth fellowtraveling executioner with upraised sword  would flee this way or that
He would see an empty village
Whatever house he entered would be abandoned void  empty as he entered it
Whatever pot he grabbed hold of would be abandoned void  empty as he grabbed hold of it
They would tell him 'Good man right now villageplundering bandits are entering this empty village
Do what you think should be done'
Then the man  afraid of the four vipers of utmost heat  horrible venom afraid of the five enemy executioners afraid of the sixth fellowtraveling executioner with upraised sword afraid of the villageplundering bandits  would flee this way or that
He would see a great expanse of water with the near shore dubious  risky the further shore secure  free from risk but with neither a ferryboat nor a bridge going from this shore to the other
The thought would occur to him 'Here is this great expanse of water with the near shore dubious  risky the further shore secure  free from risk but with neither a ferryboat nor a bridge going from this shore to the other
What if I were to gather grass twigs branches  leaves and having bound them together to make a raft were to cross over to safety on the other shore in dependence on the raft making an effort with my hands  feet' Then the man having gathered grass twigs branches  leaves having bound them together to make a raft would cross over to safety on the other shore in dependence on the raft making an effort with his hands  feet
Crossed over having gone to the other shore he would stand on high ground a brahman
Monks I have made this simile to convey a meaning
Here the meaning is this 'The four vipers of utmost heat  horrible venom' stands for the four great existents the earth property the liquid property the fireproperty  the wind property
'The five enemy executioners' stands for the five clingingaggregates the form clingingaggregate the feeling clingingaggregate the perception clingingaggregate the fabrications clingingaggregate the consciousness clingingaggregate
'The sixth fellowtraveling executioner with upraised sword' stands for passion  delight
'The empty village' stands for the six internal sense media
If a wise competent intelligent person examines them from the point of view of the eye they appear abandoned void  empty
If he examines them from the point of view of the ear the nose the tongue the body the intellect they appear abandoned void  empty
'The villageplundering bandits' stands for the six external sensemedia
The eye is attacked by agreeable  disagreeable forms
The ear is attacked by agreeable  disagreeable sounds
The nose is attacked by agreeable  disagreeable aromas
The tongue is attacked by agreeable  disagreeable flavors
The body is attacked by agreeable  disagreeable tactile sensations
The intellect is attacked by agreeable  disagreeable ideas
'The great expanse of water' stands for the fourfold flood the flood of sensuality the flood of becoming the flood of views  the flood of ignorance
'The near shore dubious  risky' stands for selfidentification
'The further shore secure and free from risk' stands for Unbinding
'The raft' stands for just this noble eightfold path right view right resolve right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness right concentration
'Making an effort with hands  feet' stands for the arousing of persistence
'Crossed over having gone to the other shore he would stand on high ground a brahman' stands for the arahant

On one occasion Ven
Ananda and Ven
Udayin were staying near Kosambi in Ghosita's Park
Then in the evening Ven
Udayin emerged from his seclusion and went to Ven
Ananda and exchanged courteous greetings with him
After an exchange of friendly greetings  courtesies he sat to one side
As he was sitting there he said to Ven
Ananda In many ways the body has been pointed out revealed and announced by the Blessed One 'For this reason the body is notself
Can consciousness in the same way be declared taught described set forth revealed explained  made plain 'For this reason consciousness is notself'
It can Doesn't eyeconsciousness arise in dependence on the eye  forms
Yes friend
And if the cause  reason for the arising of eyeconsciousness were to cease totally everywhere totally in every way without remainder would eyeconsciousness be discerned
No friend
It's in this way friend that consciousness has been pointed out revealed and announced by the Blessed One 'For this reason consciousness is notself'
Doesn't earconsciousness arise in dependence on the ear  sounds
Doesn't noseconsciousness arise in dependence on the nose  aromas
Doesn't tongueconsciousness arise in dependence on the tongue  flavors
Doesn't bodyconsciousness arise in dependence on the body  tactile sensations
Doesn't intellectconsciousness arise in dependence on the intellect  ideas
Yes friend
And if the cause  reason for the arising of intellectconsciousness were to cease totally everywhere totally in every way without remainder would intellectconsciousness be discerned
No friend
It's in this way friend that consciousness has been pointed out revealed and announced by the Blessed One 'For this reason consciousness is notself'
It's just as if a man going around wanting heartwood seeking heartwood searching for heartwood would take a sharp ax and enter a forest
There he would see a large banana tree trunk straight young without shoots
He would cut off the roof cut off the crown and unfurl the coil of the stem
There he wouldn't even find softwood much less heartwood
In the same way a monk assumes neither a self nor anything pertaining to a self in the six spheres of sensory contact
Assuming in this way he doesn't cling to anything in the world
Not clinging he is not agitated
Unagitated he is totally unbound right within
He discerns that 'Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task done
There is nothing further for this world'
How is it friend Is the eye the fetter of visual objects or are visual objects the fetter of the eye Is the tongue the fetter of tastes or are tastes the fetter of the tongue Is mind the fetter of thoughts or are thoughts the fetter of mind
It is not friend that the eye is the fetter of visual objects nor are visual objects the fetter of the eye but that based on these two desire and lust arise and they are the fetter it is not that the tongue is the fetter of tastes that mind is the fetter of thoughts but that based on these two desire and lust arise and they are the fetter
It is just as if there were a black and a white ox bound together by one rope or one yoketie would it be right to say that the black ox is the fetter of the white one or the white one of the black
No indeed friend
Neither the black nor the white ox is the fetter of the other but they are bound together by the same rope or the same yoketie that is the fetter
So too friend the eye is not the fetter of objects nor are objects the fetter of eye the tongue the mind but based on these two desire and lust arise and they are the fetter
If friend the eye were the fetter of visual objects or visual objects were the fetter of the eye if the tongue if the mind were the fetter of thoughts or thoughts were the fetter of mind then this holy life would not be discernible for the utter destruction of suffering
But since it is not case therefore this holy life is discernible for the utter destruction of suffering
Thus it should be understood that the eye is not the fetter the tongue the mind but that based on these two desire and lust arise and they are the fetter
The Blessed One friend has eyes he sees objects with the eye
But in the Blessed One there is no desire or lust
The Blessed One's heart is completely liberated
The Blessed One has a tongue a mind he knows thoughts with the mind
But in the Blessed One there is no desire or lust
The Blessed One's heart is completely liberated
Thus it should be understood that the eye is not the fetter the tongue the mind but that based on these two desire and lust arise and they are the fetter
Once Ven
Sariputta and Ven
Maha Kotthita were living near Varanasi at Isipatana in the Deer Park
Then Ven
Maha Kotthita in the late afternoon left his seclusion and went to Ven
Sariputta
On arrival he exchanged courteous greetings with him
After an exchange of friendly greetings  courtesies he sat to one side
As he was sitting there he said to Ven
Sariputta Now tell me friend Sariputta is the eye the fetter of forms or are forms the fetter of the eye
Is the ear Is the nose Is the tongue Is the body Is the intellect the fetter of ideas or are ideas the fetter of the intellect
No my friend
The eye is not the fetter of forms nor are forms the fetter of the eye
Whatever desire  passion arises in dependence on the two of them That is the fetter there
The ear is not the fetter of sounds The nose is not the fetter of aromas The tongue is not the fetter of flavors The body is not the fetter of tactile sensations The intellect is not the fetter of ideas nor are ideas the fetter of the intellect
Whatever desire  passion arises in dependence on the two of them That is the fetter there
Suppose that a black ox and a white ox were joined with a single collar or yoke
If someone were to say 'The black ox is the fetter of the white ox the white ox is the fetter of the black'  speaking this way would he be speaking rightly
No my friend
The black ox is not the fetter of the white ox nor is the white ox the fetter of the black
The single collar or yoke by which they are joined That is the fetter there
In the same way the eye is not the fetter of forms nor are forms the fetter of the eye
Whatever desire  passion arises in dependence on the two of them That is the fetter there
The ear is not the fetter of sounds The nose is not the fetter of aromas The tongue is not the fetter of flavors The body is not the fetter of tactile sensations The intellect is not the fetter of ideas nor are ideas the fetter of the intellect
Whatever desire  passion arises in dependence on the two of them That is the fetter there
If the eye were the fetter of forms or if forms were the fetter of the eye then this holy life for the right ending of stress  suffering would not be proclaimed
But because whatever desire  passion arises in dependence on the two of them is the fetter there that is why this holy life for the right ending of stress  suffering is proclaimed
If the ear were the fetter
If the nose were the fetter
If the tongue were the fetter
If the body were the fetter
If the intellect were the fetter of ideas or if ideas were the fetter of the intellect then this holy life for the right ending of stress  suffering would not be proclaimed
But because whatever desire  passion arises in dependence on the two of them is the fetter there that is why this holy life for the right ending of stress  suffering is proclaimed
And through this line of reasoning one may know how the eye is not the fetter of forms nor are forms the fetter of the eye but whatever desire  passion arises in dependence on the two of them That is the fetter there
The ear is not the fetter of sounds The nose is not the fetter of aromas The tongue is not the fetter of flavors The body is not the fetter of tactile sensations The intellect is not the fetter of ideas nor are ideas the fetter of the intellect but whatever desire  passion arises in dependence on the two of them That is the fetter there
There is an eye in the Blessed One
The Blessed One sees forms with the eye
There is no desire or passion in the Blessed One
The Blessed One is wellreleased in mind
There is an ear in the Blessed One
There is a nose in the Blessed One
There is a tongue in the Blessed One
There is a body in the Blessed One
There is an intellect in the Blessed One
The Blessed One knows ideas with the intellect
There is no desire or passion in the Blessed One
The Blessed One is wellreleased in mind
It is through this line of reasoning that one may know how the eye is not the fetter of forms nor are forms the fetter of the eye but whatever desire  passion arises in dependence on the two of them That is the fetter there
The ear is not the fetter of sounds The nose is not the fetter of aromas The tongue is not the fetter of flavors The body is not the fetter of tactile sensations The intellect is not the fetter of ideas nor are ideas the fetter of the intellect but whatever desire  passion arises in dependence on the two of them That is the fetter there
Is there monks any criterion whereby a monk apart from faith apart from persuasion apart from inclination apart from rational speculation apart from delight in views and theories could affirm the attainment of enlightenment 'Birth is destroyed the holy life has been accomplished what was to be done is done there is no further living in this world'
For us Lord all things have the Blessed One as their root their guide their refuge
It would be well Lord if the meaning of these words were to be made clear by the Blessed One
Hearing it from the Blessed One the monks will remember it
There is such a criterion monks whereby a monk could affirm the attainment of enlightenment What is that method
In this monks a monk seeing an object with the eye recognizes within himself the presence of lust hatred or delusion knowing 'Lust hatred or delusion is present in me' or he recognizes the absence of these things knowing 'There is no lust hatred or delusion present in me' Now monks as regards that recognition of the presence or absence of these things within him are these matters to be perceived by faith by persuasion by inclination by rational speculation by delight in views and theories
No indeed Lord
Are not these matters to be perceived by the eye of wisdom
Indeed Lord
Then monks this is the criterion whereby a monk apart from faith apart from persuasion apart from inclination apart from rational speculation apart from delight in views and theories could affirm the attainment of enlightenment 'Birth is destroyed the holy life has been accomplished what was to be done is done there is no further living in this world'
Translator's note This sutta is based on a play on words
In everyday Pali the term consummate in faculties is used to describe a person whose beauty and health are inspiring
Here the Buddha gives a different meaning to the term
Then a certain monk went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side
As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One 'Consummate in faculties consummate in faculties' it is said
To what extent is one consummate in faculties
If a monk while keeping track of arising  passing away with regard to the eyefaculty becomes disenchanted with the eyefaculty if while keeping track of arising  passing away with regard to the earfaculty the nosefaculty the tonguefaculty the body faculty the intellectfaculty he becomes disenchanted with the intellectfaculty and disenchanted he becomes dispassionate through dispassion he is fully released with full release there is the knowledge 'Fully released' he discerns that 'Birth is depleted the holy life fulfilled the task done
There is nothing further for this world' it is to this extent that one is consummate in faculties
Monks I will teach you about new kamma and old kamma about the ceasing of kamma and the path that leads to the ceasing of kamma
Listen well pay close attention and I will speak
What monks is old kamma
The eye monks is to be regarded as old kamma brought into existence and created by volition forming a basis for feeling
This monks is called 'old kamma'
And what monks is new kamma
The action one performs now by body speech and mind
This monks is called 'new kamma'
When monks by ceasing actions of body speech and mind one touches liberation this monks is called 'the ceasing of kamma'
And what monks is the path that leads to the ceasing of kamma
It is the Noble Eightfold Path namely Right View Right Thought Right Speech Right Action Right Livelihood Right Effort Right Mindfulness Right Concentration
This monks is called 'the path that leads to the ceasing of kamma'
Whatever monks a teacher ought to do out of compassion for the profit of his disciples that I have done having compassion for you
Here monks are the roots of trees
Here are lonely places
Meditate monks
Do not be slothful have no subsequent regrets
Thus we charge you
It's a gain for you monks a great gain that you've gained the opportunity to live the holy life
I have seen a hell named 'Six Spheres of Contact' Whatever form one sees there with the eye is undesirable never desirable displeasing never pleasing disagreeable never agreeable
Whatever sound one hears there with the ear Whatever aroma one smells there with the nose Whatever flavor one tastes there with the tongue Whatever tactile sensation one touches there with the body Whatever idea one cognizes there with the intellect is undesirable never desirable displeasing never pleasing disagreeable never agreeable
It's a gain for you monks a great gain that you've gained the opportunity to live the holy life
I have seen a heaven named 'Six Spheres of Contact' Whatever form one sees there with the eye is desirable never undesirable pleasing never displeasing agreeable never disagreeable
Whatever sound one hears there with the ear Whatever aroma one smells there with the nose Whatever flavor one tastes there with the tongue Whatever tactile sensation one touches there with the body Whatever idea one cognizes there with the intellect is desirable never undesirable pleasing never displeasing agreeable never disagreeable
It's a gain for you monks a great gain that you've gained the opportunity to live the holy life 
You said 'with sensedoors unguarded' Venerable Kaccaana
In what way is one 'with sensedoors unguarded'
In this case Brahman someone seeing objects with the eye is attracted to things that are pleasing and repelled by things that are unpleasing
He dwells without mindfulness and his mind is restricted
He does not experience the emancipation of the heart through wisdom
And so those evil and unwholesome states do not cease without remainder
Hearing a sound smelling a scent tasting a flavor touching an object cognizing a mindobject he is attracted by things that are pleasing and repelled by things that are unpleasing And so those evil and unwholesome states do not cease without remainder
That is how one is 'with sensedoors unguarded' Now in what way is one 'with sensedoors guarded'
In this case Brahman a monk seeing objects with the eye is not attracted to things that are pleasing and not repelled by things that are unpleasing
He dwells with mindfulness present and his mind is unbounded
Thus he experiences the emancipation of the heart through wisdom and so those evil and unwholesome states that arise cease without remainder
In this way one is 'with sensedoors guarded'
Monks I will teach you new  old kamma the cessation of kamma and the path of practice leading to the cessation of kamma
Listen and pay close attention
I will speak
Now what monks is old kamma
The eye is to be seen as old kamma fabricated  willed capable of being felt
The ear The nose The tongue The body The intellect is to be seen as old kamma fabricated  willed capable of being felt
This is called old kamma
And what is new kamma
Whatever kamma one does now with the body with speech or with the intellect This is called new kamma
And what is the cessation of kamma
Whoever touches the release that comes from the cessation of bodily kamma verbal kamma  mental kamma This is called the cessation of kamma
And what is the path of practice leading to the cessation of kamma
Just this noble eightfold path right view right resolve right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness right concentration
This is called the path of practice leading to the cessation of kamma
So monks I have taught you new  old kamma the cessation of kamma and the path of practice leading to the cessation of kamma
Whatever a teacher should do  seeking the welfare of his disciples out of sympathy for them  that have I done for you
Over there are the roots of trees over there empty dwellings
Practice jhana monks
Don't be heedless
Don't later fall into regret
This is our message to you

How can it come about Bhaaradvaaja depending on what is it that these young monks youthful blackhaired with the bloom of youth in the prime of life never having enjoyed the pleasure of the senses can practice the holy life fully and perfectly to the end of their days
It has been said sire by the Blessed One who knows and sees the Arahant the Fully Selfenlightened One 'Come monks whatever woman is a mother think of her just as a mother whatever woman is a sister think of her just as a sister whatever woman is a daughter think of her just as a daughter
That is how these young monks can practice the holy life to the end of their days' But Bhaaradvaaja the heart is fickle
It may well be that at times thoughts of desire arise towards those they think of just as mothers just as sisters just as daughters
Is there any other cause any other reason whereby these young monks youthful and blackhaired can practice the holy life to the end of their days
It has been said sire by the Blessed One 'Come monks contemplate this body upwards from the soles of the feet downwards from the top of the head bounded by the skin full of manifold impurities
There are in this body hair of the head hair of the body nails teeth skin flesh sinews bones marrow kidneys heart liver pleura spleen lungs intestines mesentery bowels feces bile phlegm pus blood sweat fat tears tallow saliva synovic fluid urine
That is how these young monks can practice the holy life to the end of their days' Well Bhaaradvaaja for those monks who train the body morals mind and insight that is easy but for those who do not it is difficult
Sometimes when a man thinks 'I will regard this as repulsive' he comes to think of it as attractive
Is there any other cause any other reason whereby those young monks can practice the holy life to the end of their days
It has been said sire by the Exalted One 'Come monks guard the doors of your sensefaculties
Seeing an object with the eye do not seize hold of either its general appearance or its details
Because anyone dwelling with the eyefaculty uncontrolled could be overwhelmed by cupidity and dejection evil and unwholesome states of mind therefore practice to control the eyefaculty guard it and gain control over it
That is how these young monks can practice the holy life to the end of their days' Wonderful good Bhaaradvaaja it is marvelous how well spoken are the words of the Blessed One I myself good Bhaaradvaaja whenever I enter the inner parts of my palace with body speech and mind unguarded with mindfulness unestablished with sensefaculties uncontrolled am at such times overcome with lustful thoughts
But when I do so with body speech and mind guarded with mindfulness established with faculties controlled then lustful thoughts do not overcome me
Friend Saariputta my companion has renounced the training and reverted to the lower life
This is what happens friend with one whose sensedoors are unguarded who is immoderate in eating and not given to wakefulness
As long as he lives it will be impossible for him to maintain the holy life in all its fullness and purity
But if a monk guards his sensedoors is moderate in eating and given to watchfulness then it will be possible for him as long as he lives to maintain the holy life in all its fullness and purity
And how friend does one guard the sensedoors
In this a monk seeing an object with the eye does not seize hold of either its general appearance or its details
Because anyone dwelling with the eyefaculty uncontrolled could be overwhelmed by cupidity and dejection evil and unwholesome states of mind therefore he practices to control the eyefaculty guards it and gains control over it
So one guards the sensedoors
And how friend is one moderate in eating
In this a monk takes his food properly considering not for sport for intoxication for adornment or beautification but purely for the maintenance and nourishment of this body for keeping it unharmed as an aid to the practice of the holy life thinking 'I shall put an end to the old feeling and not produce any new feeling
Thus I shall keep going incur no fault and live at ease' That friend is how one is moderate in eating
And how friend is one given to watchfulness
In this a monk walks up and down by day and then sits thus cleansing his mind from obstructive states
of the night In the middle watch of the night lying on his right side he adopts the lion posture resting one foot on the other mindful and clearly aware with his thoughts fixed on rising
In the last watch of the night he rises walks up and down and then sits thus cleansing his mind from obstructive states
That friend is how one is given to watchfulness
Therefore this is how you should train yourselves 'We will guard the doors of our senses be moderate in eating and given to watchfulness'
This friend is the way for you to train yourself
Whatever is not yours let go of it
Your letting go of it will be for your longterm happiness  benefit
And what is not yours
The eye is not yours let go of it
Your letting go of it will be for your longterm happiness  benefit
Forms are not yours Eyeconsciousness is not yours Eyecontact is not yours Whatever arises in dependence on eyecontact experienced either as pleasure as pain or as neitherpleasurenorpain that too is not yours let go of it
Your letting go of it will be for your longterm happiness  benefit
The ear is not yours let go of it
The nose is not yours let go of it
The tongue is not yours let go of it
The body is not yours let go of it
The intellect is not yours let go of it
Your letting go of it will be for your longterm happiness  benefit
Ideas are not yours Intellectconsciousness is not yours Intellectcontact is not yours Whatever arises in dependence on intellectcontact experienced either as pleasure as pain or as neitherpleasurenorpain that too is not yours let go of it
Your letting go of it will be for your longterm happiness  benefit
Suppose a person were to gather or burn or do as he likes with the grass twigs branches  leaves here in Jeta's Grove
Would the thought occur to you 'It's us that this person is gathering burning or doing with as he likes'
No lord
Why is that
Because those things are not our self nor do they pertain to our self
In the same way monks the eye is not yours let go of it
Your letting go of it will be for your longterm happiness  benefit The ear The nose The tongue The body The intellect is not yours let go of it
Your letting go of it will be for your longterm happiness  benefit Whatever arises in dependence on intellectcontact experienced either as pleasure as pain or as neitherpleasurenorpain that too is not yours let go of it
Your letting go of it will be for your longterm happiness  benefit

Develop concentration monks
A concentrated monk discerns things as they actually are present
And what does he discern as it actually is present
He discerns as it actually is present that 'The eye is inconstant' 'Forms are inconstant' 'Eyeconsciousness is inconstant' 'Eyecontact is inconstant' 'Whatever arises in dependence on eyecontact experienced either as pleasure as pain or as neitherpleasurenorpain that too is inconstant'
He discerns as it actually is present that 'The ear is inconstant' 'The nose is inconstant' 'The tongue is inconstant' 'The body is inconstant
He discerns as it actually is present that 'The intellect is inconstant' 'Ideas are inconstant' 'Intellectconsciousness is inconstant' 'Intellectcontact is inconstant' 'Whatever arises in dependence on intellectcontact experienced either as pleasure as pain or as neitherpleasurenorpain that too is inconstant'
So develop concentration monks
A concentrated monk discerns things as they actually are present
It's in dependence on a pair that consciousness comes into play
And how does consciousness come into play in dependence on a pair
In dependence on the eye  forms there arises eyeconsciousness
The eye is inconstant changeable of a nature to become otherwise
Forms are inconstant changeable of a nature to become otherwise
Thus this pair is both wavering  fluctuating  inconstant changeable of a nature to become otherwise
Eyeconsciousness is inconstant changeable of a nature to become otherwise
Whatever is the cause the requisite condition for the arising of eyeconsciousness that is inconstant changeable of a nature to become otherwise
Having arisen in dependence on an inconstant factor how could eyeconsciousness be constant
The coming together the meeting the convergence of these three phenomena is eyecontact
Whatever is the cause the requisite condition for the arising of eyecontact that is inconstant changeable of a nature to become otherwise
Having arisen in dependence on an inconstant factor how could eyecontact be constant
Contacted one feels
Contacted one intends
Contacted one perceives
These phenomena are both wavering  fluctuating  inconstant changeable of a nature to become otherwise
This is how it's in dependence on a pair that eyeconsciousness comes into play
In dependence on the ear  sounds there arises earconsciousness
In dependence on the nose  aromas there arises noseconsciousness
In dependence on the tongue  flavors there arises tongueconsciousness
In dependence on the body  tactile sensations there arises bodyconsciousness
In dependence on the intellect  ideas there arises intellectconsciousness
The intellect is inconstant changeable of a nature to become otherwise
Ideas are inconstant changeable of a nature to become otherwise
Thus this pair is both wavering  fluctuating  inconstant changeable of a nature to become otherwise
Intellectconsciousness is inconstant changeable of a nature to become otherwise
Whatever is the cause the requisite condition for the arising of intellectconsciousness that is inconstant changeable of a nature to become otherwise
Having arisen in dependence on an inconstant factor how could intellectconsciousness be constant
The coming together the meeting the convergence of these three phenomena is intellectcontact
Whatever is the cause the requisite condition for the arising of intellectcontact that is inconstant changeable of a nature to become otherwise
Having arisen in dependence on an inconstant factor how could intellectcontact be constant
Contacted one feels
Contacted one intends
Contacted one perceives
These phenomena are both wavering  fluctuating  inconstant changeable of a nature to become otherwise
This is how it's in dependence on a pair that intellectconsciousness comes into play
It would be well for me Lord if the Blessed One would teach me briefly a doctrine so that having heard it I might dwell alone in seclusion unwearied ardent and resolute
Well now Maalunkyaputta what am I to say to the younger monks if you a frail aged venerable man far gone in years at the end of your life ask for instruction in brief
What do you think Maalunkyaputta
Objects cognizable by the eye not seen which you have not seen before which you do not see now and do not wish to see  have you any desire lust and fondness for them
No indeed Lord
Well then Maalunkyaputta in things seen heard sensed cognized in the seen there will only be the seen in the heard only the heard in the sensed only the sensed in the cognized only the cognized Then Maalunkyaputta there will be no 'thereby' for you
Having no 'thereby' you have no 'there' Having no 'there' Maalunkyaputta there is for you neither this world nor the next nor anywhere in between
That in itself is the end of suffering
Indeed Lord I understand in full the meaning of what the Blessed One has stated in brief
Indeed Lord I understand in full the meaning of what the Blessed One has stated in brief
Monks I will teach you about one who dwells in heedlessness and one who dwells in heedfulness
Listen and pay careful attention I will speak
As you say lord the monks responded
The Blessed One said And how does one dwell in heedlessness
When a monk dwells without restraint over the faculty of the eye the mind is stained with forms cognizable via the eye
When the mind is stained there is no joy
There being no joy there is no rapture
There being no rapture there is no serenity
There being no serenity he dwells in suffering
The mind of one who suffers does not become centered
When the mind is uncentered phenomena don't become manifest
When phenomena aren't manifest one is classed simply as one who dwells in heedlessness
When a monk dwells without restraint over the ear nose tongue body
When a monk dwells without restraint over the faculty of the intellect the mind is stained with ideas cognizable via the intellect
When the mind is stained there is no joy
There being no joy there is no rapture
There being no rapture there is no serenity
There being no serenity he dwells in suffering
The mind of one who suffers does not become centered
When the mind is uncentered phenomena don't become manifest
When phenomena aren't manifest one is classed simply as one who dwells in heedlessness
This is how one dwells in heedlessness
And how does one dwell in heedfulness
When a monk dwells with restraint over the faculty of the eye the mind is not stained with forms cognizable via the eye
When the mind is not stained there is joy
There being joy there is rapture
There being rapture there is serenity
There being serenity he dwells in ease
The mind of one at ease becomes centered
When the mind is centered phenomena become manifest
When phenomena are manifest one is classed simply as one who dwells in heedfulness
When a monk dwells with restraint over the ear nose tongue body
When a monk dwells with restraint over the faculty of the intellect the mind is not stained with ideas cognizable via the intellect
When the mind is not stained there is joy
There being joy there is rapture
There being rapture there is serenity
There being serenity he dwells in ease
The mind of one at ease becomes centered
When the mind is centered phenomena become manifest
When phenomena are manifest one is classed simply as one who dwells in heedfulness
This is how one dwells in heedfulness

Translator's note In the following translation the passage in braces is contained in the Thai edition of the Pali canon but not in the PTS edition
Then Ven
Punna went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to the Blessed One sat to one side
As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One It would be good if the Blessed One would teach me the Dhamma in brief so that having heard the Dhamma from the Blessed One I might dwell alone in seclusion heedful ardent  resolute
There are Punna forms cognizable via the eye  agreeable pleasing charming endearing fostering desire enticing
If a monk relishes them welcomes them and remains fastened to them then in him  relishing them welcoming them and remaining fastened to them  there arises delight
From the origination of delight I tell you comes the origination of suffering and stress
There are sounds cognizable via the ear aromas cognizable by the nose flavors cognizable via the tongue tactile sensations cognizable via the body
There are ideas cognizable via the intellect  agreeable pleasing charming endearing fostering desire enticing
If a monk relishes them welcomes them and remains fastened to them then in him  relishing them welcoming them and remaining fastened to them  there arises delight
From the origination of delight I tell you comes the origination of suffering and stress
There are forms cognizable via the eye  agreeable pleasing charming endearing fostering desire enticing
If a monk does not relish them welcome them or remain fastened to them then in him  not relishing them not welcoming them not remaining fastened to them  there arises no delight
From the cessation of delight I tell you comes the cessation of suffering and stress
There are sounds cognizable via the ear aromas cognizable by the nose flavors cognizable via the tongue tactile sensations cognizable via the body
There are ideas cognizable via the intellect  agreeable pleasing charming endearing fostering desire enticing
If a monk does not relish them welcome them or remain fastened to them then in him  not relishing them not welcoming them not remaining fastened to them  there arises no delight
From the cessation of delight I tell you comes the cessation of suffering and stress
By this means Punna you are not far from this doctrine and discipline
When this was said a certain monk said to the Blessed One Here is where I am ill at ease lord for I don't discern as they actually are present the origination the passing away the allure the drawback and the escape from the six spheres of contact
Then what do you think monk
Do you regard that 'The eye is not mine
It is not my self
It is not what I am'
Yes lord
Very good monk
When it is wellseen by you with right discernment that 'The eye is not mine
It is not my self
It is not what I am' then the first sphere of contact will be abandoned by you for the sake of no further becoming in the future
Do you regard that 'The ear is not mine The nose is not mine The tongue is not mine The body is not mine
Do you regard that 'The intellect is not mine
It is not my self
It is not what I am'
Yes lord
Very good monk
When it is wellseen by you with right discernment that 'The intellect is not mine
It is not my self
It is not what I am' then the sixth sphere of contact will be abandoned by you for the sake of no further becoming in the future
Well then Punna
Now that I have instructed you with a brief instruction in which country are you going to live
Lord there is a country called Sunaparanta
I am going to live there
Punna the Sunaparanta people are fierce
They are rough
If they insult and ridicule you what will you think
If they insult and ridicule me I will think 'These Sunaparanta people are civilized very civilized in that they don't hit me with their hands' That is what I will think O Blessed One
That is what I will think O One Wellgone
But if they hit you with their hands what will you think
I will think 'These Sunaparanta people are civilized very civilized in that they don't hit me with a clod' But if they hit you with a clod
I will think 'These Sunaparanta people are civilized very civilized in that they don't hit me with a stick' But if they hit you with a stick
I will think 'These Sunaparanta people are civilized very civilized in that they don't hit me with a knife' But if they hit you with a knife
I will think 'These Sunaparanta people are civilized very civilized in that they don't take my life with a sharp knife' But if they take your life with a sharp knife
If they take my life with a sharp knife I will think 'There are disciples of the Blessed One who  horrified humiliated and disgusted by the body and by life  have sought for an assassin but here I have met my assassin without searching for him' That is what I will think O Blessed One
That is what I will think O One Wellgone
Good Punna very good
Possessing such calm and selfcontrol you are fit to dwell among the Sunaparantans
Now it is time to do as you see fit
Then Ven
Punna delighting and rejoicing in the Blessed One's words rising from his seat bowed down to the Blessed One and left keeping him on his right side
Setting his dwelling in order and taking his robe and bowl he set out for the Sunaparanta country and after wandering stage by stage he arrived there
There he lived
During that Rains retreat he established male and female lay followers in the practice while he realized the three knowledges and then attained total Unbinding
Then a large number of monks went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side
As they were sitting there they said to him Lord the clansman named Punna whom the Blessed One instructed with a brief instruction has died
What is his destination
What is his future state
Monks the clansman Punna was wise
He practiced the Dhamma in accordance with the Dhamma and did not pester me with issues related to the Dhamma
The clansman Punna is totally unbound
This may not be life affirming in the American sense of the word but it does affirm that the arahants have awakened to a release that transcends life and death
And that is the whole point of Dhamma practice
If there were nothing more important than life then life itself would be pointless
Then a certain monk went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side
As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One 'The world the world' it is said
In what respect does the word 'world' apply
Insofar as it disintegrates monk it is called the 'world' Now what disintegrates
The eye disintegrates
Forms disintegrate
Consciousness at the eye disintegrates
Contact at the eye disintegrates
And whatever there is that arises in dependence on contact at the eye  experienced as pleasure pain or neitherpleasurenorpain  that too disintegrates
The ear disintegrates
Sounds disintegrate
The nose disintegrates
Aromas disintegrate
The tongue disintegrates
Tastes disintegrate
The body disintegrates
Tactile sensations disintegrate
The intellect disintegrates
Ideas disintegrate
Consciousness at the intellect consciousness disintegrates
Contact at the intellect disintegrates
And whatever there is that arises in dependence on contact at the intellect  experienced as pleasure pain or neitherpleasurenorpain  that too disintegrates
Insofar as it disintegrates it is called the 'world'
Then a certain monk went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side
As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One
Lord is there any one thing with whose abandoning in a monk ignorance is abandoned and clear knowing arises
Yes monk there is one thing with whose abandoning in a monk ignorance is abandoned and clear knowing arises
What is that one thing
Ignorance monk is the one thing with whose abandoning in a monk ignorance is abandoned and clear knowing arises 
But how does a monk know how does a monk see so that ignorance is abandoned and clear knowing arises
There is the case monk where a monk has heard 'All things are unworthy of attachment' Having heard that all things are unworthy of attachment he directly knows every thing
Directly knowing every thing he comprehends every thing
Comprehending every thing he sees all themes as something separate

He sees the eye as something separate
He sees forms as something separate
He sees eyeconsciousness as something separate
He sees eyecontact as something separate
And whatever arises in dependence on eyecontact  experienced either as pleasure as pain or as neitherpleasurenorpain  that too he sees as something separate
He sees the ear as something separate
He sees the nose as something separate
He sees the tongue as something separate
He sees the body as something separate
He sees the intellect as something separate
He sees ideas as something separate
He sees intellectconsciousness as something separate
He sees intellectcontact as something separate
And whatever arises in dependence on intellectcontact  experienced either as pleasure as pain or as neitherpleasurenorpain  that too he sees as something separate
This is how a monk knows this is how a monk sees so that ignorance is abandoned and clear knowing arises
Then Ven
Ananda went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side
As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One It is said that the world is empty the world is empty lord
In what respect is it said that the world is empty
Insofar as it is empty of a self or of anything pertaining to a self Thus it is said Ananda that the world is empty
And what is empty of a self or of anything pertaining to a self
The eye is empty of a self or of anything pertaining to a self
Forms Eyeconsciousness Eyecontact is empty of a self or of anything pertaining to a self
The ear is empty
The nose is empty
The tongue is empty
The body is empty
The intellect is empty of a self or of anything pertaining to a self
Ideas Intellectconsciousness Intellectcontact is empty of a self or of anything pertaining to a self
Thus it is said that the world is empty

At Savatthi
Then a certain monk went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side
As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One Lord in such and such a dwelling a certain monk  newly ordained not well known  is diseased in pain severely ill
It would be good if the Blessed One would visit the monk out of sympathy for him
Then the Blessed One on hearing the word newly ordained on hearing the word diseased and realizing that the monk was not well known went to him
The monk saw the Blessed One coming from afar and on seeing him stirred in his bed
Then the Blessed One said to him Enough monk
Don't stir in your bed
There are these seats made ready
I will sit down there
The Blessed One sat down on a seat made ready and said to the monk I hope you are getting better monk
I hope you are comfortable
I hope that your pains are lessening and not increasing
I hope that there are signs of their lessening and not of their increasing
I am not getting better lord
I am not comfortable
My extreme pains are increasing not lessening
There are signs of their increasing and not of their lessening
Then I hope you have no anxiety monk
I hope you have no anguish
Yes lord I do have not a small amount of anxiety not a small amount of anguish
I hope you can't fault yourself with regard to your virtue
No lord I can't fault myself with regard to my virtue
Then what are you anxious about
What is your anguish
I understand that the Blessed One has not taught the Dhamma with purity of virtue as its goal
If you understand that I have not taught the Dhamma with purity of virtue as its goal then for what goal do you understand that I have taught the Dhamma
I understand that the Blessed One has taught the Dhamma with total Unbinding through lack of clinging as its goal
Good good monk
It's good that you understand that I have taught the Dhamma with total Unbinding through lack of clinging as its goal for I have taught the Dhamma with total Unbinding through lack of clinging as its goal
What do you think monk Is the eye constant or inconstant
Inconstant lord
And is that which is inconstant easeful or stressful
Stressful lord
And is it fitting to regard what is inconstant stressful subject to change as 'This is mine
This is my self
This is what I am'
No lord
Is the ear constant or inconstant Inconstant lord
Is the nose constant or inconstant Inconstant lord
Is the tongue constant or inconstant Inconstant lord
Is the body constant or inconstant Inconstant lord
What do you think monk Is the intellect constant or inconstant
Inconstant lord
And is that which is inconstant easeful or stressful
Stressful lord
And is it fitting to regard what is inconstant stressful subject to change as 'This is mine
This is my self
This is what I am'
No lord
Seeing thus the instructed disciple of the noble ones grows disenchanted with the eye disenchanted with the ear disenchanted with the nose disenchanted with the tongue disenchanted with the body disenchanted with the intellect
Disenchanted he becomes dispassionate
Through dispassion he is fully released
With full release there is the knowledge 'Fully released' He discerns that 'Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task done
There is nothing further for this world' That is what the Blessed One said
Gratified the monk delighted in the Blessed One's words
And while this explanation was being given the mind of that monk through no clinging was fully released from fermentations
This lesswellknown metta verse has its origins in an ancient probably preBuddhist snake charm
It is taught by the Buddha in the Vinaya in response to his hearing of a monk who perished after being bitten by a snake
The first stanza not translated here extends loving kindness to the four main groups of snake deities
The Buddha tells the monks that if they adequately develop loving kindness to these snake deities they will be free of harm from snake bites
More interesting is the characteristic way in which the Buddha adapts an existing tradition  charms against snake bites  to serve as a vehicle for his own more universal teaching
He expands the cultivation of loving kindness far beyond snakes and reptiles to include insects animals and all human beings
At the same time he emphasizes the interdependent thinking that one's best protection against being harmed is to do no harm oneself to others
The word metta has a more unique scope than even that most protean of English words  love  can easily express
Except for the fact that it throws off the eightsyllable meter of the verse one can easily substitute words such as friendship friendliness deep unselfish caring or loving kindness
Now at that time a certain monk was sick with dysentery
He lay fouled in his own urine  excrement
Then the Blessed One on an inspection tour of the lodgings with Ven
Ananda as his attendant went to that monk's dwelling and on arrival saw the monk lying fouled in his own urine  excrement
On seeing him he went to the monk and said What is your sickness monk
I have dysentery O Blessed One
But do you have an attendant
No O Blessed One
Then why don't the monks attend to you
I don't do anything for the monks lord which is why they don't attend to me
Then the Blessed One addressed Ven
Ananda Go fetch some water Ananda
We will wash this monk
As you say lord Ven
Ananda replied and he fetched some water
The Blessed One sprinkled water on the monk and Ven
Ananda washed him off
Then  with the Blessed One taking the monk by the head and Ven
Ananda taking him by the feet  they lifted him up and placed him on a bed
Then the Blessed One from this cause because of this event had the monks assembled and asked them Is there a sick monk in that dwelling over there
Yes O Blessed One there is
And what is his sickness
He has dysentery O Blessed One
But does he have an attendant
No O Blessed One
Then why don't the monks attend to him
He doesn't do anything for the monks lord which is why they don't attend to him
Monks you have no mother you have no father who might tend to you
If you don't tend to one another who then will tend to you
Whoever would tend to me should tend to the sick
If one's preceptor is present the preceptor should tend to one as long as life lasts and should stay until one's recovery
If one's teacher is present the teacher should tend to one as long as life lasts and should stay until one's recovery
If one's student is present the student should tend to one as long as life lasts and should stay until one's recovery
If one's apprentice is present the apprentice should tend to one as long as life lasts and should stay until one's recovery
If one who is a fellow student of one's preceptor is present the fellow student of one's preceptor should tend to one as long as life lasts and should stay until one's recovery
If one who is a fellow apprentice of one's teacher is present the fellow apprentice of one's teacher should tend to one as long as life lasts and should stay until one's recovery
If no preceptor teacher student apprentice fellow student of one's preceptor or fellow apprentice of one's teacher is present the sangha should tend to one
If it does not incur an offense of wrongdoing
A sick person endowed with five qualities is hard to tend to he does what is not amenable to his cure he does not know the proper amount in things amenable to his cure he does not take his medicine he does not tell his symptoms as they actually are present to the nurse desiring his welfare saying that they are worse when they are worse improving when they are improving or remaining the same when they are remaining the same and he is not the type who can endure bodily feelings that are painful fierce sharp wracking repellent disagreeable lifethreatening

Dwelling alone Lord dwelling alone it is said How far Lord does one dwell alone and to what extent does one dwell with a mate
There are Migajaala objects cognizable by the eye  attractive pleasing charming agreeable enticing lustinspiring
And if a monk takes pleasure in them welcomes them persists in clinging to them then because of this taking pleasure welcoming and persistent clinging enjoyment comes and from enjoyment infatuation
Infatuation brings bondage and a monk who is trapped in the bondage of enjoyment is called 'one who dwells with a mate' ear nose tongue body mind and a monk who is trapped in the bondage of enjoyment is called 'one who dwells with a mate' And a monk so dwelling Migajaala even though he may frequent jungle glades and remote forestdwellings free from noise with little sound far from the madding crowd undisturbed by men well fitted for seclusion  still he is termed 'one who dwells with a mate' Why is this
Craving is the mate he has not left behind and therefore he is called 'one who dwells with a mate'
But Migajaala there are objects cognizable by the eye ear nose tongue body mind  attractive pleasing charming agreeable enticing lustinspiring
And if a monk takes no pleasure in them does not welcome them does not persist in clinging to them then because of his not taking pleasure not welcoming them and not persisting in clinging to them enjoyment fades away and without enjoyment there is no infatuation
Without infatuation no bondage is generated and the monk who is freed from the bondage of enjoyment is called 'one who dwells alone'
And a monk so dwelling Migajaala even though he may live near a village crowded with monks and nuns male and female layfollowers kings and royal ministers sectarians and their followers  still he is termed 'one who dwells alone' Why is this so
Craving is the mate he has left behind and therefore he is called one who dwells alone

Migajala went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side
As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One 'A person living alone
A person living alone' thus it is said
To what extent lord is one a person living alone and to what extent is one a person living with a companion
Migajala there are forms cognizable via the eye  agreeable pleasing charming endearing fostering desire enticing  and a monk relishes them welcomes them  remains fastened to them
As he relishes them welcomes them  remains fastened to them delight arises
There being delight he is impassioned
Being impassioned he is fettered
A monk joined with the fetter of delight is said to be a person living with a companion
There are sounds cognizable via the ear aromas cognizable via the nose flavors cognizable via the tongue tactile sensations cognizable via the body ideas cognizable via the intellect  agreeable pleasing charming endearing fostering desire enticing  and a monk relishes them welcomes them  remains fastened to them
As he relishes them welcomes them  remains fastened to them delight arises
There being delight he is impassioned
Being impassioned he is fettered
A monk joined with the fetter of delight is said to be a person living with a companion
A person living in this way  even if he frequents isolated forest  wilderness dwellings with an unpopulated atmosphere lying far from humanity appropriate for seclusion  is still said to be living with a companion
Why is that
Because the craving that is his companion has not been abandoned by him
Thus he is said to be a person living with a companion
Now there are forms cognizable via the eye  agreeable pleasing charming endearing fostering desire enticing  and a monk does not relish them welcome them or remain fastened to them
As he doesn't relish them welcome them or remain fastened to them delight ceases
There being no delight he is not impassioned
Being not impassioned he is not fettered
A monk disjoined from the fetter of delight is said to be a person living alone
There are sounds cognizable via the ear aromas cognizable via the nose flavors cognizable via the tongue tactile sensations cognizable via the body ideas cognizable via the intellect  agreeable pleasing charming endearing fostering desire enticing  and a monk does not relish them welcome them or remain fastened to them
As he doesn't relish them welcome them or remain fastened to them delight ceases
There being no delight he is not impassioned
Being not impassioned he is not fettered
A monk disjoined from the fetter of delight is said to be a person living alone
A person living in this way  even if he lives near a village associating with monks  nuns with male  female lay followers with kings  royal ministers with sectarians  their disciples  is still said to be living alone
A person living alone is said to be a monk
Why is that
Because the craving that was his companion has been abandoned by him
Thus he is said to be a person living alone
At Savatthi
Then a certain monk went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side
As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One Lord in such and such a dwelling a certain monk  newly ordained not well known  is diseased in pain severely ill
It would be good if the Blessed One would visit the monk out of sympathy for him
Then the Blessed One on hearing the word newly ordained on hearing the word diseased and realizing that the monk was not well known went to him
The monk saw the Blessed One coming from afar and on seeing him stirred in his bed
Then the Blessed One said to him Enough monk
Don't stir in your bed
There are these seats made ready
I will sit down there
The Blessed One sat down on a seat made ready and said to the monk I hope you are getting better monk
I hope you are comfortable
I hope that your pains are lessening and not increasing
I hope that there are signs of their lessening and not of their increasing
I am not getting better lord
I am not comfortable
My extreme pains are increasing not lessening
There are signs of their increasing and not of their lessening
Then I hope you have no anxiety monk
I hope you have no anguish
Yes lord I do have not a small amount of anxiety not a small amount of anguish
I hope you can't fault yourself with regard to your virtue
No lord I can't fault myself with regard to my virtue
Then what are you anxious about
What is your anguish
I understand that the Blessed One has not taught the Dhamma with purity of virtue as its goal
If you understand that I have not taught the Dhamma with purity of virtue as its goal then for what goal do you understand that I have taught the Dhamma
I understand that the Blessed One has taught the Dhamma with the fading of passion as its goal
Good good monk
It's good that you understand that I have taught the Dhamma with the fading of passion as its goal for I have taught the Dhamma with the fading of passion as its goal
What do you think monk Is the eye constant or inconstant
Inconstant lord
And is that which is inconstant easeful or stressful
Stressful lord
And is it fitting to regard what is inconstant stressful subject to change as 'This is mine
This is my self
This is what I am'
No lord
Is the ear constant or inconstant Inconstant lord
Is the nose constant or inconstant Inconstant lord
Is the tongue constant or inconstant Inconstant lord
Is the body constant or inconstant Inconstant lord
What do you think monk Is the intellect constant or inconstant
Inconstant lord
And is that which is inconstant easeful or stressful
Stressful lord
And is it fitting to regard what is inconstant stressful subject to change as 'This is mine
This is my self
This is what I am'
No lord
Seeing thus the instructed disciple of the noble ones grows disenchanted with the eye disenchanted with the ear disenchanted with the nose disenchanted with the tongue disenchanted with the body disenchanted with the intellect
Disenchanted he becomes dispassionate
Through dispassion he is fully released
With full release there is the knowledge 'Fully released' He discerns that 'Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task done
There is nothing further for this world' That is what the Blessed One said
Gratified the monk delighted in the Blessed One's words
And while this explanation was being given there arose in the monk the dustless stainless Dhamma eye Whatever is subject to origination is all subject to cessation
Monks I will teach you the All as a phenomenon to be abandoned
Listen  pay close attention
I will speak
As you say lord the monks responded
The Blessed One said And which All is a phenomenon to be abandoned
The eye is to be abandoned
Forms are to be abandoned
Consciousness at the eye is to be abandoned
Contact at the eye is to be abandoned
And whatever there is that arises in dependence on contact at the eye  experienced as pleasure pain or neitherpleasurenorpain  that too is to be abandoned
The ear is to be abandoned
Sounds are to be abandoned
The nose is to be abandoned
Aromas are to be abandoned
The tongue is to be abandoned
Flavors are to be abandoned
The body is to be abandoned
Tactile sensations are to be abandoned
The intellect is to be abandoned
Ideas are to be abandoned
Consciousness at the intellect is to be abandoned
Contact at the intellect is to be abandoned
And whatever there is that arises in dependence on contact at the intellect  experienced as pleasure pain or neitherpleasurenorpain  that too is to be abandoned
This is called the All as a phenomenon to be abandoned

Monks I will teach you the All
Listen  pay close attention
I will speak
As you say lord the monks responded
The Blessed One said What is the All
Simply the eye  forms ear  sounds nose  aromas tongue  flavors body  tactile sensations intellect  ideas
This monks is called the All
Anyone who would say 'Repudiating this All I will describe another' if questioned on what exactly might be the grounds for his statement would be unable to explain and furthermore would be put to grief
Why
Because it lies beyond range
Secondly the Commentary includes nibbana within the scope of the All described here  as a dhamma or object of the intellect  even though there are many other discourses in the Canon specifically stating that nibbana lies beyond the range of the six senses and their objects
Sn for instance indicates that a person who has attained nibbana has gone beyond all phenomena and therefore cannot be described
MN discusses a consciousness without feature that does not partake of the Allness of the All Furthermore the following discourse says that the All is to be abandoned
At no point does the Canon say that nibbana is to be abandoned
Nibbana follows on cessation which is to be realized
Once nibbana is realized there are no further tasks to be done
Thus it seems more this discourse's discussion of All is meant to limit the use of the word all throughout the Buddha's teachings to the six sense spheres and their objects
As the following discourse shows this would also include the consciousness contact and feelings connected with the sense spheres and their objects
Nibbana would lie outside of the word all This would fit in with another point made several times in the Canon that dispassion is the highest of all dhammas while the arahant has gone beyond even dispassion
This raises the question if the word all does not include nibbana does that mean that one may infer from the statement all phenomena are notself that nibbana is self
The answer is no
As AN
states to even ask if there is anything remaining or not remaining after the cessation of the six sense spheres is to differentiate what is by nature undifferentiated
The range of differentiation goes only as far as the All Perceptions of self or notself which would count as differentiation would not apply beyond the All When the cessation of the All is experienced all differentiation is allayed

Translator's note A number of discourses make the point that the mind is fettered not by things like the five aggregates or the objects of the six senses but by the act of passion  delight for them
There are two ways to try to cut through this fetter
One is to focus on the drawbacks of passion  delight in  of themselves seeing clearly the stress  suffering they engender in the mind
The other is to analyze the objects of passion  delight in such a way that they no longer seem worthy of interest
This second approach is the one recommended in this discourse when the Buddha talks of smashing scattering  demolishing form and making it unfit for play he is referring to the practice of analyzing form minutely into its component parts until it no longer seems a fit object for passion  delight
When all five aggregates can be treated in this way the mind is left with no conditioned object to serve as a focal point for its passion and so is released  at the very least  to the stage of Awakening called nonreturn
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Savatthi at Jeta's Grove Anathapindika's monastery
Then Ven
Radha went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side
As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One 'A being' lord
'A being' it's said
To what extent is one said to be 'a being'
Any desire passion delight or craving for form Radha when one is caught up there tied up there one is said to be 'a being'
Any desire passion delight or craving for feeling perception fabrications
Any desire passion delight or craving for consciousness Radha when one is caught up there tied up there one is said to be 'a being'
Just as when boys or girls are playing with little sand castles as long as they are not free from passion desire love thirst fever  craving for those little sand castles that's how long they have fun with those sand castles enjoy them treasure them feel possessive of them
But when they become free from passion desire love thirst fever  craving for those little sand castles then they smash them scatter them demolish them with their hands or feet and make them unfit for play
In the same way Radha you too should smash scatter  demolish form and make it unfit for play
Practice for the ending of craving for form
You should smash scatter  demolish feeling and make it unfit for play
Practice for the ending of craving for feeling
You should smash scatter  demolish perception and make it unfit for play
Practice for the ending of craving for perception
You should smash scatter  demolish fabrications and make them unfit for play
Practice for the ending of craving for fabrications
You should smash scatter  demolish consciousness and make it unfit for play
Practice for the ending of craving for consciousness  for the ending of craving Radha is Unbinding
On one occasion Ven
Sariputta  Ven
Maha Kotthita were staying near Varanasi in the Deer Park at Isipatana
Then Ven
Maha Kotthita emerging from seclusion in the late afternoon went to Ven
Sariputta and on arrival exchanged courteous greetings with him
After an exchange of friendly greetings  courtesies he sat to one side
As he was sitting there he said to Ven
Sariputta Sariputta my friend which things should a virtuous monk attend to in an appropriate way
A virtuous monk Kotthita my friend should attend in an appropriate way to the five clingingaggregates as inconstant stressful a disease a cancer an arrow painful an affliction alien a dissolution an emptiness notself
Which five
Form as a clingingaggregate feeling perception fabrications consciousness as a clingingaggregate
A virtuous monk should attend in an appropriate way to these five clingingaggregates as inconstant stressful a disease a cancer an arrow painful an affliction alien a dissolution an emptiness notself
For it is possible that a virtuous monk attending in an appropriate way to these five clingingaggregates as inconstant notself would realize the fruit of streamentry
Then which things should a monk who has attained streamentry attend to in an appropriate way
A monk who has attained streamentry should attend in an appropriate way to these five clingingaggregates as inconstant stressful a disease a cancer an arrow painful an affliction alien a dissolution an emptiness notself
For it is possible that a monk who has attained streamentry attending in an appropriate way to these five clingingaggregates as inconstant notself would realize the fruit of oncereturning
Then which things should a monk who has attained oncereturning attend to in an appropriate way
A monk who has attained oncereturning should attend in an appropriate way to these five clingingaggregates as inconstant stressful a disease a cancer an arrow painful an affliction alien a dissolution an emptiness notself
For it is possible that a monk who has attained oncereturning attending in an appropriate way to these five clingingaggregates as inconstant notself would realize the fruit of nonreturning
Then which things should a monk who has attained nonreturning attend to in an appropriate way
A monk who has attained nonreturning should attend in an appropriate way to these five clingingaggregates as inconstant stressful a disease a cancer an arrow painful an affliction alien a dissolution an emptiness notself
For it is possible that a monk who has attained nonreturning attending in an appropriate way to these five clingingaggregates as inconstant notself would realize the fruit of arahantship
Then which things should an arahant attend to in an appropriate way
An arahant should attend in an appropriate way to these five clingingaggregates as inconstant stressful a disease a cancer an arrow painful an affliction alien a dissolution an emptiness notself
Although for an arahant there is nothing further to do and nothing to add to what has been done still these things  when developed  pursued  lead both to a pleasant abiding in the herenow and to mindfulness  alertness

There the Blessed One said Monks I will teach you clingable phenomena  clinging
Listen  pay close attention
I will speak
As you say lord the monks responded
The Blessed One said And what monks are clingable phenomena
What is clinging
Form is a clingable phenomenon
Any desirepassion related to it is clinging related to it
Feeling is a clingable phenomenon
Any desirepassion related to it is clinging related to it
Perception is a clingable phenomenon
Any desirepassion related to it is clinging related to it
Fabrications are clingable phenomena
Any desirepassion related to them is clinging related to them
Consciousness is a clingable phenomenon
Any desirepassion related to it is clinging related to it
These are called clingable phenomena
This is clinging
And when monks a monk having seen as they really are the arising and the passing away the attractiveness and the danger and the deliverance from the five groups of clinging is released without clinging he monks is called a monk in whom the cankers are destroyed who has lived the life to perfection done what had to be done put down the burden gained the highest goal worn through the fetters of rebirth and is liberated by perfect insight
Monks there are these five groups of clinging
What five
The bodygroup of clinging the feelinggroup the perceptiongroup the mentalformationgroup the consciousnessgroup of clinging
And when monks the Ariyan disciple understands as they really are the arising and the passing away the attractiveness and the danger and the deliverance from the five groups of clinging he is called an Ariyan disciple who is a Streamwinner not liable to states of woe assured of final enlightenment

There the Blessed One said I tell you monks It is for one who knows  sees that there is the ending of the effluents
For one who knows what  sees what is there the ending of the effluents
'Such is form such its origination such its passing away
Such is feeling Such is perception Such are fabrications Such is consciousness such its origination such its passing away' It is for one who knows  sees in this way that there is the ending of the effluents
Even though this wish may occur to a monk who dwells without devoting himself to development  'O that my mind might be released from effluents through lack of clinging'  still his mind is not released from the effluents through lack of clinging
Why is that
From lack of developing it should be said
Lack of developing what
The four frames of reference the four right exertions the four bases of power the five faculties the five strengths the seven factors for Awakening the noble eightfold path
Suppose a hen has eight ten or twelve eggs If she doesn't cover them rightly warm them rightly or incubate them rightly then even though this wish may occur to her  'O that my chicks might break through the egg shells with their spiked claws or beaks and hatch out safely'  still it is not possible that the chicks will break through the egg shells with their spiked claws or beaks and hatch out safely
Why is that
Because the hen has not covered them rightly warmed them rightly or incubated them rightly
In the same way even though this wish may occur to a monk who dwells without devoting himself to development  'O that my mind might be released from effluents through lack of clinging'  still his mind is not released from the effluents through lack of clinging

Suppose a hen has eight ten or twelve eggs that she covers rightly warms rightly  incubates rightly Even though this wish may not occur to her  'O that my chicks might break through the egg shells with their spiked claws or beaks and hatch out safely'  still it is possible that the chicks will break through the egg shells with their spiked claws or beaks and hatch out safely
Why is that
Because the hen has covered them warmed them  incubated them rightly
In the same way even though this wish may not occur to a monk who dwells devoting himself to development  'O that my mind might be released from effluents through lack of clinging'  still his mind is released from the effluents through lack of clinging
Why is that
From developing it should be said
Developing what
The four frames of reference the four right exertions the four bases of power the five faculties the five strengths the seven factors for Awakening the noble eightfold path
Just as when a carpenter or carpenter's apprentice sees the marks of his fingers or thumb on the handle of his adze but does not know 'Today my adze handle wore down this much or yesterday it wore down that much or the day before yesterday it wore down this much' still he knows it is worn through when it is worn through
In the same way when a monk dwells devoting himself to development he does not know 'Today my effluents wore down this much or yesterday they wore down that much or the day before yesterday they wore down this much' still he knows they are worn through when they are worn through
Just as when an oceangoing ship rigged with masts  stays after six months on the water is left on shore for the winter Its stays weathered by the heat  wind moistened by the clouds of the rainy season easily wither  rot away
In the same way when a monk dwells devoting himself to development his fetters easily wither  rot away

There the Blessed One said Monks from an inconstruable beginning comes transmigration
A beginning point is not evident although beings hindered by ignorance and fettered by craving are transmigrating  wandering on
It's just as when a dog is tied by a leash to a post or stake If it walks it walks right around that post or stake
If it stands it stands right next to that post or stake
If it sits it sits right next to that post or stake
If it lies down it lies down right next to that post or stake
In the same way an uninstructed runofthemill person regards form as 'This is mine this is my self this is what I am' He regards feeling perception fabrications consciousness as 'This is mine this is my self this is what I am' If he walks he walks right around these five clingingaggregates
If he stands he stands right next to these five clingingaggregates
If he sits he sits right next to these five clingingaggregates
If he lies down he lies down right next to these five clingingaggregates
Thus one should reflect on one's mind with every moment 'For a long time has this mind been defiled by passion aversion  delusion' From the defilement of the mind are beings defiled
From the purification of the mind are beings purified
Monks have you ever seen a moving contraption
Yes lord
That moving contraption was created by the mind
And this mind is even more variegated than a moving contraption
Thus one should reflect on one's mind with every moment 'For a long time has this mind been defiled by passion aversion  delusion' From the defilement of the mind are beings defiled
From the purification of the mind are beings purified
Monks I can imagine no one group of beings more variegated than that of common animals
Common animals are created by mind
And the mind is even more variegated than common animals
Thus one should reflect on one's mind with every moment 'For a long time has this mind been defiled by passion aversion  delusion' From the defilement of the mind are beings defiled
From the purification of the mind are beings purified
It's just as when  there being dye lac yellow orpiment indigo or crimson  a dyer or painter would paint the picture of a woman or a man complete in all its parts on a wellpolished panel or wall or on a piece of cloth in the same way an uninstructed runofthemill person when creating creates nothing but form feeling perception fabrications consciousness
Now what do you think monks  Is form constant or inconstant Inconstant lord And is that which is inconstant easeful or stressful Stressful lord And is it fitting to regard what is inconstant stressful subject to change as 'This is mine
This is my self
This is what I am'
No lord
Is feeling constant or inconstant Inconstant lord
Is perception constant or inconstant Inconstant lord
Are fabrications constant or inconstant Inconstant lord
What do you think monks  Is consciousness constant or inconstant Inconstant lord And is that which is inconstant easeful or stressful Stressful lord And is it fitting to regard what is inconstant stressful subject to change as 'This is mine
This is my self
This is what I am'
No lord
Thus monks any form whatsoever that is past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or near every form is to be seen as it actually is with right discernment as 'This is not mine
This is not my self
This is not what I am'
Any feeling whatsoever
Any perception whatsoever
Any fabrications whatsoever
Any consciousness whatsoever that is past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or near every consciousness is to be seen as it actually is with right discernment as 'This is not mine
This is not my self
This is not what I am'
Seeing thus the wellinstructed disciple of the noble ones grows disenchanted with form disenchanted with feeling disenchanted with perception disenchanted with fabrications disenchanted with consciousness
Disenchanted he becomes dispassionate
Through dispassion he is fully released
With full release there is the knowledge 'Fully released' He discerns that 'Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task done
There is nothing further for this world' See also SN

There the Blessed One said Monks from an inconstruable beginning comes transmigration
A beginning point is not evident although beings hindered by ignorance and fettered by craving are transmigrating  wandering on
There comes a time when the great ocean evaporates dries up  does not exist
But for beings  as long as they are hindered by ignorance fettered by craving transmigrating  wandering on  I don't say that there is an end of suffering  stress
There comes a time when Sineru king of mountains is consumed with flame is destroyed  does not exist
But for beings  as long as they are hindered by ignorance fettered by craving transmigrating  wandering on  I don't say that there is an end of suffering  stress
There comes a time when the great earth is consumed with flame is destroyed  does not exist

Just as a dog tied by a leash to a post or stake keeps running around and circling around that very post or stake in the same way an uninstructed runofthemill person  who has no regard for noble ones is not wellversed or disciplined in their Dhamma who has no regard for people of integrity is not wellversed or disciplined in their Dhamma  assumes form to be the self or the self as possessing form or form as in the self or the self as in form
He assumes feeling to be the self
He assumes perception to be the self
He assumes fabrications to be the self
He assumes consciousness to be the self or the self as possessing consciousness or consciousness as in the self or the self as in consciousness

He is not set loose from form not set loose from feeling from perception from fabrications not set loose from consciousness
He is not set loose from birth aging  death from sorrows lamentations pains distresses  despairs
He is not set loose I tell you from suffering  stress
But a wellinstructed disciple of the noble ones  who has regard for noble ones is wellversed  disciplined in their Dhamma who has regard for people of integrity is wellversed  disciplined in their Dhamma  doesn't assume form to be the self or the self as possessing form or form as in the self or the self as in form

Sitting to one side a monk said to the Blessed One Lord is there any form that is constant lasting eternal not subject to change that will stay just as it is as long as eternity
Is there any feeling any perception Are there any fabrications Is there any consciousness that is constant lasting eternal not subject to change that will stay just as it is as long as eternity
No monk there is no form no feeling no perception there are no fabrications there is no consciousness that is constant lasting eternal not subject to change that will stay just as it is as long as eternity 
Then the Blessed One picking up a tiny bit of dust with the tip of his fingernail said to the monk There isn't even this much form that is constant lasting eternal not subject to change that will stay just as it is as long as eternity
If there were even this much form that was constant lasting eternal not subject to change that would stay just as it is as long as eternity then this living of the holy life for the right ending of suffering  stress would not be discerned
But because there isn't even this much form that is constant lasting eternal not subject to change that will stay just as it is as long as eternity this living of the holy life for the right ending of suffering  stress is discerned
There isn't even this much feeling
There isn't even this much perception
There aren't even this many fabrications
There isn't even this much consciousness that is constant lasting eternal not subject to change that will stay just as it is as long as eternity
If there were even this much consciousness that was constant lasting eternal not subject to change that would stay just as it is as long as eternity then this living of the holy life for the right ending of suffering  stress would not be discerned
But because there isn't even this much consciousness that is constant lasting eternal not subject to change that will stay just as it is as long as eternity this living of the holy life for the right ending of suffering  stress is discerned
What do you think monk  Is form constant or inconstant Inconstant lord And is that which is inconstant easeful or stressful Stressful lord And is it fitting to regard what is inconstant stressful subject to change as 'This is mine

No lord
Thus monk any form whatsoever that is past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or near every form is to be seen as it actually is with right discernment as 'This is not mine
This is not my self
This is not what I am'
Any feeling whatsoever
Any perception whatsoever

Seeing thus the instructed disciple of the noble ones grows disenchanted with form disenchanted with feeling disenchanted with perception disenchanted with fabrications disenchanted with consciousness
Disenchanted he becomes dispassionate
Through dispassion he is fully released
With full release there is the knowledge 'Fully released' He discerns that 'Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task done

In these five groups of clinging I perceive no self nor any thing pertaining to a self As for this 'I am' you mention friend Khemaka what is it
Do you say this 'I am' is the body or not the body feelings perceptions mental formations consciousness or not consciousness
No friends I do not say this 'I am' is the body consciousness nor that it is other than the body consciousness
Yet with regard to the five groups of clinging 'I am' comes to me but I do not consider it as 'This I am' It is just like the scent of a blue red or white lotus
If someone were to say 'The scent belongs to the petals or the color or the fibers' would he be describing it correctly
Surely not friend
Then how would he describe it correctly
As the scent of the flower would be the correct explanation
In the same way friends I do not say this 'I am' is the body consciousness nor that it is other than the body consciousness
Yet with regard to the five groups of clinging 'I am' comes to me but I do not consider it as 'This I am' Though friends an Ariyan disciple has abandoned the five lower fetters there still remains in him a subtle remnant from among the five groups of clinging a subtle remnant of the 'I'conceit of the 'I'desire an unextirpated lurking tendency to think 'I am' Later on he dwells contemplating the rise and fall of the five groups of clinging and he sees 'This is the body this is its arising this is its passing away
These are feelings perceptions mental formations this is consciousness this is its arising this is its passing away'
So as he dwells thus in contemplation of the rise and fall of the five groups of clinging this subtle remnant from among the five groups of clinging this subtle remnant of the 'I'conceit of the 'I'desire this unextirpated lurking tendency to think 'I am' is brought to an end
Friends it is like a cloth soiled and stained whose owners give it to the washerman
He rubs it smooth with saltearth lye or cowdung then rinses it in clean water
Now though the cloth has been cleaned and thoroughly purified there still hangs about it unremoved the subtle smell of saltearth lye or cowdung
The washerman returns it to the owners who put it away carefully in a sweetsmelling box
Then the smell of saltearth lye or cowdung that still clung to it disappears completely
In just the same way friends though an Ariyan disciple has abandoned the five lower fetters this unextirpated lurking tendency to think 'I am' is brought to an end
Now when this teaching was thus expounded the hearts of some sixty elders were completely freed from the cankers as too was that of Venerable Khemaka
I am staying Lord in a forest hut not far away
Now a number of wanderers of another sect came to me and said 'Friend Anuraadha a Tathaagata a superman a man supreme one who has gained the Highest must be describable in four ways a Tathaagata comes to be after death he does not come to be after death he both comes to be and does not come to be after death he neither comes to be nor does not come to be after death' To this Lord I replied 'A Tathaagata can be described otherwise than in these four ways' At my reply the wanderers of another sect said 'This monk must be a novice not long ordained or if he is an elder he is an ignorant fool' Then the wanderers abusing me as a novice and a fool got up and went away
Soon after they had left Lord I thought 'If these wanderers were to ply me with further questions how should I answer them so as to express correctly the Blessed One's standpoint without misrepresentation in accordance with the true doctrine so that no follower of his teacher would incur reproach' Now what do you think Anuraadha is the body permanent or impermanent
Impermanent Lord
Well then Anuraadha do you equate the Tathaagata with his body feelings perceptions mental formations consciousness
No indeed Lord
Do you consider he has no body feelings perceptions mental formations consciousness
No indeed Lord
Then Anuraadha since in this very life the Tathaagata is not to be regarded as really and truly existing is it proper for you to declare of him 'Friends he who is a Tathaagata can be described otherwise than in these four ways'
No indeed Lord
Good good Anuraadha
As before so now I proclaim just suffering and the ceasing of suffering
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Vesali in the Great Wood at the Hall of the Gabled Pavilion
At that time Ven
Anuradha was staying not far from the Blessed One in a wilderness hut
Then a large number of wandering sectarians went to Ven
Anuradha and on arrival exchanged courteous greetings with him
After an exchange of friendly greetings  courtesies they sat to one side
As they were sitting there they said to Ven
Anuradha Friend Anuradha the Tathagata  the supreme man the superlative man attainer of the superlative attainment  being described is described with these four positions The Tathagata exists after death does not exist after death both does  does not exist after death neither exists nor does not exist after death
When this was said Ven
Anuradha said to the wandering sectarians Friends the Tathagata  the supreme man the superlative man attainer of the superlative attainment  being described is described otherwise than with these four positions The Tathagata exists after death does not exist after death both does  does not exist after death neither exists nor does not exist after death
When this was said the wandering sectarians said to Ven
Anuradha This monk is either a newcomer not long gone forth or else an elder who is foolish  inexperienced So the wandering sectarians addressing Ven
Anuradha as they would a newcomer or a fool got up from their seats and left
Then not long after the wandering sectarians had left this thought occurred to Ven
Anuradha If I am questioned again by those wandering sectarians how will I answer in such a way that will I speak in line with what the Blessed One has said will not misrepresent the Blessed One with what is unfactual will answer in line with the Dhamma so that no one whose thinking is in line with the Dhamma will have grounds for criticizing me
Then Ven
Anuradha went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to the Blessed One sat to one side
As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One Just now I was staying not far from the Blessed One in a wilderness hut
Then a large number of wandering sectarians came and said to me 'Friend Anuradha the Tathagata  the supreme man the superlative man attainer of the superlative attainment  being described is described with these four positions The Tathagata exists after death does not exist after death both does  does not exist after death neither exists nor does not exist after death'
When this was said I said to them 'Friends the Tathagata  the supreme man the superlative man attainer of the superlative attainment  being described is described otherwise than with these four positions The Tathagata exists after death does not exist after death both does  does not exist after death neither exists nor does not exist after death'
When this was said the wandering sectarians said to me 'This monk is either a newcomer not long gone forth or else an elder who is foolish  inexperienced' So addressing me as they would a newcomer or a fool they got up from their seats and left
Then not long after the wandering sectarians had left this thought occurred to me 'If I am questioned again by those wandering sectarians how will I answer in such a way that will I speak in line with what the Blessed One has said will not misrepresent the Blessed One with what is unfactual will answer in line with the Dhamma and no one whose thinking is in line with the Dhamma will have grounds for criticizing me' What do you think Anuradha Is form constant or inconstant
Inconstant lord
And is that which is inconstant easeful or stressful
Stressful lord
And is it proper to regard what is inconstant stressful subject to change as 'This is mine
This is my self
This is what I am'
No lord
Is feeling constant or inconstant
Inconstant lord
Is perception constant or inconstant
Inconstant lord
Are fabrications constant or inconstant
Inconstant lord
Is consciousness constant or inconstant
Inconstant lord
And is that which is inconstant easeful or stressful
Stressful lord
And is it proper to regard what is inconstant stressful subject to change as 'This is mine
This is my self
This is what I am'
No lord
What do you think Anuradha Do you regard form as the Tathagata
No lord
Do you regard feeling as the Tathagata
No lord
Do you regard perception as the Tathagata
No lord
Do you regard fabrications as the Tathagata
No lord
Do you regard consciousness as the Tathagata
No lord
What do you think Anuradha Do you regard the Tathagata as being in form Elsewhere than form In feeling Elsewhere than feeling In perception Elsewhere than perception In fabrications Elsewhere than fabrications In consciousness Elsewhere than consciousness
No lord
What do you think Do you regard the Tathagata as formfeelingperceptionfabricationsconsciousness
No lord
Do you regard the Tathagata as that which is without form without feeling without perception without fabrications without consciousness
No lord
And so Anuradha  when you can't pin down the Tathagata as a truth or reality even in the present life  is it proper for you to declare 'Friends the Tathagata  the supreme man the superlative man attainer of the superlative attainment  being described is described otherwise than with these four positions The Tathagata exists after death does not exist after death both does  does not exist after death neither exists nor does not exist after death'
No lord
Very good Anuradha
Very good
Both formerly  now it is only stress that I describe and the cessation of stress

Then Yodhajiva the headman went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side
As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One Lord I have heard that it has been passed down by the ancient teaching lineage of warriors that 'When a warrior strives  exerts himself in battle if others then strike him down  slay him while he is striving  exerting himself in battle then with the breakup of the body after death he is reborn in the company of devas slain in battle' What does the Blessed One have to say about that
Enough headman put that aside
Don't ask me that
A second time A third time Yodhajiva the headman said Lord I have heard that it has been passed down by the ancient teaching lineage of warriors that 'When a warrior strives  exerts himself in battle if others then strike him down  slay him while he is striving  exerting himself in battle then with the breakup of the body after death he is reborn in the company of devas slain in battle' What does the Blessed One have to say about that
Apparently headman I haven't been able to get past you by saying 'Enough headman put that aside
Don't ask me that' So I will simply answer you
When a warrior strives  exerts himself in battle his mind is already seized debased  misdirected by the thought 'May these beings be struck down or slaughtered or annihilated or destroyed
May they not exist' If others then strike him down  slay him while he is thus striving  exerting himself in battle then with the breakup of the body after death he is reborn in the hell called the realm of those slain in battle
But if he holds such a view as this 'When a warrior strives  exerts himself in battle if others then strike him down  slay him while he is striving  exerting himself in battle then with the breakup of the body after death he is reborn in the company of devas slain in battle' that is his wrong view
Now there are two destinations for a person with wrong view I tell you either hell or the animal womb
When this was said Yodhajiva the headman sobbed  burst into tears
That is what I couldn't get past you by saying 'Enough headman put that aside
Don't ask me that' I'm not crying lord because of what the Blessed One said to me but simply because I have been deceived cheated  fooled for a long time by that ancient teaching lineage of warriors who said 'When a warrior strives  exerts himself in battle if others then strike him down  slay him while he is striving  exerting himself in battle then with the breakup of the body after death he is reborn in the company of devas slain in battle'
Magnificent lord
Magnificent
Just as if he were to place upright what was overturned to reveal what was hidden to show the way to one who was lost or to carry a lamp into the dark so that those with eyes could see forms in the same way has the Blessed One  through many lines of reasoning  made the Dhamma clear
I go to the Blessed One for refuge to the Dhamma and to the Community of monks
May the Blessed One remember me as a lay follower who has gone to him for refuge from this day forward for life

Then the Brahman lady Verahaccaani served the Venerable Udaayii with her own hands with choice foods both hard and soft until he had had enough
When he had eaten and withdrawn his hand from the bowl the lady Verahaccaani put on her shoes sat down on a high seat covered her head and said to the Venerable Udaayii Teach me your doctrine recluse
The time will come for that sister he said and getting up from his seat he went on his way
You are speaking thus my lad in praise of the recluse Udaayii
But when I said to this Udaayii 'Teach me your doctrine recluse' he replied 'The time will come for that sister' and then got up from his seat and returned home
Well my lady you put on your shoes sat down on a high seat covered your head and said 'Teach me your doctrine recluse' But these venerable recluses honor their doctrine they hold it in high esteem
Very well young man
Invite the recluse Udaayii on my behalf to a meal tomorrow
When the Venerable Udaayii had eaten and withdrawn his hand from the bowl the lady sat down barefoot and bareheaded on a low seat and said to the Venerable Udaayii Tell me Venerable Sir what do the Arahants say causes weal and woe to exist
What do they say causes them not to exist
Where the eye is sister the Arahants declare that weal and woe exist
Where the eye is absent they declare that weal and woe do not exist

Now the Venerable Vakkali saw the Blessed One coming from a distance and tried to get up
Then the Blessed One said to the Venerable Vakkali Enough Vakkali do not try to get up
There are these seats made ready
I will sit down there And he sat down on a seat that was ready
Then he said
Are you feeling better Vakkali
Are you bearing up
Are your pains getting better and not worse
Are there signs that they are getting better and not worse
No Lord I do not feel better I am not bearing up
I have severe pains and they are getting worse not better
There is no sign of improvement only of worsening
Have you any doubts Vakkali
Have you any cause for regret
Indeed Lord I have many doubts
I have much cause for regret
Have you nothing to reproach yourself about as regards morals
No Lord I have nothing to reproach myself about as regards morals
Well then Vakkali if you have nothing to reproach yourself about as regards morals you must have some worry or scruple that is troubling you
For a long time Lord I have wanted to come and set eyes on the Blessed One but I had not the strength in this body to come and see the Blessed One
Enough Vakkali
What is there to see in this vile body
He who sees Dhamma Vakkali sees me he who sees me sees Dhamma
Truly seeing Dhamma one sees me seeing me one sees Dhamma
Then Vacchagotta the wanderer went to the Blessed One and on arrival exchanged courteous greetings with him
After an exchange of friendly greetings  courtesies he sat to one side
As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One Master Gotama a few days ago a large number of contemplatives brahmans and wanderers of various sects were sitting together in the Debating Hall when this conversation arose among them 'This Purana Kassapa  the leader of a community the leader of a group the teacher of a group honored and famous esteemed as holy by the mass of people  describes a disciple who has died and passed on in terms of places of rebirth That one is reborn there that one is reborn there Even when the disciple is an ultimate person a foremost person attained to the foremost attainment Purana Kassapa describes him when he has died and passed on in terms of places of rebirth That one is reborn there that one is reborn there
'This Makkhali Gosala This Nigantha Nataputta This Sañjaya Velatthaputta This Pakudha Kaccana This Ajita Kesakambala  the leader of a community the leader of a group the teacher of a group honored and famous esteemed as holy by the mass of people  describes a disciple who has died and passed on in terms of places of rebirth That one is reborn there that one is reborn there Even when the disciple is an ultimate person a foremost person attained to the foremost attainment Ajita Kesakambala describes him when he has died and passed on in terms of places of rebirth That one is reborn there that one is reborn there
This contemplative Gotama  the leader of a community the leader of a group the teacher of a group honored and famous esteemed as holy by the mass of people  describes a disciple who has died and passed on in terms of places of rebirth That one is reborn there that one is reborn there But when the disciple is an ultimate person a foremost person attained to the foremost attainment Gotama the contemplative does not describe him when he has died and passed on in terms of places of rebirth That one is reborn there that one is reborn there Instead he describes him thus He has cut through craving severed the fetter and by rightly breaking through conceit has made an end of suffering  stress'
So I was simply befuddled
I was uncertain How is the teaching of Gotama the contemplative to be understood
Of course you are befuddled Vaccha
Of course you are uncertain
When there is a reason for befuddlement in you uncertainty arises
I designate the rebirth of one who has sustenance Vaccha and not of one without sustenance
Just as a fire burns with sustenance and not without sustenance even so I designate the rebirth of one who has sustenance and not of one without sustenance
But Master Gotama at the moment a flame is being swept on by the wind and goes a far distance what do you designate as its sustenance then
Vaccha when a flame is being swept on by the wind and goes a far distance I designate it as windsustained for the wind is its sustenance at that time
And at the moment when a being sets this body aside and is not yet reborn in another body what do you designate as its sustenance then
Vaccha when a being sets this body aside and is not yet reborn in another body I designate it as cravingsustained for craving is its sustenance at that time

Then Vacchagotta the wanderer went to the Blessed One and on arrival exchanged courteous greetings with him
After an exchange of friendly greetings  courtesies he sat to one side
As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One Now then Master Gotama is the cosmos eternal
That has not been declared by me Vaccha 'The cosmos is eternal' Well then Master Gotama is the cosmos not eternal
Vaccha that too has not been declared by me 'The cosmos is not eternal' Then is the cosmos finite Is the cosmos infinite Is the body the same as the soul Is the body one thing and the soul another Does the Tathagata exist after death Does the Tathagata not exist after death Does the Tathagata both exist and not exist after death Does the Tathagata neither exist nor not exist after death
Vaccha that too has not been declared by me 'The Tathagata neither exists nor does not exist after death
Now Master Gotama what is the cause what is the reason why  when wanderers of other sects are asked in this way they answer that 'The cosmos is eternal' or 'The cosmos is not eternal' or 'The cosmos is finite' or 'The cosmos is infinite' or 'The body is the same as the soul' or 'The body is one thing and the soul another' or 'The Tathagata exists after death' or 'The Tathagata does not exist after death' or 'The Tathagata both exists and does not exist after death or 'The Tathagata neither exists nor does not exist after death' yet when Master Gotama is asked in this way he does not answer that 'The cosmos is eternal' or 'The cosmos is not eternal' or 'The cosmos is finite' or 'The cosmos is infinite' or 'The body is the same as the soul' or 'The body is one thing and the soul another' or 'The Tathagata exists after death' or 'The Tathagata does not exist after death' or 'The Tathagata both exists and does not exist after death or 'The Tathagata neither exists nor does not exist after death'
Vaccha the members of other sects assume form to be the self or the self as possessing form or form as in the self or the self as in form
They assume feeling to be the self
They assume perception to be the self
They assume fabrications to be the self
They assume consciousness to be the self or the self as possessing consciousness or consciousness as in the self or the self as in consciousness
That is why when asked in this way they answer that 'The cosmos is eternal' or that 'The Tathagata neither exists nor does not exist after death'
But the Tathagata worthy and rightly selfawakened does not assume form to be the self or the self as possessing form or form as in the self or the self as in form
He does not assume feeling to be the self
He does not assume perception to be the self
He does not assume fabrications to be the self
He does not assume consciousness to be the self or the self as possessing consciousness or consciousness as in the self or the self as in consciousness
That is why when asked in this way he does not answer that 'The cosmos is eternal' or that 'The Tathagata neither exists nor does not exist after death' Then Vacchagotta the wanderer getting up from his seat went to Ven

Just now Master Moggallana I went to Gotama the contemplative and on arrival asked him about this matter and he answered me with the same words the same phrasing as Master Moggallana
Amazing Master Moggallana
Astounding
How the meaning and phrasing of the teacher and disciple agree coincide and do not diverge from one another with regard to the supreme teaching

This monks is the meanest of callings  that of one who goes begging
It is a term of abuse in the world to say 'You scrapgatherer wandering about bowl in hand' This is the life undertaken by young men of good family seeking their own good because it is good not compelled by rulers not compelled by robbers not on account of debts not through fear not for a livelihood but with the thought 'Here I am plunged into birth decayanddeath sorrow lamentation pain grief and despair thrown into suffering overcome with suffering
Surely there must be a way of bringing this entire mass of suffering to an end'
So monks a young man of good family leaves the world but he is greedy for sense pleasures with fierce passions with hate in his heart corruptly motivated lacking in mindfulness inattentive unconcentrated scatterbrained his faculties uncontrolled
Just as monks a funeraltorch lit at both ends and smeared in the middle with dung is no good as fuel either in the village or in the forest  that is how I would describe that man who has lost his home and wealth without satisfying the demands of the recluse life
There are monks three unskilled ways of thought thoughts of lust thoughts of illwill thoughts of hurting
And these three unskilled states disappear utterly in him whose heart is well established in the four foundations of mindfulness or who practices concentration on the signless
Indeed monks this concentration on the signless is greatly to be commended the concentration on the signless if developed and frequently practiced is of great fruit of great profit
There are monks these two views the existence view and the nonexistence view
And the welltaught Ariyan disciple deliberates 'Is there anything in the world that I can cling to without being at fault' And he realizes 'There is nothing in the world that I can cling to without being at fault
Suppose I were to grasp and cling to the body to feelings perceptions the mental formations consciousness
Conditioned by my clinging becoming would arise conditioned by becoming birth conditioned by birth decayanddeath sorrow lamentation pain grief and despair
In that way the whole mass of suffering would arise'
On one occasion the Blessed One was staying among the Sakyans at Kapilavatthu in the Banyan Park
Then after having dismissed the community of monks over a particular incident he early in the morning put on his robes and carrying his bowl and outer robe went into Kapilavatthu for alms
After having gone for alms in Kapilavatthu after his meal returning from his almsround he went to the Great Forest for the day's abiding
Plunging into the Great Forest he sat down at the root of a beluva sapling as his day's abiding
Then as he was alone in seclusion this line of thought arose in his awareness I have turned away the community of monks
But here there are monks who are new  not long gone forth only recently come to this Dhamma  discipline
If they do not see me there may be alteration in them there may be change
Just as when a young calf does not see its mother there may be alteration in it there may be change in the same way there are monks who are new  not long gone forth only recently come to this Dhamma  discipline
If they do not see me there may be alteration in them there may be change
Just as when young seedlings don't get water there may be alteration in them there may be change in the same way there are monks who are new  not long gone forth only recently come to this Dhamma  discipline
If they do not see me there may be alteration in them there may be change
What if I were to aid the community of monks as I did before
Then Brahma Sahampati  having known with his own awareness the line of thinking in the Blessed One's awareness  just as a strong man might extend his flexed arm or flex his extended arm disappeared from the Brahmaworld and reappeared in front of the Blessed One
Arranging his upper robe over one shoulder he knelt down with his right knee on the ground saluted the Blessed One with his hands before his heart and said to him So it is O Blessed One
So it is O One Wellgone
The Blessed One has turned away the community of monks
But here there are monks who are new  not long gone forth only recently come to this Dhamma  discipline
If they do not see the Blessed One there may be alteration in them there may be change
Just as when a young calf does not see its mother Just as when young seedlings don't get water in the same way there are monks who are new  not long gone forth only recently come to this Dhamma  discipline
If they do not see the Blessed One there may be alteration in them there may be change
Let the Blessed One delight in the community of monks
Let the Blessed One welcome the community of monks
Let the Blessed One aid the community of monks as he did before
The Blessed One acquiesced with silence
Then Brahma Sahampati sensing the Blessed One's acquiescence bowed down to the Blessed One and after circumambulating him disappeared right there
Then the Blessed One emerging from seclusion in the evening went to the Banyan Park
On arrival he sat down on a seat made ready
After he had sat down he worked a psychic feat such that the monks went to him contritely in ones and twos
On arrival they bowed down to him and sat to one side
As they were sitting there the Blessed One said to them Monks this is the lowliest form of livelihood that of an almsgoer
A term of abuse in the world is 'You go about as an almsgoer with a bowl in your hand' And yet sons of good family take up with compelling reason in dependence on a compelling reason  not coerced by kings nor coerced by thieves nor from debt nor from fear nor to earn a livelihood but 'I am oppressed with birth aging  death with sorrows lamentations pains distresses  despairs
I am oppressed with stress overcome with stress
Perhaps an ending of this entire mass of suffering  stress might be found'
And although this son of a good family has gone forth in this way he is covetous with strong passion for sensual desires with a mind of ill will of corrupt resolves his mindfulness muddled unalert unconcentrated his mind distracted loose in his sense faculties
Just as a log from a funeral pyre burning at both ends smeared with excrement in the middle fills no use as timber either in the village or in the wilderness I speak of this person with this comparison
He has missed out on the enjoyments of the householder and yet does not fulfill the goal of the contemplative life
Monks there are these three types of unskillful thinking thinking of sensuality thinking of ill will thinking of harm
These three types of unskillful thinking cease without remainder in one who dwells with his mind well established in the four frames of reference or who develops the themeless concentrationThis is reason enough monks to develop the themeless concentration
The themeless concentration when developed  pursued is of great fruit great benefit
Monks there are these two views the view of becoming and the view of nonbecoming
There the instructed disciple of the noble ones considers thus 'Is there anything in the world to which I could cling without being blameworthy' He discerns 'There is nothing in the world to which I could cling without being blameworthy' He discerns 'In clinging I would be clinging just to form
In clinging I would be clinging just to feeling perception fabrications
In clinging I would be clinging just to consciousness
From that clinging of mine as a requisite condition would come becoming
From becoming as a requisite condition birth
From birth as a requisite condition then aging illness  death sorrow lamentation pain distress  despair would come into play
Thus would be the origination of this entire mass of suffering  stress'
What do you think monks  Is form constant or inconstant
Inconstant lord
And is that which is inconstant easeful or stressful
Stressful lord
And is it fitting to regard what is inconstant stressful subject to change as 'This is mine
This is my self
This is what I am'
No lord
 Is feeling constant or inconstant  Inconstant lord
 Is perception constant or inconstant  Inconstant lord
 Are fabrications constant or inconstant  Inconstant lord
What do you think monks  Is consciousness constant or inconstant
Inconstant lord
And is that which is inconstant easeful or stressful
Stressful lord
And is it fitting to regard what is inconstant stressful subject to change as 'This is mine
This is my self
This is what I am'
No lord
Thus monks any form whatsoever that is past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or near every form is to be seen as it actually is with right discernment as 'This is not mine
This is not my self
This is not what I am'
Any feeling whatsoever
Any perception whatsoever
Any fabrications whatsoever
Any consciousness whatsoever that is past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or near every consciousness is to be seen as it actually is with right discernment as 'This is not mine
This is not my self
This is not what I am'
Seeing thus the instructed disciple of the noble ones grows disenchanted with form disenchanted with feeling disenchanted with perception disenchanted with fabrications disenchanted with consciousness
Through disenchantment he becomes dispassionate
Through dispassion he is fully released
With full release there is the knowledge 'Fully released' He discerns that 'Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task done
There is nothing further for this world' See also Iti
At Savatthi
Monks any brahmans or contemplatives who recollect their manifold past lives all recollect the five clingingaggregates or one among them
Which five
When recollecting 'I was one with such a form in the past' one is recollecting just form
Or when recollecting 'I was one with such a feeling in the past' one is recollecting just feeling
Or when recollecting 'I was one with such a perception in the past' one is recollecting just perception
Or when recollecting 'I was one with such mental fabrications in the past' one is recollecting just mental fabrications
Or when recollecting 'I was one with such a consciousness in the past' one is recollecting just consciousness
And why do you call it 'form'
Because it is afflicted thus it is called 'form' Afflicted with what
With cold  heat  hunger  thirst with the touch of flies mosquitoes wind sun  reptiles
Because it is afflicted it is called form
And why do you call it 'feeling'
Because it feels thus it is called 'feeling' What does it feel
It feels pleasure it feels pain it feels neitherpleasurenorpain
Because it feels it is called feeling
And why do you call it 'perception'
Because it perceives thus it is called 'perception' What does it perceive
It perceives blue it perceives yellow it perceives red it perceives white
Because it perceives it is called perception
And why do you call them 'fabrications'
Because they fabricate fabricated things thus they are called 'fabrications' What do they fabricate as a fabricated thing
For the sake of formness they fabricate form as a fabricated thing
For the sake of feelingness they fabricate feeling as a fabricated thing
For the sake of perceptionhood For the sake of fabricationhood For the sake of consciousnesshood they fabricate consciousness as a fabricated thing
Because they fabricate fabricated things they are called fabrications

And why do you call it 'consciousness'
Because it cognizes thus it is called consciousness
What does it cognize
It cognizes what is sour bitter pungent sweet alkaline nonalkaline salty  unsalty
Because it cognizes it is called consciousness
Thus an instructed disciple of the noble ones reflects in this way 'I am now being chewed up by form
But in the past I was also chewed up by form in the same way I am now being chewed up by present form
And if I delight in future form then in the future I will be chewed up by form in the same way I am now being chewed up by present form' Having reflected in this way he becomes indifferent to past form does not delight in future form and is practicing for the sake of disenchantment dispassion and cessation with regard to present form
 ''I am now being chewed up by feeling perception fabrications consciousness
But in the past I was also chewed up by consciousness in the same way I am now being chewed up by present consciousness
And if I delight in future consciousness then in the future I will be chewed up by consciousness in the same way I am now being chewed up by present consciousness' Having reflected in this way he becomes indifferent to past consciousness does not delight in future consciousness and is practicing for the sake of disenchantment dispassion and cessation with regard to present consciousness
What do you think monks  Is form constant or inconstant Inconstant lord And is that which is inconstant easeful or stressful Stressful lord And is it fitting to regard what is inconstant stressful subject to change as 'This is mine

This is what I am'
No lord

No lord
Thus monks any form whatsoever that is past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or near every form is to be seen as it actually is with right discernment as 'This is not mine
This is not my self
This is not what I am'
Any feeling whatsoever
Any perception whatsoever

Disenchanted he becomes dispassionate
Through dispassion he is fully released
With full release there is the knowledge 'Fully released' He discerns that 'Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task done
There is nothing further for this world'
This monks is called a disciple of the noble ones who neither builds up nor tears down but who stands having torn down who neither clings nor abandons but who stands having abandoned who neither pulls in nor discards but who stands having discarded who neither piles up nor scatters but who stands having scattered

And to the monk whose mind is thus released the devas together with Indra the Brahmas  Pajapati pay homage even from afar
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying at Varanasi in the Game Refuge at Isipatana
There he addressed the group of five monks
Form monks is not self
If form were the self this form would not lend itself to disease
It would be possible with regard to form 'Let this form be thus
Let this form not be thus' But precisely because form is not self form lends itself to disease
And it is not possible with regard to form 'Let this form be thus
Let this form not be thus'
Feeling is not self
Perception is not self
 fabrications are not self
Consciousness is not self
If consciousness were the self this consciousness would not lend itself to disease
It would be possible with regard to consciousness 'Let my consciousness be thus
Let my consciousness not be thus' But precisely because consciousness is not self consciousness lends itself to disease
And it is not possible with regard to consciousness 'Let my consciousness be thus
Let my consciousness not be thus'
What do you think monks  Is form constant or inconstant
Inconstant lord
And is that which is inconstant easeful or stressful
Stressful lord
And is it fitting to regard what is inconstant stressful subject to change as 'This is mine
This is my self
This is what I am'
No lord
Is feeling constant or inconstant
Inconstant lord
Is perception constant or inconstant
Inconstant lord
Are fabrications constant or inconstant
Inconstant lord
What do you think monks  Is consciousness constant or inconstant
Inconstant lord
And is that which is inconstant easeful or stressful
Stressful lord
And is it fitting to regard what is inconstant stressful subject to change as 'This is mine
This is my self
This is what I am'
No lord
Thus monks any form whatsoever that is past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or near every form is to be seen as it actually is with right discernment as 'This is not mine
This is not my self
This is not what I am'
Any feeling whatsoever
Any perception whatsoever
Any fabrications whatsoever
Any consciousness whatsoever that is past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or near every consciousness is to be seen as it actually is with right discernment as 'This is not mine
This is not my self
This is not what I am'
Seeing thus the wellinstructed disciple of the noble ones grows disenchanted with form disenchanted with feeling disenchanted with perception disenchanted with fabrications disenchanted with consciousness
Disenchanted he becomes dispassionate
Through dispassion he is fully released
With full release there is the knowledge 'Fully released' He discerns that 'Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task done
There is nothing further for this world' That is what the Blessed One said
Gratified the group of five monks delighted at his words
And while this explanation was being given the hearts of the group of five monks through not clinging were fully released from fermentationeffluents
At Savatthi Monks the Tathagata  the worthy one the rightly selfawakened one who from disenchantment with form from dispassion from cessation from lack of clinging is released  is termed 'rightly selfawakened' And a discernmentreleased monk  who from disenchantment with form from dispassion from cessation from lack of clinging is released  is termed 'discernmentreleased'
The Tathagata  the worthy one the rightly selfawakened one who from disenchantment with feeling perception fabrication from dispassion from cessation from lack of clinging is released  is termed 'rightly selfawakened' And a discernmentreleased monk  who from disenchantment with feeling perception fabrication from dispassion from cessation from lack of clinging is released  is termed 'discernmentreleased'
The Tathagata  the worthy one the rightly selfawakened one who from disenchantment with consciousness from dispassion from cessation from lack of clinging is released  is termed 'rightly selfawakened' And a discernmentreleased monk  who from disenchantment with consciousness from dispassion from cessation from lack of clinging is released  is termed 'discernmentreleased'
So what difference what distinction what distinguishing factor is there between one rightly selfawakened and a monk discernmentreleased
For us lord the teachings have the Blessed One as their root their guide  their arbitrator
It would be good if the Blessed One himself would explicate the meaning of this statement
Having heard it from the Blessed One the monks will remember it
In that case monks listen  pay close attention
I will speak
As you say lord the monks responded
The Blessed One said The Tathagata  the worthy one the rightly selfawakened one  is the one who gives rise to the path unarisen who engenders the path unengendered who points out the path not pointed out
He knows the path is expert in the path is adept at the path
And his disciples now keep following the path and afterwards become endowed with the path
This is the difference this the distinction this the distinguishing between one rightly selfawakened and a monk discernmentreleased
Translator's note The term seven bases here can also mean the seven notes of the musical scale and it is possible that the phrase three modes of investigation may also be borrowed from musical theory it may refer to three ways of testing a musical scale once it has been tuned
Thus in this discourse the Buddha may be borrowing terms commonly used to describe a consummate musician and applying them to his description of a consummate meditator
The Commentary for its part singles out this discourse as being one that entices a serious meditator to practice
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying at Savatthi in Jeta's Grove Anathapindika's Monastery
There he addressed the monks Monks
Yes lord the monks replied to the Blessed One
The Blessed One said Monks a monk who is skilled in seven bases and has three modes of investigation is fulfilled  fully accomplished in this doctrine  discipline  the ultimate person
And how is a monk skilled in seven bases
There is the case where a monk discerns form the origination of form the cessation of form the path of practice leading to the cessation of form
He discerns the allure of form the drawback of form and the escape from form
He discerns feeling He discerns perception He discerns fabrications
He discerns consciousness the origination of consciousness the cessation of consciousness the path of practice leading to the cessation of consciousness
He discerns the allure of consciousness the drawback of consciousness and the escape from consciousness
And what is form
The four great existents and the form derived from them this is called form
From the origination of nutriment comes the origination of form
From the cessation of nutriment comes the cessation of form
And just this noble eightfold path is the path of practice leading to the cessation of form ie right view right resolve right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness right concentration
The fact that pleasure  happiness arises in dependence on form that is the allure of form

Those who are wellreleased are fully accomplished

This is how a monk is skilled in seven bases
And how does a monk have three modes of investigation
There is the case where a monk investigates in terms of properties investigates in terms of sense spheres investigates in terms of dependent coarising
This is how a monk has three modes of investigation
A monk who is skilled in seven bases and has three modes of investigation is fulfilled and fully accomplished in this doctrine  discipline  the ultimate person

There the Blessed One said Monks there are these five clingingaggregates
Which five
Form as a clingingaggregate feeling as a clingingaggregate perception as a clingingaggregate fabrications as a clingingaggregate consciousness as an a clingingaggregate
Now as long as I did not have direct knowledge of the fourfold round with regard to these five clingingaggregates I did not claim to have directly awakened to the unexcelled right selfawakening in this cosmos with its devas Maras  Brahmas in this generation with its brahmans  contemplatives its royalty  common people

I had direct knowledge of form of the origination of form of the cessation of form of the path of practice leading to the cessation of form

At Savatthi
There the Blessed One exclaimed this exclamation 'It should not be it should not occur to me it will not be it will not occur to me' a monk set on this would break the lower fetters
When this was said a certain monk said to the Blessed One In what way would a monk set on this  'It should not be it should not occur to me it will not be it will not occur to me'  break the lower fetters
There is the case monk where an uninstructed runofthemill person  who has no regard for noble ones is not wellversed or disciplined in their Dhamma who has no regard for men of integrity is not wellversed or disciplined in their Dhamma  assumes form to be the self or the self as possessing form or form as in the self or the self as in form
He assumes feeling to be the self or the self as possessing feeling or feeling as in the self or the self as in feeling
He assumes perception to be the self or the self as possessing perception or perception as in the self or the self as in perception
He assumes fabrications to be the self or the self as possessing fabrications or fabrications as in the self or the self as in fabrications
He assumes consciousness to be the self or the self as possessing consciousness or consciousness as in the self or the self as in consciousness
He does not discern as it actually is inconstant form as 'inconstant form' He does not discern as it actually is inconstant feeling as 'inconstant feeling' inconstant perception as 'inconstant perception' inconstant fabrications as 'inconstant fabrications' inconstant consciousness as 'inconstant consciousness'
He does not discern as it actually is stressful form as 'stressful form' stressful feeling as 'stressful feeling' stressful perception as 'stressful perception' stressful fabrications as 'stressful fabrications' stressful consciousness as 'stressful consciousness'
He does not discern as it actually is notself form as 'notself form' notself feeling as 'notself feeling' notself perception as 'notself perception' notself fabrications as 'notself fabrications' notself consciousness as 'notself consciousness'
He does not discern as it actually is fabricated form as 'fabricated form' fabricated feeling as 'fabricated feeling' fabricated perception as 'fabricated perception' fabricated fabrications as 'fabricated fabrications' fabricated consciousness as 'fabricated consciousness'
He does not discern as it actually is that 'form will stop being' 'feeling will stop being' 'perception will stop being' 'fabrications will stop being' 'consciousness will stop being'
Now a wellinstructed disciple of the noble ones  who has regard for noble ones is wellversed  disciplined in their Dhamma who has regard for men of integrity is wellversed  disciplined in their Dhamma  does not assume form to be the self or the self as possessing form or form as in the self or the self as in form
He does not assume feeling to be the self does not assume perception to be the self does not assume fabrications to be the self He does not assume consciousness to be the self or the self as possessing consciousness or consciousness as in the self or the self as in consciousness
He discerns as it actually is inconstant form as 'inconstant form' inconstant feeling as 'inconstant feeling' inconstant perception as 'inconstant perception' inconstant fabrications as 'inconstant fabrications' inconstant consciousness as 'inconstant consciousness'
He discerns as it actually is stressful form as 'stressful form' stressful feeling as 'stressful feeling' stressful perception as 'stressful perception' stressful fabrications as 'stressful fabrications' stressful consciousness as 'stressful consciousness'
He discerns as it actually is notself form as 'notself form' notself feeling as 'notself feeling' notself perception as 'notself perception' notself fabrications as 'notself fabrications' notself consciousness as 'notself consciousness'
He discerns as it actually is fabricated form as 'fabricated form' fabricated feeling as 'fabricated feeling' fabricated perception as 'fabricated perception' fabricated fabrications as 'fabricated fabrications' fabricated consciousness as 'fabricated consciousness'
He discerns as it actually is that 'form will stop being' 'feeling will stop being' 'perception will stop being' 'fabrications will stop being' 'consciousness will stop being'
From the stopping of form from the stopping of feeling of perception of fabrications of consciousness a monk set on this  'It should not be it should not occur to me it will not be it will not occur to me'  would break the lower fetters
Lord a monk set on this would break the lower fetters
But for one knowing in what way seeing in what way is there the immediate ending of fermentations
There is the case where an uninstructed runofthemill person falls into fear over what is not grounds for fear
There is fear for an uninstructed runofthemill person 'It should not be it should not occur to me it will not be it will not occur to me' But an instructed disciple of the noble ones does not fall into fear over what is not grounds for fear
There is no fear for an instructed disciple of the noble ones 'It should not be it should not occur to me it will not be it will not occur to me'
Should consciousness when standing stand attached to form supported by form established on form watered with delight it would exhibit growth increase  proliferation
Should consciousness when standing stand attached to feeling supported by feeling established on feeling watered with delight it would exhibit growth increase  proliferation
Should consciousness when standing stand attached to perception supported by perception established on perception watered with delight it would exhibit growth increase  proliferation
Should consciousness when standing stand attached to fabrications supported by fabrications established on fabrications watered with delight it would exhibit growth increase  proliferation
Were someone to say 'I will describe a coming a going a passing away an arising a growth an increase or a proliferation of consciousness apart from form from feeling from perception from fabrications' that would be impossible
If a monk abandons passion for the property of form
If a monk abandons passion for the property of feeling
If a monk abandons passion for the property of perception
If a monk abandons passion for the property of fabrications
If a monk abandons passion for the property of consciousness then owing to the abandonment of passion the support is cut off and there is no base for consciousness
Consciousness thus unestablished not proliferating not performing any function is released
Owing to its release it stands still
Owing to its stillness it is contented
Owing to its contentment it is not agitated
Not agitated he is totally unbound right within
He discerns that 'Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task done
There is nothing further for this world'
For one knowing in this way seeing in this way monk there is the immediate ending of fermentations

Now at that time uncertainty arose in the monks with regard to this and that item Now what is allowed by the Blessed One
What is not allowed They told this matter to the Blessed One
Bhikkhus whatever I have not objected to saying 'This is not allowable' if it fits in with what is not allowable if it goes against what is allowable this is not allowable for you
Whatever I have not objected to saying 'This is not allowable' if it fits in with what is allowable if it goes against what is not allowable this is allowable for you

Now at that time the wanderer Sañjaya was residing in Rajagaha with a large company of wanderers  in all
And at that time Sariputta and Moggallana were practicing the holy life under Sañjaya
They had made this agreement Whoever attains the Deathless first will inform the other
Then Ven
Assaji arising early in the morning taking his robe and bowl entered Rajagaha for alms gracious in the way he approached and departed looked forward and behind drew in and stretched out his arm his eyes downcast his every movement consummate
Sariputta the wanderer saw Ven
Assaji going for alms in Rajagaha gracious his eyes downcast his every movement consummate
On seeing him the thought occurred to him Surely of those in this world who are arahants or have entered the path to arahantship this is one
What if I were to approach him and question him 'On whose account have you gone forth
Or who is your teacher
Or in whose Dhamma do you delight' But then the thought occurred to Sariputta the wanderer This is the wrong time to question him
He is going for alms in the town
What if I were to follow behind this monk who has found the path for those who seek it
Then Ven
Assaji having gone for alms in Rajagaha left taking his alms
Then Sariputta the wanderer approached him and on arrival exchanged courteous greetings with him
After an exchange of friendly greetings  courtesies he stood to one side
As he was standing there he said Bright are your faculties my friend pure your complexion and clear
On whose account have you gone forth
Or who is your teacher
Or in whose Dhamma do you delight
There is my friend the Great Contemplative a son of the Sakyans gone forth from a Sakyan family
I have gone forth on account of that Blessed One
That Blessed One is my teacher
And it is in that Blessed One's Dhamma that I delight
But what is your teacher's teaching
What does he proclaim''
I am new my friend not long gone forth only recently come to this Dhamma  Discipline
I cannot explain the Dhamma in detail but I will tell you the gist in brief
Then Sariputta the wanderer spoke thus to the Ven
Assaji
Then Ven
Assaji gave this Dhamma exposition to Sariputta the Wanderer
Then to Sariputta the wanderer as he heard this Dhamma exposition there arose the dustless stainless Dhamma eye Whatever is subject to origination is all subject to cessation
Then Sariputta the wanderer went to Moggallana the wanderer
Moggallana the wanderer saw him coming from afar and on seeing him said Bright are your faculties my friend pure your complexion and clear
Could it be that you have attained the Deathless
Yes my friend I have attained the Deathless

But how friend did you attain the Deathless
Just now friend I saw Ven
Assaji going for alms in Rajagaha gracious in the way he approached and departed looked forward and behind drew in and stretched out his arm his eyes downcast his every movement consummate
On seeing him the thought occurred to me 'Surely of those in this world who are arahants or have entered the path to arahantship this is one
What if I were to approach him and question him On whose account have you gone forth
Or who is your teacher

'But what is your teacher's teaching
What does he proclaim'
'I am new my friend not long gone forth only recently come to this Dhamma  Discipline
I cannot explain the doctrine to you in detail but I will tell you the gist in brief'
Then Ven
Assaji gave me this Dhamma exposition
Then to Moggallana the wanderer as he heard this Dhamma exposition there arose the dustless stainless Dhamma eye Whatever is subject to origination is all subject to cessation

There the Blessed One said Monks I will teach you the five aggregates  the five clingingaggregates
Listen  pay close attention
I will speak
As you say lord the monks responded
The Blessed One said Now what monks are the five aggregates
Whatever form is past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or near That is called the form aggregate
Whatever feeling is past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or near That is called the feeling aggregate
Whatever perception is past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or near That is called the perception aggregate
Whatever fabrications are past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or near Those are called the fabrications aggregate
Whatever consciousness is past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or near That is called the consciousness aggregate
These are called the five aggregates
And what are the five clingingaggregates
Whatever form  past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or near  is clingable offers sustenance and is accompanied with mental fermentation That is called the form clingingaggregate
Whatever feeling  past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or near  is clingable offers sustenance and is accompanied with mental fermentation That is called the feeling clingingaggregate
Whatever perception  past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or near  is clingable offers sustenance and is accompanied with mental fermentation That is called the perception clingingaggregate
Whatever fabrications  past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or near  are clingable offer sustenance and are accompanied with mental fermentation Those are called the fabrications clingingaggregate
Whatever consciousness  past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or near  is clingable offers sustenance and is accompanied with mental fermentation That is called the consciousness clingingaggregate
These are called the five clingingaggregates
At Savatthi
There the Blessed One said One attached is unreleased one unattached is released
Should consciousness when standing stand attached to form supported by form landing on form watered with delight it would exhibit growth increase  proliferation
Should consciousness when standing stand attached to feeling supported by feeling landing on feeling watered with delight it would exhibit growth increase  proliferation
Should consciousness when standing stand attached to perception supported by perception landing on perception watered with delight it would exhibit growth increase  proliferation
Should consciousness when standing stand attached to fabrications supported by fabrications landing on fabrications watered with delight it would exhibit growth increase  proliferation
Were someone to say 'I will describe a coming a going a passing away an arising a growth an increase or a proliferation of consciousness apart from form from feeling from perception from fabrications' that would be impossible
If a monk abandons passion for the property of form
If a monk abandons passion for the property of feeling
If a monk abandons passion for the property of perception
If a monk abandons passion for the property of fabrications
If a monk abandons passion for the property of consciousness then owing to the abandonment of passion the support is cut off and there is no landing of consciousness
Consciousness thus not having landed not increasing not concocting is released
Owing to its release it is steady
Owing to its steadiness it is contented
Owing to its contentment it is not agitated
Not agitated he is totally unbound right within
He discerns that 'Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task done
There is nothing further for this world' See also SN SN
Monks those recluses and brahmans who regard the self in various ways do so in terms of the five groups of clinging or some of them
Which five
Here monks the uninstructed worldling regards body as the self the self as having body body as being in the self or the self as being in the body
So this way of regarding arises it occurs to him to think 'I am'
Now when it has occurred to him to think 'I am' the five faculties come into play  the faculties of eye ear nose tongue and body
Monks there is mind there are mindobjects there is the element of ignorance
The uninstructed worldling touched by the feeling born of contact with ignorance thinks 'I am' 'I am this' 'things will be' 'things will not be' 'things will be embodied' 'things will be disembodied' 'things will be conscious' 'things will be unconscious' 'things will be neither consciousnorunconscious'
It is just in this way monks that the five faculties persist
But here for the well taught Ariyan disciple ignorance is abandoned and knowledge arises
With the waning of ignorance and the arising of knowledge he does not come to think 'I am' 'I am this' 'things will be' 'things will not be' 'things will be embodied' 'things will be disembodied' 'things will be conscious' 'things will be unconscious' 'things will be neither consciousnorunconscious'
At Savatthi
There the Blessed One said Monks whatever contemplatives or brahmans who assume in various ways when assuming a self all assume the five clingingaggregates or a certain one of them
Which five
There is the case where an uninstructed runofthemill person  who has no regard for noble ones is not wellversed or disciplined in their Dhamma who has no regard for men of integrity is not wellversed or disciplined in their Dhamma  assumes form to be the self or the self as possessing form or form as in the self or the self as in form
He assumes feeling to be the self or the self as possessing feeling or feeling as in the self or the self as in feeling
He assumes perception to be the self or the self as possessing perception or perception as in the self or the self as in perception
He assumes fabrications to be the self or the self as possessing fabrications or fabrications as in the self or the self as in fabrications
He assumes consciousness to be the self or the self as possessing consciousness or consciousness as in the self or the self as in consciousness
Thus both this assumption  the understanding 'I am' occur to him
And so it is with reference to the understanding 'I am' that there is the appearance of the five faculties  eye ear nose tongue  body
Now there is the intellect there are ideas there is the property of ignorance
To an uninstructed runofthemill person touched by experience born of the contact of ignorance there occur 'I am' 'I am thus' 'I shall be' 'I shall not be' 'I shall be possessed of form' 'I shall be formless' 'I shall be percipient' 'I shall be nonpercipient' or 'I shall be neither percipient nor nonpercipient'
The five faculties monks continue as they were
And with regard to them the wellinstructed disciple of the noble ones abandons ignorance and gives rise to clear knowing
Owing to the fading of ignorance and the arising of clear knowing  'I am' 'I am this' 'I shall be' 'I shall not be' 'I shall be possessed of form' 'I shall be formless' 'I shall be percipient' 'I shall be nonpercipient' and 'I shall be neither percipient nor nonpercipient'  do not occur to him
Once monks in Varanasi Brahmadatta was the king of Kasi  rich prosperous with many possessions many troops many vehicles many territories with fullystocked armories  granaries
Dighiti was the king of Kosala  poor not very prosperous with few possessions few troops few vehicles few territories with poorlystocked armories  granaries
So Brahmadatta the king of Kasi raising a fourfold army marched against Dighiti the king of Kosala
Dighiti the king of Kosala heard Brahmadatta the king of Kasi they say has raised a fourfold army and is marching against me Then the thought occurred to him King Brahmadatta is rich prosperous with fullystocked armories  granaries whereas I am poor with poorlystocked armories  granaries
I am not competent to stand against even one attack by him
Why don't I slip out of the city beforehand So taking his chief consort he slipped out of the city beforehand
Then King Brahmadatta conquering the troops vehicles lands armories  granaries of King Dighiti lived in lordship over them
Meanwhile King Dighiti had set out for Varanasi together with his consort and traveling by stages arrived there
There he lived with her on the outskirts of Varanasi in a potter's house disguised as a wanderer
Not long afterwards she became pregnant
She had a pregnancy wish of this sort she wanted to see a fourfold army armed  arrayed standing on a parade ground at dawn and to drink the water used for washing the swords
She said to King Dighiti Your majesty I am pregnant and I have a pregnancy wish of this sort I want to see a fourfold army armed  arrayed standing on a parade ground at dawn and to drink the water used for washing the swords He said My queen where is there for us  fallen on hard times  a fourfold army armed  arrayed standing on a parade ground and water used for washing the swords
If I don't get this your majesty I will die
Now at that time the brahman adviser to King Brahmadatta was a friend of King Dighiti
So King Dighiti went to him and on arrival said A lady friend of yours old friend is pregnant and she has a pregnancy wish of this sort she wants to see a fourfold army armed  arrayed standing on a parade ground at dawn and to drink the water used for washing the swords
In that case let me see her
So King Dighiti's consort went to King Brahmadatta's brahman adviser
When he saw her coming from afar he rose from his seat arranged his robe over one shoulder and with his hands raised in salutation to her exclaimed three times Surely the king of Kosala has come to your womb
Surely the king of Kosala has come to your womb
Don't be worried my queen
You will get to see a fourfold army armed  arrayed standing on a parade ground at dawn and to drink the water used for washing the swords
Then he went to King Brahmadatta and on arrival said to him Your majesty signs have appeared such that tomorrow at dawn a fourfold army armed  arrayed should stand on a parade ground and that the swords should be washed
So King Brahmadatta ordered his people I say then Do as the brahman adviser says Thus King Dighiti's chief consort got to see a fourfold army armed  arrayed standing on a parade ground at dawn and got to drink the water used for washing the swords
Then with the maturing of the fetus she gave birth to a son whom they named Dighavu
Not long afterwards Prince Dighavu reached the age of discretion
The thought occurred to King Dighiti This King Brahmadatta of Kasi has done us great harm
He has seized our troops vehicles lands armories  granaries
If he finds out about us he will have all three of us killed
Why don't I send Prince Dighavu to live outside of the city So Prince Dighavu having gone to live outside of the city learned all the crafts
Now at that time King Dighiti's barber had gone over to King Brahmadatta
He saw King Dighiti together with his consort living on the outskirts of Varanasi in a potter's house disguised as a wanderer
On seeing them he went to King Brahmadatta and on arrival said to him Your majesty King Dighiti of Kosala together with his consort is living on the outskirts of Varanasi in a potter's house disguised as a wanderer
So King Brahmadatta ordered his people I say then go fetch King Dighiti together with his consort
Responding As you say your majesty they went and fetched King Dighiti together with his consort
Then King Brahmadatta ordered his people I say then having bound King Dighiti  his consort with a stout rope with their arms pinned tightly against their backs and having shaved them bald march them to a harshsounding drum from street to street crossroads to crossroads evict them out the south gate of the city and there to the south of the city cut them into four pieces and bury them in holes placed in the four directions
Responding As you say your majesty the king's people bound King Dighiti  his consort with a stout rope pinning their arms tightly against their backs shaved them bald and marched them to a harshsounding drum from street to street crossroads to crossroads
Then the thought occurred to Prince Dighavu It's been a long time since I saw my mother  father
What if I were to go see them So he entered Varanasi and saw his mother  father bound with a stout rope their arms pinned tightly against their backs their heads shaven bald being marched to a harshsounding drum from street to street crossroads to crossroads
So he went to them
King Dighiti saw Prince Dighavu coming from afar and on seeing him said Don't my dear Dighavu be farsighted
Don't be nearsighted
For vengeance is not settled through vengeance
Vengeance is settled through nonvengeance
When this was said the people said to him This King Dighiti has gone crazy
He's talking nonsense
Who is Dighavu
Why is he saying 'Don't my dear Dighavu be farsighted
Don't be nearsighted
For vengeance is not settled through vengeance
Vengeance is settled through nonvengeance'
I'm not crazy or talking nonsense
He who knows will understand Then a second time a third time he said Don't my dear Dighavu be farsighted
Don't be nearsighted
For vengeance is not settled through vengeance
Vengeance is settled through nonvengeance
A third time the people said to him This King Dighiti has gone crazy
He's talking nonsense
Who is Dighavu
Why is he saying 'Don't my dear Dighavu be farsighted
Don't be nearsighted
For vengeance is not settled through vengeance
Vengeance is settled through nonvengeance'
I'm not crazy or talking nonsense
He who knows will understand
Then the king's people having marched King Dighiti together with his chief consort to a harshsounding drum from street to street crossroads to crossroads evicted them out the south gate of the city and there to the south of the city cut them into four pieces buried them in holes placed in the four directions stationed guards and left
Then Prince Dighavu having entered Varanasi brought out some liquor and got the guards to drink it
When they had fallen down drunk he collected sticks made a pyre raised the bodies of his mother  father onto the pyre set fire to it and then circumambulated it three times with his hands raised in salutation
Now at that time King Brahmadatta had gone up to the terrace on top of his palace
He saw Prince Dighavu circumambulating the pyre three times with his hands raised in salutation and on seeing him the thought occurred to him Doubtlessly this person is a relative or bloodkinsman of King Dighiti
Ah how unfortunate for me for there is no one who will tell me what this means
Then Prince Dighavu having gone into the wilderness and having cried  wept as much as he needed to dried his tears and entered Varanasi
Going to an elephant stable next to the king's palace he said to the chief elephant trainer Teacher I want to learn this craft
In that case young man you may learn it
Then rising in the last watch of the night Prince Dighavu sang in a sweet voice and played the lute in the elephant stable
King Brahmadatta also rising in the last watch of the night heard the sweetvoiced singing  luteplaying in the elephant stable
On hearing it he asked his people I say Who was that rising in the last watch of the night singing in a sweet voice and playing a lute in the elephant stable
Your majesty a young man  the student of suchandsuch an elephant trainer rising in the last watch of the night was singing in a sweet voice and playing a lute in the elephant stable
I say then go fetch that young man
Responding As you say your majesty they went and fetched Prince Dighavu
Then King Brahmadatta said to Prince Dighavu I say Was that you rising in the last watch of the night singing in a sweet voice and playing a lute in the elephant stable
Yes your majesty
I say then my young man sing and play the lute
Responding As you say your majesty and seeking to win favor Prince Dighavu sang with a sweet voice and played the lute
Then King Brahmadatta said to him I say You my young man are to stay and attend to me
As you say your majesty Prince Dighavu replied
Then he rose in the morning before King Brahmadatta went to bed in the evening after him did whatever the king ordered always acting to please him speaking politely to him
And it was not long before King Brahmadatta placed the prince close to him in a position of trust
Then one day King Brahmadatta said to Prince Dighavu I say then my young man harness the chariot
I'm going hunting
Responding As you say your majesty Prince Dighavu harnessed the chariot and then said to King Brahmadatta Your chariot is harnessed your majesty
Now is the time for you to do as you see fit
Then King Brahmadatta mounted the chariot and Prince Dighavu drove it
He drove it in such a way that the king's entourage went one way and the chariot another
Then after they had gone far King Brahmadatta said to Prince Dighavu I say then my young man unharness the chariot
I'm tired
I'm going to lie down
Responding As you say your majesty Prince Dighavu unharnessed the chariot and sat down crosslegged on the ground
Then King Brahmadatta lay down placing his head on Prince Dighavu's lap
As he was tired he went to sleep right away
Then the thought occurred to Prince Dighavu This King Brahmadatta of Kasi has done us great harm
He has seized our troops vehicles lands armories  granaries
And it was because of him that my mother  father were killed
Now is my chance to wreak vengeance He drew his sword from his scabbard
But then he thought My father told me as he was about to die 'Don't my dear Dighavu be farsighted
Don't be nearsighted
For vengeance is not settled through vengeance
Vengeance is settled through nonvengeance' It would not be proper for me to transgress my father's words So he put his sword back in its scabbard
A second time A third time the thought occurred to Prince Dighavu This King Brahmadatta of Kasi has done us great harm
He has seized our troops vehicles lands armories  granaries
And it was because of him that my mother  father were killed
Now is my chance to wreak vengeance He drew his sword from his scabbard
But then he thought My father told me as he was about to die 'Don't my dear Dighavu be farsighted
Don't be nearsighted
For vengeance is not settled through vengeance
Vengeance is settled through nonvengeance' It would not be proper for me to transgress my father's words So once again he put his sword back in its scabbard
Then King Brahmadatta suddenly got up  frightened agitated unnerved alarmed
Prince Dighavu said to him Your majesty why have you gotten up suddenly  frightened agitated unnerved  alarmed
I say my young man Just now as I was dreaming Prince Dighavu  son of Dighiti king of Kasi  struck me down with a sword Then Prince Dighavu grabbing King Brahmadatta by the head with his left hand and drawing his sword from its scabbard with his right said I your majesty am that very Prince Dighavu son of Dighiti king of Kasi
You have done us great harm
You have seized our troops vehicles lands armories  granaries
And it was because of you that my mother  father were killed
Now is my chance to wreak vengeance
So King Brahmadatta dropping his head down to Prince Dighavu's feet said Grant me my life my dear Dighavu
Grant me my life my dear Dighavu
Who am I that I would dare grant life to your majesty
It is your majesty who should grant life to me
In that case my dear Dighavu you grant me my life and I grant you your life
Then King Brahmadatta and Prince Dighavu granted one another their lives and taking one another by the hands swore an oath to do one another no harm
Then King Brahmadatta said to Prince Dighavu In that case my dear Dighavu harness the chariot
We will go on
Responding As you say your majesty Prince Dighavu harnessed the chariot and then said to King Brahmadatta Your chariot is harnessed your majesty
Now is the time for you to do as you see fit
Then King Brahmadatta mounted the chariot and Prince Dighavu drove it
He drove it in such a way that it was not long before they met up with the king's entourage
Then King Brahmadatta having entered Varanasi had his ministers  councilors convened and said to them I say then
If you were to see Prince Dighavu the son of Dighiti the king of Kasi what would you do to him
Different ministers said We would cut of his hands your majesty  We would cut off his feet your majesty  We would cut off his hands  feet your majesty  We would cut off his ears your majesty  We would cut off his nose your majesty  We would cut off his ears  nose your majesty  We would cut off his head your majesty
Then the king said This I say is Prince Dighavu the son of Dighiti the king of Kasi
You are not allowed to do anything to him
It was by him that my life was granted to me and it was by me that his life was granted to him
Then King Brahmadatta said to Prince Dighavu What your father said to you as he was about to die  'Don't my dear Dighavu be farsighted
Don't be nearsighted
For vengeance is not settled through vengeance
Vengeance is settled through nonvengeance'  in reference to what did he say that
What my father said to me as he was about to die  'Don't be farsighted'  'Don't bear vengeance for a long time' is what he was saying to me as he was about to die
And what he said to me as he was about to die  'Don't be nearsighted'  'Don't be quick to break with a friend' is what he was saying to me as he was about to die
And what he said to me as he was about to die  'For vengeance is not settled through vengeance
Vengeance is settled through nonvengeance'  My mother  father were killed by your majesty
If I were to deprive your majesty of life those who hope for your majesty's wellbeing would deprive me of life
And those who hope for my wellbeing would deprive them of life
And in that way vengeance would not be settled by vengeance
But now I have been granted my life by your majesty and your majesty has been granted your life by me
And in this way vengeance has been settled by nonvengeance
That is what my father was saying to me as he was about to die
Then King Brahmadatta said Isn't it amazing
Isn't it astounding
How wise this Prince Dighavu is in that he can understand in full the meaning of what his father said in brief So he returned his father's troops vehicles lands armories  granaries and gave him his daughter in marriage
Such monks is the forbearance  gentleness of kings who wield the scepter who wield the sword
So now let your light shine forth so that you  who have gone forth in such a welltaught Dhamma  Discipline  will be their equal in forbearance  gentleness
This chapter of the Cullavagga contains the fourteen sets of khandhakavatta or khandhaka duties which derive their name from their location in the Khandhaka section of the Vinaya
These duties govern the daytoday life of the bhikkhus although some communities will observe them more closely than others
Changes in technology for example have had inevitably led to the dropping of some of the duties  the toilet duties for instance were designed for a very different kind of restroom than what's found in monasteries today even in Asia to say nothing of the West
Still these duties are important to know even when their precise details are dated for the more fully a bhikkhu knows them the better he is able to apply them in a useful way to modern situations
The following passages consist of the complete lists of the fourteen sets of duties together with a few of the origin stories describing the events that led to the formulation of each set
Where the duties are identical to the rules of the Sekhiya section of the Patimokkha I have simply noted the fact without listing the rules here
These rules may easily be found in The Buddhist Monastic Code
The duties of a student to his teacher and of a teacher to his student are identical to those governing the relationship between mentor and pupil and so have not been repeated
I have included explanatory passages from the Commentary in brackets and marked with a capital C and from the Subcommentary in braces and marked with an SPassages in parentheses are my own observations
A section mark denotes passages where my translation differs from that of B
Horner's translation The Book of the Discipline
A certain incoming bhikkhu unfastening the bolt and pushing open the door rushed into an unoccupied dwelling
A snake fell on his shoulder from the lintel above
Frightened he let out a yelp
An incoming bhikkhu thinking 'I will now enter the monastery' having taken off his sandals having put them down and beaten off the dust having lowered his sunshade having uncovered his head having put his robe on his torsoshoulder should enter the monastery properly  unhurriedly

Translator's note Some people have said that the Buddha's teachings on the aggregates constitute his analysis of what we truly are and that because the aggregates are impermanent and interdependent we have an impermanent interdependent self
This sutta however shows that we can be analyzed into the aggregates only if we feel obsession or attachment for them
If we don't feel these things there's no way we can be measured classified or defined
At Savatthi
Then a certain monk went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side
As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One It would be good lord if the Blessed One would teach me the Dhamma in brief such that having heard the Dhamma from the Blessed One I might dwell alone secluded heedful ardent  resolute
Monk whatever one stays obsessed with that's what one is measured by
Whatever one is measured by that's how one is classified
Whatever one doesn't stay obsessed with that's not what one is measured by
Whatever one isn't measured by that's not how one is classified
I understand O Blessed One
I understand O One Wellgone
And how monk do you understand the detailed meaning of what I have said in brief
If one stays obsessed with form lord that's what one is measured by
Whatever one is measured by that's how one is classified
If one stays obsessed with feeling
If one stays obsessed with perception
If one stays obsessed with fabrications
If one stays obsessed with consciousness that's what one is measured by
Whatever one is measured by that's how one is classified
But if one doesn't stay obsessed with form lord that's not what one is measured by
Whatever one isn't measured by that's not how one is classified
If one doesn't stay obsessed with feeling
If one doesn't stay obsessed with perception
If one doesn't stay obsessed with fabrications

This is how the detailed meaning of what I have said in brief should be seen
Then the monk delighting in and approving of the Blessed One's words got up from his seat and bowed down to the Blessed One circled around him keeping the Blessed One to his right and departed
Then dwelling alone secluded heedful ardent  resolute he in no long time reached  remained in the supreme goal of the holy life for which clansmen rightly go forth from home into homelessness knowing  realizing it for himself in the here  now
He knew Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task done
There is nothing further for the sake of this world And thus he became another one of the arahants
Monks I will explain to you grasping and worrying and also not grasping and not worrying Here monks the uninstructed worldling with no regard for Noble Ones unskilled and untrained in the Dhamma of the Noble Ones of those who are worthy regards body as the self the self as having body body as being in the self or the self as being in the body
Change occurs to this man's body and it becomes different
Because of this change and alteration in his body his consciousness is preoccupied with bodily change
Due to this preoccupation with bodily change worried thoughts arise and persist laying a firm hold on his mind
Through this mental obsession he becomes fearful and distressed and being full of desire and attachment he is worried
He regards feeling as the self change occurs to his feeling he is worried
In this way monks grasping and worrying arise
And how monks do not grasping and not worrying arise
Here monks the wellinstructed Ariyan disciple who has regard for the Noble Ones is skilled and trained in the Dhamma of the Noble Ones of those who are worthy does not regard body as the self the self as having body body as being in the self or the self as being in the body
Change occurs to this man's body and it becomes different but despite this change and alteration in his body his consciousness is not preoccupied with bodily change Not being full of desire and attachment he is not worried
In this way monks grasping and worrying do not arise
I have heard that on one occasion Ven
Maha Kaccana was staying in Avanti at Osprey's Haunt on Sheerface Peak
Then Haliddakani the householder went to him and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side
As he was sitting there he said to Ven
Maha Kaccana Venerable sir this was said by the Blessed One in Magandiya's Questions in the Atthaka Vagga
How is the detailed meaning of this the Blessed One's brief statement to be understood
The property of form householder is the home of consciousness
When consciousness is in bondage through passion to the property of form it is said to be living at home
The property of feeling perception fabrication is the home of consciousness
When consciousness is in bondage through passion to the property of fabrication it is said to be dwelling at home
And how does one not live at home
Any desire passion delight craving any attachments clingings fixations of awareness biases or obsessions with regard to the property of form these the Tathagata has abandoned their root destroyed made like a palmyra stump deprived of the conditions of development not destined for future arising
Therefore the Tathagata is said to be not dwelling at home
Any desire passion delight craving any attachments clingings fixations of awareness biases or obsessions with regard to the property of feeling perception fabrication
Any desire passion delight craving any attachments clingings fixations of awareness biases or obsessions with regard to the property of consciousness these the Tathagata has abandoned their root destroyed made like a palmyra stump deprived of the conditions of development not destined for future arising
Therefore the Tathagata is said to be not dwelling at home
And how does one live with society
One who is in bondage to the distraction of the society of formimpressions is said to be living in society
One who is in bondage to the distraction of the society of soundimpressions aromaimpressions flavorimpressions tactilesensationimpressions ideaimpressions is said to be living in society
This is how one lives with society
And how does one live free from society
The Tathagata has abandoned bondage to the distraction of the society of formimpressions its root destroyed made like a palmyra stump deprived of the conditions of development not destined for future arising
Therefore the Tathagata is said to be living free from society
The Tathagata has abandoned bondage to the distraction of the society of soundimpressions aromaimpressions flavorimpressions tactilesensationimpressions ideaimpressions its root destroyed made like a palmyra stump deprived of the conditions of development not destined for future arising
Therefore the Tathagata is said to be living free from society
And how is one intimate in villages
There is the case where a certain person lives entangled with householders
Delighting together with them sorrowing together with them happy when they are happy pained when they are pained he takes on any of their arisen business affairs as his own duty
This is how one is intimate in villages
And how is one not intimate in villages
There is the case where a monk lives unentangled with householders
Not delighting together with them not sorrowing together with them not happy when they are happy not pained when they are pained he does not take on any of their arisen business affairs as his own duty
This is how one is not intimate in villages
And how is one not rid of sensual passions
There is the case where a certain person is not free of passion for sensual pleasures not free of desire not free of love not free of thirst not free of fever not free of craving for sensual pleasures
This is how one is not rid of sensual passions
And how is one rid of sensual passions
There is the case where a certain person is free of passion for sensual pleasures free of desire free of love free of thirst free of fever free of craving for sensual pleasures
This is how one is rid of sensual passions
And how does one have yearnings
There is the case where a certain person thinks 'May form be like this in the future
May feeling May perception May fabrication May consciousness be like this in the future' This is how one has yearnings
And how is one free from yearning
There is the case where a certain person does not think 'May form be like this in the future
May feeling May perception May fabrication May consciousness be like this in the future' This is how one is free from yearning
And how does one engage with people in quarrelsome debate
There is the case where a certain person is a fomenter of this kind of debate 'You understand this doctrine  discipline
I'm the one who understands this doctrine  discipline
How could you understand this doctrine  discipline
You're practicing wrongly
I'm practicing rightly
What should be said first you said last
What should be said last you said first
I'm being consistent
You're not
What you took so long to think out has been refuted
Your doctrine has been overthrown
You're defeated
Go and try to salvage your doctrine or extricate yourself if you can' This is how one engages with people in quarrelsome debate
And how does one not engage with people in quarrelsome debate
There is the case where a certain person is not a fomenter of this kind of debate 'You understand this doctrine  discipline
I'm the one who understands this doctrine  discipline
How could you understand this doctrine  discipline
You're practicing wrongly
I'm practicing rightly
What should be said first you said last
What should be said last you said first
I'm being consistent
You're not
What you took so long to think out has been refuted
Your doctrine has been overthrown
You're defeated
Go and try to salvage your doctrine or extricate yourself if you can' This is how one does not engage with people in quarrelsome debate
So householder what was said by the Blessed One in Magandiya's Questions in the Atthaka Vagga
This is how the detailed meaning of this the Blessed One's brief statement is to be understood
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying among the Sakyans at a Sakyan town named Devadaha
Then a large number of monks headed for outlying districts went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side
As they were sitting there they said to the Blessed One Lord we want to go to the countryside of the outlying districts and to take up residence there
Have you informed Sariputta
No lord we haven't informed Ven
Sariputta
Inform Sariputta monks
Sariputta is wise a great help to the monks who are his fellows in the holy life
As you say lord the monks replied
At that time Ven
Sariputta was sitting under a certain cassia tree not far from the Blessed One
Then the monks delighting in  approving of the Blessed One's words rose from their seats and  bowing down to the Blessed One and circumambulating him keeping him to their right  went to Ven
Sariputta
On arrival they exchanged courteous greetings with him
After an exchange of friendly greetings  courtesies they sat to one side
As they were sitting there they said to Ven
Sariputta Friend Sariputta we want to go to the countryside of the outlying districts and to take up residence there
We have already informed the Teacher
Friends in foreign lands there are wise nobles  brahmans householders  contemplatives  for the people there are wise  discriminating  who will question a monk 'What is your teacher's doctrine
What does he teach' Have you listened well to the teachings  grasped them well attended to them well considered them well penetrated them well by means of discernment  so that in answering you will speak in line with what the Blessed One has said will not misrepresent the Blessed One with what is unfactual will answer in line with the Dhamma and no one whose thinking is in line with the Dhamma will have grounds for criticizing you
We would come from a long way away to hear the explication of these words in Ven
Sariputta's presence
It would be good if Ven
Sariputta himself would enlighten us as to their meaning
Then in that case friends listen  pay close attention
I will speak
As you say friend the monks responded
Ven
Sariputta said Friends in foreign lands there are wise nobles  brahmans householders  contemplatives  for the people there are wise  discriminating  who will question a monk 'What is your teacher's doctrine
What does he teach'
Thus asked you should answer 'Our teacher teaches the subduing of passion  desire'
Having thus been answered there may be wise nobles  brahmans householders  contemplatives who will question you further 'And your teacher teaches the subduing of passion  desire for what'
Thus asked you should answer 'Our teacher teaches the subduing of passion  desire for form for feeling for perception for fabrications
Our teacher teaches the subduing of passion  desire for consciousness'
Having thus been answered there may be wise nobles  brahmans householders  contemplatives who will question you further 'And seeing what danger does your teacher teach the subduing of passion  desire for form for feeling for perception for fabrications
Seeing what danger does your teacher teach the subduing of passion  desire for consciousness'
Thus asked you should answer 'When one is not free from passion desire love thirst fever  craving for form then from any change  alteration in that form there arises sorrow lamentation pain grief  despair
When one is not free from passion for feeling for perception for fabrications When one is not free from passion desire love thirst fever  craving for consciousness then from any change  alteration in that consciousness there arise sorrow lamentation pain grief  despair
Seeing this danger our teacher teaches the subduing of passion  desire for form for feeling for perception for fabrications
Seeing this danger our teacher teaches the subduing of passion  desire for consciousness'
Having thus been answered there may be wise nobles  brahmans householders  contemplatives who will question you further 'And seeing what benefit does your teacher teach the subduing of passion  desire for form for feeling for perception for fabrications
Seeing what benefit does your teacher teach the subduing of passion  desire for consciousness'
Thus asked you should answer 'When one is free from passion desire love thirst fever  craving for form then with any change  alteration in that form there does not arise any sorrow lamentation pain grief or despair
When one is free from passion for feeling for perception for fabrications When one is free from passion desire love thirst fever  craving for consciousness then with any change  alteration in that consciousness there does not arise any sorrow lamentation pain grief or despair
Seeing this benefit our teacher teaches the subduing of passion  desire for form for feeling for perception for fabrications
Seeing this benefit our teacher teaches the subduing of passion  desire for consciousness'
Friends if one who entered  remained in unskillful mental qualities were to have a pleasant abiding in the here  now  unthreatened undespairing unfeverish  and on the breakup of the body after death could expect a good destination then the Blessed One would not advocate the abandoning of unskillful mental qualities
But because one who enters  remains in unskillful mental qualities has a stressful abiding in the here  now  threatened despairing  feverish  and on the breakup of the body after death can expect a bad destination that is why the Blessed One advocates the abandoning of unskillful mental qualities
If one who entered  remained in skillful mental qualities were to have a stressful abiding in the here  now  threatened despairing  feverish  and on the breakup of the body after death could expect a bad destination then the Blessed One would not advocate entering into skillful mental qualities
But because one who enters  remains in skillful mental qualities has a pleasant abiding in the here  now  unthreatened undespairing unfeverish  and on the breakup of the body after death can expect a good destination that is why the Blessed One advocates entering into skillful mental qualities
That is what Ven
Sariputta said
Gratified the monks delighted in Ven
Sariputta's words
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was living among the Bhaggas at Crocodile Haunt in the Bhesakala Grove at the Deer Park
Then the householder Nakulapita went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side
As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One Lord I am a feeble old man aged advanced in years having come to the last stage of life
I am afflicted in body  ailing with every moment
And it is only rarely that I get to see the Blessed One  the monks who nourish the heart
May the Blessed One teach me may the Blessed One instruct me for my longterm benefit  happiness
So it is householder
So it is
The body is afflicted weak  encumbered
For who looking after this body would claim even a moment of true health except through sheer foolishness
So you should train yourself 'Even though I may be afflicted in body my mind will be unafflicted' That is how you should train yourself
Then the householder Nakulapita delighting in  approving of the Blessed One's words rose from his seat and  bowing down to the Blessed One and circumambulating him keeping him to his right  went to Ven
Sariputta and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side
As he was sitting there Ven
Sariputta said to him Your faculties are clear  calm householder your complexion pure
Have you had the opportunity today of listening to a Dhamma talk in the presence of the Blessed One
How could it be otherwise lord
I have just now been sprinkled by the Blessed One with the deathless ambrosia of a Dhamma talk
And how were you sprinkled by the Blessed One with the deathless ambrosia of a Dhamma talk
Just now I went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side
As I was sitting there I said to him 'Lord I am a feeble old man aged advanced in years having come to the last stage of life
I am afflicted in body  ailing with every moment
And it is only rarely that I get to see the Blessed One  the monks who nourish the heart
May the Blessed One teach me may the Blessed One instruct me for my longterm benefit  happiness'
When this was said the Blessed One said to me 'So it is householder
So it is
The body is afflicted weak  encumbered
For who looking after this body would claim even a moment of true health except through sheer foolishness
So you should train yourself Even though I may be afflicted in body my mind will be unafflicted That is how you should train yourself' That's how I was sprinkled by the Blessed One with the deathless ambrosia of a Dhamma talk
But why didn't it occur to you to question the Blessed One further 'In what way is one afflicted in body  afflicted in mind
And in what way is one afflicted in body but unafflicted in mind'
I would come from a long way away to hear the explication of these words in Ven
Sariputta's presence
It would be good if Ven
Sariputta himself would enlighten me as to their meaning
Then in that case householder listen  pay close attention
I will speak
As you say lord the householder Nakulapita responded
Ven
Sariputta said Now how is one afflicted in body  afflicted in mind
There is the case where an uninstructed runofthemill person  who has no regard for noble ones is not wellversed or disciplined in their Dhamma who has no regard for men of integrity is not wellversed or disciplined in their Dhamma  assumes form to be the self or the self as possessing form or form as in the self or the self as in form
He is seized with the idea that 'I am form' or 'Form is mine' As he is seized with these ideas his form changes  alters and he falls into sorrow lamentation pain distress  despair over its change  alteration
He assumes feeling to be the self or the self as possessing feeling or feeling as in the self or the self as in feeling
He is seized with the idea that 'I am feeling' or 'Feeling is mine' As he is seized with these ideas his feeling changes  alters and he falls into sorrow lamentation pain distress  despair over its change  alteration
He assumes perception to be the self or the self as possessing perception or perception as in the self or the self as in perception
He is seized with the idea that 'I am perception' or 'Perception is mine' As he is seized with these ideas his perception changes  alters and he falls into sorrow lamentation pain distress  despair over its change  alteration
He assumes fabrications to be the self or the self as possessing fabrications or fabrications as in the self or the self as in fabrications
He is seized with the idea that 'I am fabrications' or 'Fabrications are mine' As he is seized with these ideas his fabrications change  alter and he falls into sorrow lamentation pain distress  despair over their change  alteration
He assumes consciousness to be the self or the self as possessing consciousness or consciousness as in the self or the self as in consciousness
He is seized with the idea that 'I am consciousness' or 'Consciousness is mine' As he is seized with these ideas his consciousness changes  alters and he falls into sorrow lamentation pain distress  despair over its change  alteration
This householder is how one is afflicted in body and afflicted in mind
And how is one afflicted in body but unafflicted in mind
There is the case where a wellinstructed disciple of the noble ones  who has regard for noble ones is wellversed  disciplined in their Dhamma who has regard for men of integrity is wellversed  disciplined in their Dhamma  does not assume form to be the self or the self as possessing form or form as in the self or the self as in form
He is not seized with the idea that 'I am form' or 'Form is mine' As he is not seized with these ideas his form changes  alters but he does not fall into sorrow lamentation pain distress or despair over its change  alteration
He does not assume feeling to be the self
He does not assume perception to be the self
He does not assume fabrications to be the self
He does not assume consciousness to be the self or the self as possessing consciousness or consciousness as in the self or the self as in consciousness
He is not seized with the idea that 'I am consciousness' or 'Consciousness is mine' As he is not seized with these ideas his consciousness changes  alters but he does not fall into sorrow lamentation pain distress or despair over its change  alteration
This householder is how one is afflicted in body but unafflicted in mind
That is what Ven
Sariputta said
Gratified the householder Nakulapita delighted in Ven
Sariputta's words
Once monks in this same Savatthi there was a lady of a household named Vedehika
This good report about Lady Vedehika had circulated 'Lady Vedehika is gentle
Lady Vedehika is eventempered
Lady Vedehika is calm' Now Lady Vedehika had a slave named Kali who was diligent deft  neat in her work
The thought occurred to Kali the slave 'This good report about my Lady Vedehika has circulated Lady Vedehika is eventempered
Lady Vedehika is gentle
Lady Vedehika is calm Now is anger present in my lady without showing or is it absent
Or is it just because my work is neat that the anger present in my lady doesn't show
Why don't I test her'
So Kali the slave got up after daybreak
Then Lady Vedehika said to her 'Hey Kali'
'Yes madam'
'Why did you get up after daybreak'
'No reason madam'
'No reason you wicked slave and yet you get up after daybreak' Angered  displeased she scowled
Then the thought occurred to Kali the slave 'Anger is present in my lady without showing and not absent
And it's just because my work is neat that the anger present in my lady doesn't show
Why don't I test her some more'
So Kali the slave got up later in the day
Then Lady Vedehika said to her 'Hey Kali'
'Yes madam'
'Why did you get up later in the day'
'No reason madam'
'No reason you wicked slave and yet you get up later in the day' Angered  displeased she grumbled
Then the thought occurred to Kali the slave 'Anger is present in my lady without showing and not absent
And it's just because my work is neat that the anger present in my lady doesn't show
Why don't I test her some more'
So Kali the slave got up even later in the day
Then Lady Vedehika said to her 'Hey Kali'
'Yes madam'
'Why did you get up even later in the day'
'No reason madam'
'No reason you wicked slave and yet you get up even later in the day' Angered  displeased she grabbed hold of a rolling pin and gave her a whack over the head cutting it open
Then Kali the slave with blood streaming from her cutopen head went and denounced her mistress to the neighbors 'See ladies the gentle one's handiwork
See the eventempered one's handiwork
See the calm one's handiwork
How could she angered  displeased with her only slave for getting up after daybreak grab hold of a rolling pin and give her a whack over the head cutting it open'
After that this evil report about Lady Vedehika circulated 'Lady Vedehika is vicious
Lady Vedehika is foultempered
Lady Vedehika is violent'
In the same way monks a monk may be ever so gentle ever so eventempered ever so calm as long as he is not touched by disagreeable aspects of speech
But it's when disagreeable aspects of speech touch him that he can be known from experience as gentle eventempered  calm
I don't call a monk easy to admonish if he is easy to admonish and makes himself easy to admonish only by reason of robes almsfood lodging  medicinal requisites for curing the sick
Why is that
Because if he doesn't get robes almsfood lodging  medicinal requisites for curing the sick then he isn't easy to admonish and doesn't make himself easy to admonish
But if a monk is easy to admonish and makes himself easy to admonish purely out of esteem for the Dhamma respect for the Dhamma reverence for the Dhamma then I call him easy to admonish
Thus monks 'We will be easy to admonish and make ourselves easy to admonish purely out of esteem for the Dhamma respect for the Dhamma reverence for the Dhamma' that's how you should train yourselves
Monks there are these five aspects of speech by which others may address you timely or untimely true or false affectionate or harsh beneficial or unbeneficial with a mind of goodwill or with inner hate
Others may address you in a timely way or an untimely way
They may address you with what is true or what is false
They may address you in an affectionate way or a harsh way
They may address you in a beneficial way or an unbeneficial way
They may address you with a mind of goodwill or with inner hate
In any event you should train yourselves 'Our minds will be unaffected and we will say no evil words
We will remain sympathetic to that person's welfare with a mind of good will and with no inner hate
We will keep pervading him with an awareness imbued with good will and beginning with him we will keep pervading the allencompassing world with an awareness imbued with good will  abundant expansive immeasurable free from hostility free from ill will' That's how you should train yourselves
Suppose that a man were to come along carrying a hoe  a basket saying 'I will make this great earth be without earth' He would dig here  there scatter soil here  there spit here  there urinate here  there saying 'Be without earth
Be without earth' Now what do you think  would he make this great earth be without earth
No lord
Why is that
Because this great earth is deep  enormous
It can't easily be made to be without earth
The man would reap only a share of weariness  disappointment

Suppose that a man were to come along carrying lac yellow orpiment indigo or crimson saying 'I will draw pictures in space I will make pictures appear' Now what do you think  would he draw pictures in space  make pictures appear
No lord
Why is that
Because space is formless  featureless
It's not easy to draw pictures there and to make them appear
The man would reap only a share of weariness  disappointment

Suppose that a man were to come along carrying a burning grass torch and saying 'With this burning grass torch I will heat up the river Ganges and make it boil' Now what do you think  would he with that burning grass torch heat up the river Ganges and make it boil
No lord

Because the river Ganges is deep  enormous
It's not easy to heat it up and make it boil with a burning grass torch
The man would reap only a share of weariness  disappointment

No lord
Why is that
Because the catskin bag is beaten wellbeaten beaten through  through soft silky free of rustling  crackling

Monks if you attend constantly to this admonition on the simile of the saw do you see any aspects of speech slight or gross that you could not endure
No lord
Then attend constantly to this admonition on the simile of the saw
That will be for your longterm welfare  happiness
That is what the Blessed One said
Gratified the monks delighted in the Blessed One's words
The body of this sutta consists of a narrative illustrating the power of skillful action
In the past unskillful behavior was unknown among the human race
As a result people lived for an immensely long time  years  endowed with great beauty wealth pleasure and strength
Over the course of time though they began behaving in various unskillful ways
This caused the human life span gradually to shorten to the point where it now stands at years with human beauty wealth pleasure and strength decreasing proportionately
In the future as morality continues to degenerate human life will continue to shorten to the point were the normal life span is years with people reaching sexual maturity at five
Among those human beings the ten courses of action will have entirely disappeared The word 'skillful' will not exist so from where will there be anyone who does what is skillful
Those who lack the honorable qualities of motherhood fatherhood contemplativehood  brahmanhood will be the ones who receive homage Fierce hatred will arise fierce malevolence fierce rage  murderous thoughts mother for child child for mother father for child child for father brother for sister sister for brother Ultimately conditions will deteriorate to the point of a swordinterval in which swords appear in the hands of all human beings and they hunt one another like game
A few people however will take shelter in the wilderness to escape the carnage and when the slaughter is over they will come out of hiding and resolve to take up a life of skillful and virtuous action again
With the recovery of virtue the human life span will gradually increase again until it reaches years with people attaining sexual maturity at
Only three diseases will be known at that time desire lack of food and old age
Another Buddha  Metteyya  will gain Awakening his monastic Sangha numbering in the thousands
The greatest king of the time Sankha will go forth into homelessness and attain arahantship under Metteyya's guidance
The story after chronicling the ups and downs of human wealth life span etc concludes with the following lesson on kamma and skillful action
 Monks live with yourself as your island yourself as your refuge with nothing else as your refuge
Live with the Dhamma as your island the Dhamma as your refuge with nothing else as your refuge
And how does a monk live with himself as his island himself as his refuge with nothing else as his refuge with the Dhamma as his island the Dhamma as his refuge with nothing else as his refuge
There is the case where a monk remains focused on the body in  of itself  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the world
He remains focused on feelings in  of themselves mind in  of itself mental qualities in  of themselves  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the world
This is how a monk lives with himself as his island himself as his refuge with nothing else as his refuge with the Dhamma as his island the Dhamma as his refuge with nothing else as his refuge
Wander monks in your proper range your own ancestral territory
When you wander in your proper range your own ancestral territory you will grow in long life beauty pleasure wealth  strength
And what constitutes a monk's long life
There is the case where a monk develops the base of power endowed with concentration founded on desire  the fabrications of exertion
He develops the base of power endowed with concentration founded on persistence founded on intent He develops the base of power endowed with concentration founded on discrimination  the fabrications of exertion
From the development  pursuit of these four bases of power he can stay for an aeon if he wants or for the remainder of an aeon
This constitutes a monk's long life
And what constitutes a monk's beauty
There is the case where a monk is virtuous
He dwells restrained in accordance with the Patimokkha consummate in his behavior  sphere of activity
He trains himself having undertaken the training rules seeing danger in the slightest faults
This constitutes a monk's beauty
And what constitutes a monk's pleasure
There is the case where a monk  quite withdrawn from sensuality withdrawn from unskillful mental qualities  enters  remains in the first jhana rapture  pleasure born from withdrawal accompanied by directed thought  evaluation
With the stilling of directed thoughts  evaluations he enters  remains in the second jhana rapture  pleasure born of composure unification of awareness free from directed thought  evaluation  internal assurance
With the fading of rapture he remains equanimous mindful  alert and senses pleasure with the body
He enters  remains in the third jhana of which the Noble Ones declare 'Equanimous  mindful he has a pleasant abiding' With the abandoning of pleasure  pain  as with the earlier disappearance of elation  distress  he enters  remains in the fourth jhana purity of equanimity  mindfulness neither pleasure nor pain
This constitutes a monk's pleasure
And what constitutes a monk's wealth
There is the case where a monk keeps pervading the first direction  as well as the second direction the third  the fourth  with an awareness imbued with good will
Thus he keeps pervading above below  all around everywhere  in every respect the allencompassing world with an awareness imbued with good will abundant expansive immeasurable free from hostility free from ill will
He keeps pervading the first direction  as well as the second direction the third  the fourth  with an awareness imbued with compassion imbued with appreciation

This constitutes a monk's wealth
And what constitutes a monk's strength
There is the case where a monk through the ending of the mental fermentations enters  remains in the fermentationfree awarenessrelease  discernmentrelease having directly known  realized them for himself right in the here  now
This constitutes a monk's strength
Monks I don't envision any other single strength so hard to overcome as this the strength of Mara
And the adopting of skillful qualities is what causes this merit to increase 
That is what the Blessed One said
Gratified the monks delighted in the Blessed One's words
Monks I will explain to you the burden the laying hold of the burden the holding on to the burden the laying down of the burden
Listen
What monks is the burden
'The five groups of clinging' is the answer
Which five
They are the group of clinging to corporeality to feelings to perceptions to mental formations to consciousness
This monks is called 'the burden'
What is the laying hold of the burden
The answer is that it is the person the Venerable Soandso of suchandsuch a family
This monks is called 'the laying hold of the burden'
What is the holding on to the burden
The answer is that it is that craving which gives rise to fresh rebirth and bound up with lust and greed now here now there finds ever fresh delight
It is sensual craving craving for existence craving for nonexistence
This monks is called 'the holding on to the burden'
What is the laying down of the burden
It is the complete fading away and extinction of this craving its forsaking and giving up liberation and detachment from it
This monks is called 'the laying down of the burden' Thus said the Blessed One the Wellfarer spoke thus the Teacher then said
It is easy to understand how this sutta could be misunderstood both in ancient and in modern times since one would expect the person to be described as the bearer rather than the bearing The explanation is that the person is in terms of relative truth what the khandhas are according to ultimate truth
One is tempted to think that this sutta was originally delivered for the benefit of one or other of the Bhaaradvaajas whose name appears to mean twiceborn burden
Thus have I heard
Once while the Blessed One was staying in the vicinity of Saavatthi in the Jeta Grove in Anaathapindika's monastery a certain deity whose surpassing brilliance and beauty illumined the entire Jeta Grove late one night came to the presence of the Blessed One having come to him and offered profound salutations he stood on one side and spoke to him reverently in the following verse

The word satipatthana is the name for an approach to meditation aimed at establishing sati or mindfulness
The term sati is related to the verb sarati to remember or to keep in mind
It is sometimes translated as nonreactive awareness free from agendas simply present with whatever arises but the formula for satipatthana doesn't support that translation
Nonreactive awareness is actually an aspect of equanimity a quality fostered in the course of satipatthana
The activity of satipatthana however definitely has a motivating agenda the desire for Awakening which is classed not as a cause of suffering but as part of the path to its ending
The role of mindfulness is to keep the mind properly grounded in the present moment in a way that will keep it on the path
To make an analogy Awakening is like a mountain on the horizon the destination to which you are driving a car
Mindfulness is what remembers to keep attention focused on the road to the mountain rather than letting it stay focused on glimpses of the mountain or get distracted by other paths leading away from the road
As a compound term satipatthana can be broken down in two ways either as satipatthana foundation of mindfulness or as satiupatthana establishing of mindfulness
Scholars debate as to which is the proper interpretation but in practice both provide useful food for thought
The first interpretation focuses on the objects of the meditation practice the focal points that provide mindfulness with a foundation  or to use the more idiomatic English phrase adopted here a frame of reference
Altogether there are four the body in and of itself feelings in and of themselves mind in and of itself and mental qualities in and of themselves
The in and of itself here is crucial
In the case of the body for instance it means viewing the body on its own terms rather than in terms of its function in the context of the world
Dropping any concern for how the body's beauty agility or strength fits into the world the meditator simply stays with the direct experience of its breathing its movements its postures its elementary properties and its inevitable decay
A similar principle applies to the other frames of reference
The second interpretation of satipatthana  satiupatthana  focuses on the process of the meditation practice on how a frame of reference is established
This sutta gives three stages for this process applied to each frame of reference
The first stage as applied to the body is this
The monk remains focused on the body in and of itself  ardent alert and mindful  putting aside greed and distress with reference to the world
Remaining focused refers to the element of concentration in the practice as the meditator holds to one particular frame of reference amid the conflicting currents of experience
Ardent refers to the effort put into the practice trying to abandon unskillful states of mind and develop skillful ones in their stead all the while trying to discern the difference between the two
Alert means being clearly aware of what is happening in the present
Mindful as mentioned above means being able to keep the frame of reference continually in mind
As these qualities work together they bring the mind to a solid state of concentration
Although satipatthana practice is often said to be separate from the practice of jhana a number of suttas equate the successful completion of this first stage with the attainment of the first level of jhana
This point is confirmed by the many suttas  MN among them  describing how the practice of satipatthana brings to completion the factors for Awakening which coincide with the factors of jhana
The second stage of satipatthana practice is this
The phenomena of origination and passing away covers events either directly or indirectly related to one's chosen frame of reference
Directly means changes in the frame of reference itself
For instance when focused on the body one may notice the arising and passing away of breath sensations within it
Indirectly here means events in any of the other three frames of reference as they relate to the body
For example one might notice the arising and passing away of feelings of pleasure or mental states of irritation in connection to events in the body
Or one might notice lapses of mindfulness in one's focus on the body
In each of these cases if the origination and passing away is of neutral events such as the aggregates one is directed simply to be aware of them as events and to let them follow their natural course so as to see what factors accompany them and lead to their comings and goings
However when skillful or unskillful mental qualities  such as the factors for Awakening or the Hindrances  arise and pass away one is encouraged to foster the factors that strengthen jhana and eliminate the factors that weaken it
This means actively getting engaged in maximizing skillful mental qualities and minimizing unskillful ones
One thus develops insight into the process of origination and passing away by taking an active and sensitive role in the process just as you learn about eggs by trying to cook with them gathering experience from your successes and failures in attempting increasingly difficult dishes
As this process leads to stronger and more refined states of concentration it makes one sensitive to the fact that the grosser one's participation in the process of origination and passing away in the mind the grosser the level of stress that results
This leads one to let go of increasingly refined levels of participation as one is able to detect them leading to the third and final stage in satipatthana practice
Or his mindfulness that 'There is a body ' is maintained to the extent of knowledge  recollection
And he remains independent unsustained by anything in the world
This stage corresponds to a mode of perception that the Buddha in MN terms entry into emptiness
This is the culminating equipoise where the path of the practice opens to a state of nonfashioning and from there to the fruit of Awakening and release
At first glance the four frames of reference for satipatthana practice sound like four different meditation exercises but MN makes clear that they can all center on a single practice keeping the breath in mind
When the mind is with the breath all four frames of reference are right there
The difference lies simply in the subtlety of one's focus
It's like learning to play the piano
As you get more proficient at playing you also become sensitive in listening to ever more subtle levels in the music
This allows you to play even more skillfully
In the same way as a meditator gets more skilled in staying with the breath the practice of satipatthana gives greater sensitivity in peeling away ever more subtle layers of participation in the present moment until nothing is left standing in the way of total release

Or he remains focused on the phenomenon of origination with regard to the mind on the phenomenon of passing away with regard to the mind or on the phenomenon of origination  passing away with regard to the mind
Or his mindfulness that 'There is a mind' is maintained to the extent of knowledge  remembrance
And he remains independent unsustained by anything in the world
This is how a monk remains focused on the mind in  of itself
And how does a monk remain focused on mental qualities in  of themselves
There is the case where a monk remains focused on mental qualities in  of themselves with reference to the five hindrances
And how does a monk remain focused on mental qualities in  of themselves with reference to the five hindrances
There is the case where there being sensual desire present within a monk discerns that 'There is sensual desire present within me' Or there being no sensual desire present within he discerns that 'There is no sensual desire present within me' He discerns how there is the arising of unarisen sensual desire
And he discerns how there is the abandoning of sensual desire once it has arisen

This is how a monk remains focused on mental qualities in  of themselves with reference to the five hindrances
Furthermore the monk remains focused on mental qualities in  of themselves with reference to the five clingingaggregates
And how does he remain focused on mental qualities in  of themselves with reference to the five clingingaggregates
There is the case where a monk 'Such is form such its origination such its disappearance
Such is feeling Such is perception Such are fabrications Such is consciousness such its origination such its disappearance'

Furthermore the monk remains focused on mental qualities in  of themselves with reference to the sixfold internal  external sense media
And how does he remain focused on mental qualities in  of themselves with reference to the sixfold internal  external sense media
There is the case where he discerns the eye he discerns forms he discerns the fetter that arises dependent on both
He discerns how there is the arising of an unarisen fetter
And he discerns how there is the abandoning of a fetter once it has arisen
And he discerns how there is no future arising of a fetter that has been abandoned

Furthermore the monk remains focused on mental qualities in  of themselves with reference to the four noble truths
And how does he remain focused on mental qualities in  of themselves with reference to the four noble truths
There is the case where he discerns as it has come to be that 'This is stress This is the origination of stress This is the cessation of stress This is the way leading to the cessation of stress'
Now what is the noble truth of stress
Birth is stressful aging is stressful death is stressful sorrow lamentation pain distress  despair are stressful association with the unbeloved is stressful separation from the loved is stressful not getting what one wants is stressful
In short the five clingingaggregates are stressful
And what is birth
Whatever birth taking birth descent comingtobe comingforth appearance of aggregates  acquisition of spheres of the various beings in this or that group of beings that is called birth
And what is aging
Whatever aging decrepitude brokenness graying wrinkling decline of lifeforce weakening of the faculties of the various beings in this or that group of beings that is called aging

In beings subject to birth the wish arises 'O may we not be subject to birth and may birth not come to us' But this is not to be achieved by wishing
This is the stress of not getting what one wants
In beings subject to aging illness death sorrow lamentation pain distress  despair the wish arises 'O may we not be subject to aging illness death sorrow lamentation pain distress  despair and may aging illness death sorrow lamentation pain distress  despair not come to us' But this is not to be achieved by wishing
This is the stress of not getting what one wants
And what are the five clingingaggregates that in short are stress
Form as a clingingaggregate feeling as a clingingaggregate perception as a clingingaggregate fabrications as a clingingaggregate consciousness as a clingingaggregate These are called the five clingingaggregates that in short are stress
This is called the noble truth of stress
And what is the noble truth of the origination of stress
The craving that makes for further becoming  accompanied by passion  delight relishing now here  now there  ie craving for sensuality craving for becoming craving for nonbecoming

That is where when being abandoned this craving is abandoned
That is where when ceasing it ceases
This is called the noble truth of the cessation of stress
And what is the noble truth of the path of practice leading to the cessation of stress
Just this very noble eightfold path right view right resolve right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness right concentration
And what is right view
Knowledge with regard to stress knowledge with regard to the origination of stress knowledge with regard to the cessation of stress knowledge with regard to the way of practice leading to the cessation of stress This is called right view
And what is right resolve
Aspiring to renunciation to freedom from ill will to harmlessness This is called right resolve

There is the case where a monk generates desire endeavors arouses persistence upholds  exerts his intent for the sake of the nonarising of evil unskillful qualities that have not yet arisen for the sake of the abandoning of evil unskillful qualities that have arisen for the sake of the arising of skillful qualities that have not yet arisen for the maintenance nonconfusion increase plenitude development  culmination of skillful qualities that have arisen This is called right effort
And what is right mindfulness
There is the case where a monk remains focused on the body in  of itself  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the world
He remains focused on feelings in  of themselves the mind in  of itself mental qualities in  of themselves  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the world
This is called right mindfulness
And what is right concentration
There is the case where a monk  quite withdrawn from sensuality withdrawn from unskillful qualities  enters  remains in the first jhana rapture  pleasure born from withdrawal accompanied by directed thought  evaluation
With the stilling of directed thoughts  evaluations he enters  remains in the second jhana rapture  pleasure born of composure unification of awareness free from directed thought  evaluation  internal assurance
With the fading of rapture he remains equanimous mindful  alert and senses pleasure with the body
He enters  remains in the third jhana of which the Noble Ones declare 'Equanimous  mindful he has a pleasant abiding' With the abandoning of pleasure  pain  as with the earlier disappearance of elation  distress  he enters  remains in the fourth jhana purity of equanimity  mindfulness neither pleasure nor pain
This is called right concentration
This is called the noble truth of the path of practice leading to the cessation of stress
In this way he remains focused internally on mental qualities in  of themselves or externally on mental qualities in  of themselves or both internally  externally on mental qualities in  of themselves
Or he remains focused on the phenomenon of origination with regard to mental qualities on the phenomenon of passing away with regard to mental qualities or on the phenomenon of origination  passing away with regard to mental qualities
Or his mindfulness that 'There are mental qualities' is maintained to the extent of knowledge  remembrance
And he remains independent unsustained by anything in the world
This is how a monk remains focused on mental qualities in  of themselves with reference to the four noble truths
Now if anyone would develop these four frames of reference in this way for seven years one of two fruits can be expected for him either gnosis right here  now or  if there be any remnant of clingingsustenance  nonreturn
Let alone seven years
If anyone would develop these four frames of reference in this way for six years five four three two years one year seven months six months five four three two months one month half a month one of two fruits can be expected for him either gnosis right here  now or  if there be any remnant of clingingsustenance  nonreturn
Let alone half a month
If anyone would develop these four frames of reference in this way for seven days one of two fruits can be expected for him either gnosis right here  now or  if there be any remnant of clingingsustenance  nonreturn
'This is the direct path for the purification of beings for the overcoming of sorrow  lamentation for the disappearance of pain  distress for the attainment of the right method  for the realization of Unbinding  in other words the four frames of reference' Thus was it said and in reference to this was it said
That is what the Blessed One said
Gratified the monks delighted in the Blessed One's words
Then the Blessed One said to Ven
Ananda Ananda let's go to the far shore of the Hiraññavati River
We'll head for Upavattana the Mallans' salgrove near Kusinara
As you say lord Ven
Ananda responded to the Blessed One
Then the Blessed One with a large community of monks went to the far shore of the Hiraññavati River and headed for Upavattana the Mallans' salgrove near Kusinara
On arrival he said to Ven
Ananda Ananda please prepare a bed for me between the twin saltrees with its head to the north
I am tired and will lie down
Responding As you say lord Ven
Ananda prepared a bed between the twin saltrees with its head to the north
Then the Blessed One lay down on his right side in the lion's sleeping posture with one foot on top of the other mindful  alert
Now at that time the twin saltrees were in full bloom even though it was not the time for flowering
They showered strewed  sprinkled on the Tathagata's body in homage to him
Heavenly coraltree blossoms fell from the sky showering strewing  sprinkling the Tathagata's body in homage to him
Heavenly sandalwood powder fell from the sky showering strewing  sprinkling the Tathagata's body in homage to him
Heavenly music was playing in the sky in homage to the Tathagata
Heavenly songs were sung in the sky in homage to the Tathagata
Then the Blessed One said to Ven
Ananda Ananda the twin saltrees are in full bloom even though it's not the flowering season
They shower strew  sprinkle on the Tathagata's body in homage to him
Heavenly coraltree blossoms are falling from the sky Heavenly sandalwood powder is falling from the sky Heavenly music is playing in the sky Heavenly songs are sung in the sky in homage to the Tathagata
But it is not to this extent that a Tathagata is worshipped honored respected venerated or paid homage to
Rather the monk nun male lay follower or female lay follower who keeps practicing the Dhamma in accordance with the Dhamma who keeps practicing masterfully who lives in accordance with the Dhamma that is the person who worships honors respects venerates  pays homage to the Tathagata with the highest homage
So you should train yourselves 'We will keep practicing the Dhamma in accordance with the Dhamma we will keep practicing masterfully we will live in accordance with the Dhamma' That's how you should train yourselves
Now at that time Ven
Upavana was standing in front of the Blessed One fanning him
Then the Blessed One dismissed him saying Go away monk
Don't stand in front of me Then the thought occurred to Ven
Ananda For a long time now this Ven
Upavana has been an attendant to the Blessed One staying near him and traveling with him
But now in his final hour he dismisses him saying 'Go away monk
Don't stand in front of me' Now what is the reason what is the cause why the Blessed One dismisses him saying 'Go away monk
Don't stand in front of me'
Then Ven
Ananda said to the Blessed One For a long time now this Ven
Upavana has been an attendant to the Blessed One staying near him and traveling with him
But now in his final hour he dismisses him saying 'Go away monk
Don't stand in front of me' Now what is the reason what is the cause why the Blessed One dismisses him saying 'Go away monk
Don't stand in front of me'
Ananda most of the devatas from ten worldsystems have gathered in order to see the Tathagata
For twelve leagues all around Upavattana the Mallans' salgrove near Kusinara there is not the space even of the tip of a horsetail hair that is not occupied by eminent devatas
The devatas Ananda are complaining 'We have come a long distance to see the Tathagata
Only once in a long long time does a Tathagata  worthy  rightly selfawakened  arise in the world
Tonight in the last watch of the night the total Unbinding of the Tathagata will occur
And this eminent monk is standing in front of the Blessed One blocking the way
We aren't getting to see the Blessed One in his final hour' But lord what is the state of the devatas the Blessed One is referring to
Ananda there are devatas who perceive space to be earth
Tearing at their hair they are weeping
Uplifting their arms they are weeping
As if their feet were cut out from under them they fall down and roll back  forth crying 'All too soon the Blessed One will be totally unbound
All too soon the One Wellgone will be totally unbound
All too soon the One with Eyes will disappear from the world' Then there are devatas who perceive earth to be earth
Tearing at their hair they are weeping
Uplifting their arms they are weeping
As if their feet were cut out from under them they fall down and roll back  forth crying 'All too soon the Blessed One will be totally unbound
All too soon the One Wellgone will be totally unbound
All too soon the One with Eyes will disappear from the world' But those devatas who are free from passion acquiesce mindful  alert 'Fabrications are inconstant
What else is there to expect' In the past lord the monks in all directions after ending the Rains retreat came to see the Tathagata
Thus we got to see  attend to the monks who inspire the heart
But now after the Blessed One is gone we won't get to see or attend to the monks who inspire the heart
Ananda there are these four places that merit being seen by a clansman with conviction that merit his feelings of urgency  dismay
Which four
'Here the Tathagata was born' is a place that merits being seen by a clansman with conviction that merits his feelings of urgency  dismay
'Here the Tathagata awakened to the unexcelled right selfawakening' 'Here the Tathagata set rolling the unexcelled wheel of Dhamma' 'Here the Tathagata was totally unbound in the remainderless property of Unbinding' is a place that merits being seen by a clansman with conviction that merits his feelings of urgency  dismay
These are the four places that merit being seen by a clansman with conviction that merit his feelings of urgency  dismay
They will come out of conviction Ananda  monks nuns male lay followers  female lay followers  to the spots where 'Here the Tathagata was born' 'Here the Tathagata awakened to the unexcelled right selfawakening' 'Here the Tathagata set rolling the unexcelled wheel of Dhamma' 'Here the Tathagata was totally unbound in the remainderless property of Unbinding' And anyone who dies while making a pilgrimage to these memorials with a bright confident mind will  on the breakup of the body after death  reappear in a good destination the heavenly world
Lord what course should we follow with regard to womenfolk
Notseeing Ananda But when there is seeing lord what course should be followed
Notaddressing Ananda
But when we are addressed what course should be followed
Mindfulness should be established Ananda
And lord what course should we follow with regard to the Tathagata's body
You are not to be concerned about the Tathagata's funeral
Please Ananda strive for the true goal be committed to the true goal dwell heedful ardent  resolute for the sake of the true goal
There are wise nobles brahmans  householders who are highly confident in the Tathagata
They will conduct the Tathagata's funeral
But lord what course should be followed with regard to the Tathagata's body
The course they follow with regard to the body of a wheelturning monarch Ananda is the course that should be followed with regard to the body of the Tathagata
And what lord is the course they follow with regard to the body of a wheelturning monarch
Ananda they wrap the body of a wheelturning monarch in new linen cloth
Having wrapped it in new linen cloth they wrap it in teased cottonwool
Having wrapped it in teased cottonwool they wrap it in new linen cloth
Having done this times they place the body in an iron oilvat cover it with an iron lid make a pyre composed totally of perfumed substances and cremate the body
Then they build a burial mound for the wheelturning monarch at a great fourway intersection
That is the course that they follow with regard to the body of a wheelturning monarch
The course they follow with regard to the body of a wheelturning monarch Ananda is the course that should be followed with regard to the body of the Tathagata
A burial mound for the Tathagata is to be built at a great fourway intersection
And those who offer a garland a scent or a perfume powder there or bow down there or brighten their minds there that will be for their longterm welfare  happiness
There are these four who are worthy of a burial mound
Which four
A Tathagata worthy  rightly selfawakened is worthy of a burial mound
A Private Buddha a disciple of a Tathagata a wheelturning monarch is worthy of a burial mound
And for what reason is a Tathagata worthy  rightly selfawakened worthy of a burial mound
'This is the burial mound of a Tathagata worthy  rightly selfawakened' many people will brighten their minds
Having brightened their minds there then  on the breakup of the body after death  they will reappear in a good destination the heavenly world
It is for this reason that a Tathagata worthy  rightly selfawakened is worthy of a burial mound
And for what reason is a Private Buddha worthy of a burial mound

Having brightened their minds there then  on the breakup of the body after death  they will reappear in a good destination the heavenly world
And for what reason is a wheelturning monarch worthy of a burial mound
'This is the burial mound of a wheelturning monarch' many people will brighten their minds
Having brightened their minds there then  on the breakup of the body after death  they will reappear in a good destination the heavenly world
It is for this reason that a wheelturning monarch is worthy of a burial mound
These are the four who are worthy of a burial mound
Then Ven
Ananda going into a building stood leaning against the door jamb weeping Here I am still in training with work left to do and the total Unbinding of my teacher is about to occur  the teacher who has had such sympathy for me
Then the Blessed One said to the monks Monks where is Ananda
Lord Ven
Ananda having gone into that building stands leaning against the door jamb weeping 'Here I am still in training with work left to do and the total Unbinding of my teacher is about to occur  the teacher who has had such sympathy for me' Then the Blessed One told a certain monk Come monk
In my name call Ananda saying 'The Teacher calls you my friend' As you say lord the monk answered and having gone to Ven
Ananda on arrival he said The Teacher calls you my friend
As you say my friend Ven
Ananda replied
Then he went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side
As he was sitting there the Blessed One said to him Enough Ananda
Don't grieve
Don't lament
Haven't I already taught you the state of growing different with regard to all things dear  appealing the state of becoming separate the state of becoming otherwise
What else is there to expect
It's impossible that one could forbid anything born existent fabricated  subject to disintegration from disintegrating
For a long time Ananda you have waited on the Tathagata with physical acts of good will  helpful happy wholehearted without limit with verbal acts of good will with mental acts of good will  helpful happy wholehearted without limit
You are one who has made merit
Commit yourself to exertion and soon you will be without mental fermentations
Then the Blessed One addressed the monks Monks those who in the past were worthy ones rightly selfawakened had foremost attendants just as I have had Ananda
Those who in the future will be worthy ones rightly selfawakened will have foremost attendants just as I have had Ananda
Ananda is wise he knows 'This is the time to approach to see the Tathagata
This is the time for monks this the time for nuns this the time for male layfollowers this the time for female layfollowers this the time for kings  their ministers this the time for sectarians this the time for the followers of sectarians'
There are these four marvelous  amazing qualities in Ananda
If a group of monks approaches to see Ananda they are gratified at the sight of him
If he speaks Dhamma to them they are gratified with what he says
Before they are sated he falls silent
If a group of nuns approaches to see Ananda If a group of male lay followers approaches to see Ananda If a group of female lay followers approaches to see Ananda they are gratified at the sight of him
If he speaks Dhamma to them they are gratified with what he says
Before they are sated he falls silent
These are the four marvelous  amazing qualities in Ananda
There are these four marvelous  amazing qualities in a wheelturning monarch
If a group of noble warriors approaches to see him If a group of brahmans approaches to see him If a group of householders approaches to see him If a group of contemplatives approaches to see him they are gratified at the sight of him
If he speaks to them they are gratified with what he says
Before they are sated he falls silent
In the same way monks there are these four marvelous  amazing qualities in Ananda

If he speaks Dhamma to them they are gratified with what he says
Before they are sated he falls silent
These are the four marvelous  amazing qualities in Ananda
When this was said Ven
Ananda said to the Blessed One Lord may the Blessed One not be totally unbound in this little town this dusty town this branch township
There are other great cities Campa Rajagaha Savatthi Saketa Kosambi Vanarasi
May the Blessed One be totally unbound there
In those cities there are many wealthy noble warriors brahmans  householders who have high confidence in the Tathagata
They will conduct the Tathagata's funeral
Don't say that Ananda
Don't say that 'this little town this dusty town this branch township' In the past Ananda a king named Mahasudassana was a wheelturning monarch a righteous king ruling righteously who was a conqueror of the four directions a stabilizer of his country endowed with the seven treasures
This Kusinara was his capital city named Kusavati twelve leagues long from east to west seven leagues wide from north to south
Kusavati was powerful rich  wellpopulated crowded with people  prosperous
Just as the capital city of the devas named Alakamanda is powerful rich  wellpopulated crowded with yakkhas  prosperous in the same way Kusavati was powerful rich  wellpopulated crowded with people  prosperous
By day or by night it was never lacking in ten sounds the sound of elephants horses carts drums tabors lutes songs cymbals gongs with cries of 'Eat
Drink
Snack' as the tenth
Now Ananda go into Kusinara and announce to the Kusinara Mallans 'Tonight Vasitthas in the last watch of the night the total Unbinding of the Tathagata will occur
Come out Vasitthas
Come out Vasitthas
Don't later regret that The Tathagata's total Unbinding occurred within the borders of our very own town but we didn't get to see him in his final hour' Responding As you say lord Ven
Ananda put on his robe and  carrying his bowl  outer robe  went unaccompanied into Kusinara
Now at that time the Kusinara Mallans had met for some business in their assembly hall
Ven
Ananda went to the assembly hall and on arrival announced to them Tonight Vasitthas in the last watch of the night the total Unbinding of the Tathagata will occur
Come out Vasitthas
Come out Vasitthas
Don't later regret that 'The Tathagata's total Unbinding occurred within the borders of our very own town but we didn't get to see him in his final hour' When they heard Ven
Ananda the Mallans together with their sons daughters  wives were shocked saddened their minds overflowing with sorrow
Some of them wept tearing at their hair they wept uplifting their arms
As if their feet were cut out from under them they fell down and rolled back  forth crying All too soon the Blessed One will be totally unbound
All too soon the One Wellgone will be totally unbound
All too soon the One with Eyes will disappear from the world
Then the Mallans together with their sons daughters  wives  shocked saddened their minds overflowing with sorrow  went to Ven
Ananda at Upavattana the Mallans' salgrove near Kusinara
The thought occurred to Ven
Ananda If I let the Mallans pay reverence to the Blessed One one by one the night will be over before they have finished paying reverence
What if I were to have them pay reverence to the Blessed One arranging them family by family announcing 'Lord the Mallan named soso together with his children  wives servants  retainers bows down with his head at the Blessed One's feet' So Ven
Ananda arranging the Mallans family by family had them pay reverence to the Blessed One Lord the Mallan named soso together with his children  wives servants  retainers bows down with his head at the Blessed One's feet
In this way Ven
Ananda got the Mallans to pay reverence to the Blessed One within the first watch of the night
Now at that time Subhadda the Wanderer was staying in Kusinara
He heard Tonight in the last watch of the night the total Unbinding of Gotama the contemplative will take place Then the thought occurred to him I have heard the elder wanderers teachers of teachers saying that only once in a long long time do Tathagatas  worthy ones rightly selfawakened  appear in the world
Tonight in the last watch of the night the total Unbinding of Gotama the contemplative will occur
Now there is a doubt that has arisen in me but I have faith that he could teach me the Dhamma in such a way that I might abandon that doubt
So he went to Upavattana the Mallans' salgrove and on arrival said to Ven
Ananda I have heard the elder wanderers teachers of teachers saying that only once in a long long time do Tathagatas  worthy ones rightly selfawakened  appear in the world
Tonight in the last watch of the night the total Unbinding of Gotama the contemplative will occur
Now there is a doubt that has arisen in me but I have faith that he could teach me the Dhamma in such a way that I might abandon that doubt
It would be good Ven
Ananda if you would let me see him
When this was said Ven
Ananda said to him Enough friend Subhadda
Don't bother the Blessed One
The Blessed One is tired
For a second time For a third time Subhadda the Wanderer said to Ven
Ananda It would be good Ven
Ananda if you would let me see him
For a third time Ven
Ananda said to him Enough friend Subhadda
Don't bother the Blessed One
The Blessed One is tired
Now the Blessed One heard the exchange between Ven
Ananda  Subhadda the Wanderer and so he said to Ven
Ananda Enough Ananda
Don't stand in his way
Let him see the Tathagata
Whatever he asks me will all be for the sake of knowledge and not to be bothersome
And whatever I answer when asked he will quickly understand
So Ven
Ananda said to Subhadda the Wanderer Go ahead friend Subhadda
The Blessed One gives you his leave
Then Subhadda went to the Blessed One and exchanged courteous greetings with him
After an exchange of friendly greetings  courtesies he sat to one side
As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One Venerable sir these brahmans  contemplatives each with his group each with his community each the teacher of his group an honored leader wellregarded by people at large  ie Purana Kassapa Makkhali Gosala Ajita Kesakambalin Pakudha Kaccayana Sañjaya Belatthaputta  the Nigantha Nataputta Do they all have direct knowledge as they themselves claim or do they all not have direct knowledge or do some of them have direct knowledge and some of them not
Enough Subhadda
Put this question aside
I will teach you the Dhamma
Listen and pay close attention
I will speak
Yes lord Subhadda answered and the Blessed One said In any doctrine  discipline where the noble eightfold path is not found no contemplative of the first second third fourth order is found
But in any doctrine  discipline where the noble eightfold path is found contemplatives of the first second third fourth order are found
The noble eightfold path is found in this doctrine  discipline and right here there are contemplatives of the first second third fourth order
Other teachings are empty of knowledgeable contemplatives
And if the monks dwell rightly this world will not be empty of arahants
And no contemplative of the second third fourth order
Other teachings are empty of knowledgeable contemplatives
And if the monks dwell rightly this world will not be empty of arahants
Then Subhadda the Wanderer said Magnificent lord
Magnificent
Just as if he were to place upright what was overturned to reveal what was hidden to point out the way to one who was lost or to carry a lamp into the dark so that those with eyes could see forms in the same way has the Blessed One  through many lines of reasoning  made the Dhamma clear
I go to the Blessed One for refuge to the Dhamma  to the community of monks
Let me obtain the going forth in the Blessed One's presence let me obtain admission
Anyone Subhadda who has previously belonged to another sect and who desires the going forth  admission in this doctrine  discipline must first undergo probation for four months
If at the end of four months the monks feel so moved they give him the going forth  admit him to the monk's state
But I know distinctions among individuals in this matter
Lord if that is so I am willing to undergo probation for four years
If at the end of four years the monks feel so moved let them give me the going forth  admit me to the monk's state
Then the Blessed One said to Ven
Ananda Very well then Ananda give Subhadda the going forth
Yes lord Ananda answered
Then Subhadda said to Ven
Ananda It is a gain for you Ananda a great gain that you have been anointed here in the Teacher's presence with the pupil's anointing
Then Subhadda the Wanderer received the going forth  the admission in the Blessed One's presence
And not long after his admission  dwelling alone secluded heedful ardent  resolute  he in no long time reached  remained in the supreme goal of the holy life for which clansmen rightly go forth from home into homelessness knowing  realizing it for himself in the here  now
He knew Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task done
There is nothing further for the sake of this world And thus Ven
Subhadda became another one of the arahants the last of the Blessed One's facetoface disciples
Then the Blessed One said to Ven
Ananda Now if it occurs to any of you  'The teaching has lost its authority we are without a Teacher'  do not view it in that way
Whatever Dhamma  Vinaya I have pointed out  formulated for you that will be your Teacher when I am gone
At present the monks address one another as 'friend' but after I am gone they are not to address one another that way
The more senior monks are to address the newer monks by their name or clan or as 'friend' The newer monks are to address the more senior monks as 'venerable' or 'sir'
After I am gone the sangha  if it wants  may abolish the lesser  minor training rules
After I am gone the monk Channa should be given the brahma penalty
What lord is the brahma penalty
Channa may say what he wants Ananda but he is not to be spoken to instructed or admonished by the monks
Then the Blessed One addressed the monks If even a single monk has any doubt or perplexity concerning the Buddha Dhamma or Sangha the path or the practice ask
Don't later regret that 'The Teacher was facetoface with us but we didn't bring ourselves to crossquestion him in his presence' When this was said the monks were silent
A second time the Blessed One said If even a single monk has any doubt or perplexity concerning the Buddha Dhamma or Sangha the path or the practice ask
Don't later regret that 'The Teacher was facetoface with us but we didn't bring ourselves to crossquestion him in his presence' A second time the monks were silent
A third time the Blessed One said If even a single monk has any doubt or perplexity concerning the Buddha Dhamma or Sangha the path or the practice ask
Don't later regret that 'The Teacher was facetoface with us but we didn't bring ourselves to crossquestion him in his presence' A third time the monks were silent
Then the Blessed One addressed the monks Now if it's out of respect for the Teacher that you don't ask let a friend inform a friend
When this was said the monks were silent
Then Ven
Ananda said to the Blessed One It's amazing lord
It's marvelous
I'm confident that in this community of monks there is not even a single monk who has any doubt or perplexity concerning the Buddha Dhamma or Sangha the path or the practice
You Ananda speak out of confidence while there is knowledge in the Tathagata that in this community of monks there is not even a single monk who has any doubt or perplexity concerning the Buddha Dhamma or Sangha the path or the practice
Of these monks the most backward is a streamwinner not destined for the planes of deprivation headed to selfawakening for sure
Then the Blessed One addressed the monks Now then monks I exhort you All fabrications are subject to decay
Bring about completion by being heedful Those were the Tathagata's last words
Then the Blessed One entered the first jhana
Emerging from that he entered the second jhana
Emerging from that he entered the third the fourth jhana the dimension of the infinitude of space the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness the dimension of nothingness the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception
Emerging from that he entered the cessation of perception  feeling
Then Ven
Ananda said to Ven
Anuruddha Ven
Anuruddha the Blessed One is totally unbound
No friend Ananda
The Blessed One isn't totally unbound
He has entered the cessation of perception  feeling
Then the Blessed One emerging from the cessation of perception  feeling entered the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception
Emerging from that he entered the dimension of nothingness the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness the dimension of the infinitude of space the fourth jhana the third the second the first jhana
Emerging from the first jhana he entered the second the third the fourth jhana
Emerging from the fourth jhana he immediately was totally Unbound
When the Blessed One was totally Unbound simultaneously with the total Unbinding there was a great earthquake awesome  hairraising and the drums of the devas sounded
When the Blessed One was totally Unbound simultaneously with the total Unbinding Sahampati Brahma uttered this verse
When the Blessed One was totally Unbound simultaneously with the total Unbinding Sakka ruler of the gods uttered this verse
When the Blessed One was totally Unbound simultaneously with the total Unbinding Ven
Anuruddha uttered this verse
When the Blessed One was totally Unbound simultaneously with the total Unbinding Ven
Ananda uttered this verse
When the Blessed One was totally Unbound simultaneously with the total Unbinding some of the monks present who were not without passion wept uplifting their arms
As if their feet were cut out from under them they fell down and rolled back  forth crying All too soon is the Blessed One totally unbound
All too soon is the One Wellgone totally unbound
All too soon the One with Eyes has disappeared from the world But those monks who were free from passion acquiesced mindful  alert Fabrications are inconstant
What else is there to expect
Then Ven
Anuruddha addressed the monks Enough friends
Don't grieve
Don't lament
Hasn't the Blessed One already taught the state of growing different with regard to all things dear  appealing the state of becoming separate the state of becoming otherwise
What else is there to expect
It's impossible that one could forbid anything born existent fabricated  subject to disintegration from disintegrating
The devatas friends are complaining
But Ven
Anuruddha what is the state of the devatas the Blessed One is referring to
Friend Ananda there are devatas who perceive space to be earth
Tearing at their hair they are weeping
Uplifting their arms they are weeping
As if their feet were cut out from under them they fall down and roll back  forth crying 'All too soon is the Blessed One totally unbound
All too soon is the One Wellgone totally unbound
All too soon the One with Eyes has disappeared from the world' Then there are devatas who perceive earth to be earth
Tearing at their hair they are weeping
Uplifting their arms they are weeping
As if their feet were cut out from under them they fall down and roll back  forth crying 'All too soon is the Blessed One totally unbound
All too soon is the One Wellgone totally unbound
All too soon the One with Eyes has disappeared from the world' But those devatas who are free from passion acquiesce mindful  alert 'Fabrications are inconstant
What else is there to expect' Then Ven
Anuruddha  Ven
Ananda spent the remainder of the night in Dhamma talk
Then Ven
Anuruddha said to Ven
Ananda Go friend Ananda
Entering Kusinara announce to the Kusinara Mallans 'The Blessed One Vasitthas is totally unbound
Now is the time for you to do as you see fit' Responding As you say sir Ven
Ananda in the early morning put on his robe and  carrying his bowl  outer robe  went unaccompanied into Kusinara
Now at that time the Kusinara Mallans had met for some business in their assembly hall
Ven
Ananda went to the assembly hall and on arrival announced to them The Blessed One Vasitthas is totally unbound
Now is the time for you to do as you see fit
When they heard Ven
Ananda the Mallans together with their sons daughters  wives were shocked saddened their minds overflowing with sorrow
Some of them wept tearing at their hair they wept uplifting their arms
As if their feet were cut out from under them they fell down and rolled back  forth crying All too soon is the Blessed One totally unbound
All too soon is the One Wellgone totally unbound
All too soon the One with Eyes has disappeared from the world
Then the Kusinara Mallans ordered their men In that case I say gather scents garlands  all the musical instruments in Kusinara Then taking scents garlands  all the musical instruments in Kusinara along with lengths of cloth the Kusinara Mallans went to the Blessed One's body in Upavattana the Mallans' salgrove near Kusinara
On arrival they spent the entire day in worshipping honoring respecting  venerating the Blessed One's body with dances songs music garlands  scents in making cloth canopies and arranging floral wreaths
Then the thought occurred to them It's too late today to cremate the Blessed One's body
We'll cremate the Blessed One's body tomorrow And so they spent the second day the third day the fourth day the fifth day the sixth day in worshipping honoring respecting  venerating the Blessed One's body with dances songs music garlands  scents in making cloth canopies and arranging floral wreaths
Then on the seventh day the thought occurred to them Worshipping honoring respecting  venerating to the Blessed One's body with dances songs music garlands  scents let's carry it to the south around the outside of the town and cremate it to the south of the town
Then eight leading Mallans having bathed their heads and wearing new linen cloth thinking We'll lift up the Blessed One's body were unable to lift it
So the Kusinara Mallans asked Ven
Anuruddha What is the reason Ven
Anuruddha what is the cause why these eight leading Mallans having bathed their heads and wearing new linen cloth thinking 'We'll lift up the Blessed One's body' are unable to lift it
Your intention Vasitthas is one thing
The devas' intention is another
But what Ven
Anuruddha is the devas' intention
Your intention Vasitthas is 'Worshipping honoring respecting  venerating the Blessed One's body with dances songs music garlands  scents let's carry it to the south around the outside of the town and cremate it to the south of the town' The devas' intention is 'Worshipping honoring respecting  venerating the Blessed One's body with heavenly dances songs music garlands  scents let's carry it to the north of the town enter the town through the north gate carry it through the middle of the town and out the east gate to the Mallans' memorial called Makutabandhana to cremate it there' Then let it be venerable sir in line with the devas' intention
Now at that time Kusinara  even to its rubbish heaps  cesspools  was strewn kneedeep in coraltree flowers
So the devas  the Kusinara Mallans worshipping honoring respecting  venerating the Blessed One's body with heavenly  human dances songs music garlands  scents carried it to the north of the town entered the town through the north gate carried it through the middle of the town and out the east gate to the Mallans' memorial called Makutabandhana
There they set it down
Then the Kusinara Mallans said to Ven
Ananda Venerable sir what course should we follow with regard to the Tathagata's body
The course they follow with regard to the body of a wheelturning monarch Vasitthas is the course that should be followed with regard to the body of the Tathagata
And what venerable sir is the course they follow with regard to the body of a wheelturning monarch
Vasitthas they wrap the body of a wheelturning monarch in new linen cloth
Having wrapped it in new linen cloth they wrap it in teased cottonwool
Having wrapped it in teased cottonwool they wrap it in new linen cloth
Having done this times they place the body in an iron oilvat cover it with an iron lid make a pyre composed totally of perfumed substances and cremate the body
Then they build a burial mound for the wheelturning monarch at a great fourway intersection
That is the course that they follow with regard to the body of a wheelturning monarch
The course they follow with regard to the body of a wheelturning monarch Vasitthas is the course that should be followed with regard to the body of the Tathagata
A burial mound for the Tathagata is to be built at a great fourway intersection
And those who offer a garland a scent or a perfume powder there or bow down there or brighten their minds there that will be for their longterm welfare  happiness
So the Kusinara Mallans ordered their men In that case I say gather the Mallans' teased cottonwool
Then they wrapped the Blessed One's body in new linen cloth
Having wrapped it in new linen cloth they wrapped it in teased cottonwool
Having wrapped it in teased cottonwool they wrapped it in new linen cloth
Having done this times they placed the body in an iron oilvat covered it with an iron lid made a pyre composed totally of perfumed substances and set the body on the pyre
Now at that time Ven
Maha Kassapa was traveling on the highway from Pava to Kusinara with a large community of monks approximately monks in all
Leaving the road he sat down at the foot of a tree
Meanwhile a certain naked ascetic carrying a coraltree flower from Kusinara was traveling on the highway to Pava
Ven
Maha Kassapa saw the naked ascetic coming from afar and on seeing him said to him Do you know our teacher friend
Yes friend I know him
Seven days ago Gotama the contemplative was totally unbound
That's how I got this coraltree flower
With that some of the monks present who were not without passion wept uplifting their arms
As if their feet were cut out from under them they fell down and rolled back  forth crying All too soon is the Blessed One totally unbound
All too soon is the One Wellgone totally unbound
All too soon the One with Eyes has disappeared from the world But those monks who were free from passion acquiesced mindful  alert Fabrications are inconstant
What else is there to expect
Now at that time a monk named Subhadda who had gone forth when old was sitting among the group
He said to the monks Enough friends
Don't grieve
Don't lament
We're well rid of the Great Contemplative
We've been harassed by 'This is allowable
This is not allowable' But now we will do what we want to do and not do what we don't want to do
Then Ven
Maha Kassapa addressed the monks Enough friends
Don't grieve
Don't lament
Hasn't the Blessed One already taught the state of growing different with regard to all things dear  appealing the state of becoming separate the state of becoming otherwise
What else is there to expect
It's impossible that one could forbid anything born existent fabricated  subject to disintegration from disintegrating
Then four leading Mallans having bathed their heads and wearing new linen cloth thinking We'll ignite the Blessed One's pyre were unable to ignite it
So the Kusinara Mallans asked Ven
Anuruddha What is the reason Ven
Anuruddha what is the cause why these four leading Mallans having bathed their heads and wearing new linen cloth thinking 'We'll ignite the Blessed One's pyre' are unable to ignite it
Your intention Vasitthas is one thing
The devas' intention is another
But what Ven
Anuruddha is the devas' intention
The devas' intention Vasitthas is 'This Ven
Maha Kassapa is traveling on the highway from Pava to Kusinara with a large community of monks approximately monks in all
The Blessed One's pyre will not catch fire until Ven
Maha Kassapa has worshipped the Blessed One's feet with his head' Then let it be venerable sir in line with the devas' intention
So Ven
Maha Kassapa went to the Blessed One's pyre at Makutabandhana the Mallans' memorial near Kusinara
On arrival arranging his robe over one shoulder he placed his hands palmtopalm over his heart circumambulated the pyre uncovered the Blessed One's feet and worshipped them with his head
And the monks arranging their robes over one shoulder placed their hands palmtopalm over their hearts circumambulated the pyre and worshipped the Blessed One's feet with their heads
As soon as it had been worshipped by Ven
Maha Kassapa and the monks the Blessed One's pyre caught fire of its own accord
In the burning of the Blessed One's body no cinder or ash of the outer skin inner skin flesh tendons or oil of the joints could be discerned
Only the bonerelics remained
Just as in the burning of ghee or oil no cinder or ash can be discerned in the same way in the burning of the Blessed One's body no cinder or ash of the outer skin inner skin flesh tendons or oil of the joints could be discerned
Only the bonerelics remained
And of the twinwrappings only two were burnt the innermost  the outermost
When the Blessed One's body was consumed a cascade of water fell from the sky extinguishing the Blessed One's pyre
Water shot up from a saltree as well extinguishing the Blessed One's pyre
The Kusinara Mallans with all kinds of scented water extinguished the Blessed One's pyre
Then for seven days they kept the bonerelics in their assembly hall  setting them round with a lattice of spears surrounded by ramparts of bows  worshipping honoring respecting  venerating them with dances songs music garlands  scents
Then King Ajatasattu Vedehiputta of Magadha heard The Blessed One they say has been totally unbound in Kusinara So he sent an envoy to the Kusinara Mallans The Blessed One was a noble warrior
I too am a noble warrior
I deserve a share of the Blessed One's bonerelics
I too will build a burial mound and hold a ceremony for them
The Licchavis of Vesali heard The Blessed One they say has been totally unbound in Kusinara So they sent an envoy to the Kusinara Mallans The Blessed One was a noble warrior
We too are noble warriors
We deserve a share of the Blessed One's bonerelics
We too will build a burial mound and hold a ceremony for them
The Sakyans of Kapilavatthu heard The Blessed One they say has been totally unbound in Kusinara So they sent an envoy to the Kusinara Mallans The Blessed One was the greatest of our relatives
We deserve a share of the Blessed One's bonerelics
We too will build a burial mound and hold a ceremony for them
The Buliyans of Allakappa The Koliyans of Ramagama heard The Blessed One they say has been totally unbound in Kusinara So they sent an envoy to the Kusinara Mallans The Blessed One was a noble warrior
We too are noble warriors
We deserve a share of the Blessed One's bonerelics
We too will build a burial mound and hold a ceremony for them
The Brahman of Vetha Island heard The Blessed One they say has been totally unbound in Kusinara So he sent an envoy to the Kusinara Mallans The Blessed One was a noble warrior
I am a brahman
I deserve a share of the Blessed One's bonerelics
I too will build a burial mound and hold a ceremony for them
The Pava Mallans heard The Blessed One they say has been totally unbound in Kusinara So they sent an envoy to the Kusinara Mallans The Blessed One was a noble warrior
We too are noble warriors
We deserve a share of the Blessed One's bonerelics
We too will build a burial mound and hold a ceremony for them
When this was said the Kusinara Mallans said to the groups  factions The Blessed One was totally unbound within the borders of our own town
We will not give up a share of the Blessed One's bonerelics
When this was said Dona the brahman addressed the groups  factions
In that case brahman you yourself divide the Blessed One's bonerelics into eight equal shares
Responding As you say good sirs to the groups  factions Dona the brahman divided the Blessed One's bonerelics into eight equal shares and then said to the groups  factions Good sirs give me this urn
I will build a burial mound and hold a ceremony for the urn They gave him the urn
Then the Moriyans of Pipphalivana heard The Blessed One they say has been totally unbound in Kusinara So they sent an envoy to the Kusinara Mallans The Blessed One was a noble warrior
We too are noble warriors
We deserve a share of the Blessed One's bonerelics
We too will build a burial mound and hold a ceremony for them
There is no share of the Blessed One's bonerelics
They have been divided
Take the embers from here They took the embers from there
Then King Ajatasattu Vedehiputta of Magadha built a burial mound and held a ceremony for the Blessed One's relics in Rajagaha
The Licchavis of Vesali built a burial mound and held a ceremony for the Blessed One's relics in Vesali
The Sakyans of Kapilavattu built a burial mound and held a ceremony for the Blessed One's relics in Kapilavattu
The Buliyans of Allakappa built a burial mound and held a ceremony for the Blessed One's relics in Allakappa
The Koliyans of Ramagama built a burial mound and held a ceremony for the Blessed One's relics in Ramagama
The brahman of Vettha Island built a burial mound and held a ceremony for the Blessed One's relics on Vettha Island
The Pava Mallans built a burial mound and held a ceremony for the Blessed One's relics in Pava
The Kusinara Mallans built a burial mound and held a ceremony for the Blessed One's relics in Kusinara
Dona the brahman built a burial mound and held a ceremony for the urn
The Moriyans of Pipphalivana built a burial mound and held a ceremony for the embers in Pipphalivana
Thus there were eight burial mounds for the bonerelics a ninth for the urn and a tenth for the embers
That is how it was in the past
It is sometimes assumed based on a passage in SN that the Pali canon is uniformly negative toward this aspect of Buddhist tradition
There Ven
Vakkali who is ill states that For a long time have I wanted to come  see the Blessed One but I haven't had the bodily strength to do so and the Buddha comforts him Enough Vakkali
Why do you want to see this filthy body
Whoever sees the Dhamma sees me whoever sees me sees the Dhamma It should be noted however that the Buddha's treatment of this topic is sensitive to the context
In SN he is talking to a monk who is too sick to come see the Buddha on his own strength and is on the verge of arahantship
Here in DN however the Buddha dismisses Ven
Upavana so as to honor the desire of the devas who want to see him in his last hour and he sends Ven
Ananda into Kusinara to inform the lay people there so that they too will be able to see him in his last hour
His motive here may be similar to that given for encouraging the building of a burial mound dedicated to him seeing him will help human  heavenly beings brighten their minds and that will be for their longterm welfare  happiness
Thus the attitudes expressed on this topic in the Pali canon when taken in their entirety are more complex than is generally recognized
Thus have I heard
On one occasion the Blessed One was living in the abode of Alavaka the Yakkha at Alavi
Then Alavaka approached the Blessed One and said Get out recluse  Very well friend so saying the Blessed One went out
Come in recluse  Very well friend so saying the Blessed One entered
Get out recluse said Alavaka to the Blessed One a second time
 Very well friend so saying the Blessed One went out
Come in recluse  Very well friend so saying the Blessed One entered
Get out recluse said Alavaka to the Blessed One a third time
 Very well friend so saying the Blessed One went out
Come in recluse  Very well friend so saying the Blessed One entered
Get out recluse said Alavaka to the Blessed One a fourth time
 No O friend I will not get out
Do what you will
I will ask you a question recluse
If you do not answer me I will confound your mind or cleave your heart or take you by your feet and fling you over to the further shore of the ocean
Well friend I do not see anyone in the world of Devas Maras Brahmas or among the generation of recluses brahmanas deities and humans who could either confound my mind or cleave my heart or take me by the feet and fling me over to the further shore of the ocean nevertheless friend ask what you will
Then Alavaka addressed the Blessed One in verse
Having thus spoken Alavaka said to the Blessed One
Most excellent O Gotama is thy teaching most excellent
Just as a man would set upright what is overturned reveal what is concealed point out the way to one gone astray bring an oil lamp into the darkness so that those with eyes could see objects even so the Dhamma has been declared in many a manner by the Venerable Gotama
I take refuge in the Venerable Gotama in the Dhamma and in the Sangha
May the Venerable Gotama accept me as a disciple who has taken refuge from this day forth while life lasts
While the Buddha was staying at Savatthi a band of monks having received subjects of meditation from the master proceeded to a forest to spend the rainy season
The tree deities inhabiting this forest were worried by their arrival as they had to descend from tree abodes and dwell on the ground
They hoped however the monks would leave soon but finding that the monks would stay the vassana period of three months harassed them in diverse ways during the night with the intention of scaring them away
Living under such conditions being impossible the monks went to the Master and informed him of their difficulties
Thereon the Buddha instructed them in the Metta sutta and advised their return equipped with this sutta for their protection
The monks went back to the forest and practicing the instruction conveyed permeated the whole atmosphere with their radiant thoughts of metta or lovingkindness
The deities so affected by this power of love henceforth allowed them to meditate in peace
The discourse gets divided into two parts
The first detailing the standard of moral conduct required by one who wishes to attain Purity and Peace and the second the method of practice of metta
He who is skilled in well being and who wishes to attain that state of Calm should act thus he should be dexterous upright exceedingly upright obedient gentle and humble
Contented easily supportable with but few responsibilities of simple livelihood controlled in the senses prudent courteous and not hanker after association with families
Let him not perform the slightest wrong for which wise men may rebuke him
'May all beings be happy and safe
May they have happy minds'

Whatever living beings there may be  feeble or strong long stout or of medium size short small large those seen or those unseen those dwelling far or near those who are born as well as those yet to be born  may all beings have happy minds
Let him not deceive another nor despise anyone anywhere
In anger or ill will let him not wish another ill
Just as a mother would protect her only child with her life even so let one cultivate a boundless love towards all beings
Let him radiate boundless love towards the entire world  above below and across  unhindered without ill will without enmity
Standing walking sitting or reclining as long as he is awake let him develop this mindfulness
This they say is 'Noble Living' here
Not falling into wrong views  being virtuous endowed with insight lust in the senses discarded  verily never again will he return to conceive in a womb
Thus have I heard
On one occasion the Blessed One was living near Savatthi at Jetavana at Anathapindika's monastery
Then in the forenoon the Blessed One having dressed himself took bowl and robe and entered the city of Savatthi for alms
Now at that time a fire was burning and an offering was being prepared in the house of the brahman Aggikabharadvaja
Then the Blessed One while on his alms round came to the brahman's residence
The brahman seeing the Blessed One some way off said this Stay there you shaveling stay there you wretched monk stay there you outcast When he spoke thus the Blessed One said to the brahman Do you know brahman who an outcast is and what the conditions are that make an outcast No indeed Venerable Gotama I do not know who an outcast is nor the conditions that make an outcast
It is good if Venerable Gotama were to explain the Dhamma to me so that I may know who an outcast is and what the conditions are that make an outcast
Listen then brahman and pay attention I will speak
Yes Venerable Sir replied the brahman
Whosoever is angry harbors hatred and is reluctant to speak well of others perverted in views deceitful  know him as an outcast
Whosoever in this world kills living beings once born or twice born in whom there is no sympathy for living beings  know him as an outcast
Whosoever destroys and besieges villages and hamlets and becomes notorious as an oppressor  know him as an outcast
Be it in the village or in the forest whosoever steals what belongs to others what is not given to him  know him as an outcast
Whosoever having actually incurred a debt runs away when he is pressed to pay saying 'I owe no debt to you'  know him as an outcast
Whosoever coveting anything kills a person going along the road and grabs whatever that person has  know him as an outcast
He who for his own sake or for the sake of others or for the sake of wealth utters lies when questioned as a witness  know him as an outcast
Whosoever by force or with consent associates with the wives of relatives or friends  know him as an outcast
Whosoever being wealthy supports not his mother and father who have grown old  know him as an outcast
Whosoever strikes and annoys by speech mother father brother sister or motherinlaw or fatherinlaw  know him as an outcast
Whosoever when questioned about what is good says what is detrimental and talks in an evasive manner know him as an outcast
Whosoever having committed an evil deed wishes that it may not be known to others and commits evil in secret  know him as an outcast
Whosoever having gone to another's house and partaken of choice food does not honor that host by offering food when he repays the visit  know him as an outcast
Whosoever deceives by uttering lies a brahman or an ascetic or any other mendicant  know him as an outcast
Whosoever when a brahman or ascetic appears during mealtime angers him by harsh speech and does not offer him  know him as an outcast
Whosoever in this world shrouded in ignorance speaks harsh words or falsehood expecting to gain something  know him as an outcast
Whosoever debased by his pride exalts himself and belittles other  know him as an outcast
Whosoever is given to anger is miserly has base desires and is selfish deceitful shameless and fearless  know him as an outcast
Whosoever reviles the Enlightened One or a disciple of the Buddha recluse or a householder  know him as an outcast
Whosoever not being an arahant a Consummate One pretends to be so is a thief in the whole universe  he is the lowest of outcasts
Not by birth is one an outcast not by birth is one a brahman
By deed one becomes an outcast by deed one becomes a brahman
Know ye by the example I now cite
There was an outcast's son Sopaka who became known as Matanga
This Matanga attained the highest fame so difficult to gain
Many were the warriors and brahmans who went to attend on him
Mounting the celestial chariot along the passionfree high road reached the Brahma realm having given up sense desires
His birth did not prevent him from being reborn in the Brahma realm
There are brahmans born in the family of preceptors kinsmen of hymns
They are often seen committing evil deeds
In this life itself they are despised in the next they are born in an evil state of existence
High birth does not prevent them from falling into a woeful state or from censure
Not by birth is one an outcast not by birth is one a brahman
By deed one becomes an outcast by deed one becomes an brahman
When the Buddha had thus spoken the Brahman Aggikabharadvaja said to the Blessed One Excellent O Venerable Gotama excellent
Just as O Venerable Gotama a man were to set upright what had been overturned or were to reveal what had been hidden or were to point the way to one who had gone astray or were to hold an oil lamp in the dark so that those with eyes may see things even so in many ways has the Venerable Gotama expounded the Dhamma the doctrine
I take refuge in the Venerable Gotama the Dhamma and the Sangha the Order
May the Venerable Gotama accept me as a lay follower who has taken refuge from this day onwards while life lasts
Thus have I heard
On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Dakkhinagiri in the brahmana village Ekanala in Magadha
Now at that time it being the sowing season five hundred plows of the brahman Kasibharadvaja were put to use
Then in the forenoon the Blessed One having dressed himself took bowl and robe and went to the place where brahman Kasibharadvaja's work was going on
It was the time of food distribution by the brahman and the Blessed One drew near and stood at one side
Bharadvaja seeing the Blessed One standing there for alms said to him
Recluse I do plow and do sow and having plowed and sown I eat
You also recluse should plow and sow having plowed and sown you should eat
I too brahman plow and sow having plowed and sown I eat
We do not see the Venerable Gotama's yoke or plow or plowshare or goad or oxen
Nevertheless the Venerable Gotama says 'I too brahman plow and sow having plowed and sown I eat' Thereupon the brahman addressed the Blessed One in a stanza
You profess to be a plowman yet your plow we do not see asked about your plow and the rest tell us of them that we may know
Faith is my seed austerity the rain wisdom my yoke and plow modesty is the pole mind the strap mindfulness is my plowshare and goad
Controlled in speech and conduct guarded in deed and speech abstemious in food I make truth my weed cutter arahantship my deliverance complete
Exertion my team in yoke draws me to Nibbana's security and on it goes without stopping wither gone one does not suffer
Thuswise is this plowing plowed which bears the fruit of Deathlessness having plowed this plowing one is freed from every ill
Then brahman Kasibharadvaja filling a golden bowl with milkrice offered it to the Blessed One saying May the Venerable Gotama partake of this milk rice a plowman indeed is Venerable Gotama who plows a plow for the fruit of Deathlessness
What I receive by reciting verses O brahman I should not eat
It is not the tradition of those who practice right livelihood
The Buddhas reject what is received by reciting verses
This brahman is the conduct as long as Dhamma reigns
To those wholly consummate taintless and welldisciplined great sages should thou offer other food and drink sure field is that for meritseeking men
To whom then Venerable Gotama shall I give this milk rice
Brahman in the world of Devas Maras and Brahmas or among the generation of recluses brahmanas deities and humans there is no one by whom this milk rice if eaten could be wholly digested except by the Tathagata or the disciple of a Tathagata
Therefore brahman either cast this milk rice where there is no grass or into water where there are no living creatures
Thereupon the brahman flung that milk rice into water where there were no living creatures and the milk rice thrown into the water smoked and steamed making the noise cicchita citicita just like a plowshare heated during the day when thrown into water smokes and steams making the noise cicchita citicita
Then the brahman Kasibharadvaja alarmed with hair standing on end approached and fell with his head at the Blessed One's feet and said as follows
Most excellent O Gotama is thy teaching most excellent
Just as a man would set upright what is overturned reveal what is concealed point out the way to one gone astray bring an oil lamp into the darkness so that those with eyes could see objects even so the Dhamma has been declared in many a manner by the Venerable Gotama
I take refuge in the Venerable Gotama in the Dhamma and in the Sangha
I wish to receive the novice's ordination and higher ordination
Brahman Kasibharadvaja duly received both the pabbajja and upasampada from the Blessed One
Not long after his upasampada the Venrable Bharadvaja dwelling alone and aloof diligent strenuous and resolute ere long by his own insight here and now realized and attained the highest perfection the end of the Noble Life  for the sake of which men of good family go forth from home to live the homeless life
Birth is destroyed lived is the noble life done is what has to be done there is no more of this state
The Venerable Bharadvaja became one of the arahants
Thus have I heard
On one occasion the Blessed One was living near Savatthi at Jetavana at Anathapindika's monastery
Now when the night was far advanced a certain deity whose surpassing radiance illuminated the whole of Jetavana came to the presence of the Blessed One respectfully saluted him and stood beside him
Standing thus he addressed the Blessed One in verse

Fully realizing these causes of downfall in the world the sage endowed with ariyan insight shares a realm of security
The occasion for this discourse in brief according to the commentary is as follows The city of Vesali was afflicted by a famine causing death especially to the poor folk
Due to the presence of decaying corpses the evil spirits began to haunt the city this was followed by a pestilence
Plagued by these three fears of famine nonhuman beings and pestilence the citizens sought the help of the Buddha who was then living at Rajagaha
Followed by a large number of monks including the Venerable Ananda his attendant disciple the Buddha came to the city of Vesali
With the arrival of the Master there were torrential rains which swept away the putrefying corpses
The atmosphere became purified the city was clean
Thereupon the Buddha delivered this Jewel Discourse to the Venerable Ananda and gave him instructions as to how he should tour the city with the Licchavi citizens reciting the discourse as a mark of protection to the people of Vesali
The Venerable Ananda followed the instructions and sprinkled the sanctified water from the Buddha's own alms bowl
As a consequence the evil spirits were exorcised the pestilence subsided
Thereafter the Venerable Ananda returned with the citizens of Vesali to the Public hall where the Buddha and his disciples had assembled awaiting his arrival
There the Buddha recited the same Jewel Discourse to the gathering
Whatever beings are assembled here terrestrial or celestial may they all have peace of mind and may they listen attentively to these words
O beings listen closely
May you all radiate lovingkindness to those human beings who by day and night bring offerings to you
Wherefore protect them with diligence
Whatever treasure there be either here or in the world beyond whatever precious jewel there be in the heavenly worlds there is nought comparable to the Tathagata
This precious jewel is the Buddha
By this truth may there be happiness
That Cessation that Detachment that Deathlessness supreme the calm and collected Sakyan Sage had realized
There is nought comparable to this Dhamma

The Supreme Buddha extolled a path of purity calling it the path which unfailingly brings concentration
There is nought comparable to this concentration
This precious jewel is the Dhamma

The eight persons extolled by virtuous men constitute four pairs
They are the disciples of the Buddha and are worthy of offerings
Gifts given to them yield rich results
This precious jewel is the Sangha

With a steadfast mind and applying themselves well in the dispensation of the Buddha Gotama free from they have attained to that which should be attained encountering the Deathless

Thus have I heard
On one occasion the Blessed One was living near Rajagaha in the bamboo grove in the Squirrels' feeding ground
At that time the Venerable Maha Kassapa who was living in the Pipphali Cave was afflicted with a disease was suffering therefrom and was gravely ill
Then the Blessed One arising from his solitude at eventide visited the Venerable Maha Kassapa and sat down on a seat made ready
Thus seated the Blessed One spoke to the Venerable Maha Kassapa
Well Kassapa how is it with you
Are you bearing up are you enduring
Do your pains decrease or increase
Are there signs of your pains decreasing and not of increasing
No Ven
Sir I am not bearing up I am not enduring the pain is very great
There is a sign not of pains decreasing but of their increasing
Kassapa these seven factors of enlightenment are well expounded by me and are cultivated and fully developed by me
They conduce to perfect understanding to full realization and to Nibbana
What are the seven

These seven factors of enlightenment Kassapa are well expounded by me and are cultivated and fully developed by me
They conduce to perfect understanding to full realization and to Nibbana
Most assuredly O Blessed One they are factor of enlightenment
Most assuredly O Welcome Being they are factors of enlightenment
Thus said the Buddha and the Venerable Maha Kassapa glad at heart approved the utterances of the Buddha
Thereupon the Venerable Kassapa recovered from that affliction and that affliction of the Venerable Kassapa disappeared
One time the Buddha was staying near Savatthi in Jeta's grove at the garden of Anathapindika
At that time he was seated under the open sky on a night of blinding darkness while oil lamps were burning
And also at that time a great number of winged insects were flying around and falling into those oil lamps thus meeting with misfortune meeting with ruin meeting with both misfortune and ruin
The Buddha saw those great number of winged insects flying around and falling into those oil lamps And then the Buddha understanding the meaning of this gave utterance  at that moment  to this profound utterance
This is a wonderful example of the Buddha using whatever situation presents itself as an opportunity for teaching and his remarks as usual can be taken on many different levels
The insects are drawn irresistibly in the dark night to the shining lamps but in their zeal to approach the light they go too far and only meet their doom
Humans likewise are drawn to the pleasures of the senses to what is seen and heard not realizing the dangers involved
When we get too close  when we hold on with too much attachment  we get burned by suffering
The senses can still be enjoyed as the moth can stay circling the flame but only when one holds the proper distance
This quality of stepping back or standing off from obsession with the senses is something that is cultivated with the practice of mindfulness meditation
But the fire can also be taken as a symbol of wisdom
We are naturally drawn to the light of truth to the teachings of the Buddha for example but must take care not to overshoot the mark
Getting too attached to views even if these views are correct can also lead to harm and the strengthening of bondage
The word translated here as point is sara which can mean the heart the essence or the crux of something
The subtle idea that seems to be expressed is that rushing or running will never reveal what is essential  the pith can never be approached headlong
What is needed is the tranquility of mind that meditation brings and the ability to keep even wisdom in proper perspective
The passage is in the form of an Udana a solemn utterance and is in the tristubh meter of eleven syllables per line
The order of the last two lines has been rearranged in translation to better reflect the syntax of English
This tender poem of loss and recovery was composed by Patacara one of the leading women of the Buddha's order of nuns
Born the daughter of a wealthy banker Patacara fell in love with one of her father's servants and ran off to live happily with him in a forest hamlet
Then through a series of tragic accidents she lost first her husband then two sons and finally her parents and brother
Wandering destitute naked and mad with grief she in time met the Buddha face to face who showed her kindness when others would scorn her
She heard his teaching joined the order of nuns and went on to become one of the arahants or worthy ones
Patacara helped many other women who were overcome by grief regain their sanity and quench the pain of their loss
The meter of the verse is based on eight syllables per line and there is an interesting wordplay in the fourth stanza
The latter part of the phrase As he has come so has he gone corresponds to the word Tathagata  a favorite epithet of the Buddha
This is a portion of a poem attributed to Talaputa a famous performer before joining the Buddha's sangha and undertaking the training of his mind for liberation
Some people have said that the Theravada tradition shows little recognition of nature but these and many other verses in the Theragatha reveal a poignant appreciation of nature's beauty
The forests and hills were favorite resorts of the Buddha and his followers and the wilderness was considered the most suitable setting for silent meditation
As the Buddha was so fond of saying
Thus have I heard
On one occasion the Blessed One was living in the Deer Park at Isipatana near Varanasi
Then he addressed the group of five monks
Monks these two extremes ought not to be practiced by one who has gone forth from the household life
There is addiction to indulgence of sensepleasures which is low coarse the way of ordinary people unworthy and unprofitable and there is addiction to selfmortification which is painful unworthy and unprofitable
Avoiding both these extremes the Tathagata has realized the Middle Path it gives vision gives knowledge and leads to calm to insight to enlightenment and to Nibbana
And what is that Middle Path realized by the Tathagata
It is the Noble Eightfold path and nothing else namely right understanding right thought right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness and right concentration
This is the Middle Path realized by the Tathagata which gives vision which gives knowledge and leads to calm to insight to enlightenment and to Nibbana
The Noble Truth of Suffering monks is this Birth is suffering aging is suffering sickness is suffering death is suffering association with the unpleasant is suffering dissociation from the pleasant is suffering not to receive what one desires is suffering  in brief the five aggregates subject to grasping are suffering
The Noble Truth of the Origin of Suffering is this It is this craving which produces rebecoming accompanied by passionate greed and finding fresh delight now here and now there namely craving for sense pleasure craving for existence and craving for nonexistence
The Noble Truth of the Cessation of Suffering is this It is the complete cessation of that very craving giving it up relinquishing it liberating oneself from it and detaching oneself from it
The Noble Truth of the Path Leading to the Cessation of Suffering is this It is the Noble Eightfold Path and nothing else namely right understanding right thought right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness and right concentration
'This is the Noble Truth of Suffering' such was the vision the knowledge the wisdom the science the light that arose in me concerning things not heard before
'This suffering as a noble truth should be fully realized' such was the vision the knowledge the wisdom the science the light that arose in me concerning things not heard before
'This suffering as a noble truth has been fully realized' such was the vision the knowledge the wisdom the science the light that arose in me concerning things not heard before
'This is the Noble Truth of the Origin of Suffering' such was the vision the knowledge the wisdom the science the light that arose in me concerning things not heard before
'This Origin of Suffering as a noble truth should be eradicated' such was the vision the knowledge the wisdom the science the light that arose in me concerning things not heard before
'This Origin of suffering as a noble truth has been eradicated' such was the vision the knowledge the wisdom the science the light that arose in me concerning things not heard before
'This is the Noble Truth of the Cessation of Suffering' such was the vision the knowledge the wisdom the science the light that arose in me concerning things not heard before
'This Cessation of suffering as a noble truth should be realized' such was the vision the knowledge the wisdom the science the light that arose in me concerning things not heard before
'This Cessation of suffering as a noble truth has been realized' such was the vision the knowledge the wisdom the science the light that arose in me concerning things not heard before
'This is the Noble Truth of the Path leading to the cessation of suffering' such was the vision the knowledge the wisdom the science the light that arose in me concerning things not heard before
'This Path leading to the cessation of suffering as a noble truth should be developed' such was the vision the knowledge the wisdom the science the light that arose in me concerning things not heard before
'This Path leading to the cessation of suffering as a noble truth has been developed' such was the vision the knowledge the wisdom the science the light that arose in me concerning things not heard before
As long as my knowledge of seeing things as they really are was not quite clear in these three aspects in these twelve ways concerning the Four Noble Truths I did not claim to have realized the matchless supreme Enlightenment in this world with its gods with its Maras and Brahmas in this generation with its recluses and brahmanas with its Devas and humans
But when my knowledge of seeing things as they really are was quite clear in these three aspects in these twelve ways concerning the Four Noble Truths then I claimed to have realized the matchless supreme Enlightenment in this world with its gods with its Maras and Brahmas in this generation with its recluses and brahmanas with its Devas and humans
And a vision of insight arose in me thus 'Unshakable is the deliverance of my heart
This is the last birth
Now there is no more rebecoming' This the Blessed One said
The group of five monks was glad and they rejoiced at the words of the Blessed One
When this discourse was thus expounded there arose in the Venerable Kondañña the passionfree stainless vision of Truth dhammacakkhu in other words he attained sotapatti the first stage of sanctity and realized Whatever has the nature of arising has the nature of ceasing
Now when the Blessed One set in motion the Wheel of Truth the Bhummattha devas proclaimed The Matchless Wheel of Truth that cannot be set in motion by recluse brahmana deva Mara Brahma or any one in the world is set in motion by the Blessed One in the Deer Park at Isipatana near Varanasi
Hearing these words of the earth deities all the Catummaharajika devas proclaimed The Matchless Wheel of Truth that cannot be set in motion by recluse brahmana deva Mara Brahma or any one in the world is set in motion by the Blessed One in the Deer Park at Isipatana near Varanasi These words were heard in the upper deva realms and from Catummaharajika it was proclaimed in Tavatimsa Yama Tusita Nimmanarati Paranimmitavasavatti and the Brahmas of Brahma Parisajja Brahma Purohita Maha Brahma Parittabha Appamanabha Abhassara Parittasubha Appamana subha Subhakinna Vehapphala Aviha Atappa Sudassa Sudassi and in Akanittha The Matchless Wheel of Truth that cannot be set in motion by recluse brahmana deva Mara Brahma or any one in the world is set in motion by the Blessed One in the Deer Park at Isipatana near Varanasi
Thus at that very moment at that instant the cry spread as far as Brahma realm the system of ten thousand worlds trembled and quaked and shook
A boundless sublime radiance surpassing the effulgence of devas appeared in the world
Then the Blessed One uttered this paean of joy Verily Kondañña has realized verily Kondañña has realized Thus it was that the Venerable Kondañña received the name Añña Knondañña'  Kondañña who realizes
AN
reports a discussion among several elder monks as to what is meant in this poem by both sides and in between Six of the elders express the following separate opinions
The issue is then taken to the Buddha who states that all six interpretations are wellspoken but the interpretation he had in mind when speaking the poem was the first
The Buddha
On one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Rajagaha in the Bamboo Grove the Squirrel's Sanctuary
Then Talaputa the head of an acting troupe went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side
As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One Lord I have heard that it has been passed down by the ancient teaching lineage of actors that 'When an actor on the stage in the midst of a festival makes people laugh  gives them delight with his imitation of reality then with the breakup of the body after death he is reborn in the company of the laughing devas' What does the Blessed One have to say about that
Enough headman put that aside
Don't ask me that
A second time A third time Talaputa the head of an acting troupe said Lord I have heard that it has been passed down by the ancient teaching lineage of actors that 'When an actor on the stage in the midst of a festival makes people laugh  gives them delight with his imitation of reality then with the breakup of the body after death he is reborn in the company of the laughing devas' What does the Blessed One have to say about that
Apparently headman I haven't been able to get past you by saying 'Enough headman put that aside
Don't ask me that' So I will simply answer you
Any beings who are not devoid of passion to begin with who are bound by the bond of passion focus with even more passion on things inspiring passion presented by an actor on stage in the midst of a festival
Any beings who are not devoid of aversion to begin with who are bound by the bond of aversion focus with even more aversion on things inspiring aversion presented by an actor on stage in the midst of a festival
Any beings who are not devoid of delusion to begin with who are bound by the bond of delusion focus with even more delusion on things inspiring delusion presented by an actor on stage in the midst of a festival
Thus the actor  himself intoxicated  heedless having made others intoxicated  heedless  with the breakup of the body after death is reborn in what is called the hell of laughter
But if he holds such a view as this 'When an actor on the stage in the midst of a festival makes people laugh  gives them delight with his imitation of reality then with the breakup of the body after death he is reborn in the company of the laughing devas' that is his wrong view
Now there are two destinations for a person with wrong view I tell you either hell or the animal womb
When this was said Talaputa the head of an acting troupe sobbed  burst into tears
That is what I couldn't get past you by saying 'Enough headman put that aside
Don't ask me that' I'm not crying lord because of what the Blessed One said to me but simply because I have been deceived cheated  fooled for a long time by that ancient teaching lineage of actors who said 'When an actor on the stage in the midst of a festival makes people laugh  gives them delight with his imitation of reality then with the breakup of the body after death he is reborn in the company of the laughing devas'
Magnificent lord

Just as if he were to place upright what was overturned to reveal what was hidden to show the way to one who was lost or to carry a lamp into the dark so that those with eyes could see forms in the same way has the Blessed One  through many lines of reasoning  made the Dhamma clear
I go to the Blessed One for refuge to the Dhamma and to the Community of monks
May the Blessed One remember me as a lay follower who has gone to him for refuge from this day forward for life

As Subha the nun was going through Jivaka's delightful mango grove a libertine blocked her path so she said to him
Whatever recluses and Brahmans Sona hold views about the body which is impermanent unsatisfactory and subject to change such as 'I am better' 'I am equal' or 'I am worse ' what else are they but folk who do not see things as they really are
But Sona whatever recluses and Brahmans do not hold such views What else are they but those who see things as they really are
Now the Venerable Nanda the Blessed One's first cousin put on wellpressed robes painted his eyes took a bright shiny bowl and went before the Blessed One
Having saluted the Blessed One he sat down to one side
As he sat there the Blessed One said It is not suitable for you Nanda who as a young man of good family have left the household life in faith for homelessness to appear in wellpressed robes with painted eyes and a bright shiny bowl
The proper thing for you Nanda is to be a forestdweller to go for alms in ragged robes dwelling aloof from sensedesires 
After that the Venerable Nanda became a forestdweller going for alms in ragged robes dwelling aloof from sensedesires
Dwelling at Savatthi
Monks gains offerings  fame are a cruel thing a harsh bitter obstacle to the attainment of the unexcelled rest from bondage
Suppose there were a beetle a dungeater full of dung gorged with dung with a huge pile of dung in front of him
He because of that would look down on other beetles 'Yes sirree
I am a dungeater full of dung gorged with dung with a huge pile of dung in front of me' In the same way there is the case where a certain monk  conquered by gains offerings  fame his mind consumed  puts on his robes and carrying his bowl  outer robe goes into a village or town for alms
Having eaten there as much as he likes  full of almsfood  invited again for the next day  he goes to the monastery and in the midst of a group of monks boasts 'I have eaten as much as I like I am full of almsfood  have been invited again for tomorrow
I am a recipient of robes almsfood lodgings  medicinal requisites for curing illness
These other monks though have next to no merit next to no influence
They aren't recipients of robes almsfood lodgings  medicinal requisites for curing illness' Conquered by gains offerings  fame his mind consumed he looks down on other wellbehaved monks
That will be for this worthless man's longterm suffering  harm
That's how cruel gains offerings  fame are a harsh bitter obstacle to the attainment of the unexcelled rest from bondage
Thus you should train yourselves 'We will put aside any gains offerings  fame that have arisen and we will not let any gains offerings  fame that have arisen keep our minds consumed' That's how you should train yourselves

A fatal thing monks are gains favors and fame a bitter harsh impediment to the attainment of the unsurpassed freedom from bondage
It is just like a beetle feeding on dung full of dung gorged with dung standing before a great dunghill who might despise other beetles saying 'I am a dungeater full of dung gorged with dung and before me is this great dunghill'
In the same way monks if some monk is overwhelmed with gains favors and fame so that his head is turned so having risen early and taken his robe and bowl and gone for alms to the village or market town he eats his fill gets invited again for next day and has a full bowl
Then he goes to the monks' park and boasts in the midst of the assembled monks 'I have had a good meal and I am invited again for tomorrow
My bowl is full
I have got a robe alms lodgings and medical requisites
But these other monks have little merit and little influence they do not get requisites' Thus this bhikkhu who is so overwhelmed with gains favors and fame that his head is turned despises other wellbehaved bhikkhus
But this will bring harm and sorrow to that wretched man for many a long day
That shows you monks how disastrous gains favors and fame are what a bitter harsh impediment to the attainment of the unsurpassed freedom from bondage
Therefore monks you should train yourselves thus 'Whatever gains favors and fame may come our way we will reject lest it turn our heads' So monks you should train yourselves
What is the reason Lord and depending on what conditions is it that formerly there were fewer precepts yet more monks attained enlightenment
What is the reason Lord and depending on what conditions is it that nowadays there are more precepts and fewer monks attain enlightenment
It is like this Kassapa
When beings are in decline and the true Dhamma is waning then there are more precepts and fewer monks attain enlightenment
But there is no disappearance of the true Dhamma Kassapa till a counterfeit Dhamma arises in the world but when a counterfeit Dhamma arises then there is a disappearance of the true Dhamma just as there is no disappearing of gold so long as no counterfeit gold has arisen in the world The earthelement does not make the true Dhamma disappear the waterelement the fireelement the airelement But right here men of straw appear and it is they who bring about the disappearance of the true Dhamma
A ship Kassapa may sink all at once but it is not thus that the true Dhamma disappears
There are five contributory factors Kassapa which lead to the adulteration and disappearance of the true Dhamma
Which five
It is when monks and nuns male and female layfollowers behave disrespectfully and rebelliously towards the Teacher towards the Dhamma towards the Sangha towards the training towards meditation
But when monks and nuns male and female lay followers behave respectfully and deferentially towards the Dhamma towards the Sangha towards the training towards meditation then these five things conduce to the maintenance the purity and the preservation of the true Dhamma
On one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Savatthi in Jeta's Grove Anathapindika's monastery

Maha Kassapa went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side
As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One What is the cause lord what is the reason why before there were fewer training rules and yet more monks established in final gnosis whereas now there are more training rules and yet fewer monks established in final gnosis
That's the way it is Kassapa
When beings are degenerating and the true Dhamma is disappearing there are more training rules and yet fewer monks established in final gnosis
There is no disappearance of the true Dhamma as long as a counterfeit of the true Dhamma has not arisen in the world but there is the disappearance of the true Dhamma when a counterfeit of the true Dhamma has arisen in the world
Just as there is no disappearance of gold as long as a counterfeit of gold has not arisen in the world but there is the disappearance of gold when a counterfeit of gold has arisen in the world in the same way there is no disappearance of the true Dhamma as long as a counterfeit of the true Dhamma has not arisen in the world but there is the disappearance of the true Dhamma when a counterfeit of the true Dhamma has arisen in the world
It's not the earth property that makes the true Dhamma disappear
It's not the water property the fire property the wind property that makes the true Dhamma disappear
It's worthless people who arise right here who make the true Dhamma disappear
The true Dhamma doesn't disappear the way a boat sinks all at once
These five downwardleading qualities tend to the confusion and disappearance of the true Dhamma
Which five
There is the case where the monks nuns male lay followers  female lay followers live without respect without deference for the Teacher
They live without respect without deference for the Dhamma for the Sangha for the Training for concentration
These are the five downwardleading qualities that tend to the confusion and disappearance of the true Dhamma
But these five qualities tend to the stability the nonconfusion the nondisappearance of the true Dhamma
Which five
There is the case where the monks nuns male lay followers  female lay followers live with respect with deference for the Teacher

I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Rajagaha in the Bamboo Grove the Squirrels' Sanctuary
Then Ven
Maha Kassapa went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side
As he was sitting there the Blessed One said to him You are now old Kassapa
Your robes made of castoff hemp rags are heavy for you
So wear robes donated by householders eat invitational meals and live close by me
Lord for a long time I have lived in the wilderness and have extolled living in the wilderness
I have been an almsgoer and have extolled being an almsgoer
I have worn cast off rags and have extolled wearing cast off rags
I have worn only one set of the triple robe and have extolled wearing only one set of the triple robe
I have been modest and have extolled being modest
I have been content and have extolled being content
I have been reclusive and have extolled being reclusive
I have been unentangled and have extolled being unentangled
I have kept my persistence aroused and have extolled having persistence aroused
But Kassapa what compelling reason do you see that you for a long time have lived in the wilderness and have extolled living in the wilderness that you have kept your persistence aroused and have extolled having persistence aroused
Lord I see two compelling reasons that for a long time I have lived in the wilderness and have extolled living in the wilderness that I have kept my persistence aroused and have extolled having persistence aroused seeing a pleasant abiding for myself in the here  now and feeling sympathy for later generations 'Perhaps later generations will take it as an example It seems that the disciples of the Awakened One and those who awakened after him lived for a long time in the wilderness and extolled living in the wilderness were almsgoers and extolled being almsgoers wore cast off rags and extolled wearing cast off rags wore only one set of the triple robe and extolled wearing only one set of the triple robe were modest and extolled being modest were content and extolled being content were reclusive and extolled being reclusive were unentangled and extolled being unentangled kept their persistence aroused and extolled having persistence aroused' Good Kassapa
Very good
It seems that you are one who practices for the happiness of many out of compassion for the world for the welfare benefit  happiness of beings human  divine
So continue wearing your robes of cast off hemp cloth go for alms and live in the wilderness
At Savatthi
There the Blessed One said From an inconstruable beginning comes transmigration
A beginning point is not evident though beings hindered by ignorance and fettered by craving are transmigrating  wandering on
A being who has not been your mother at one time in the past is not easy to find A being who has not been your father your brother your sister your son your daughter at one time in the past is not easy to find
Why is that
From an inconstruable beginning comes transmigration
A beginning point is not evident though beings hindered by ignorance and fettered by craving are transmigrating  wandering on
Long have you thus experienced stress experienced pain experienced loss swelling the cemeteries  enough to become disenchanted with all fabricated things enough to become dispassionate enough to be released
Thus have I heard
Once the Venerable MahaaKassapa and the Venerable Saariputta were staying near Benares at Isipatana in the Deer Park
It is said friend Kassapa that without ardor and without taking care one is unable to gain enlightenment unable to gain Nibbaana unable to gain relief from bondage but that with ardor with taking care enlightenment can be gained

When friend a monk thinks 'Evil and unskilled states that have not arisen would if they were to arise be to my detriment' and he does not arouse ardor when he thinks 'Evil and unskilled states that have arisen will if they are not abandoned be to my detriment' and he does not arouse ardor when he thinks 'Skilled states that have not arisen if they do not arise this will be to my detriment' and he does not arouse ardor when he thinks 'Skilled states that have arisen if they should cease this will be to my detriment' and he does not arouse ardor  this friend is being without ardor
Thus it is friend that without ardor without taking care one is unable to gain enlightenment unable to gain Nibbaana unable to gain relief from bondage
And how friend is one ardent
When a monk thinks 'Evil and unskilled states' 'Skilled states'  this friend is arousing ardor
Thus it is friend that by arousing ardor and taking care one is able to gain enlightenment to gain Nibbaana to gain relief from bondage
Monks Kassapa here is content with any old robe
He praises contentment with any robe nor does he commit any offense of unseemliness or impropriety on account of a robe
If he has not got a robe he does not worry if he has got a robe he enjoys the use of it without clinging or foolish attachment not committing any offense aware of the danger and wisely avoiding it
Kassapa is content with whatever alms he gets whatever lodging whatever requisites in the way of medicines for sickness he enjoys the use of these things without clinging or foolish attachment not committing any offense aware of the danger and wisely avoiding it
Therefore monks you should train yourselves thus We will be content with whatever robe alms lodging medicines we may get We will enjoy the use of these things without clinging or foolish attachment not committing any offense aware of the danger and wisely avoiding it
Monks I will exhort you by the example of Kassapa or one like Kassapa
So exhorted you should practice to gain the goal
Now on that occasion the Blessed One was dwelling in Rajagaha in the Bamboo Grove
Then thirty monks from Pava  all wilderness dwellers all almsgoers all triplerobe wearers all still with fetters  went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side
Then the thought occurred to the Blessed One These thirty monks from Pava are all still with fetters
What if I were to teach them the Dhamma in such a way that in this very sitting their minds through lack of clinging would be released from fermentations
So he addressed the monks Monks
Yes lord the monks responded
The Blessed One said From an inconceivable beginning comes transmigration
A beginning point is not evident though beings hindered by ignorance and fettered by craving are transmigrating  wandering on
What do you think monks
Which is greater the blood you have shed from having your heads cut off while transmigrating  wandering this long long time or the water in the four great oceans
As we understand the Dhamma taught to us by the Blessed One this is the greater the blood we have shed from having our heads cut off while transmigrating  wandering this long long time not the water in the four great oceans
Excellent monks
Excellent
It is excellent that you thus understand the Dhamma taught by me

This is the greater the blood you have shed from having your heads cut off while transmigrating  wandering this long long time not the water in the four great oceans
The blood you have shed when being cows you had your cowheads cut off Long has this been greater than the water in the four great oceans
The blood you have shed when being water buffaloes you had your water buffaloheads cut off when being rams you had your ramheads cut off when being goats you had your goatheads cut off when being deer you had your deerheads cut off when being chickens you had your chickenheads cut off when being pigs you had your pigheads cut off Long has this been greater than the water in the four great oceans

The blood you have shed when arrested as thieves plundering villages you had your heads cut off when arrested as highway thieves you had your heads cut off when arrested as adulterers you had your heads cut off Long has this been greater than the water in the four great oceans
Why is that
From an inconceivable beginning comes transmigration
A beginning point is not evident though beings hindered by ignorance and fettered by craving are transmigrating  wandering on
Long have you thus experienced stress experienced pain experienced loss swelling the cemeteries  enough to become disenchanted with all fabrications enough to become dispassionate enough to be released
That is what the Blessed One said
Gratified the monks delighted in the Blessed One's words
And while this explanation was being given the minds of the thirty monks from Pava  through lack of clinging  were released from fermentations
At Savatthi
There the Blessed One said From an inconstruable beginning comes transmigration
A beginning point is not evident though beings hindered by ignorance and fettered by craving are transmigrating  wandering on
When you see someone who is happy  wellprovided in life you should conclude 'We too have experienced just this sort of thing in the course of that long long time'
Why is that
From an inconstruable beginning comes transmigration
A beginning point is not evident though beings hindered by ignorance and fettered by craving are transmigrating  wandering on
Long have you thus experienced stress experienced pain experienced loss swelling the cemeteries  enough to become disenchanted with all fabricated things enough to become dispassionate enough to be released
At Savatthi
There the Blessed One said From an inconstruable beginning comes transmigration
A beginning point is not evident though beings hindered by ignorance and fettered by craving are transmigrating  wandering on
When you see someone who has fallen on hard times overwhelmed with hard times you should conclude 'We too have experienced just this sort of thing in the course of that long long time'
Why is that
From an inconstruable beginning comes transmigration
A beginning point is not evident though beings hindered by ignorance and fettered by craving are transmigrating  wandering on
Long have you thus experienced stress experienced pain experienced loss swelling the cemeteries  enough to become disenchanted with all fabricated things enough to become dispassionate enough to be released
The discourses report two instances where brāhmans asked the Buddha about the nature of the goal he taught and he responded with the analogy of the extinguished fire
There is every reason to believe that in choosing this analogy he was referring to a concept of fire familiar to his listeners and as they had been educated in the Vedic tradition that he probably had the Vedic concept of fire in mind
This of course is not to say that he himself adhered to the Vedic concept or that he was referring to it in all its details
He was simply drawing on a particular aspect of fire as seen in the Vedas so that his listeners could have a familiar reference point for making sense of what he was saying
Now although the Vedic texts contain several different theories concerning the physics of fire there is at least one basic point on which they agree Fire even when not manifest continues to exist in a latent form
The Vedic view of all physical phenomena is that they are the manifestation of preexistent potencies inherent in nature
Each type of phenomenon has its corresponding potency which has both personal  impersonal characteristics as a god and as the powers he wields
In the case of fire both the god  the phenomenon are called Agni
Agni who is generated being produced by men through the agency of sahas
'Sahas' here is the potency the power of subjugation wielded by Agni himself
Jan Gonda in discussing this passage comments 'The underlying theory must have been that a man and his physical strength are by no means able to produce a god or potency of Agni's rank
Only the cooperation or conjunction of that special principle which seems to have been central in the descriptions of Agni's character his power of subjugation his overwhelming power can lead to the result desired the appearance of sparks and the generation of fire' Further 'a divine being like Agni was in a way already preexistent when being generated by a pair of kindling sticks'
As fire burns Agni 'continues entering' into the fire
Scattered in many places  as many separate fires  he is nevertheless one  the same thing
Other fires are attached to him as branches to a tree
When fire is extinguished Agni and his powers do not pass out of existence
Instead they go into hiding
This point is expressed in a myth mentioned frequently in the Vedic texts of Agni's trying to hide himself from the other gods in places where he thought they would never perceive him
In the version told in RV the gods finally find the hidden Agni as an embryo in the water
 Great was the membrane  firm that enveloped you when you entered the waters We searched for you in various places O Agni knower of creatures when you had entered into the waters  plants
As Chauncey Blair notes 'The concept of Agni in the waters does not imply destruction of Agni
He is merely a hidden a potential Agni and no less capable of powerful action'
The implications of Agni's being an embryo are best understood in light of the theories of biological generation held in ancient India
The husband after having entered his wife becomes an embryo and is born again of her
 Laws of Manu
Just as ancient Indians saw an underlying identity connecting a father  his offspring so too did they perceive a single identity underlying the manifest  embryonic forms of fire
In this way Agni repeatedly reborn was seen as immortal and in fact the Vedas attribute immortality to him more frequently than to any other of the gods
To you immortal
When you spring to life all the gods sing for joy By your powers they were made immortal who extended himself over all the worlds is the protector of immortality
Not only immortal but also omnipresent Agni in his manifest form is present in all three levels of the cosmos  heaven air  earth  as sun lightning  flamefire
As for his latent presence he states in the myth of his hiding 'my bodies entered various places' a survey of the Vedas reveals a wide variety of places where his embryos may be found
Some of them  such as stone wood plants  kindling sticks  relate directly to the means by which fire is kindled  fueled
Others relate more to firelike qualities  powers such as brilliance  vitality present in water plants animals  all beings
In the final analysis Agni fills the entire universe as the latent embryo of growth  vitality
As Raimundo Panikkar writes 'Agni is one of the most comprehensive symbols of the reality that is allencompassing'
Agni pervades  decks the heaven  earth his forms are scattered everywhere
He who is the embryo of waters embryo of woods embryo of all things that move  do not move
In plants  herbs in all existent beings I have deposited the embryo of increase
I have engendered all progeny on earth and sons in women hereafter
You have filled earth heaven  the air between and follow the whole cosmos like a shadow
We call upon the sage with holy verses Agni Vaiśvānara the everbeaming who has surpassed both heaven  earth in greatness
He is a god below a god above us
This view that Agnifire in a latent state is immortal  omnipresent occurs also in the Upaniṣads that were composed circa  Band later accepted into the Vedic Canon
The authors of these texts use this view to illustrate by way of analogy the doctrines of a unitary identity immanent in all things and of the immortality of the soul in spite of apparent death
Now the light that shines higher than this heaven on the backs of all on the backs of everything in the highest worlds than which there are no higher  truly that is the same as the light here within a person
There is this hearing of it  when one closes one's ears and hears a sound a roar as of a fire blazing
Truly this Brahma shines when fire blazes and disappears when it does not blaze
Its brilliance goes to the sun its vital breath to the wind
This Brahma shines when the sun is seen and disappears when it is not seen
Its brilliance goes to the moon its vital breath to the wind

Truly all these divinities having entered into wind do not perish when they die in the wind indeed from there they come forth again
In the major noncanonical Upaniṣads  whose period of composition is believed to overlap with the time of the Buddha  the analogy is even more explicit
One interesting development in this stratum of the Vedic literature is the positive sense in which it comes to regard extinguished fire
The Vedic hymns  earlier Upaniṣads saw burning fire as a positive force the essence of life  vitality
These texts though see the tranquility  inactivity of the extinguished fire as an ideal image for the soul's desired destination
Whether this reevaluation of the image of fire  seeing its extinguishing as preferable to its burning  predated the founding of Buddhism was influenced by it or simply paralleled it no one can say for sure as there are no firm dates for any of the Upaniṣads
At any rate in both stages of the Vedic attitude toward fire the thought of a fire going out carried no connotations of going out of existence at all
Instead it implied a return to an omnipresent immortal state
This has led some scholars to assume that in using the image of an extinguished fire to illustrate the goal he taught the Buddha was simply adopting the Vedic position wholesale and meant it to carry the same implications as the last quotation above a pleasant eternal existence for a tranquil soul
But when we look at how the Buddha actually used the image of extinguished fire in his teachings we find that he approached the Vedic idea of latent fire from another angle entirely If latent fire is everywhere all at once it is nowhere in particular
If it is conceived as always present in everything it has to be so loosely defined that it has no defining characteristics nothing by which it might be known at all
Thus instead of using the subsistence of latent fire as an image for immortality he uses the diffuse indeterminate nature of extinguished fire as understood by the Vedists to illustrate the absolute indescribability of the person who has reached the Buddhist goal
'But Venerable Gotama the monk whose mind is thus released Where does he reappear'
' Reappear Vaccha doesn't apply'
'In that case Venerable Gotama he does not reappear'
' Does not reappear Vaccha doesn't apply'
'both does  does not reappear'
'doesn't apply'
'neither does nor does not reappear'
'doesn't apply'
'At this point Venerable Gotama I am befuddled at this point confused
The modicum of clarity coming to me from your earlier conversation is now obscured'
'Of course you're befuddled Vaccha
Of course you're confused
Deep Vaccha is this phenomenon hard to see hard to realize tranquil refined beyond the scope of conjecture subtle tobeexperienced by the wise
For those with other views other practices other satisfactions other aims other teachers it is difficult to know
That being the case I will now put some questions to you
Answer as you see fit
How do you construe this Vaccha If a fire were burning in front of you would you know that This fire is burning in front of me'
'yes'
'And suppose someone were to ask you Vaccha This fire burning in front of you dependent on what is it burning Thus asked how would you reply'
'I would reply This fire burning in front of me is burning dependent on grass  timber as its sustenance'
'If the fire burning in front of you were to go out would you know that This fire burning in front of me has gone out'
'yes'
'And suppose someone were to ask you This fire that has gone out in front of you in which direction from here has it gone
East
West
North
Or south Thus asked how would you reply'
'That doesn't apply Venerable Gotama
Any fire burning dependent on a sustenance of grass  timber being unnourished  from having consumed that sustenance and not being offered any other  is classified simply as out'
'Even so Vaccha any form by which one describing the Tathāgata would describe him That the Tathāgata has abandoned its root destroyed made like a palmyra stump deprived of the conditions of existence not destined for future arising
Freed from the classification of form Vaccha the Tathāgata is deep boundless hardtofathom like the sea
Reappears doesn't apply
Does not reappear doesn't apply
Both does  does not reappear doesn't apply
Neither reappears nor does not reappear doesn't apply
'Any feeling Any perception Any fabrication
'Any consciousness by which one describing the Tathāgata would describe him That the Tathāgata has abandoned Freed from the classification of consciousness Vaccha the Tathāgata is deep boundless hardtofathom like the sea'
The person who has attained the goal is thus indescribable because heshe has abandoned all things by which heshe could be described
This point is asserted in even more thoroughgoing fashion in a pair of dialogues where two inexperienced monks who have attempted to describe the state of the Tathāgata after death are crossexamined on the matter by Sāriputta  the Buddha himself
Sāriputta 'How do you construe this my friend Yamaka Do you regard form as the Tathāgata'
Yamaka 'No friend'
Sāriputta 'Do you regard feeling as the Tathāgata'
Yamaka 'No friend'
Sāriputta 'perception'
Yamaka 'No friend'
Sāriputta 'fabrications'
Yamaka 'No friend'
Sāriputta 'consciousness'
Yamaka 'No friend'
Sāriputta 'Do you regard the Tathāgata as being in form
Elsewhere than form
In feeling
Elsewhere than feeling
In perception
Elsewhere than perception
In fabrications
Elsewhere than fabrications
In consciousness
Elsewhere than consciousness'
Yamaka 'No friend'
Sāriputta 'Do you regard the Tathāgata as formfeelingperceptionfabricationsconsciousness'
Yamaka 'No friend'
Sāriputta 'Do you regard the Tathāgata as that which is without form without feeling without perception without fabrications without consciousness'
Yamaka 'No friend'
Sāriputta 'And so my friend Yamaka  when you can't pin down the Tathāgata as a truth or reality even in the present life  is it proper for you to declare As I understand the Teaching explained by the Blessed One a monk with no more effluents on the breakup of the body is annihilated perishes  does not exist after death'
Yamaka 'Previously friend Sāriputta I did foolishly hold that evil supposition
But now having heard your explanation of the Teaching I have abandoned that evil supposition and the Teaching has become clear'
Sāriputta 'Then friend Yamaka how would you answer if you are thus asked A monk a worthy one with no more effluents what is he on the breakup of the body after death'
Yamaka 'Thus asked I would answer Form feeling perception fabrications consciousness are inconstant
That which is inconstant is stressful
That which is stressful has stopped and gone to its end'
The Buddha puts the same series of questions to the monk Anurādha who  knowing that the Tathāgata after death could not be described in terms of existence nonexistence both or neither  had attempted to describe the Tathāgata in other terms
After receiving the same answers as Yamaka had given Sāriputta the Buddha concludes
'And so Anurādha  when you can't pin down the Tathāgata as a truth or reality even in the present life  is it proper for you to declare Friend the Tathāgata  the supreme man the superlative man attainer of the superlative attainment  being described is described otherwise than with these four positions The Tathāgata exists after death does not exist after death both does  does not exist after death neither exists nor does not exist after death'
'No lord'
'Very good Anurādha
Both formerly  now Anurādha it is only stress that I describe and the stopping of stress'
Thus none of the four alternatives  reappearingexisting not reappearingexisting both  neither  can apply to the Tathāgata after death because even in this lifetime there is no way of defining or identifying what the Tathāgata is
To identify a person by the contents of his or her mind  such things as feelings perceptions or fabrications  there would have to be a way of knowing what those contents are
In ordinary cases the texts say this is possible through either of two cognitive skills that a meditator can develop through the practice of meditation and that beings on higher planes of existence can also share the ability to know where a living being is reborn after death and the ability to know another being's thoughts
In both skills the knowledge is made possible by the fact that the ordinary mind exists in a state of dependency on its objects
When a being is reborn its consciousness has to become established at a certain point This point is what a master of the first skill perceives
When the ordinary mind thinks it needs a mental object to act as a prop or support for its thoughts This support is what a master of the second skill perceives
The mind of a person who has attained the goal though is free from all dependencies and so offers no means by which a master of either skill can perceive it
Then the Blessed One went with a large number of monks to the Black Rock on the slope of Isigili
From afar he saw Ven
Vakkali lying dead on a couch
Now at that time a smokiness a darkness was moving to the east moving to the west moving to the north the south above below moving to the intermediate directions
The Blessed One said 'Monks do you see that smokiness that darkness'
'Yes lord'
'That is Māra the Evil One
He is searching for the consciousness of Vakkali the clansman Where is the consciousness of Vakkali the clansman established But monks through unestablished consciousness Vakkali the clansman has attained total nibbāna'
'There is the case Sandha where for an excellent thoroughbred of a man the perception of earth with regard to earth has ceased to exist the perception of liquid with regard to liquid the perception of heat with regard to heat the perception of wind with regard to wind the perception of the dimension of the infinitude of space with regard to the dimension of the infinitude of space the perception of the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness with regard to the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness the perception of the dimension of nothingness with regard to the dimension of nothingness the perception of the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception with regard to the sphere of neither perception nor nonperception the perception of this world with regard to this world the next world with regard to the next world and whatever is seen heard sensed cognized attained sought after pondered by the intellect the perception with regard even to that has ceased to exist
'Absorbed in this way the excellent thoroughbred of a man is absorbed dependent neither on earth liquid heat wind the dimension of the infinitude of space the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness the dimension of nothingness the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception this world the next world nor on whatever is seen heard sensed cognized attained sought after or pondered by the intellect  and yet he is absorbed
And to this excellent thoroughbred of a man absorbed in this way the gods together with Indra the Brahmās  their viceroys pay homage even from afar
Thus the mind that has attained the goal cannot be known or described from the outside because it is completely free of any dependency  any support or object inside it  by which it might be known
This point forms the context for the dialogue in which the brāhman Upasīva asks the Buddha about the person who attains the goal
The important term in the last verse is pamāṇa 'criterion'
It is a pregnant term with meanings both in philosophical and in ordinary usage
In philosophical discourse it refers to a means of knowledge or a standard used to assess the validity of an assertion or object
In the Buddha's time and later various schools of thought specialized in discussing the nature and role of such criteria
The Maitri Upaniṣad contains one of their basic tenets
Because of its precision this is the criterion for time
For without a criterion there is no ascertaining the things to be assessed
Thus when a mind has abandoned all phenomena there is no means or criterion by which anyone else could know or say anything about it
This much is obvious
But the verse also seems to be saying that the goal is indescribable from the inside  for the person experiencing it  as well
First the verse is in response to Upasīva's inquiry into the goal as the Buddha has known it
Secondly the line 'for him it doesn't exist' can mean not only that the person experiencing the goal offers no criteria to the outside by which anyone else might describe himher but also that the experience offers no criteria from the inside for describing it either
And as we have already noted the outside criteria by which a person might be described are determined precisely by what is there inside the person's mind
Thus for the person experiencing the goal there would not even be any means of knowing whether or not there was a person having the experience
There would simply be the experience in  of itself
This is where the ordinary meaning of pamāṇa  as limit or measurement  comes in
This meaning goes back to the Vedic hymns
There the act of measuring is seen as an essential part of the process of the creation of the cosmos
In one g Vedic hymn for example the creation of mind is followed by the appearance of a horizontal limit or measuring line separating male from female
From this line the rest of the cosmos is laid out
So to say that no criterionmeasurementlimit exists for the person experiencing the goal means that the person's experience is totally free of all the most elementary perceptions  distinctions that underlie our knowledge of the cosmos
And the word 'free'  one of the few the Buddha uses in a straightforward way to describe the mind that has attained the goal  thus carries two meanings free from dependency as we have already seen and free from limitations even of the most abstruse  subtlest sort
This second reading of the verse  dealing with the limitlessness  indescribability of the goal for the person experiencing it  is supported by a number of other passages in the Pali Canon referring explicitly to the inner experience of the goal
There is monks that dimension where there is neither earth nor water nor fire nor wind nor dimension of the infinitude of space nor dimension of the infinitude of consciousness nor dimension of nothingness nor dimension of neither perception nor nonperception nor this world nor the next world nor sun nor moon
And there I say there is neither coming nor going nor stasis nor passing away nor arising without stance without foundation without support
This just this is the end of stress
Consciousness without surface without end radiant all around is not experienced through the solidity of earth the liquidity of water the radiance of fire the windiness of wind the divinity of devas the allness of the All
The phrase 'the allness of the All' can best be understood with reference to the following three passages
What is the All
Simply the eye  forms ear  sounds nose  aromas tongue  flavors body  tactile sensations intellect  ideas
This monks is termed the All
Anyone who would say Repudiating this All I will describe another if questioned on what exactly might be the grounds for his statement would be unable to explain and furthermore would be put to grief
Why
Because it lies beyond range
If the six senses  their objects  sometimes called the six spheres of contact  constitute the All is there anything beyond the All
MahāKoṭṭhita 'With the remainderless stopping  fading of the six spheres of contact is it the case that there is anything else'
Sāriputta 'Don't say that my friend'
MahāKoṭṭhita 'With the remainderless stopping  fading of the six spheres of contact is it the case that there is not anything else'
Sāriputta 'Don't say that my friend'
MahāKoṭṭhita 'is it the case that there both is  is not anything else'
Sāriputta 'Don't say that my friend'
MahāKoṭṭhita 'is it the case that there neither is nor is not anything else'
Sāriputta 'Don't say that my friend'
MahāKoṭṭhita 'Being asked if there is anything else you say Don't say that my friend Being asked if there is not anything else if there both is  is not anything else if there neither is nor is not anything else you say Don't say that my friend Now how is the meaning of this statement to be understood'
Sāriputta 'Saying is it the case that there is anything else is it the case that there is not anything else is it the case that there both is  is not anything else is it the case the there neither is nor is not anything else one is objectifying the nonobjectified
However far the six spheres of contact go that is how far objectification goes
However far objectification goes that is how far the six spheres of contact go
With the remainderless fading  stopping of the six spheres of contact there comes to be the stopping the allaying of objectification'
The dimension of nonobjectification although it may not be described may be realized through direct experience
Monks that dimension should be experienced where the eye stops and the perception of form fades
That dimension should be experienced where the ear stops and the perception of sound fades where the nose stops and the perception of aroma fades where the tongue stops and the perception of flavor fades where the body stops and the perception of tactile sensation fades where the intellect stops and the perception of ideaphenomenon fades That dimension should be experienced
This experience of the goal  absolutely unlimited freedom beyond classification and exclusive of all else  is termed the elemental nibbāna property with no 'fuel' remaining
It is one of two ways in which nibbāna is experienced the distinction between the two being expressed as follows
'Monks there are these two forms of the nibbāna property
Which two
The nibbāna property with fuel remaining and the nibbāna property with no fuel remaining
'And what is the nibbāna property with fuel remaining
There is the case where a monk is an arahant whose effluents have ended who has attained completion finished the task laid down the burden attained the true goal destroyed the fetter of becoming and is released through right gnosis
His five faculties still remain and owing to their being intact he experiences the pleasing  the displeasing and is sensitive to pleasure  pain
His ending of passion aversion  delusion is termed the nibbāna property with fuel remaining
'And what is the nibbāna property with no fuel remaining
There is the case where a monk is an arahant released through right gnosis
For him all that is sensed being unrelished will grow cold right here
This is termed the nibbāna property with no fuel remaining'
The phrase referring to the range of feeling as 'growing cold right here' is a set expression describing death as experienced by one who has reached the goal
The verse following this passage states explicitly that this is what is meant here
The Verses of the Elder Udāyin suggest a simile to illustrate the distinction between these two nibbāna properties
Here Ven
Udāyin compares the nibbāna property with fuel remaining  the state of being absolutely free from passion aversion  delusion  to a fire whose flames have died out but whose embers are still glowing
Although he does not complete the analogy he seems to imply that the nibbāna property without fuel remaining  when the Worthy One discards his body at death  is like a fire so totally out that its embers have grown cold
Thus the completely free  unadulterated experience we have been discussing is that of nibbāna after death
There are though states of concentration which give a foretaste of this experience in the present life and which enabled the Buddha to say that he taught the goal on the basis of direct knowledge
nanda 'In what way venerable sir might a monk attain concentration of such a form that he would have neither the perception of earth with regard to earth nor of water with regard to water nor of fire wind the dimension of the infinitude of space the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness the dimension of nothingness the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception this world nor of the next world with regard to the next world and yet he would still be percipient'
The Buddha 'There is the case nanda where he would be percipient of this This is peace this is exquisite  the resolution of all fabrications the relinquishing of all acquisitions the ending of craving dispassion stopping nibbāna'
nanda 'But what were you percipient of at that time'
Sāriputta ' The stopping of becoming  nibbāna  the stopping of becoming  nibbāna One perception arose in me as another perception stopped
Just as in a blazing woodchip fire one flame arises as another flame stops even so The stopping of becoming  nibbāna  the stopping of becoming  nibbāna One perception arose in me as another one stopped
I was percipient at that time of the stopping of becoming  nibbāna'
nanda 'It is amazing my friend it is marvelous how the Blessed One has attained  recognized the opportunity for the purification of beings and the direct realization of nibbāna where the eye will be and forms and yet one will not be sensitive to that dimension where the ear will be and sounds where the nose will be and aromas where the tongue will be and flavors where the body will be and tactile sensations and yet one will not be sensitive to that dimension'
Udāyin 'Is one insensitive to that dimension percipient or not percipient'
nanda ' percipient'
Udāyin ' percipient of what'
nanda 'There is the case where  with the complete transcending of perceptions of form and the passing away of perceptions of resistance and not attending to perceptions of diversity  'infinite space' one remains in the dimension of the infinitude of space Percipient in this way one is not sensitive to that dimension
'Further with the complete transcending of the dimension of the infinitude of space 'infinite consciousness' one remains in the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness Percipient in this way one is not sensitive to that dimension
'Further with the complete transcending of the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness 'There is nothing' one remains in the dimension of nothingness Percipient in this way one is not sensitive to that dimension
'Once friend when I was staying in Sāketa at the Game Refuge in the Black Forest the nun Jaṭilā Bhāgikā went to me and on arrival  having bowed to me  stood to one side
As she was standing to one side she said to me Ven
nanda the concentration whereby  neither pressed down nor forced back nor with fabrications kept blocked or suppressed  still as a result of release contented as a result of stillness and as a result of contentment one is not agitated This concentration is said by the Blessed One to be the fruit of what'
'I said to her This concentration is said by the Blessed One to be the fruit of gnosis Percipient in this way friend one is not sensitive to that dimension'
In this extraordinary state of mental poise  neither pressed forced blocked or suppressed  nibbāna in the present life is experienced as freedom from all perception dealing with the six sensory spheres  the dimensions of meditative absorption
Although one is conscious and these dimensions are present one does not partake of them
On the level of ordinary sensory experience however nibbāna in the present life is experienced by the Worthy One as the passing away of passion aversion  delusion
This implies that these three states are analogous to fire and as we saw in the Introduction they are directly referred to as fires at various points in the Canon
On the surface the notion of passion  aversion as fires hardly requires explanation but in order to gain a fuller appreciation of the analogies that the Canon draws between fire on the one hand and passion aversion  delusion on the other we first need some background on the specifically Buddhist views on fire it contains
At Savatthi
There the Blessed One said From an inconstruable beginning comes transmigration
A beginning point is not evident though beings hindered by ignorance and fettered by craving are transmigrating  wandering on
Just as a stick thrown up in the air lands sometimes on its base sometimes on its side sometimes on its tip in the same way beings hindered by ignorance and fettered by craving transmigrating  wandering on sometimes go from this world to another world sometimes come from another world to this
Why is that
From an inconstruable beginning comes transmigration
A beginning point is not evident though beings hindered by ignorance and fettered by craving are transmigrating  wandering on
Long have you thus experienced stress experienced pain experienced loss swelling the cemeteries  enough to become disenchanted with all fabricated things enough to become dispassionate enough to be released
At Savatthi
There the Blessed One said From an inconstruable beginning comes transmigration
A beginning point is not evident though beings hindered by ignorance and fettered by craving are transmigrating  wandering on
What do you think monks Which is greater the tears you have shed while transmigrating  wandering this long long time  crying  weeping from being joined with what is displeasing being separated from what is pleasing  or the water in the four great oceans
As we understand the Dhamma taught to us by the Blessed One this is the greater the tears we have shed while transmigrating  wandering this long long time  crying  weeping from being joined with what is displeasing being separated from what is pleasing  not the water in the four great oceans
Excellent monks
Excellent
It is excellent that you thus understand the Dhamma taught by me
This is the greater the tears you have shed while transmigrating  wandering this long long time  crying  weeping from being joined with what is displeasing being separated from what is pleasing  not the water in the four great oceans
Long have you experienced the death of a mother
The tears you have shed over the death of a mother while transmigrating  wandering this long long time  crying  weeping from being joined with what is displeasing being separated from what is pleasing  are greater than the water in the four great oceans
Long have you experienced the death of a father the death of a brother the death of a sister the death of a son the death of a daughter loss with regard to relatives loss with regard to wealth loss with regard to disease
The tears you have shed over loss with regard to disease while transmigrating  wandering this long long time  crying  weeping from being joined with what is displeasing being separated from what is pleasing  are greater than the water in the four great oceans
Why is that
From an inconstruable beginning comes transmigration
A beginning point is not evident though beings hindered by ignorance and fettered by craving are transmigrating  wandering on
Long have you thus experienced stress experienced pain experienced loss swelling the cemeteries  enough to become disenchanted with all fabricated things enough to become dispassionate enough to be released
On one occasion Ven
Musila Ven
Pavittha Ven
Narada and Ven
Ananda were staying in Kosambi at Ghosita's monastery
Then Ven
Pavittha said to Ven
Musila Musila my friend putting aside conviction putting aside preference putting aside tradition putting aside reasoning through analogies putting aside an agreement through pondering views Do you have truly personal knowledge that 'From birth as a requisite condition come aging  death'
Yes Pavittha my friend
Putting aside conviction preference tradition reasoning through analogies an agreement through pondering views I do have truly personal knowledge that 'From birth as a requisite condition come aging  death'
Musila my friend putting aside conviction putting aside preference putting aside tradition putting aside reasoning through analogies putting aside an agreement through pondering views Do you have truly personal knowledge that 'From ignorance as a requisite condition come fabrications'
Yes Pavittha my friend
Putting aside conviction preference tradition reasoning through analogies an agreement through pondering views I do have truly personal knowledge that 'From ignorance as a requisite condition come fabrications' Musila my friend putting aside conviction putting aside preference putting aside tradition putting aside reasoning through analogies putting aside an agreement through pondering views Do you have truly personal knowledge that 'From the cessation of birth comes the cessation of aging  death'
Yes Pavittha my friend
Putting aside conviction preference tradition reasoning through analogies an agreement through pondering views I do have truly personal knowledge that 'From the cessation of birth comes the cessation of aging  death'
Musila my friend putting aside conviction putting aside preference putting aside tradition putting aside reasoning through analogies putting aside an agreement through pondering views Do you have truly personal knowledge that 'From the cessation of ignorance comes the cessation of fabrications'
Yes Pavittha my friend
Putting aside conviction preference tradition reasoning through analogies an agreement through pondering views I do have truly personal knowledge that 'From the cessation of ignorance comes the cessation of fabrications' Musila my friend putting aside conviction putting aside preference putting aside tradition putting aside reasoning through analogies putting aside an agreement through pondering views Do you have truly personal knowledge that 'The cessation of becoming is Unbinding'
Yes Pavittha my friend
Putting aside conviction preference tradition reasoning through analogies an agreement through pondering views I do have truly personal knowledge that 'The cessation of becoming is Unbinding' Then Ven
Musila you are an arahant whose fermentations are ended
When this was said Ven
Musila was silent

Then Ven
Narada said Pavittha my friend it would be good if I were to get that question
Ask me that question and I will answer it for you
Then Ven
Narada will get that question
I will ask Ven
Narada that question and may he answer that question for me
Then Ven
Narada you are an arahant whose fermentations are ended
My friend although I have seen properly with right discernment as it actually is present that 'The cessation of becoming is Unbinding' still I am not an arahant whose fermentations are ended
It's as if there were a well along a road in a desert with neither rope nor water bucket
A man would come along overcome by heat oppressed by the heat exhausted dehydrated  thirsty
He would look into the well and would have knowledge of 'water' but he would not dwell touching it with his body
In the same way although I have seen properly with right discernment as it actually is present that 'The cessation of becoming is Unbinding' still I am not an arahant whose fermentations are ended
When this was said Ven
Ananda said to Ven
Pavittha When he speaks in this way friend Pavittha what do you have to say about Ven
Narada
When Ven
Narada speaks in this way friend Ananda I have nothing to say about Ven
Narada except that admirable  skillful
Translator's note This discourse is sometimes cited as proof that a meditator can attain Awakening without having practiced the jhanas but a close reading shows that it does not support this assertion at all
The new arahants mentioned here do not deny that they have attained any of the four form jhanas that make up the definition of right concentration
Instead they simply deny that they have acquired any psychic powers or that they remain in physical contact with the higher levels of concentration the formless states beyond forms In this their definition of discernmentrelease is no different from that given in AN
Taken in the context of the Buddha's many other teachings on right concentration there's every reason to believe that the new arahants mentioned in this discourse had reached at least the first jhana before attaining Awakening
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Rajagaha in the Bamboo Grove the squirrels' sanctuary
Now at that time the Blessed One was worshipped revered honored venerated given homage  a recipient of robes almsfood lodgings  medical requisites for the sick
The community of monks was also worshipped revered honored venerated given homage  a recipient of robes almsfood lodgings  medical requisites for the sick
But the wanderers of other sects were not worshipped revered honored venerated or given homage nor were they recipients of robes almsfood lodgings or medical requisites for the sick
Now at that time Susima the wanderer was living in Rajagaha with a large following of wanderers
And so Susima's following of wanderers said to him Come now friend Susima
Go live the holy life under Gotama the contemplative
When you have completely mastered the Dhamma tell it to us when we have completely mastered it we will teach it to householders and then we too will be worshipped revered honored venerated given homage we too will become recipients of robes almsfood lodgings  medical requisites for the sick
Responding As you say friends to his own following Susima the wanderer went to Ven
Ananda and on arrival exchanged courteous greetings with him
After an exchange of friendly greetings  courtesies he sat to one side
As he was sitting there he said to Ven
Ananda Friend Ananda I want to live the holy life in this Dhamma  Discipline
Then Ven
Ananda took Susima the wanderer to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to the Blessed One sat to one side
As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One Lord this wanderer Susima has said 'Friend Ananda I want to live the holy life in this Dhamma  Discipline' Then in that case Ananda give him the Going Forth So Susima the wanderer gained the Going Forth in the presence of the Blessed One he gained the Acceptance
Now at that time a large number of monks had declared final gnosis in the Blessed One's presence We discern that 'Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task done
There is nothing further for the sake of this world' Ven
Susima heard that A large number of monks it seems have declared final gnosis in the Blessed One's presence 'We discern that Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task done
There is nothing further for the sake of this world' Then Ven
Susima went to those monks and on arrival exchanged courteous greetings with them
After an exchange of friendly greetings  courtesies he sat to one side
As he was sitting there he said to them Is it true as they say that you have declared final gnosis in the Blessed One's presence 'We discern that Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task done
There is nothing further for the sake of this world'
Yes friend
Then having known thus having seen thus do you wield manifold supranormal powers
Having been one you become many having been many you become one
You appear
You vanish
You go unimpeded through walls ramparts  mountains as if through space
You dive in  out of the earth as if it were water
You walk on water without sinking as if it were dry land
Sitting crosslegged you fly through the air like a winged bird
With your hand you touch and stroke even the sun  moon so mighty  powerful
You exercise influence with your body even as far as the Brahma worlds
No friend
Then having known thus having seen thus do you hear  by means of the divine earelement purified  surpassing the human  both kinds of sounds divine  human whether near or far
No friend
Then having known thus having seen thus do you know the awareness of other beings other individuals having encompassed it with your own awareness
Do you discern a mind with passion as a mind with passion and a mind without passion as a mind without passion a mind with aversion as a mind with aversion and a mind without aversion as a mind without aversion a mind with delusion as a mind with delusion and a mind without delusion as a mind without delusion a restricted mind as a restricted mind and a scattered mind as a scattered mind an enlarged mind as an enlarged mind and an unenlarged mind as an unenlarged mindan excelled mind as an excelled mind and an unexcelled mind as an unexcelled mind a concentrated mind as a concentrated mind and an unconcentrated mind as an unconcentrated mind a released mind as a released mind and an unreleased mind as an unreleased mind
No friend
Then having known thus having seen thus do you recollect your manifold past lives ie one birth two births three births four five ten twenty thirty forty fifty one hundred one thousand one hundred thousand births many aeons of cosmic contraction many aeons of cosmic expansion many aeons of cosmic contraction  expansion 'There I had such a name belonged to such a clan had such an appearance
Such was my food such my experience of pleasure  pain such the end of my life
Passing away from that state I rearose there
There too I had such a name belonged to such a clan had such an appearance
Such was my food such my experience of pleasure  pain such the end of my life
Passing away from that state I rearose here'
No friend
Then having known thus having seen thus do you see  by means of the divine eye purified  surpassing the human  beings passing away and reappearing and do you discern how they are inferior  superior beautiful  ugly fortunate  unfortunate in accordance with their kamma 'These beings  who were endowed with bad conduct of body speech  mind who reviled the noble ones held wrong views and undertook actions under the influence of wrong views  with the breakup of the body after death have reappeared in the plane of deprivation the bad destination the lower realms in hell
But these beings  who were endowed with good conduct of body speech  mind who did not revile the noble ones who held right views and undertook actions under the influence of right views  with the breakup of the body after death have reappeared in the good destinations in the heavenly world'
No friend
Then having known thus having seen thus do you dwell touching with your body the peaceful emancipations the formless states beyond form
No friend
So just now friends didn't you make that declaration without having attained any of these Dhammas
We're released through discernment friend Susima
I don't understand the detailed meaning of your brief statement
It would be good if you would speak in such a way that I would understand its detailed meaning
Whether or not you understand friend Susima we are still released through discernment
So Ven
Susima got up from his seat and went to the Blessed One
On arrival having bowed down to the Blessed One he sat to one side
As he was sitting there he told the Blessed One the entire conversation he had had with those monks
First Susima there is the knowledge of the regularity of the Dhamma after which there is the knowledge of Unbinding
I don't understand the detailed meaning of the Blessed One's brief statement
It would be good if the Blessed One would speak in such a way that I would understand its detailed meaning
Whether or not you understand Susima it is still the case that first there is the knowledge of the regularity of the Dhamma after which there is the knowledge of Unbinding
What do you think Susima Is form constant or inconstant  Inconstant lord  And is that which is inconstant easeful or stressful  Stressful lord  And is it fitting to regard what is inconstant stressful subject to change as 'This is mine
This is my self
This is what I am'
No lord
Is feeling constant or inconstant  Inconstant lord
Is perception constant or inconstant  Inconstant lord
Are fabrications constant or inconstant  Inconstant lord
What do you think Susima Is consciousness constant or inconstant  Inconstant lord  And is that which is inconstant easeful or stressful  Stressful lord  And is it fitting to regard what is inconstant stressful subject to change as 'This is mine
This is my self
This is what I am'
No lord
Thus Susima any form whatsoever that is past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or near every form is to be seen as it actually is with right discernment as 'This is not mine
This is not my self
This is not what I am'
Any feeling whatsoever
Any perception whatsoever
Any fabrications whatsoever
Any consciousness whatsoever that is past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or near every consciousness is to be seen as it actually is with right discernment as 'This is not mine
This is not my self
This is not what I am'
Seeing thus the wellinstructed disciple of the noble ones grows disenchanted with form disenchanted with feeling disenchanted with perception disenchanted with fabrications disenchanted with consciousness
Disenchanted he becomes dispassionate
Through dispassion he is fully released
With full release there is the knowledge 'Fully released' He discerns that 'Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task done
There is nothing further for this world' Susima do you see that from birth as a requisite condition there is aging  death
Yes lord
Do you see that from becoming as a requisite condition there is birth
Yes lord
Do you see that from clingingsustenance as a requisite condition there is becoming
Yes lord
Do you see that from craving as a requisite condition there is clingingsustenance
Yes lord
Do you see that from feeling as a requisite condition there is craving
Yes lord
Do you see that from contact as a requisite condition there is feeling
Yes lord
Do you see that from the six sense media as a requisite condition there is contact
Yes lord
Do you see that from nameform as a requisite condition there are the six sense media
Yes lord
Do you see that from consciousness as a requisite condition there is nameform
Yes lord
Do you see that from fabrications as a requisite condition there is consciousness
Yes lord
Do you see that from ignorance as a requisite condition there are fabrications
Yes lord
Now Susima do you see that from the cessation of birth there is the cessation of aging  death
Yes lord
Do you see that from the cessation of becoming there is the cessation of birth
Yes lord
Do you see that from the cessation of clingingsustenance there is the cessation of becoming
Yes lord
Do you see that from the cessation of craving there is the cessation of clingingsustenance
Yes lord
Do you see that from the cessation of feeling there is the cessation of craving
Yes lord
Do you see that from the cessation of contact there is the cessation of feeling
Yes lord
Do you see that from the cessation of the six sense media there is the cessation of contact
Yes lord
Do you see that from the cessation of nameform there is the cessation of the six sense media
Yes lord
Do you see that from the cessation of consciousness there is the cessation of nameform
Yes lord
Do you see that from the cessation of fabrications there is the cessation of consciousness
Yes lord
Do you see that from the cessation of ignorance there is the cessation of fabrications
Yes lord
Then having known thus having seen thus Susima do you wield manifold supranormal powers
Having been one you become many having been many you become one
You appear
You vanish
You go unimpeded through walls ramparts  mountains as if through space
You dive in  out of the earth as if it were water
You walk on water without sinking as if it were dry land
Sitting crosslegged you fly through the air like a winged bird
With your hand you touch and stroke even the sun  moon so mighty  powerful
You exercise influence with your body even as far as the Brahma worlds
No lord
Then having known thus having seen thus Susima do you hear  by means of the divine earelement purified  surpassing the human  both kinds of sounds divine  human whether near or far
No lord
Then having known thus having seen thus Susima do you know the awareness of other beings other individuals having encompassed it with your own awareness
Do you discern a mind with passion as a mind with passion and a mind without passion as a mind without passion a mind with aversion as a mind with aversion and a mind without aversion as a mind without aversion a mind with delusion as a mind with delusion and a mind without delusion as a mind without delusion a restricted mind as a restricted mind and a scattered mind as a scattered mind an enlarged mind as an enlarged mind and an unenlarged mind as an unenlarged mindan excelled mind as an excelled mind and an unexcelled mind as an unexcelled mind a concentrated mind as a concentrated mind and an unconcentrated mind as an unconcentrated mind a released mind as a released mind and an unreleased mind as an unreleased mind
No lord
Then having known thus having seen thus Susima do you recollect your manifold past lives ie one birth two births three births four five ten twenty thirty forty fifty one hundred one thousand one hundred thousand births many aeons of cosmic contraction many aeons of cosmic expansion many aeons of cosmic contraction  expansion 'There I had such a name belonged to such a clan had such an appearance
Such was my food such my experience of pleasure  pain such the end of my life

No lord
Then having known thus having seen thus Susima do you dwell touching with your body the peaceful emancipations the formless states beyond form
No lord
So just now Susima didn't you make that declaration without having attained any of these Dhammas
Then throwing himself down with his head at the Blessed One's feet Ven
Susima said to the Blessed One A transgression has overcome me lord in that I was so foolish so muddleheaded  so unskilled as to go forth as a thief of the Dhamma in this welltaught Dhamma  Discipline
May the Blessed One please accept this confession of my transgression as such so that I may restrain myself in the future
Yes Susima a transgression overcame you in that you were so foolish so muddleheaded  so unskilled as to go forth as a thief of the Dhamma in this welltaught Dhamma  Discipline
Suppose Susima that a robber an evildoer having been caught were shown to a king 'This your majesty is a robber an evildoer
Decree what punishment you want for him' And so the king would say 'Go and  having bound him with a stout rope with his arms pinned tightly against his back having shaved him bald  march him to a harshsounding drum from street to street crossroads to crossroads evict him out the south gate of the city and there to the south of the city cut off his head' Then the king's men having bound the man with a stout rope with his arms pinned tightly against his back would march him to a harshsounding drum from street to street crossroads to crossroads evict him out the south gate of the city and there to the south of the city cut off his head
What do you think Susima
Wouldn't that man for that reason experience pain  distress
Yes lord
However much the pain  distress that man would experience for that reason Susima the Going Forth of a thief of the Dhamma in this welltaught Dhamma  Discipline is still more painful in its result more bitter in its result in that it leads even to the lower realms
But because you see your transgression as such and make amends in accordance with the Dhamma we accept your confession
For Susima it is a cause of growth in the Dhamma  Discipline of the noble ones when seeing a transgression as such one makes amends in accordance with the Dhamma and exercises restraint in the future

On one occasion Ven
Sariputta and Ven
MahaKotthita were staying near Varanasi in the Deer Park at Isipatana
Then in the evening arising from his seclusion Ven
MahaKotthita went to Ven
Sariputta and on arrival exchanged courteous greetings with him
After an exchange of friendly greetings  courtesies he sat to one side
As he was sitting there he said to Ven
Sariputta Now tell me Sariputta my friend Are aging  death selfmade or othermade or both selfmade  othermade or  without selfmaking or othermaking  do they arise spontaneously
It's not the case Kotthita my friend that aging  death are selfmade that they are othermade that they are both selfmade  othermade or that  without selfmaking or othermaking  they arise spontaneously
However from birth as a requisite condition comes aging  death
Now tell me friend Sariputta Is birth Is becoming Is clingingsustenance Is craving Is feeling Is contact Are the six sense media selfmade or othermade or both selfmade  othermade or  without selfmaking or othermaking  do they arise spontaneously
It's not the case Kotthita my friend that the six sense media are selfmade that they are othermade that they are both selfmade  othermade or that  without selfmaking or othermaking  they arise spontaneously
However from name  form as a requisite condition come the six sense media
Now tell me friend Sariputta Is nameform selfmade or othermade or both selfmade  othermade or  without selfmaking or othermaking  does it arise spontaneously
It's not the case Kotthita my friend that nameform is selfmade that it is othermade that it is both selfmade  othermade or that  without selfmaking or othermaking  it arises spontaneously
However from consciousness as a requisite condition comes nameform
Now tell me friend Sariputta is consciousness selfmade or othermade or both selfmade  othermade or  without selfmaking or othermaking does it arise spontaneously
It's not the case Kotthita my friend that consciousness is selfmade that it is othermade that it is both selfmade  othermade or that  without selfmaking or othermaking  it arises spontaneously
However from nameform as a requisite condition comes consciousness
Just now friend Sariputta I understood your statement as 'It's not the case Kotthita my friend that nameform is selfmade that it is othermade that it is both selfmade  othermade or that  without selfmaking or othermaking  it arises spontaneously
However from consciousness as a requisite condition comes nameform' But then I understood your statement as 'It's not the case Kotthita my friend that consciousness is selfmade that it is othermade that it is both selfmade  othermade or that  without selfmaking or othermaking  it arises spontaneously' However from nameform as a requisite condition comes consciousness' Now how is the meaning of these statements to be understood
Very well then Kotthita my friend I will give you an analogy for there are cases where it is through the use of an analogy that intelligent people can understand the meaning of what is being said
It is as if two sheaves of reeds were to stand leaning against one another
In the same way from nameform as a requisite condition comes consciousness from consciousness as a requisite condition comes nameform
From name  form as a requisite condition come the six sense media
From the six sense media as a requisite condition comes contact
From contact as a requisite condition comes feeling
From feeling as a requisite condition comes craving
From craving as a requisite condition comes clingingsustenance
From clingingsustenance as a requisite condition comes becoming
From becoming as a requisite condition comes birth
From birth as a requisite condition then aging  death sorrow lamentation pain distress  despair come into play
Such is the origination of this entire mass of suffering  stress
If one were to pull away one of those sheaves of reeds the other would fall if one were to pull away the other the first one would fall
In the same way from the cessation of nameform comes the cessation of consciousness from the cessation of consciousness comes the cessation of nameform
From the cessation of nameform comes the cessation of the six sense media
From the cessation of the six sense media comes the cessation of contact
From the cessation of contact comes the cessation of feeling
From the cessation of feeling comes the cessation of craving
From the cessation of craving comes the cessation of clingingsustenance
From the cessation of clingingsustenance comes the cessation of becoming
From the cessation of becoming comes the cessation of birth
From the cessation of birth then aging  death sorrow lamentation pain distress  despair all cease
Such is the cessation of this entire mass of suffering  stress
It's amazing friend Sariputta
It's astounding friend Sariputta how well that was said by Ven
Sariputta
And I rejoice in Ven
Sariputta's good statements with regard to these topics

Dwelling at Savatthi Monks before my Awakening when I was just an unawakened Bodhisatta the realization came to me 'How this world has fallen on difficulty
It is born it ages it dies it falls away  rearises but it does not discern the escape from this stress from this aging  death
O when will it discern the escape from this stress from this aging  death'

From what as a requisite condition is there aging  death' From my appropriate attention there came the breakthrough of discernment 'Aging  death exist when birth exists

From nameform as a requisite condition comes consciousness'
Then the thought occurred to me 'This consciousness turns back at nameform and goes no farther
It is to this extent that there is birth aging death falling away  rearising ie from nameform as a requisite condition comes consciousness from consciousness as a requisite condition comes nameform
From nameform as a requisite condition come the six sense media Thus is the origination of this entire mass of stress
Origination origination' Vision arose clear knowing arose discernment arose knowledge arose illumination arose within me with regard to things never heard before
Then the thought occurred to me 'Aging  death don't exist when what doesn't exist
From the cessation of what comes the cessation of aging  death' From my appropriate attention there came the breakthrough of discernment 'Aging  death don't exist when birth doesn't exist
From the cessation of birth comes the cessation of aging  death' 'Nameform doesn't exist when what doesn't exist
From the cessation of what comes the cessation of nameform' From my appropriate attention there came the breakthrough of discernment 'Nameform doesn't exist when consciousness doesn't exist
From the cessation of consciousness comes the cessation of nameform' Then the thought occurred to me 'Consciousness doesn't exist when what doesn't exist
From the cessation of what comes the cessation of consciousness' From my appropriate attention there came the breakthrough of discernment 'Consciousness doesn't exist when nameform doesn't exist
From the cessation of nameform comes the cessation of consciousness'
The thought occurred to me 'I have attained this path to Awakening ie from the cessation of nameform comes the cessation of consciousness from the cessation of consciousness comes the cessation of nameform
From the cessation of nameform comes the cessation of the six sense media
From the cessation of the six sense media comes the cessation of contact
From the cessation of contact comes the cessation of feeling
From the cessation of feeling comes the cessation of craving
From the cessation of craving comes the cessation of clingingsustenance
From the cessation of clingingsustenance comes the cessation of becoming
From the cessation of becoming comes the cessation of birth
From the cessation of birth then aging  death sorrow lamentation pain distress  despair all cease
Thus is the cessation of this entire mass of stress
Cessation cessation' Vision arose clear knowing arose discernment arose knowledge arose illumination arose within me with regard to things never heard before
It is just as if a man traveling along a wilderness track were to see an ancient path an ancient road traveled by people of former times
He would follow it
Following it he would see an ancient city an ancient capital inhabited by people of former times complete with parks groves  ponds walled delightful
He would go to address the king or the king's minister saying 'Sire you should know that while traveling along a wilderness track I saw an ancient path I followed it I saw an ancient city an ancient capital complete with parks groves  ponds walled delightful
Sire rebuild that city' The king or king's minister would rebuild the city so that at a later date the city would become powerful rich  wellpopulated fully grown  prosperous
In the same way I saw an ancient path an ancient road traveled by the Rightly Selfawakened Ones of former times
And what is that ancient path that ancient road traveled by the Rightly Selfawakened Ones of former times
Just this noble eightfold path right view right aspiration right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness right concentration
That is the ancient path the ancient road traveled by the Rightly Selfawakened Ones of former times
I followed that path
Following it I came to direct knowledge of aging  death direct knowledge of the origination of aging  death direct knowledge of the cessation of aging  death direct knowledge of the path leading to the cessation of aging  death
I followed that path
Following it I came to direct knowledge of birth becoming clinging craving feeling contact the six sense media nameform consciousness direct knowledge of the origination of consciousness direct knowledge of the cessation of consciousness direct knowledge of the path leading to the cessation of consciousness
I followed that path
Following it I came to direct knowledge of fabrications direct knowledge of the origination of fabrications direct knowledge of the cessation of fabrications direct knowledge of the path leading to the cessation of fabrications
Knowing that directly I have revealed it to monks nuns male lay followers  female lay followers so that this holy life has become powerful rich detailed wellpopulated widespread proclaimed among celestial  human beings
At Savatthi There are these four nutriments for the maintenance of beings who have come into being or for the support of those in search of a place to be born
Which four
Physical food gross or refined contact as the second intellectual intention the third and consciousness the fourth
These are the four nutriments for the maintenance of beings who have come into being or for the support of those in search of a place to be born
Where there is passion delight  craving for the nutriment of physical food consciousness lands there and increases
Where consciousness lands and increases there is the alighting of nameform
Where there is the alighting of nameform there is the growth of fabrications
Where there is the growth of fabrications there is the production of renewed becoming in the future
Where there is the production of renewed becoming in the future there is future birth aging  death together I tell you with sorrow affliction  despair
Where there is passion delight  craving for the nutriment of contact
Where there is passion delight  craving for the nutriment of intellectual intention
Where there is passion delight  craving for the nutriment of consciousness consciousness lands there and increases
Where consciousness lands and increases there is the alighting of nameform
Where there is the alighting of nameform there is the growth of fabrications
Where there is the growth of fabrications there is the production of renewed becoming in the future
Where there is the production of renewed becoming in the future there is future birth aging  death together I tell you with sorrow affliction  despair
Just as  when there is dye lac yellow orpiment indigo or crimson  a dyer or painter would paint the picture of a woman or a man complete in all its parts on a wellpolished panel or wall or on a piece of cloth in the same way where there is passion delight  craving for the nutriment of physical food contact intellectual intention consciousness consciousness lands there and increases
Where consciousness lands and increases there is the alighting of nameform
Where there is the alighting of nameform there is the growth of fabrications
Where there is the growth of fabrications there is the production of renewed becoming in the future
Where there is the production of renewed becoming in the future there is future birth aging  death together I tell you with sorrow affliction  despair
Where there is no passion for the nutriment of physical food where there is no delight no craving then consciousness does not land there or increase
Where consciousness does not land or increase there is no alighting of nameform
Where there is no alighting of nameform there is no growth of fabrications
Where there is no growth of fabrications there is no production of renewed becoming in the future
Where there is no production of renewed becoming in the future there is no future birth aging  death
That I tell you has no sorrow affliction or despair
Where there is no passion for the nutriment of contact
Where there is no passion for the nutriment of intellectual intention
Where there is no passion for the nutriment of consciousness where there is no delight no craving then consciousness does not land there or increase
Where consciousness does not land or increase there is no alighting of nameform
Where there is no alighting of nameform there is no growth of fabrications
Where there is no growth of fabrications there is no production of renewed becoming in the future
Where there is no production of renewed becoming in the future there is no future birth aging  death
That I tell you has no sorrow affliction or despair
Just as if there were a roofed house or a roofed hall having windows on the north the south or the east
When the sun rises and a ray has entered by way of the window where does it land
On the western wall lord
And if there is no western wall where does it land
On the ground lord
And if there is no ground where does it land
On the water lord
And if there is no water where does it land
It does not land lord
In the same way where there is no passion for the nutriment of physical food contact intellectual intention consciousness where there is no delight no craving then consciousness does not land there or increase
Where consciousness does not land or increase there is no alighting of nameform
Where there is no alighting of nameform there is no growth of fabrications
Where there is no growth of fabrications there is no production of renewed becoming in the future
Where there is no production of renewed becoming in the future there is no future birth aging  death

At Savatthi There are these four nutriments for the maintenance of beings who have come into being or for the support of those in search of a place to be born
Which four
Physical food gross or refined contact as the second intellectual intention the third and consciousness the fourth
These are the four nutriments for the maintenance of beings who have come into being or for the support of those in search of a place to be born
And how is physical food to be regarded
Suppose a couple husband  wife taking meager provisions were to travel through a desert
With them would be their only baby son dear  appealing
Then the meager provisions of the couple going through the desert would be used up  depleted while there was still a stretch of the desert yet to be crossed
The thought would occur to them 'Our meager provisions are used up  depleted while there is still a stretch of this desert yet to be crossed
What if we were to kill this only baby son of ours dear  appealing and make dried meat  jerky
That way  chewing on the flesh of our son  at least the two of us would make it through this desert
Otherwise all three of us would perish' So they would kill their only baby son loved  endearing and make dried meat  jerky
Chewing on the flesh of their son they would make it through the desert
While eating the flesh of their only son they would beat their breasts 'Where have you gone our only baby son
Where have you gone our only baby son' Now what do you think monks Would that couple eat that food playfully or for intoxication or for putting on bulk or for beautification
No lord
Wouldn't they eat that food simply for the sake of making it through that desert
Yes lord
In the same way I tell you is the nutriment of physical food to be regarded
When physical food is comprehended passion for the five strings of sensuality is comprehended
When passion for the five strings of sensuality is comprehended there is no fetter bound by which a disciple of the noble ones would come back again to this world
And how is the nutriment of contact to be regarded
Suppose a flayed cow were to stand leaning against a wall
The creatures living in the wall would chew on it
If it were to stand leaning against a tree the creatures living in the tree would chew on it
If it were to stand exposed to water the creatures living in the water would chew on it
If it were to stand exposed to the air the creatures living in the air would chew on it
For wherever the flayed cow were to stand exposed the creatures living there would chew on it
In the same way I tell you is the nutriment of contact to be regarded
When the nutriment of contact is comprehended the three feelings are comprehended
When the three feelings are comprehended I tell you there is nothing further for a disciple of the noble ones to do
And how is the nutriment of intellectual intention to be regarded
Suppose there were a pit of glowing embers deeper than a man's height full of embers that were neither flaming nor smoking and a man were to come along  loving life hating death loving pleasure abhorring pain  and two strong men having grabbed him by the arms were to drag him to the pit of embers
To get far away would be that man's intention far away would be his wish far away would be his aspiration
Why is that
Because he would realize 'If I fall into this pit of glowing embers I will meet with death from that cause or with deathlike pain' In the same way I tell you is the nutriment of intellectual intention to be regarded
When the nutriment of intellectual intention is comprehended the three forms of craving are comprehended
When the three forms of craving are comprehended I tell you there is nothing further for a disciple of the noble ones to do
And how is the nutriment of consciousness to be regarded
Suppose that having arrested a thief a criminal they were to show him to the king 'This is a thief a criminal for you your majesty
Impose on him whatever punishment you like' So the king would say 'Go men and shoot him in the morning with a hundred spears' So they would shoot him in the morning with a hundred spears
Then the king would say at noon 'Men how is that man' 'Still alive your majesty' So the king would say 'Go men and shoot him at noon with a hundred spears' So they would shoot him at noon with a hundred spears
Then the king would say in the evening 'Men how is that man' 'Still alive your majesty' So the king would say 'Go men and shoot him in the evening with a hundred spears' So they would shoot him in the evening with a hundred spears
Now what do you think monks Would that man being shot with three hundred spears a day experience pain  distress from that cause
Even if he were to be shot with only one spear lord he would experience pain  distress from that cause to say nothing of three hundred spears
In the same way I tell you monks is the nutriment of consciousness to be regarded
When the nutriment of consciousness is comprehended name  form are comprehended
When name  form are comprehended I tell you there is nothing further for a disciple of the noble ones to do

The Blessed One was once staying among the Kurus at their markettown of Kammaasadamma
Wonderful Lord marvelous Lord is the profundity of this law of Dependent Origination and how profound it appears
And yet to me it appears perfectly plain
Do not say that Aananda do not say that
This law of Dependent Origination is indeed profound and appears profound
It is through not knowing not understanding not penetrating this truth that this generation has become entangled like a knotted string covered with blight like grass and reeds and cannot pass over the downfall the woeful way the sorrowful state the cycle of birthanddeath
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Savatthi in Jeta's Grove Anathapindika's monastery
There he addressed the monks Monks an uninstructed runofthemill person might grow disenchanted with this body composed of the four great elements might grow dispassionate toward it might gain release from it
Why is that
Because the growth  decline the taking up  putting down of this body composed of the four great elements are apparent
Thus the uninstructed runofthemill person might grow disenchanted might grow dispassionate might gain release there
But as for what's called 'mind' 'intellect' or 'consciousness' the uninstructed runofthemill person is unable to grow disenchanted with it unable to grow dispassionate toward it unable to gain release from it
Why is that
For a long time this has been relished appropriated and grasped by the uninstructed runofthemill person as 'This is me this is my self this is what I am' Thus the uninstructed runofthemill person is unable to grow disenchanted with it unable to grow dispassionate toward it unable to gain release from it
It would be better for the uninstructed runofthemill person to hold to the body composed of the four great elements rather than the mind as the self
Why is that
Because this body composed of the four great elements is seen standing for a year two years three four five ten twenty thirty forty fifty a hundred years or more
But what's called 'mind' 'intellect' or 'consciousness' by day and by night arises as one thing and ceases as another
Just as a monkey swinging through a forest wilderness grabs a branch
Letting go of it it grabs another branch
Letting go of that it grabs another one
Letting go of that it grabs another one
In the same way what's called 'mind' 'intellect' or 'consciousness' by day and by night arises as one thing and ceases as another
The instructed disciple of the noble ones attends carefully  appropriately right there at the dependent coarising
'When this is that is
'From the arising of this comes the arising of that
'When this isn't that isn't
'From the cessation of this comes the cessation of that
'In other words
'From ignorance as a requisite condition come fabrications
'From fabrications as a requisite condition comes consciousness
'From consciousness as a requisite condition comes nameform
'From nameform as a requisite condition come the six sense media
'From the six sense media as a requisite condition comes contact
'From contact as a requisite condition comes feeling
'From feeling as a requisite condition comes craving
'From craving as a requisite condition comes clingingsustenance
'From clingingsustenance as a requisite condition comes becoming
'From becoming as a requisite condition comes birth
'From birth as a requisite condition then aging  death sorrow lamentation pain distress  despair come into play
Such is the origination of this entire mass of stress  suffering
'Now from the remainderless fading  cessation of that very ignorance comes the cessation of fabrications
From the cessation of fabrications comes the cessation of consciousness
From the cessation of consciousness comes the cessation of nameform
From the cessation of nameform comes the cessation of the six sense media
From the cessation of the six sense media comes the cessation of contact
From the cessation of contact comes the cessation of feeling
From the cessation of feeling comes the cessation of craving
From the cessation of craving comes the cessation of clingingsustenance
From the cessation of clingingsustenance comes the cessation of becoming
From the cessation of becoming comes the cessation of birth
From the cessation of birth then aging  death sorrow lamentation pain distress  despair all cease
Such is the cessation of this entire mass of stress  suffering'
Seeing thus the instructed disciple of the noble ones grows disenchanted with form disenchanted with feeling disenchanted with perception disenchanted with fabrications disenchanted with consciousness
Disenchanted he becomes dispassionate
Through dispassion he is fully released
With full release there is the knowledge 'Fully released' He discerns that 'Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task done
There is nothing further for this world' See also SN SN
This poem by the Elder Udayin evokes one of the most famous of Buddhist images and is laced with meaning on many levels
In one sense  emerging from the psychological ethos of early Buddhist teaching  it can be taken to describe the ability of the awakened person to thrive in the world of sensory experience without clinging or attachment
Though the human condition is rooted in the desires that give rise to all life and selfhood one can learn to live in this world without being bound by the impulse to crave pleasure and avoid pain
One gets drenched by the world when one succumbs to to the range of grasping behaviors which inevitably bring about suffering  the mind clings to an object like water that permeates something and drenches it
Here we see a Buddha that does not transcend the world but lives in it for fortyfive years with a mind free of all attachments
As the tradition evolved the question of just what sort of being the Buddha was became of growing importance
The image of the lotus emerging from the mud and blooming above the world became a popular way of expressing the Buddha's transcendence
In the canonical passage upon which Udayin builds his verse the phrase having passed beyond the world is added and this becomes the basis for the Vetulyaka assertion that the Buddha was essentially a transcendent being
This interpretation had profound implications for later Buddhism and set the stage for among other ideas the Three Bodies of the Buddha doctrine of Mahayana Buddhism
In this way of looking at things Awakening is something that happens again and again in all different places and times and is not limited to a single occurrence of it among the Sakya's of ancient India
The tantric Buddhists of the Vajrayana were drawn to the contrast in this image between the ordinary defiling mud in which the plant is rooted and the sublime loveliness of the blossom
Relentless in their nonattachment to dichotomies and their demolition of opposites the tantric approach is to be capable of embracing both extremes without clinging to either
Though the emphasis changes we can see that the essential teaching of nonattachment or nonclinging  to the objects of senseperception to a particular mode of teaching or to conventional dualities  remains carried through the ages by this simple image of a lotus growing out of the water
These lovely verses are attributed to Tissa Kumara the youngest brother of King Ashoka and if this is true it demonstrates how some of the poetry of the Theragatha entered into the Pali canon relatively late  at the time of the Third Council
Prince Tissa was made Vice Regent when Ashoka was first consecrated King
But within only a few years inspired by the example of a forestdwelling monk he encountered while hunting he renounced worldly life to live as a simple Buddhist monk in the wilderness
His monastic name translates as The Elder Who Lives Alone
The poem exudes the romantic yearning for the solitude of nature felt by someone who grew up no doubt in the court of the Maurya empire
The first five stanzas are said to have been uttered to Ashoka while expressing his wish to become a monk and the last two verses were composed upon ordination
A final verse not translated here attests to his eventual awakening
It was quite a family
Ashoka's son and daughter were the ones to formally bring the Dhamma to the island of Lanka where Theravada Buddhism flourished for two and a half millennia
The mountains named in the last stanza actually refer to the ring of hills surrounding Vulture's Peak but since the previous stanza specifies the peak of a mountain I think it is appropriate to name the more wellknown site
These verses are said to have been uttered by Udayin
He was the son of king Suddhodhana's chief minister and is said to have been the childhood companion of prince Siddhartha
Soon after Gotama's awakening the king sent several messengers to ask his son to return home
Each one upon hearing the Buddha's teaching apparently joined his movement and gave up the king's mission
Finally Suddhodhana sends Kaludayin who agrees on condition that he can become a follower of the Buddha upon getting him to return home for a visit
The Rohini river runs through the heart of the Buddha's homeland marking the border between the lands of the Sakyas and the Koliyas
Since the verses are uttered in Rajagaha well to the southeast a returning journey would face the traveler westward
One commentary says that Kaludayin went on for sixty stanzas of this beautiful nature poetry before asking the Buddha to return but we only have the first few of these
The language is rich and evocative of spring sights and smells
It is composed in a meter of eleven syllables per line
The Buddha does indeed go home soon after his awakening where he picks up a number of family members to join his order
These include his half brother several cousins and his son
Eventually his wife stepmother and many other Sakyas will also become nuns and monks
These powerful words echo through twenty five centuries of humanity to reach our ears today
It makes one's spine tingle to think how many voices  now long silent  have uttered these words in each of the one hundred generations that have come and gone since Sirimanda first composed them
How many have heeded their message
How many can hear it today
This is the kind of literature that leads some to view Buddhism as holding a pessimistic outlook on the world
But in fact it is merely expressing in a forthright and dramatic manner some facts with which we are all quite familiar
Perhaps we would prefer to ignore the facts of aging and death but the Buddha's compassion is manifest in his not leaving the world to wallow in the shallow happiness that comes from ignoring our danger
Above all these stanzas are a call to action provoking us to wake up from the complacent slumber of our denial and urging us to dwell without confusion This is a reference to mindfulness the practice of insight meditation
For by nurturing awareness of what is actually going on in our experience  both what is pleasurable and what is painful  we sow the seeds of wisdom
And wisdom according to the Buddhist tradition can help us see through the desires and cravings that obscure what is ageless and deathless
The Sutta Nipata is probably one of the most diverse collections of discourses to be found in the Pali Tipitaka and the chapter from which this sutta is taken the Atthakavagga may well be the oldest portion of the entire canon
It is composed mostly in verse and includes some lovely poetry
There is something particularly moving for me about this poem perhaps because it is composed in the first person and appears to reveal the process through which the Buddha himself came to understanding perhaps because of the vulnerability expressed in the opening stanzas where he admits his fear and sense of dread over the nature of the human condition
Or maybe it is just the utter simplicity of first the problem and then its cause and finally its solution
How easy he can so often make it all sound
The first line alone is a counterintuitive showstopper
Conventional wisdom suggests that arming oneself is a prudent response to fear of selfinjury
Yet the Buddha's wisdom goes deeper to observe how this actually contributes to the generation of more fear
Do we really feel more safe when we lash out at our critics and adversaries
Our culture certainly assumes so but the Buddha is offering an alternative response emerging from his own experience
The phrase translated here as arming oneself which serves as the title of the sutta is elsewhere rendered embracing violence or violent conduct
The basic image is of a person taking up a stick the stick being a common symbol in Indian literature for both violence and punishment
The reader can hardly help feeling swept up in the emotional turmoil of the author
The tension mounts as the fear and despair builds and then breaks suddenly with the insight that like an animal driven to madness by an injury mankind is not evil by nature but is only driven to violence by the relentless pressure of desire
The latter half of the poem describes how to cultivate a state of mind  a stance within unfolding experience  that avoids the dysfunctional move of creating and projecting oneself on every situation
These few verses embrace the whole of the four noble truths the suffering manifest as violence its cause by the thorn in the heart the unbinding or crossing over this and the way to cultivate the selflessness that constitutes real freedom
These verses from the Sutta Nipata aptly state the paradox of illusion
Our six senses spin threads of perception which we weave into a tapestry called myself and the world We then take this handiwork to be more solid and meaningful than it is and get caught in its intricate patterns and colors
For those who are able to see through this illusory construction ordinary pleasures are seen as a snare that catches and reinforces the ego  that view we have of self as separate from which so much suffering arises
The moderation or even renunciation of these pleasures on the other hand can be viewed as a powerful tool for gaining freedom from our selfcreated suffering
The term nobles or noble ones is used in the Buddhist tradition not for people of a certain birth or social class but for any person who thinks speaks or acts nobly with generosity kindness and wisdom rather than with greed hatred or delusion
A theme recurrent in the passages we have been considering is that the abandonment of clingingsustenance is effected through knowledge
'These four sustenance have what as their cause what as their origin from what are they born from what do they arise
These four sustenance have craving as their cause craving as their origin are born from craving and arise from craving
'And what does craving have as its cause feeling And what does feeling have as its cause contact And what does contact have as its cause the six sense spheres And what do the six sense spheres have as their cause name  form And what do name  form have as their cause consciousness And what does consciousness have as its cause fabrications And what do fabrications have as their cause ignorance
'And monks as soon as ignorance is abandoned in a monk and clear knowing arises he  from the fading of ignorance and the arising of clear knowing  clings neither to sensuality as sustenance nor to views as sustenance nor to habits  practices as sustenance nor to doctrines of the self as sustenance
Not clinging he is not agitated
Unagitated he is totally unbound right within
He discerns that Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task done
There is nothing further for this world'
The word 'vijjā'  translated here as clear knowing  also means 'science' And just as science implies a method there is a method  a discipline  underlying the knowledge that leads to Unbinding
That method is described from a number of perspectives in the Canon each description stressing different aspects of the steps involved
The standard formula though is the noble eightfold path also known as the middle way
'There are these two extremes that one who has gone forth is not to indulge in
Which two
That which is devoted to sensuality with reference to sensual objects base vulgar common ignoble unprofitable and that which is devoted to selfaffliction painful ignoble unprofitable
Avoiding both of these extremes the middle way realized by the Tathāgata  producing vision producing knowledge  leads to calm to direct knowledge to selfawakening to Unbinding
'And what is the middle way realized by the Tathāgata that  producing vision producing knowledge  leads to calm to direct knowledge to selfawakening to Unbinding
Precisely this noble eightfold path right view right resolve right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness right concentration'
The eight factors of the path fall under three headings the first two factors coming under discernment the next three under virtue and the final three under concentration
These three headings are called the threefold training the dynamic among them leading to the knowledge  vision of release is one of natural cause  effect
'It is natural that in a virtuous person one of consummate virtue freedom from remorse will arise It is natural that in a person free from remorse gladness will arise that in a glad person rapture will arise that for an enraptured person the body will be calmed that a person of calmed body will feel pleasure that the mind of a person feeling pleasure will become concentrated that a person whose mind is concentrated will see things as they have come to be that a person seeing things as they have come to be will grow disenchanted that a disenchanted person will grow dispassionate that a dispassionate person will realize the knowledge  vision of release'
According to the standard description of the noble eightfold path the heading of discernment includes seeing things in terms of the four noble truths about stress and maintaining the resolve to release oneself from sensuality to abandon ill will and to avoid doing harm
Virtue includes abstaining from lying from divisive speech from harsh speech  from idle chatter from killing stealing  having illicit sex and from engaging in dishonest or abusive forms of making a living such as dealing in poison slaves weapons intoxicants or animal flesh
The factors that go into concentration though are somewhat more complex
'And what monks is right effort
There is the case where a monk generates desire endeavors arouses persistence upholds  exerts his intent for the sake of the nonarising of evil unskillful qualities that have not yet arisen for the sake of the abandoning of evil unskillful qualities that have arisen for the sake of the arising of skillful qualities that have not yet arisen for the maintenance nonconfusion increase plenitude development  culmination of skillful qualities that have arisen
This monks is right effort
'And what is right mindfulness
There is the case where a monk remains focused on the body in  of itself  ardent alert  mindful  subduing greed  distress with reference to the world
He remains focused on feelings in  of themselves He remains focused on the mind in  of itself He remains focused on mental qualities in  of themselves  ardent alert  mindful  subduing greed  distress with reference to the world
'Thus either internally he remains focused on the body in  of itself or externally or both internally  externally or else he remains focused on the phenomenon of origination with reference to the body or the phenomenon of passing away with reference to the body or the phenomenon of origination  passing away with reference to the body
Or his mindfulness that There is a body is maintained just to the extent of knowledge  recollection
And he remains independent not sustained by anything in the world
'
Right concentration is the practice of the four basic levels of jhāna
These three factors are component parts of a single whole
In fact their balanced interrelatedness is what makes them 'right' The first level of jhāna requires the abandoning of unskillful mental qualities which is part of the duty of right effort and as we saw in the description of breath meditation jhāna begins with mindfulness of the present
As jhāna is practiced  mastered skillful qualities are fostered  maintained physical processes are stilled so that mental qualities may become clearly apparent as they occur mindfulness is made pure on the attainment of the fourth level of jhāna and all four of the establishings of mindfulness are developed
'On whatever occasion monks a monk breathing in long discerns that he is breathing in long or breathing out long discerns that he is breathing out long or breathing in short discerns that he is breathing in short or breathing out short discerns that he is breathing out short trains himself to breathe inout sensitive to the entire body trains himself to breathe inout calming bodily fabrication On that occasion monks the monk remains focused on the body in  of itself  ardent alert  mindful  subduing greed  distress with reference to the world
'On whatever occasion a monk trains himself to breathe in out sensitive to rapture trains himself to breathe in out sensitive to pleasure trains himself to breathe inout sensitive to mental fabrication trains himself to breathe in out calming mental fabrication On that occasion the monk remains focused on feelings in  of themselves  ardent alert  mindful  subduing greed  distress with reference to the world
'On whatever occasion a monk trains himself to breathe in out sensitive to the mind trains himself to breathe in out gladdening the mind trains himself to breathe in out steadying the mind trains himself to breathe in out releasing the mind On that occasion the monk remains focused on the mind in  of itself  ardent alert  mindful  subduing greed  distress with reference to the world
'On whatever occasion a monk trains himself to breathe in out focusing on inconstancy trains himself to breathe inout focusing on dispassion trains himself to breathe inout focusing on stopping trains himself to breathe inout focusing on relinquishing On that occasion the monk remains focused on mental qualities in  of themselves  ardent alert  mindful  subduing greed  distress with reference to the world'
In the Great Discourse on the Establishings of Mindfulness the Buddha describes mindfulness of mental qualities in  of themselves in part in terms of the hindrances and the factors for Awakening qualities that are respectively set aside  fostered in the practice of jhāna
'And how does a monk remain focused on mental qualities in  of themselves with reference to the five hindrances
There is the case where there being sensual desire present within a monk discerns There is sensual desire present within me Or there being no sensual desire present within he discerns There is no sensual desire present within me He discerns how there is the arising of unarisen sensual desire
And he discerns how there is the abandoning of sensual desire once it has arisen
And he discerns how there is no further appearance in the future of sensual desire that has been abandoned
'And how does a monk remain focused on mental qualities in  of themselves with reference to the seven factors for Awakening
There is the case where there being mindfulness as a factor for Awakening present within a monk discerns that Mindfulness as a factor for Awakening is present within me Or there being no mindfulness as a factor for Awakening present within a monk discerns that Mindfulness as a factor for Awakening is not present within me He discerns how there is the arising of unarisen mindfulness as a factor for Awakening
And he discerns how there is the development  consummation of mindfulness as a factor for Awakening once it has arisen
'
Thus the practice of right mindfulness does not repress undesirable mental qualities  ie it does not deny their presence
Rather it notices them as they occur so that the phenomenon of their occurrence can be understood
Once they are understood for what they are as phenomena they lose their power and can be abandoned
However the practice of right mindfulness focuses not on the haphazard occurrence of mental qualities but on the elimination of undesirable qualities  the hindrances  that obstruct jhāna and on the development of desirable qualities  the factors for Awakening  that jhāna fosters
