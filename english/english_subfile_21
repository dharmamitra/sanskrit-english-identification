A woman prohibited by convention
This includes close female relatives forbidden as partners by social tradition nuns and other women under a vow of celibacy and those prohibited as partners by the law of the land
From the standpoint of a woman two kinds of men are considered illicit partners
For a married woman any man other than her husband is out of bounds
Thus a married woman violates the precept if she breaks her vow of fidelity to her husband
But a widow or divorcee is free to remarry
For any woman any man forbidden by convention such as close relatives and those under a vow of celibacy is an illicit partner
Besides these any case of forced violent or coercive sexual union constitutes a transgression
But in such a case the violation falls only on the offender not on the one compelled to submit
The positive virtue corresponding to the abstinence is for laypeople marital fidelity
Husband and wife should each be faithful and devoted to the other content with the relationship and should not risk a breakup to the union by seeking outside partners
The principle does not however confine sexual relations to the marital union
It is flexible enough to allow for variations depending on social convention
The essential purpose as was said is to prevent sexual relations which are hurtful to others
When mature independent people though unmarried enter into a sexual relationship through free consent so long as no other person is intentionally harmed no breach of the training factor is involved
Ordained monks and nuns including men and women who have undertaken the eight or ten precepts are obliged to observe celibacy
They must abstain not only from sexual misconduct but from all sexual involvements at least during the period of their vows
The holy life at its highest aims at complete purity in thought word and deed and this requires turning back the tide of sexual desire
Right livelihood is concerned with ensuring that one earns one's living in a righteous way
For a lay disciple the Buddha teaches that wealth should be gained in accordance with certain standards
One should acquire it only by legal means not illegally one should acquire it peacefully without coercion or violence one should acquire it honestly not by trickery or deceit and one should acquire it in ways which do not entail harm and suffering for others
The Buddha mentions five specific kinds of livelihood which bring harm to others and are therefore to be avoided dealing in weapons in living beings in meat production and butchery in poisons and in intoxicants
He further names several dishonest means of gaining wealth which fall under wrong livelihood practicing deceit treachery soothsaying trickery and usury
Obviously any occupation that requires violation of right speech and right action is a wrong form of livelihood but other occupations such as selling weapons or intoxicants may not violate those factors and yet be wrong because of their consequences for others
The Thai treatise discusses the positive aspects of right livelihood under the three convenient headings of rightness regarding actions rightness regarding persons and rightness regarding objects
Rightness regarding actions means that workers should fulfill their duties diligently and conscientiously not idling away time claiming to have worked longer hours than they did or pocketing the company's goods
Rightness regarding persons means that due respect and consideration should be shown to employers employees colleagues and customers
An employer for example should assign his workers chores according to their ability pay them adequately promote them when they deserve a promotion and give them occasional vacations and bonuses
Colleagues should try to cooperate rather than compete while merchants should be equitable in their dealings with customers
Rightness regarding objects means that in business transactions and sales the articles to be sold should be presented truthfully
There should be no deceptive advertising misrepresentations of quality or quantity or dishonest manoeuvers
The purification of conduct established by the prior three factors serves as the basis for the next division of the path the division of concentration
This present phase of practice which advances from moral restraint to direct mental training comprises the three factors of right effort right mindfulness and right concentration
It gains its name from the goal to which it aspires the power of sustained concentration itself required as the support for insightwisdom
Wisdom is the primary tool for deliverance but the penetrating vision it yields can only open up when the mind has been composed and collected
Right concentration brings the requisite stillness to the mind by unifying it with undistracted focus on a suitable object
To do so however the factor of concentration needs the aid of effort and mindfulness
Right effort provides the energy demanded by the task right mindfulness the steadying points for awareness
The commentators illustrate the interdependence of the three factors within the concentration group with a simple simile
Three boys go to a park to play
While walking along they see a tree with flowering tops and decide they want to gather the flowers
But the flowers are beyond the reach even of the tallest boy
Then one friend bends down and offers his back
The tall boy climbs up but still hesitates to reach for the flowers from fear of falling
So the third boy comes over and offers his shoulder for support
The first boy standing on the back of the second boy then leans on the shoulder of the third boy reaches up and gathers the flowers
In this simile the tall boy who picks the flowers represents concentration with its function of unifying the mind
But to unify the mind concentration needs support the energy provided by right effort which is like the boy who offers his back
It also requires the stabilizing awareness provided by mindfulness which is like the boy who offers his shoulder
When right concentration receives this support then empowered by right effort and balanced by right mindfulness it can draw in the scattered strands of thought and fix the mind firmly on its object
Energy the mental factor behind right effort can appear in either wholesome or unwholesome forms
The same factor fuels desire aggression violence and ambition on the one hand and generosity selfdiscipline kindness concentration and understanding on the other
The exertion involved in right effort is a wholesome form of energy but it is something more specific namely the energy in wholesome states of consciousness directed to liberation from suffering
This last qualifying phrase is especially important
For wholesome energy to become a contributor to the path it has to be guided by right view and right intention and to work in association with the other path factors
Otherwise as the energy in ordinary wholesome states of mind it merely engenders an accumulation of merit that ripens within the round of birth and death it does not issue in liberation from the round
Time and again the Buddha has stressed the need for effort for diligence exertion and unflagging perseverance
The reason why effort is so crucial is that each person has to work out his or her own deliverance
The Buddha does what he can by pointing out the path to liberation the rest involves putting the path into practice a task that demands energy
This energy is to be applied to the cultivation of the mind which forms the focus of the entire path
The starting point is the defiled mind afflicted and deluded the goal is the liberated mind purified and illuminated by wisdom
What comes in between is the unremitting effort to transform the defiled mind into the liberated mind
The work of selfcultivation is not easy  there is no one who can do it for us but ourselves  but it is not impossible
The Buddha himself and his accomplished disciples provide the living proof that the task is not beyond our reach
They assure us too that anyone who follows the path can accomplish the same goal
But what is needed is effort the work of practice taken up with the determination I shall not give up my efforts until I have attained whatever is attainable by manly perseverance energy and endeavor
The nature of the mental process effects a division of right effort into four great endeavors
The unwholesome states are the defilements and the thoughts emotions and intentions derived from them whether breaking forth into action or remaining confined within
The wholesome states are states of mind untainted by defilements especially those conducing to deliverance
Each of the two kinds of mental states imposes a double task
The unwholesome side requires that the defilements lying dormant be prevented from erupting and that the active defilements already present be expelled
The wholesome side requires that the undeveloped liberating factors first be brought into being then persistently developed to the point of full maturity
Now we will examine each of these four divisions of right effort giving special attention to their most fertile field of application the cultivation of the mind through meditation
To prevent the arising of unarisen unwholesome states
Herein the disciple rouses his will to avoid the arising of evil unwholesome states that have not yet arisen and he makes effort stirs up his energy exerts his mind and strives
The first side of right effort aims at overcoming unwholesome states states of mind tainted by defilements
Insofar as they impede concentration the defilements are usually presented in a fivefold set called the five hindrances sensual desire ill will dullness and drowsiness restlessness and worry and doubt
They receive the name hindrances because they block the path to liberation they grow up and over the mind preventing calm and insight the primary instruments for progress
The first two hindrances sensual desire and ill will are the strongest of the set the most formidable barriers to meditative growth representing respectively the unwholesome roots of greed and aversion
The other three hindrances less toxic but still obstructive are offshoots of delusion usually in association with other defilements
Sensual desire is interpreted in two ways
Sometimes it is understood in a narrow sense as lust for the five strands of sense pleasure ie agreeable sights sounds smells tastes and touches sometimes a broader interpretation is given by which the term becomes inclusive of craving in all its modes whether for sense pleasures wealth power position fame or anything else it can settle upon
The second hindrance ill will is a synonym for aversion
It comprises hatred anger resentment repulsion of every shade whether directed towards other people towards oneself towards objects or towards situations
The third hindrance dullness and drowsiness is a compound of two factors linked together by their common feature of mental unwieldiness
One is dullness manifest as mental inertia the other is drowsiness seen in mental sinking heaviness of mind or excessive inclination to sleep
At the opposite extreme is the fourth hindrance restlessness and worry
This too is a compound with its two members linked by their common feature of disquietude
Restlessness is agitation or excitement which drives the mind from thought to thought with speed and frenzy worry is remorse over past mistakes and anxiety about their possible undesired consequences
The fifth hindrance doubt signifies a chronic indecisiveness and lack of resolution not the probing of critical intelligence an attitude encouraged by the Buddha but a persistent inability to commit oneself to the course of spiritual training due to lingering doubts concerning the Buddha his doctrine and his path
The first effort to be made regarding the hindrances is the effort to prevent the unarisen hindrances from arising this is also called the endeavor to restrain
The effort to hold the hindrances in check is imperative both at the start of meditative training and throughout the course of its development
For when the hindrances arise they disperse attention and darken the quality of awareness to the detriment of calm and clarity
The hindrances do not come from outside the mind but from within
They appear through the activation of certain tendencies constantly lying dormant in the deep recesses of the mental continuum awaiting the opportunity to surface
Generally what sparks the hindrances into activity is the input afforded by sense experience
The physical organism is equipped with five sense faculties each receptive to its own specific kind of data  the eye to forms the ear to sounds the nose to smells the tongue to tastes the body to tangibles
Sense objects continuously impinge on the senses which relay the information they receive to the mind where it is processed evaluated and accorded an appropriate response
But the mind can deal with the impressions it receives in different ways governed in the first place by the manner in which it attends to them
When the mind adverts to the incoming data carelessly with unwise consideration the sense objects tend to stir up unwholesome states
They do this either directly through their immediate impact or else indirectly by depositing memory traces which later may swell up as the objects of defiled thoughts images and fantasies
As a general rule the defilement that is activated corresponds to the object attractive objects provoke desire disagreeable objects provoke ill will and indeterminate objects provoke the defilements connected with delusion
Since an uncontrolled response to the sensory input stimulates the latent defilements what is evidently needed to prevent them from arising is control over the senses
Thus the Buddha teaches as the discipline for keeping the hindrances in check an exercise called the restraint of the sense faculties
When he perceives a form with the eye a sound with the ear an odor with the nose a taste with the tongue an impression with the body or an object with the mind he apprehends neither the sign nor the particulars
And he strives to ward off that through which evil and unwholesome states greed and sorrow would arise if he remained with unguarded senses and he watches over his senses restrains his senses
Restraint of the senses does not mean denial of the senses retreating into a total withdrawal from the sensory world
This is impossible and even if it could be achieved the real problem would still not be solved for the defilements lie in the mind not in the sense organs or objects
The key to sense control is indicated by the phrase not apprehending the sign or the particulars The sign is the object's general appearance insofar as this appearance is grasped as the basis for defiled thoughts the particulars are its less conspicuous features
If sense control is lacking the mind roams recklessly over the sense fields
First it grasps the sign which sets the defilements into motion then it explores the particulars which permits them to multiply and thrive
To restrain the senses requires that mindfulness and clear understanding be applied to the encounter with the sense fields
Sense consciousness occurs in a series as a sequence of momentary cognitive acts each having its own special task
The initial stages in the series occur as automatic functions first the mind adverts to the object then apprehends it then admits the percept examines it and identifies it
Immediately following the identification a space opens up in which there occurs a free evaluation of the object leading to the choice of a response
When mindfulness is absent the latent defilements pushing for an opportunity to emerge will motivate a wrong consideration
One will grasp the sign of the object explore its details and thereby give the defilements their opportunity on account of greed one will become fascinated by an agreeable object on account of aversion one will be repelled by a disagreeable object
But when one applies mindfulness to the sensory encounter one nips the cognitive process in the bud before it can evolve into the stages that stimulate the dormant taints
Mindfulness holds the hindrances in check by keeping the mind at the level of what is sensed
It rivets awareness on the given preventing the mind from embellishing the datum with ideas born of greed aversion and delusion
Then with this lucent awareness as a guide the mind can proceed to comprehend the object as it is without being led astray
To abandon the arisen unwholesome states
Herein the disciple rouses his will to overcome the evil unwholesome states that have already arisen and he makes effort stirs up his energy exerts his mind and strives
Despite the effort at sense control the defilements may still surface
They swell up from the depths of the mental continuum from the buried strata of past accumulations to congeal into unwholesome thoughts and emotions
When this happens a new kind of effort becomes necessary the effort to abandon arisen unwholesome states called for short the endeavor to abandon
He does not retain any thought of sensual lust ill will or harmfulness or any other evil and unwholesome states that may have arisen he abandons them dispels them destroys them causes them to disappear
Just as a skilled physician has different medicines for different ailments so the Buddha has different antidotes for the different hindrances some equally applicable to all some geared to a particular hindrance
In an important discourse the Buddha explains five techniques for expelling distracting thoughts
The first is to expel the defiled thought with a wholesome thought which is its exact opposite analogous to the way a carpenter might use a new peg to drive out an old one
For each of the five hindrances there is a specific remedy a line of meditation designed expressly to deflate it and destroy it
This remedy can be applied intermittently when a hindrance springs up and disrupts meditation on the primary subject or it can be taken as a primary subject itself used to counter a defilement repeatedly seen to be a persistent obstacle to one's practice
But for the antidote to become effective in the first role as a temporary expedient required by the upsurge of a hindrance it is best to gain some familiarity with it by making it a primary object at least for short periods
For desire a remedy of general application is the meditation on impermanence which knocks away the underlying prop of clinging the implicit assumption that the objects clung to are stable and durable
For desire in the specific form of sensual lust the most potent antidote is the contemplation of the unattractive nature of the body to be dealt with at greater length in the next chapter
Ill will meets its proper remedy in the meditation on lovingkindness which banishes all traces of hatred and anger through the methodical radiation of the altruistic wish that all beings be well and happy
The dispelling of dullness and drowsiness calls for a special effort to arouse energy for which several methods are suggested the visualization of a brilliant ball of light getting up and doing a period of brisk walking meditation reflection on death or simply making a firm determination to continue striving
Restlessness and worry are most effectively countered by turning the mind to a simple object that tends to calm it down the method usually recommended is mindfulness of breathing attention to the inandout flow of the breath
In the case of doubt the special remedy is investigation to make inquiries ask questions and study the teachings until the obscure points become clear
Whereas this first of the five methods for expelling the hindrances involves a onetoone alignment between a hindrance and its remedy the other four utilize general approaches
The second marshals the forces of shame and moral dread to abandon the unwanted thought one reflects on the thought as vile and ignoble or considers its undesirable consequences until an inner revulsion sets in which drives the thought away
The third method involves a deliberate diversion of attention
When an unwholesome thought arises and clamours to be noticed instead of indulging it one simply shuts it out by redirecting one's attention elsewhere as if closing one's eyes or looking away to avoid an unpleasant sight
The fourth method uses the opposite approach
Instead of turning away from the unwanted thought one confronts it directly as an object scrutinizes its features and investigates its source
When this is done the thought quiets down and eventually disappears
For an unwholesome thought is like a thief it only creates trouble when its operation is concealed but put under observation it becomes tame
The fifth method to be used only as a last resort is suppression  vigorously restraining the unwholesome thought with the power of the will in the way a strong man might throw a weaker man to the ground and keep him pinned there with his weight
By applying these five methods with skill and discretion the Buddha says one becomes a master of all the pathways of thought
One is no longer the subject of the mind but its master
Whatever thought one wants to think that one will think
Whatever thought one does not want to think that one will not think
Even if unwholesome thoughts occasionally arise one can dispel them immediately just as quickly as a redhot pan will turn to steam a few chance drops of water
To arouse unarisen wholesome states
Herein the disciple rouses his will to arouse wholesome states that have not yet arisen and he makes effort stirs up his energy exerts his mind and strives
Simultaneously with the removal of defilements right effort also imposes the task of cultivating wholesome states of mind
This involves two divisions the arousing of wholesome states not yet arisen and the maturation of wholesome states already arisen
The first of the two divisions is also known as the endeavor to develop
Though the wholesome states to be developed can be grouped in various ways  serenity and insight the four foundations of mindfulness the eight factors of the path etc
 the Buddha lays special stress on a set called the seven factors of enlightenment mindfulness investigation of phenomena energy rapture tranquillity concentration and equanimity
Thus he develops the factors of enlightenment based on solitude on detachment on cessation and ending in deliverance namely the enlightenment factors of mindfulness investigation of phenomena energy rapture tranquillity concentration and equanimity
The seven states are grouped together as enlightenment factors both because they lead to enlightenment and because they constitute enlightenment
In the preliminary stages of the path they prepare the way for the great realization in the end they remain as its components
The experience of enlightenment perfect and complete understanding is just these seven components working in unison to break all shackles and bring final release from sorrow
The way to enlightenment starts with mindfulness
Mindfulness clears the ground for insight into the nature of things by bringing to light phenomena in the now the present moment stripped of all subjective commentary interpretations and projections
Then when mindfulness has brought the bare phenomena into focus the factor of investigation steps in to search out their characteristics conditions and consequences
Whereas mindfulness is basically receptive investigation is an active factor which unflinchingly probes analyzes and dissects phenomena to uncover their fundamental structures
The work of investigation requires energy the third factor of enlightenment which mounts in three stages
The first inceptive energy shakes off lethargy and arouses initial enthusiasm
As the work of contemplation advances energy gathers momentum and enters the second stage perseverance wherein it propels the practice without slackening
Finally at the peak energy reaches the third stage invincibility where it drives contemplation forward leaving the hindrances powerless to stop it
As energy increases the fourth factor of enlightenment is quickened
This is rapture a pleasurable interest in the object
Rapture gradually builds up ascending to ecstatic heights waves of bliss run through the body the mind glows with joy fervor and confidence intensify
But these experiences as encouraging as they are still contain a flaw they create an excitation verging on restlessness
With further practice however rapture subsides and a tone of quietness sets in signalling the rise of the fifth factor tranquillity
Rapture remains present but it is now subdued and the work of contemplation proceeds with selfpossessed serenity
Tranquillity brings to ripeness concentration the sixth factor onepointed unification of mind
Then with the deepening of concentration the last enlightenment factor comes into dominance
This is equanimity inward poise and balance free from the two defects of excitement and inertia
When inertia prevails energy must be aroused when excitement prevails it is necessary to exercise restraint
But when both defects have been vanquished the practice can unfold evenly without need for concern
The mind of equanimity is compared to the driver of a chariot when the horses are moving at a steady pace he neither has to urge them forward nor to hold them back but can just sit comfortably and watch the scenery go by
Equanimity has the same onlooking quality
When the other factors are balanced the mind remains poised watching the play of phenomena
To maintain arisen wholesome states
Herein the disciple rouses his will to maintain the wholesome things that have already arisen and not to allow them to disappear but to bring them to growth to maturity and to the full perfection of development and he makes effort stirs up his energy exerts his mind and strives
This last of the four right efforts aims at maintaining the arisen wholesome factors and bringing them to maturity
Called the endeavor to maintain it is explained as the effort to keep firmly in the mind a favorable object of concentration that has arisen The work of guarding the object causes the seven enlightenment factors to gain stability and gradually increase in strength until they issue in the liberating realization
This marks the culmination of right effort the goal in which the countless individual acts of exertion finally reach fulfillment
The Buddha says that the Dhamma the ultimate truth of things is directly visible timeless calling out to be approached and seen
He says further that it is always available to us and that the place where it is to be realized is within oneself
The ultimate truth the Dhamma is not something mysterious and remote but the truth of our own experience
It can be reached only by understanding our experience by penetrating it right through to its foundations
This truth in order to become liberating truth has to be known directly
It is not enough merely to accept it on faith to believe it on the authority of books or a teacher or to think it out through deductions and inferences
It has to be known by insight grasped and absorbed by a kind of knowing which is also an immediate seeing
What brings the field of experience into focus and makes it accessible to insight is a mental faculty called in Pali sati usually translated as mindfulness Mindfulness is presence of mind attentiveness or awareness
Yet the kind of awareness involved in mindfulness differs profoundly from the kind of awareness at work in our usual mode of consciousness
All consciousness involves awareness in the sense of a knowing or experiencing of an object
But with the practice of mindfulness awareness is applied at a special pitch
The mind is deliberately kept at the level of bare attention a detached observation of what is happening within us and around us in the present moment
In the practice of right mindfulness the mind is trained to remain in the present open quiet and alert contemplating the present event
All judgments and interpretations have to be suspended or if they occur just registered and dropped
The task is simply to note whatever comes up just as it is occurring riding the changes of events in the way a surfer rides the waves on the sea
The whole process is a way of coming back into the present of standing in the here and now without slipping away without getting swept away by the tides of distracting thoughts
It might be assumed that we are always aware of the present but this is a mirage
Only seldom do we become aware of the present in the precise way required by the practice of mindfulness
In ordinary consciousness the mind begins a cognitive process with some impression given in the present but it does not stay with it
Instead it uses the immediate impression as a springboard for building blocks of mental constructs which remove it from the sheer facticity of the datum
The cognitive process is generally interpretative
The mind perceives its object free from conceptualization only briefly
Then immediately after grasping the initial impression it launches on a course of ideation by which it seeks to interpret the object to itself to make it intelligible in terms of its own categories and assumptions
To bring this about the mind posits concepts joins the concepts into constructs  sets of mutually corroborative concepts  then weaves the constructs together into complex interpretative schemes
In the end the original direct experience has been overrun by ideation and the presented object appears only dimly through dense layers of ideas and views like the moon through a layer of clouds
The Buddha calls this process of mental construction papañca elaboration embellishment or conceptual proliferation The elaborations block out the presentational immediacy of phenomena they let us know the object only at a distance not as it really is
But the elaborations do not only screen cognition they also serve as a basis for projections
The deluded mind cloaked in ignorance projects its own internal constructs outwardly ascribing them to the object as if they really belonged to it
As a result what we know as the final object of cognition what we use as the basis for our values plans and actions is a patchwork product not the original article
To be sure the product is not wholly illusion not sheer fantasy
It takes whatis given in immediate experience as its groundwork and raw material but along with this it includes something else the embellishments fabricated by the mind
The springs for this process of fabrication hidden from view are the latent defilements
The defilements create the embellishments project them outwardly and use them as hooks for coming to the surface where they cause further distortion
To correct the erroneous notions is the task of wisdom but for wisdom to discharge its work effectively it needs direct access to the object as it is in itself uncluttered by the conceptual elaborations
The task of right mindfulness is to clear up the cognitive field
Mindfulness brings to light experience in its pure immediacy
It reveals the object as it is before it has been plastered over with conceptual paint overlaid with interpretations
To practice mindfulness is thus a matter not so much of doing but of undoing not thinking not judging not associating not planning not imagining not wishing
All these doings of ours are modes of interference ways the mind manipulates experience and tries to establish its dominance
Mindfulness undoes the knots and tangles of these doings by simply noting
It does nothing but note watching each occasion of experience as it arises stands and passes away
In the watching there is no room for clinging no compulsion to saddle things with our desires
There is only a sustained contemplation of experience in its bare immediacy carefully and precisely and persistently
Mindfulness exercises a powerful grounding function
It anchors the mind securely in the present so it does not float away into the past and future with their memories regrets fears and hopes
The mind without mindfulness is sometimes compared to a pumpkin the mind established in mindfulness to a stone
A pumpkin placed on the surface of a pond soon floats away and always remains on the water's surface
But a stone does not float away it stays where it is put and at once sinks into the water until it reaches bottom
Similarly when mindfulness is strong the mind stays with its object and penetrates its characteristics deeply
It does not wander and merely skim the surface as the mind destitute of mindfulness does
Mindfulness facilitates the achievement of both serenity and insight
It can lead to either deep concentration or wisdom depending on the mode in which it is applied
Merely a slight shift in the mode of application can spell the difference between the course the contemplative process takes whether it descends to deeper levels of inner calm culminating in the stages of absorption the jhanas or whether instead it strips away the veils of delusion to arrive at penetrating insight
To lead to the stages of serenity the primary chore of mindfulness is to keep the mind on the object free from straying
Mindfulness serves as the guard charged with the responsibility of making sure that the mind does not slip away from the object to lose itself in random undirected thoughts
It also keeps watch over the factors stirring in the mind catching the hindrances beneath their camouflages and expelling them before they can cause harm
To lead to insight and the realizations of wisdom mindfulness is exercised in a more differentiated manner
Its task in this phase of practice is to observe to note to discern phenomena with utmost precision until their fundamental characteristics are brought to light
Right mindfulness is cultivated through a practice called the four foundations of mindfulness the mindful contemplation of four objective spheres the body feelings states of mind and phenomena
As the Buddha explains
And what monks is right mindfulness
Herein a monk dwells contemplating the body in the body ardent clearly comprehending and mindful having put away covetousness and grief concerning the world
He dwells contemplating feelings in feelings states of mind in states of mind phenomena in phenomena ardent clearly comprehending and mindful having put away covetousness and grief concerning the world
The Buddha says that the four foundations of mindfulness form the only way that leads to the attainment of purity to the overcoming of sorrow and lamentation to the end of pain and grief to the entering upon the right path and the realization of Nibbana They are called the only way not for the purpose of setting forth a narrow dogmatism but to indicate that the attainment of liberation can only issue from the penetrating contemplation of the field of experience undertaken in the practice of right mindfulness
Of the four applications of mindfulness the contemplation of the body is concerned with the material side of existence the other three are concerned principally with the mental side
The completion of the practice requires all four contemplations
Though no fixed order is laid down in which they are to be taken up the body is generally taken first as the basic sphere of contemplation the others come into view later when mindfulness has gained in strength and clarity
Limitations of space do not allow for a complete explanation of all four foundations
Here we have to settle for a brief synopsis
The Buddha begins his exposition of the body with contemplation of the mindfulness of breathing
Though not required as a starting point for meditation in actual practice mindfulness of breathing usually serves as the root meditation subject the foundation for the entire course of contemplation
It would be a mistake however to consider this subject merely an exercise for neophytes
By itself mindfulness of breathing can lead to all the stages of the path culminating in full awakening
In fact it was this meditation subject that the Buddha used on the night of his own enlightenment
He also reverted to it throughout the years during his solitary retreats and constantly recommended it to the monks praising it as peaceful and sublime an unadulterated blissful abiding which banishes at once and stills evil unwholesome thoughts as soon as they arise
Mindfulness of breathing can function so effectively as a subject of meditation because it works with a process that is always available to us the process of respiration
What it does to turn this process into a basis for meditation is simply to bring it into the range of awareness by making the breath an object of observation
The meditation requires no special intellectual sophistication only awareness of the breath
One merely breathes naturally through the nostrils keeping the breath in mind at the contact point around the nostrils or upper lip where the sensation of breath can be felt as the air moves in and out
There should be no attempt to control the breath or to force it into predetermined rhythms only a mindful contemplation of the natural process of breathing in and out
The awareness of breath cuts through the complexities of discursive thinking rescues us from pointless wandering in the labyrinth of vain imaginings and grounds us solidly in the present
For whenever we become aware of breathing really aware of it we can be aware of it only in the present never in the past or the future
The Buddha's exposition of mindfulness of breathing involves four basic steps
The first two require that a long inhalation or exhalation be noted as it occurs and that a short inhalation or exhalation be noted as it occurs
One simply observes the breath moving in and out observing it as closely as possible noting whether the breath is long or short
As mindfulness grows sharper the breath can be followed through the entire course of its movement from the beginning of an inhalation through its intermediary stages to its end then from the beginning of an exhalation through its intermediary stages to its end
This third step is called clearly perceiving the entire body The fourth step calming the bodily function involves a progressive quieting down of the breath and its associated bodily functions until they become extremely fine and subtle
Beyond these four basic steps lie more advanced practices which direct mindfulness of breathing towards deep concentration and insight
Another practice in the contemplation of the body which extends meditation outwards from the confines of a single fixed position is mindfulness of the postures
The body can assume four basic postures  walking standing sitting and lying down  and a variety of other positions marking the change from one posture to another
Mindfulness of the postures focuses full attention on the body in whatever position it assumes when walking one is aware of walking when standing one is aware of standing when sitting one is aware of sitting when lying down one is aware of lying down when changing postures one is aware of changing postures
The contemplation of the postures illuminates the impersonal nature of the body
It reveals that the body is not a self or the belonging of a self but merely a configuration of living matter subject to the directing influence of volition
The next exercise carries the extension of mindfulness a step further
This exercise called mindfulness and clear comprehension adds to the bare awareness an element of understanding
When performing any action one performs it with full awareness or clear comprehension
Going and coming looking ahead and looking aside bending and stretching dressing eating drinking urinating defecating falling asleep waking up speaking remaining silent  all become occasions for the progress of meditation when done with clear comprehension
In the commentaries clear comprehension is explained as fourfold understanding the purpose of the action ie recognizing its aim and determining whether that aim accords with the Dhamma understanding suitability ie knowing the most efficient means to achieve one's aim understanding the range of meditation ie keeping the mind constantly in a meditative frame even when engaged in action and understanding without delusion ie seeing the action as an impersonal process devoid of a controlling egoentity
This last aspect will be explored more thoroughly in the last chapter on the development of wisdom
The next two sections on mindfulness of the body present analytical contemplations intended to expose the body's real nature
One of these is the meditation on the body's unattractiveness already touched on in connection with right effort the other the analysis of the body into the four primary elements
The first the meditation on unattractiveness is designed to counter infatuation with the body especially in its form of sexual desire
The Buddha teaches that the sexual drive is a manifestation of craving thus a cause of dukkha that has to be reduced and extricated as a precondition for bringing dukkha to an end
The meditation aims at weakening sexual desire by depriving the sexual urge of its cognitive underpinning the perception of the body as sensually alluring
Sensual desire rises and falls together with this perception
It springs up because we view the body as attractive it declines when this perception of beauty is removed
The perception of bodily attractiveness in turn lasts only so long as the body is looked at superficially grasped in terms of selected impressions
To counter that perception we have to refuse to stop with these impressions but proceed to inspect the body at a deeper level with a probing scrutiny grounded in dispassion
Precisely this is what is undertaken in the meditation on unattractiveness which turns back the tide of sensuality by pulling away its perceptual prop
The meditation takes one's own body as object since for a neophyte to start off with the body of another especially a member of the opposite sex might fail to accomplish the desired result
Using visualization as an aid one mentally dissects the body into its components and investigates them one by one bringing their repulsive nature to light
The texts mention thirtytwo parts headhairs bodyhairs nails teeth skin flesh sinews bones marrow kidneys heart liver diaphragm spleen lungs large intestines small intestines stomach contents excrement brain bile phlegm pus blood sweat fat tears grease snot spittle sinovial fluid and urine
The repulsiveness of the parts implies the same for the whole the body seen closeup is truly unattractive its beautiful appearance a mirage
But the aim of this meditation must not be misapprehended
The aim is not to produce aversion and disgust but detachment to extinguish the fire of lust by removing its fuel
The other analytical contemplation deals with the body in a different way
This meditation called the analysis into elements sets out to counter our innate tendency to identify with the body by exposing the body's essentially impersonal nature
The means it employs as its name indicates is the mental dissection of the body into the four primary elements referred to by the archaic names earth water fire and air but actually signifying the four principal behavioral modes of matter solidity fluidity heat and oscillation
The solid element is seen most clearly in the body's solid parts  the organs tissues and bones the fluid element in the bodily fluids the heat element in the body's temperature the oscillation element in the respiratory process
The break with the identification of the body as I or my self is effected by a widening of perspective after the elements have come into view
Having analyzed the body into the elements one then considers that all four elements the chief aspects of bodily existence are essentially identical with the chief aspects of external matter with which the body is in constant interchange
When one vividly realizes this through prolonged meditation one ceases to identify with the body ceases to cling to it
One sees that the body is nothing more than a particular configuration of changing material processes which support a stream of changing mental processes
There is nothing here that can be considered a truly existent self nothing that can provide a substantial basis for the sense of personal identity
The last exercise in mindfulness of the body is a series of cemetery meditations contemplations of the body's disintegration after death which may be performed either imaginatively with the aid of pictures or through direct confrontation with a corpse
By any of these means one obtains a clear mental image of a decomposing body then applies the process to one's own body considering This body now so full of life has the same nature and is subject to the same fate
It cannot escape death cannot escape disintegration but must eventually die and decompose Again the purpose of this meditation should not be misunderstood
The aim is not to indulge in a morbid fascination with death and corpses but to sunder our egoistic clinging to existence with a contemplation sufficiently powerful to break its hold
The clinging to existence subsists through the implicit assumption of permanence
In the sight of a corpse we meet the teacher who proclaims unambiguously Everything formed is impermanent
The next foundation of mindfulness is feeling
The word feeling is used here not in the sense of emotion but in the narrower sense of the affective tone or hedonic quality of experience
This may be of three kinds yielding three principal types of feeling pleasant feeling painful feeling and neutral feeling
The Buddha teaches that feeling is an inseparable concomitant of consciousness since every act of knowing is colored by some affective tone
Thus feeling is present at every moment of experience it may be strong or weak clear or indistinct but some feeling must accompany the cognition
Feeling arises in dependence on a mental event called contact
Contact marks the coming together of consciousness with the object via a sense faculty it is the factor by virtue of which consciousness touches the object presenting itself to the mind through the sense organ
Thus there are six kinds of contact distinguished by the six sense faculties  eyecontact earcontact nosecontact tonguecontact bodycontact and mindcontact  and six kinds of feeling distinguished by the contact from which they spring
Feeling acquires special importance as an object of contemplation because it is feeling that usually triggers the latent defilements into activity
The feelings may not be clearly registered but in subtle ways they nourish and sustain the dispositions to unwholesome states
Thus when a pleasant feeling arises we fall under the influence of the defilement greed and cling to it
When a painful feeling occurs we respond with displeasure hate and fear which are aspects of aversion
And when a neutral feeling occurs we generally do not notice it or let it lull us into a false sense of security  states of mind governed by delusion
From this it can be seen that each of the root defilements is conditioned by a particular kind of feeling greed by pleasant feeling aversion by painful feeling delusion by neutral feeling
But the link between feelings and the defilements is not a necessary one
Pleasure does not always have to lead to greed pain to aversion neutral feeling to delusion
The tie between them can be snapped and one essential means for snapping it is mindfulness
Feeling will stir up a defilement only when it is not noticed when it is indulged rather than observed
By turning it into an object of observation mindfulness defuses the feeling so that it cannot provoke an unwholesome response
Then instead of relating to the feeling by way of habit through attachment repulsion or apathy we relate by way of contemplation using the feeling as a springboard for understanding the nature of experience
In the early stages the contemplation of feeling involves attending to the arisen feelings noting their distinctive qualities pleasant painful neutral
The feeling is noted without identifying with it without taking it to be I or mine or something happening to me Awareness is kept at the level of bare attention one watches each feeling that arises seeing it as merely a feeling a bare mental event shorn of all subjective references all pointers to an ego
The task is simply to note the feeling's quality its tone of pleasure pain or neutrality
But as practice advances as one goes on noting each feeling letting it go and noting the next the focus of attention shifts from the qualities of feelings to the process of feeling itself
The process reveals a ceaseless flux of feelings arising and dissolving succeeding one another without a halt
Within the process there is nothing lasting
Feeling itself is only a stream of events occasions of feeling flashing into being moment by moment dissolving as soon as they arise
Thus begins the insight into impermanence which as it evolves overturns the three unwholesome roots
There is no greed for pleasant feelings no aversion for painful feelings no delusion over neutral feelings
All are seen as merely fleeting and substanceless events devoid of any true enjoyment or basis for involvement
With this foundation of mindfulness we turn from a particular mental factor feeling to the general state of mind to which that factor belongs
To understand what is entailed by this contemplation it is helpful to look at the Buddhist conception of the mind
Usually we think of the mind as an enduring faculty remaining identical with itself through the succession of experiences
Though experience changes the mind which undergoes the changing experience seems to remain the same perhaps modified in certain ways but still retaining its identity
However in the Buddha's teaching the notion of a permanent mental organ is rejected
The mind is regarded not as a lasting subject of thought feeling and volition but as a sequence of momentary mental acts each distinct and discrete their connections with one another causal rather than substantial
A single act of consciousness is called a citta which we shall render a state of mind Each citta consists of many components the chief of which is consciousness itself the basic experiencing of the object consciousness is also called citta the name for the whole being given to its principal part
Along with consciousness every citta contains a set of concomitants called cetasikas mental factors
These include feeling perception volition the emotions etc in short all the mental functions except the primary knowing of the object which is citta or consciousness
Since consciousness in itself is just a bare experiencing of an object it cannot be differentiated through its own nature but only by way of its associated factors the cetasikas
The cetasikas color the citta and give it its distinctive character thus when we want to pinpoint the citta as an object of contemplation we have to do so by using the cetasikas as indicators
In his exposition of the contemplation of the state of mind the Buddha mentions by reference to cetasikas sixteen kinds of citta to be noted the mind with lust the mind without lust the mind with aversion the mind without aversion the mind with delusion the mind without delusion the cramped mind the scattered mind the developed mind the undeveloped mind the surpassable mind the unsurpassable mind the concentrated mind the unconcentrated mind the freed mind the unfreed mind
For practical purposes it is sufficient at the start to focus solely on the first six states noting whether the mind is associated with any of the unwholesome roots or free from them
When a particular citta is present it is contemplated merely as a citta a state of mind
It is not identified with as I or mine not taken as a self or as something belonging to a self
Whether it is a pure state of mind or a defiled state a lofty state or a low one there should be no elation or dejection only a clear recognition of the state
The state is simply noted then allowed to pass without clinging to the desired ones or resenting the undesired ones
As contemplation deepens the contents of the mind become increasingly rarefied
Irrelevant flights of thought imagination and emotion subside mindfulness becomes clearer the mind remains intently aware watching its own process of becoming
At times there might appear to be a persisting observer behind the process but with continued practice even this apparent observer disappears
The mind itself  the seemingly solid stable mind  dissolves into a stream of cittas flashing in and out of being moment by moment coming from nowhere and going nowhere yet continuing in sequence without pause
In the context of the fourth foundation of mindfulness the multivalent word dhamma has two interconnected meanings as the account in the sutta shows
One meaning is cetasikas the mental factors which are now attended to in their own right apart from their role as coloring the state of mind as was done in the previous contemplation
The other meaning is the elements of actuality the ultimate constituents of experience as structured in the Buddha's teachingTo convey both senses we render dhamma as phenomena for lack of a better alternative
But when we do so this should not be taken to imply the existence of some noumenon or substance behind the phenomenaThe point of the Buddha's teaching of anatta egolessness is that the basic constituents of actuality are bare phenomena occurring without any noumenal support
The sutta section on the contemplation of phenomena is divided into five subsections each devoted to a different set of phenomena the five hindrances the five aggregates the six inner and outer sense bases the seven factors of enlightenment and the Four Noble Truths
Among these the five hindrances and the seven enlightenment factors are dhamma in the narrower sense of mental factors the others are dhamma in the broader sense of constituents of actuality
In the present chapter we shall deal briefly only with the two groups that may be regarded as dhamma in the sense of mental factors
We already touched on both of these in relation to right effort now we shall consider them in specific connection with the practice of right mindfulness
We shall discuss the other types of dhamma  the five aggregates and the six senses  in the final chapter in relation to the development of wisdom
The five hindrances and seven factors of enlightenment require special attention because they are the principal impediments and aids to liberation
The hindrances  sensual desire ill will dullness and drowsiness restlessness and worry and doubt  generally become manifest in an early stage of practice soon after the initial expectations and gross disturbances subside and the subtle tendencies find the opportunity to surface
Whenever one of the hindrances crops up its presence should be noted then when it fades away a note should be made of its disappearance
To ensure that the hindrances are kept under control an element of comprehension is needed we have to understand how the hindrances arise how they can be removed and how they can be prevented from arising in the future
A similar mode of contemplation is to be applied to the seven factors of enlightenment mindfulness investigation energy rapture tranquillity concentration and equanimity
When any one of these factors arises its presence should be noted
Then after noting its presence one has to investigate to discover how it arises and how it can be matured
When they first spring up the enlightenment factors are weak but with consistent cultivation they accumulate strength
Mindfulness initiates the contemplative process
When it becomes wellestablished it arouses investigation the probing quality of intelligence
Investigation in turn calls forth energy energy gives rise to rapture rapture leads to tranquillity tranquillity to onepointed concentration and concentration to equanimity
Thus the whole evolving course of practice leading to enlightenment begins with mindfulness which remains throughout as the regulating power ensuring that the mind is clear cognizant and balanced
The eighth factor of the path is right concentration in Pali samma samadhi
Concentration represents an intensification of a mental factor present in every state of consciousness
This factor onepointedness of mind has the function of unifying the other mental factors in the task of cognition
It is the factor responsible for the individuating aspect of consciousness ensuring that every citta or act of mind remains centered on its object
At any given moment the mind must be cognizant of something  a sight a sound a smell a taste a touch or a mental object
The factor of onepointedness unifies the mind and its other concomitants in the task of cognizing the object while it simultaneously exercises the function of centering all the constituents of the cognitive act on the object
Onepointedness of mind explains the fact that in any act of consciousness there is a central point of focus towards which the entire objective datum points from its outer peripheries to its inner nucleus
However samadhi is only a particular kind of onepointedness it is not equivalent to onepointedness in its entirety
A gourmet sitting down to a meal an assassin about to slay his victim a soldier on the battlefield  these all act with a concentrated mind but their concentration cannot be characterized as samadhi
Samadhi is exclusively wholesome onepointedness the concentration in a wholesome state of mind
Even then its range is still narrower it does not signify every form of wholesome concentration but only the intensified concentration that results from a deliberate attempt to raise the mind to a higher more purified level of awareness
The commentaries define samadhi as the centering of the mind and mental factors rightly and evenly on an object
Samadhi as wholesome concentration collects together the ordinarily dispersed and dissipated stream of mental states to induce an inner unification
The two salient features of a concentrated mind are unbroken attentiveness to an object and the consequent tranquillity of the mental functions qualities which distinguish it from the unconcentrated mind
The mind untrained in concentration moves in a scattered manner which the Buddha compares to the flapping about of a fish taken from the water and thrown onto dry land
It cannot stay fixed but rushes from idea to idea from thought to thought without inner control
Such a distracted mind is also a deluded mind
Overwhelmed by worries and concerns a constant prey to the defilements it sees things only in fragments distorted by the ripples of random thoughts
But the mind that has been trained in concentration in contrast can remain focused on its object without distraction
This freedom from distraction further induces a softness and serenity which make the mind an effective instrument for penetration
Like a lake unruffled by any breeze the concentrated mind is a faithful reflector that mirrors whatever is placed before it exactly as it is
Concentration can be developed through either of two methods  either as the goal of a system of practice directed expressly towards the attainment of deep concentration at the level of absorption or as the incidental accompaniment of the path intended to generate insight
The former method is called the development of serenity the second the development of insight
Both paths share certain preliminary requirements
For both moral discipline must be purified the various impediments must be severed the meditator must seek out suitable instruction and must resort to a dwelling conducive to practice
Once these preliminaries have been dispensed with the meditator on the path of serenity has to obtain an object of meditation something to be used as a focal point for developing concentration
If the meditator has a qualified teacher the teacher will probably assign him an object judged to be appropriate for his temperament
If he doesn't have a teacher he will have to select an object himself perhaps after some experimentation
The meditation manuals collect the subjects of serenity meditation into a set of forty called places of work since they are the places where the meditator does the work of practice
The forty may be listed as follows
The kasinas are devices representing certain primordial qualities
Four represent the primary elements  the earth water fire and air kasinas four represent colors  the blue yellow red and white kasinas the other two are the light and the space kasinas
Each kasina is a concrete object representative of the universal quality it signifies
Thus an earth kasina would be a circular disk filled with clay
To develop concentration on the earth kasina the meditator sets the disk in front of him fixes his gaze on it and contemplates earth earth A similar method is used for the other kasinas with appropriate changes to fit the case
The ten unattractive objects are corpses in different stages of decomposition
This subject appears similar to the contemplation of bodily decay in the mindfulness of the body and in fact in olden times the cremation ground was recommended as the most appropriate place for both
But the two meditations differ in emphasis
In the mindfulness exercise stress falls on the application of reflective thought the sight of the decaying corpse serving as a stimulus for consideration of one's own eventual death and disintegration
In this exercise the use of reflective thought is discouraged
The stress instead falls on onepointed mental fixation on the object the less thought the better
The ten recollections form a miscellaneous collection
The first three are devotional meditations on the qualities of the Triple Gem  the Buddha the Dhamma and the Sangha they use as their basis standard formulas that have come down in the Suttas
The next three recollections also rely on ancient formulas the meditations on morality generosity and the potential for divinelike qualities in oneself
Then come mindfulness of death the contemplation of the unattractive nature of the body mindfulness of breathing and lastly the recollection of peace a discursive meditation on Nibbana
The four sublime states or divine abodes are the outwardly directed social attitudes  lovingkindness compassion sympathetic joy and equanimity  developed into universal radiations which are gradually extended in range until they encompass all living beings
The four immaterial states are the objective bases for certain deep levels of absorption the base of infinite space the base of infinite consciousness the base of nothingness and the base of neitherperceptionnornonperception
These become accessible as objects only to those who are already adept in concentration
The one perception is the perception of the repulsiveness of food a discursive topic intended to reduce attachment to the pleasures of the palate
The one analysis is the contemplation of the body in terms of the four primary elements already discussed in the chapter on right mindfulness
When such a variety of meditation subjects is presented the aspiring meditator without a teacher might be perplexed as to which to choose
The manuals divide the forty subjects according to their suitability for different personality types
Thus the unattractive objects and the contemplation of the parts of the body are judged to be most suitable for a lustful type the meditation on lovingkindness to be best for a hating type the meditation on the qualities of the Triple Gem to be most effective for a devotional type etc
But for practical purposes the beginner in meditation can generally be advised to start with a simple subject that helps reduce discursive thinking
Mental distraction caused by restlessness and scattered thoughts is a common problem faced by persons of all different character types thus a meditator of any temperament can benefit from a subject which promotes a slowing down and stilling of the thought process
The subject generally recommended for its effectiveness in clearing the mind of stray thoughts is mindfulness of breathing which can therefore be suggested as the subject most suitable for beginners as well as veterans seeking a direct approach to deep concentration
Once the mind settles down and one's thought patterns become easier to notice one might then make use of other subjects to deal with special problems that arise the meditation on lovingkindness may be used to counteract anger and ill will mindfulness of the bodily parts to weaken sensual lust the recollection of the Buddha to inspire faith and devotion the meditation on death to arouse a sense of urgency
The ability to select the subject appropriate to the situation requires skill but this skill evolves through practice often through simple trialanderror experimentation
Concentration is not attained all at once but develops in stages
To enable our exposition to cover all the stages of concentration we will consider the case of a meditator who follows the entire path of serenity meditation from start to finish and who will make much faster progress than the typical meditator is likely to make
After receiving his meditation subject from a teacher or selecting it on his own the meditator retires to a quiet place
There he assumes the correct meditation posture  the legs crossed comfortably the upper part of the body held straight and erect hands placed one above the other on the lap the head kept steady the mouth and eyes closed the breath flowing naturally and regularly through the nostrils
He then focuses his mind on the object and tries to keep it there fixed and alert
If the mind strays he notices this quickly catches it and brings it back gently but firmly to the object doing this over and over as often as is necessary
This initial stage is called preliminary concentration and the object the preliminary sign
Once the initial excitement subsides and the mind begins to settle into the practice the five hindrances are likely to arise bubbling up from the depths
Sometimes they appear as thoughts sometimes as images sometimes as obsessive emotions surges of desire anger and resentment heaviness of mind agitation doubts
The hindrances pose a formidable barrier but with patience and sustained effort they can be overcome
To conquer them the meditator will have to be adroit
At times when a particular hindrance becomes strong he may have to lay aside his primary subject of meditation and take up another subject expressly opposed to the hindrance
At other times he will have to persist with his primary subject despite the bumps along the road bringing his mind back to it again and again
As he goes on striving along the path of concentration his exertion activates five mental factors which come to his aid
These factors are intermittently present in ordinary undirected consciousness but there they lack a unifying bond and thus do not play any special role
However when activated by the work of meditation these five factors pick up power link up with one another and steer the mind towards samadhi which they will govern as the jhana factors the factors of absorption
Stated in their usual order the five are initial application of mind sustained application of mind rapture happiness and onepointedness
Initial application of mind does the work of directing the mind to the object
It takes the mind lifts it up and drives it into the object the way one drives a nail through a block of wood
This done sustained application of mind anchors the mind on the object keeping it there through its function of examination
To clarify the difference between these two factors initial application is compared to the striking of a bell sustained application to the bell's reverberations
Rapture the third factor is the delight and joy that accompany a favorable interest in the object while happiness the fourth factor is the pleasant feeling that accompanies successful concentration
Since rapture and happiness share similar qualities they tend to be confused with each other but the two are not identical
The difference between them is illustrated by comparing rapture to the joy of a weary desertfarer who sees an oasis in the distance happiness to his pleasure when drinking from the pond and resting in the shade
The fifth and final factor of absorption is onepointedness which has the pivotal function of unifying the mind on the object
When concentration is developed these five factors spring up and counteract the five hindrances
Each absorption factor opposes a particular hindrance
Initial application of mind through its work of lifting the mind up to the object counters dullness and drowsiness
Sustained application by anchoring the mind on the object drives away doubt
Rapture shuts out ill will happiness excludes restlessness and worry and onepointedness counters sensual desire the most alluring inducement to distraction
Thus with the strengthening of the absorption factors the hindrances fade out and subside
They are not yet eradicated  eradication can only be effected by wisdom the third division of the path  but they have been reduced to a state of quiescence where they cannot disrupt the forward movement of concentration
At the same time that the hindrances are being overpowered by the jhana factors inwardly on the side of the object too certain changes are taking place
The original object of concentration the preliminary sign is a gross physical object in the case of a kasina it is a disk representing the chosen element or color in the case of mindfulness of breathing the touch sensation of the breath etc
But with the strengthening of concentration the original object gives rise to another object called the learning sign
For a kasina this will be a mental image of the disk seen as clearly in the mind as the original object was with the eyes for the breath it will be a reflex image arisen from the touch sensation of the air currents moving around the nostrils
When the learning sign appears the meditator leaves off the preliminary sign and fixes his attention on the new object
In due time still another object will emerge out of the learning sign
This object called the counterpart sign is a purified mental image many times brighter and clearer than the learning sign
The learning sign is compared to the moon seen behind a cloud the counterpart sign to the moon freed from the cloud
Simultaneously with the appearance of the counterpart sign the five absorption factors suppress the five hindrances and the mind enters the stage of concentration called upacarasamadhi access concentration Here in access concentration the mind is drawing close to absorption
It has entered the neighbourhood of absorption but more work is still needed for it to become fully immersed in the object the defining mark of absorption
With further practice the factors of concentration gain in strength and bring the mind to absorption
Like access concentration absorption takes the counterpart sign as object
The two stages of concentration are differentiated neither by the absence of the hindrances nor by the counterpart sign as object these are common to both
What differentiates them is the strength of the jhana factors
In access concentration the jhana factors are present but they lack strength and steadiness
Thus the mind in this stage is compared to a child who has just learned to walk he takes a few steps falls down gets up walks some more and again falls down
But the mind in absorption is like a man who wants to walk he just gets up and walks straight ahead without hesitation
Concentration in the stage of absorption is divided into eight levels each marked by greater depth purity and subtlety than its predecessor
The first four form a set called the four jhanas a word best left untranslated for lack of a suitable equivalent though it can be loosely rendered meditative absorption The second four also form a set the four immaterial states
The eight have to be attained in progressive order the achievement of any later level being dependent on the mastery of the immediately preceding level
The four jhanas make up the usual textual definition of right concentration
Thus the Buddha says
And what monks is right concentration
Herein secluded from sense pleasures secluded from unwholesome states a monk enters and dwells in the first jhana which is accompanied by initial and sustained application of mind and filled with rapture and happiness born of seclusion
Then with the subsiding of initial and sustained application of mind by gaining inner confidence and mental unification he enters and dwells in the second jhana which is free from initial and sustained application but is filled with rapture and happiness born of concentration
With the fading out of rapture he dwells in equanimity mindful and clearly comprehending and he experiences in his own person that bliss of which the noble ones say Happily lives he who is equanimous and mindful  thus he enters and dwells in the third jhana
With the abandoning of pleasure and pain and with the previous disappearance of joy and grief he enters and dwells in the fourth jhana which has neitherpleasurenorpain and purity of mindfulness due to equanimity
This monks is right concentration
The jhanas are distinguished by way of their component factors
The first jhana is constituted by the original set of five absorption factors initial application sustained application rapture happiness and onepointedness
After attaining the first jhana the meditator is advised to master it
On the one hand he should not fall into complacency over his achievement and neglect sustained practice on the other he should not become overconfident and rush ahead to attain the next jhana
To master the jhana he should enter it repeatedly and perfect his skill in it until he can attain it remain in it emerge from it and review it without any trouble or difficulty
After mastering the first jhana the meditator then considers that his attainment has certain defects
Though the jhana is certainly far superior to ordinary sense consciousness more peaceful and blissful it still stands close to sense consciousness and is not far removed from the hindrances
Moreover two of its factors initial application and sustained application appear in time to be rather coarse not as refined as the other factors
Then the meditator renews his practice of concentration intent on overcoming initial and sustained application
When his faculties mature these two factors subside and he enters the second jhana
This jhana contains only three component factors rapture happiness and onepointedness
It also contains a multiplicity of other constituents the most prominent of which is confidence of mind
In the second jhana the mind becomes more tranquil and more thoroughly unified but when mastered even this state seems gross as it includes rapture an exhilarating factor that inclines to excitation
So the meditator sets out again on his course of training this time resolved on overcoming rapture
When rapture fades out he enters the third jhana
Here there are only two absorption factors happiness and onepointedness while some other auxiliary states come into ascendency most notably mindfulness clear comprehension and equanimity
But still the meditator sees this attainment is defective in that it contains the feeling of happiness which is gross compared to neutral feeling feeling that is neither pleasant not painful
Thus he strives to get beyond even the sublime happiness of the third jhana
When he succeeds he enters the fourth jhana which is defined by two factors  onepointedness and neutral feeling  and has a special purity of mindfulness due to the high level of equanimity
Beyond the four jhanas lie the four immaterial states levels of absorption in which the mind transcends even the subtlest perception of visualized images still sometimes persisting in the jhanas
The immaterial states are attained not by refining mental factors as are the jhanas but by refining objects by replacing a relatively gross object with a subtler one
The four attainments are named after their respective objects the base of infinite space the base of infinite consciousness the base of nothingness and the base of neitherperceptionnornonperception
These states represent levels of concentration so subtle and remote as to elude clear verbal explanation
The last of the four stands at the apex of mental concentration it is the absolute maximum degree of unification possible for consciousness
But even so these absorptions reached by the path of serenity meditation as exalted as they are still lack the wisdom of insight and so are not yet sufficient for gaining deliverance
The kinds of concentration discussed so far arise by fixing the mind upon a single object to the exclusion of other objects
But apart from these there is another kind of concentration which does not depend upon restricting the range of awareness
This is called momentary concentration
To develop momentary concentration the meditator does not deliberately attempt to exclude the multiplicity of phenomena from his field of attention
Instead he simply directs mindfulness to the changing states of mind and body noting any phenomenon that presents itself the task is to maintain a continuous awareness of whatever enters the range of perception clinging to nothing
As he goes on with his noting concentration becomes stronger moment after moment until it becomes established onepointedly on the constantly changing stream of events
Despite the change in the object the mental unification remains steady and in time acquires a force capable of suppressing the hindrances to a degree equal to that of access concentration
This fluid mobile concentration is developed by the practice of the four foundations of mindfulness taken up along the path of insight when sufficiently strong it issues in the breakthrough to the last stage of the path the arising of wisdom
Though right concentration claims the last place among the factors of the Noble Eightfold Path concentration itself does not mark the path's culmination
The attainment of concentration makes the mind still and steady unifies its concomitants opens vast vistas of bliss serenity and power
But by itself it does not suffice to reach the highest accomplishment release from the bonds of suffering
To reach the end of suffering demands that the Eightfold Path be turned into an instrument of discovery that it be used to generate the insights unveiling the ultimate truth of things
This requires the combined contributions of all eight factors and thus a new mobilization of right view and right intention
Up to the present point these first two path factors have performed only a preliminary function
Now they have to be taken up again and raised to a higher level
Right view is to become a direct seeing into the real nature of phenomena previously grasped only conceptually right intention to become a true renunciation of defilements born out of deep understanding
Before we turn to the development of wisdom it will be helpful to inquire why concentration is not adequate to the attainment of liberation
Concentration does not suffice to bring liberation because it fails to touch the defilements at their fundamental level
The Buddha teaches that the defilements are stratified into three layers the stage of latent tendency the stage of manifestation and the stage of transgression
The most deeply grounded is the level of latent tendency where a defilement merely lies dormant without displaying any activity
The second level is the stage of manifestation where a defilement through the impact of some stimulus surges up in the form of unwholesome thoughts emotions and volitions
Then at the third level the defilement passes beyond a purely mental manifestation to motivate some unwholesome action of body or speech
Hence this level is called the stage of transgression
The three divisions of the Noble Eightfold Path provide the check against this threefold layering of the defilements
The first the training in moral discipline restrains unwholesome bodily and verbal activity and thus prevents defilements from reaching the stage of transgression
The training in concentration provides the safeguard against the stage of manifestation
It removes already manifest defilements and protects the mind from their continued influx
But even though concentration may be pursued to the depths of full absorption it cannot touch the basic source of affliction  the latent tendencies lying dormant in the mental continuum
Against these concentration is powerless since to root them out calls for more than mental calm
What it calls for beyond the composure and serenity of the unified mind is wisdom a penetrating vision of phenomena in their fundamental mode of being
Wisdom alone can cut off the latent tendencies at their root because the most fundamental member of the set the one which nurtures the others and holds them in place is ignorance and wisdom is the remedy for ignorance
Though verbally a negative unknowing ignorance is not a factual negative a mere privation of right knowledge
It is rather an insidious and volatile mental factor incessantly at work inserting itself into every compartment of our inner life
It distorts cognition dominates volition and determines the entire tone of our existence
As the Buddha says The element of ignorance is indeed a powerful element
At the cognitive level which is its most basic sphere of operation ignorance infiltrates our perceptions thoughts and views so that we come to misconstrue our experience overlaying it with multiple strata of delusions
The most important of these delusions are three the delusions of seeing permanence in the impermanent of seeing satisfaction in the unsatisfactory and of seeing a self in the selfless
Thus we take ourselves and our world to be solid stable enduring entities despite the ubiquitous reminders that everything is subject to change and destruction
We assume we have an innate right to pleasure and direct our efforts to increasing and intensifying our enjoyment with an anticipatory fervor undaunted by repeated encounters with pain disappointment and frustration
And we perceive ourselves as selfcontained egos clinging to the various ideas and images we form of ourselves as the irrefragable truth of our identity
Whereas ignorance obscures the true nature of things wisdom removes the veils of distortion enabling us to see phenomena in their fundamental mode of being with the vivacity of direct perception
The training in wisdom centers on the development of insight a deep and comprehensive seeing into the nature of existence which fathoms the truth of our being in the only sphere where it is directly accessible to us namely in our own experience
Normally we are immersed in our experience identified with it so completely that we do not comprehend it
We live it but fail to understand its nature
Due to this blindness experience comes to be misconstrued worked upon by the delusions of permanence pleasure and self
Of these cognitive distortions the most deeply grounded and resistant is the delusion of self the idea that at the core of our being there exists a truly established I with which we are essentially identified
This notion of self the Buddha teaches is an error a mere presupposition lacking a real referent
Yet though a mere presupposition the idea of self is not inconsequential
To the contrary it entails consequences that can be calamitous
Because we make the view of self the lookout point from which we survey the world our minds divide everything up into the dualities of I and not I what is mine and what is not mine Then trapped in these dichotomies we fall victim to the defilements they breed the urges to grasp and destroy and finally to the suffering that inevitably follows
To free ourselves from all defilements and suffering the illusion of selfhood that sustains them has to be dispelled exploded by the realization of selflessness
Precisely this is the task set for the development of wisdom
The first step along the path of development is an analytical one
In order to uproot the view of self the field of experience has to be laid out in certain sets of factors which are then methodically investigated to ascertain that none of them singly or in combination can be taken as a self
This analytical treatment of experience so characteristic of the higher reaches of Buddhist philosophical psychology is not intended to suggest that experience like a watch or car can be reduced to an accidental conglomeration of separable parts
Experience does have an irreducible unity but this unity is functional rather than substantial it does not require the postulate of a unifying self separate from the factors retaining its identity as a constant amidst the ceaseless flux
The method of analysis applied most often is that of the five aggregates of clinging material form feeling perception mental formations and consciousness
Material form constitutes the material side of existence the bodily organism with its sense faculties and the outer objects of cognition
The other four aggregates constitute the mental side
Feeling provides the affective tone perception the factor of noting and identifying the mental formations the volitional and emotive elements and consciousness the basic awareness essential to the whole occasion of experience
The analysis by way of the five aggregates paves the way for an attempt to see experience solely in terms of its constituting factors without slipping in implicit references to an unfindable self
To gain this perspective requires the development of intensive mindfulness now applied to the fourth foundation the contemplation of the factors of existence
The disciple will dwell contemplating the five aggregates their arising and passing
The disciple dwells in contemplation of phenomena namely of the five aggregates of clinging
He knows what material form is how it arises how it passes away knows what feeling is how it arises how it passes away knows what perception is how it arises how it passes away knows what mental formations are how they arise how they pass away knows what consciousness is how it arises how it passes away
Or the disciple may instead base his contemplation on the six internal and external spheres of sense experience that is the six sense faculties and their corresponding objects also taking note of the fetters or defilements that arise from such sensory contacts
The disciple dwells in contemplation of phenomena namely of the six internal and external sense bases
He knows the eye and forms the ear and sounds the nose and odors the tongue and tastes the body and tangibles the mind and mental objects and he knows as well the fetter that arises in dependence on them
He understands how the unarisen fetter arises how the arisen fetter is abandoned and how the abandoned fetter does not arise again in the future
The view of self is further attenuated by examining the factors of existence not analytically but in terms of their relational structure
Inspection reveals that the aggregates exist solely in dependence on conditions
Nothing in the set enjoys the absolute selfsufficiency of being attributed to the assumed I Whatever factors in the bodymind complex be looked at they are found to be dependently arisen tied to the vast net of events extending beyond themselves temporally and spatially
The body for example has arisen through the union of sperm and egg and subsists in dependence on food water and air
Feeling perception and mental formations occur in dependence on the body with its sense faculties
They require an object the corresponding consciousness and the contact of the object with the consciousness through the media of the sense faculties
Consciousness in its turn depends on the sentient organism and the entire assemblage of coarisen mental factors
This whole process of becoming moreover has arisen from the previous lives in this particular chain of existences and inherit all the accumulated kamma of the earlier existences
Thus nothing possesses a selfsufficient mode of being
All conditioned phenomena exist relationally contingent and dependent on other things
The above two steps  the factorial analysis and the discernment of relations  help cut away the intellectual adherence to the idea of self but they lack sufficient power to destroy the ingrained clinging to the ego sustained by erroneous perception
To uproot this subtle form of egoclinging requires a counteractive perception direct insight into the empty coreless nature of phenomena
Such an insight is generated by contemplating the factors of existence in terms of their three universal marks  impermanence unsatisfactoriness and selflessness
Generally the first of the three marks to be discerned is impermanence which at the level of insight does not mean merely that everything eventually comes to an end
At this level it means something deeper and more pervasive namely that conditioned phenomena are in constant process happenings which break up and perish almost as soon as they arise
The stable objects appearing to the senses reveal themselves to be strings of momentary formations the person posited by common sense dissolves into a current made up of two intertwining streams  a stream of material events the aggregate of material form and a stream of mental events the other four aggregates
When impermanence is seen insight into the other two marks closely follows
Since the aggregates are constantly breaking up we cannot pin our hopes on them for any lasting satisfaction
Whatever expectations we lay on them are bound to be dashed to pieces by their inevitable change
Thus when seen with insight they are dukkha suffering in the deepest sense
Then as the aggregates are impermanent and unsatisfactory they cannot be taken as self
If they were self or the belongings of a self we would be able to control them and bend them to our will to make them everlasting sources of bliss
But far from being able to exercise such mastery we find them to be grounds of pain and disappointment
Since they cannot be subjected to control these very factors of our being are anatta not a self not the belongings of a self just empty ownerless phenomena occurring in dependence on conditions
When the course of insight practice is entered the eight path factors become charged with an intensity previously unknown
They gain in force and fuse together into the unity of a single cohesive path heading towards the goal
In the practice of insight all eight factors and three trainings coexist each is there supporting all the others each makes its own unique contribution to the work
The factors of moral discipline hold the tendencies to transgression in check with such care that even the thought of unethical conduct does not arise
The factors of the concentration group keep the mind firmly fixed upon the stream of phenomena contemplating whatever arises with impeccable precision free from forgetfulness and distraction
Right view as the wisdom of insight grows continually sharper and deeper right intention shows itself in a detachment and steadiness of purpose bringing an unruffled poise to the entire process of contemplation
Insight meditation takes as its objective sphere the conditioned formations comprised in the five aggregates
Its task is to uncover their essential characteristics the three marks of impermanence unsatisfactoriness and selflessness
Because it still deals with the world of conditioned events the Eightfold Path in the stage of insight is called the mundane path
This designation in no way implies that the path of insight is concerned with mundane goals with achievements falling in the range of samsara
It aspires to transcendence it leads to liberation but its objective domain of contemplation still lies within the conditioned world
However this mundane contemplation of the conditioned serves as the vehicle for reaching the unconditioned for attaining the supramundane
When insight meditation reaches its climax when it fully comprehends the impermanence unsatisfactoriness and selflessness of everything formed the mind breaks through the conditioned and realizes the unconditioned Nibbana
It sees Nibbana with direct vision makes it an object of immediate realization
The breakthrough to the unconditioned is achieved by a type of consciousness or mental event called the supramundane path
The supramundane path occurs in four stages four supramundane paths each marking a deeper level of realization and issuing in a fuller degree of liberation the fourth and last in complete liberation
The four paths can be achieved in close proximity to one another  for those with extraordinarily sharp faculties even in the same sitting  or they can be spread out over time even over several lifetimes
The supramundane paths share in common the penetration of the Four Noble Truths
They understand them not conceptually but intuitively
They grasp them through vision seeing them with selfvalidating certainty to be the invariable truths of existence
The vision of the truths which they present is complete at one moment
The four truths are not understood sequentially as in the stage of reflection when thought is the instrument of understanding
They are seen simultaneously to see one truth with the path is to see them all
As the path penetrates the four truths the mind exercises four simultaneous functions one regarding each truth
It fully comprehends the truth of suffering seeing all conditioned existence as stamped with the mark of unsatisfactoriness
At the same time it abandons craving cuts through the mass of egotism and desire that repeatedly gives birth to suffering
Again the mind realizes cessation the deathless element Nibbana now directly present to the inner eye
And fourthly the mind develops the Noble Eightfold Path whose eight factors spring up endowed with tremendous power attained to supramundane stature right view as the direct seeing of Nibbana right intention as the mind's application to Nibbana the triad of ethical factors as the checks on moral transgression right effort as the energy in the pathconsciousness right mindfulness as the factor of awareness and right concentration as the mind's onepointed focus
This ability of the mind to perform four functions at the same moment is compared to a candle's ability to simultaneously burn the wick consume the wax dispel darkness and give light
The supramundane paths have the special task of eradicating the defilements
Prior to the attainment of the paths in the stages of concentration and even insight meditation the defilements were not cut off but were only debilitated checked and suppressed by the training of the higher mental faculties
Beneath the surface they continued to linger in the form of latent tendencies
But when the supramundane paths are reached the work of eradication begins
Insofar as they bind us to the round of becoming the defilements are classified into a set of ten fetters as follows personality view doubt clinging to rules and rituals sensual desire aversion desire for finematerial existence desire for immaterial existence conceit restlessness and ignorance
The four supramundane paths each eliminate a certain layer of defilements
The first the path of streamentry cuts off the first three fetters the coarsest of the set eliminates them so they can never arise again
Personality view the view of a truly existent self in the five aggregates is cut off since one sees the selfless nature of all phenomena
Doubt is eliminated because one has grasped the truth proclaimed by the Buddha seen it for oneself and so can never again hang back due to uncertainty
And clinging to rules and rites is removed since one knows that deliverance can be won only through the practice of the Eightfold Path not through rigid moralism or ceremonial observances
The path is followed immediately by another state of supramundane consciousness known as the fruit which results from the path's work of cutting off defilements
Each path is followed by its own fruit wherein for a few moments the mind enjoys the blissful peace of Nibbana before descending again to the level of mundane consciousness
The first fruit is the fruit of streamentry and a person who has gone through the experience of this fruit becomes a streamenterer
He has entered the stream of the Dhamma carrying him to final deliverance
He is bound for liberation and can no longer fall back into the ways of an unenlightened worldling
He still has certain defilements remaining in his mental makeup and it may take him as long as seven more lives to arrive at the final goal but he has acquired the essential realization needed to reach it and there is no way he can fall away
An enthusiastic practitioner with sharp faculties after reaching streamentry does not relax his striving but puts forth energy to complete the entire path as swiftly as possible
He resumes his practice of insight contemplation passes through the ascending stages of insightknowledge and in time reaches the second path the path of the oncereturner
This supramundane path does not totally eradicate any of the fetters but it attenuates the roots of greed aversion and delusion
Following the path the meditator experiences its fruit then emerges as a oncereturner who will return to this world at most only one more time before attaining full liberation
But our practitioner again takes up the task of contemplation
At the next stage of supramundane realization he attains the third path the path of the nonreturner with which he cuts off the two fetters of sensual desire and ill will
From that point on he can never again fall into the grip of any desire for sense pleasure and can never be aroused to anger aversion or discontent
As a nonreturner he will not return to the human state of existence in any future life
If he does not reach the last path in this very life then after death he will be reborn in a higher sphere in the finematerial world and there reach deliverance
But our meditator again puts forth effort develops insight and at its climax enters the fourth path the path of arahatship
With this path he cuts off the five remaining fetters  desire for finematerial existence and desire for immaterial existence conceit restlessness and ignorance
The first is the desire for rebirth into the celestial planes made accessible by the four jhanas the planes commonly subsumed under the name the Brahmaworld The second is the desire for rebirth into the four immaterial planes made accessible by the achievement of the four immaterial attainments
Conceit is not the coarse type of pride to which we become disposed through an overestimation of our virtues and talents but the subtle residue of the notion of an ego which subsists even after conceptually explicit views of self have been eradicated
The texts refer to this type of conceit as the conceit I am
Restlessness is the subtle excitement which persists in any mind not yet completely enlightened and ignorance is the fundamental cognitive obscuration which prevents full understanding of the Four Noble Truths
Although the grosser grades of ignorance have been scoured from the mind by the wisdom faculty in the first three paths a thin veil of ignorance overlays the truths even in the nonreturner
The path of arahatship strips away this last veil of ignorance and with it all the residual mental defilements
This path issues in perfect comprehension of the Four Noble Truths
It fully fathoms the truth of suffering eradicates the craving from which suffering springs realizes with complete clarity the unconditioned element Nibbana as the cessation of suffering and consummates the development of the eight factors of the Noble Eightfold Path
With the attainment of the fourth path and fruit the disciple emerges as an arahant one who in this very life has been liberated from all bonds
The arahant has walked the Noble Eightfold Path to its end and lives in the assurance stated so often in the formula from the Pali canon Destroyed is birth the holy life has been lived what had to be done has been done there is no coming back to any state of being The arahant is no longer a practitioner of the path but its living embodiment
Having developed the eight factors of the path to their consummation the Liberated One lives in the enjoyment of their fruits enlightenment and final deliverance
This completes our survey of the Noble Eightfold Path the way to deliverance from suffering taught by the Buddha
The higher reaches of the path may seem remote from us in our present position the demands of practice may appear difficult to fulfill
But even if the heights of realization are now distant all that we need to reach them lies just beneath our feet
The eight factors of the path are always accessible to us they are mental components which can be established in the mind simply through determination and effort
We have to begin by straightening out our views and clarifying our intentions
Then we have to purify our conduct  our speech action and livelihood
Taking these measures as our foundation we have to apply ourselves with energy and mindfulness to the cultivation of concentration and insight
The rest is a matter of gradual practice and gradual progress without expecting quick results
For some progress may be rapid for others it may be slow but the rate at which progress occurs should not cause elation or discouragement
Liberation is the inevitable fruit of the path and is bound to blossom forth when there is steady and persistent practice
The only requirements for reaching the final goal are two to start and to continue
If these requirements are met there is no doubt the goal will be attained
This is the Dhamma the undeviating law

All Wheel publications and Bodhi Leaves referred to above are published by the Buddhist Publication Society
Bhikkhu Bodhi is a Buddhist monk of American nationality born in New York City in
After completing a doctorate in philosophy at the Claremont Graduate School he came to Sri Lanka for the purpose of entering the Sangha
He received novice ordination in and higher ordination in both under the eminent scholarmonk Ven
Balangoda Ananda Maitreya with whom he studied Pali and Dhamma
He is the author of several works on Theravada Buddhism including four translations of major Pali suttas along with their commentaries
Since he has been the Editor for the Buddhist Publication Society and since its President
The Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creeds
Founded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topics
Its publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddha's discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practice
These works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first arose
Translator's note Chao Khun Nararatana prior to his ordination was a member of King Rama VI's personal staff and was so trusted by the king that he was given the rank of chao phraya  the highest Thai rank of conferred nobility  when he was only
After the king's death in he ordained at Wat Thepsirin in Bangkok and remained a monk until passing away from cancer in
From the year until his death he never left the wat compound
Even though the wat was one of the most lavishly endowed temples in Bangkok Chao Khun Nararatana lived a life of exemplary austerity and was well known for his meditative powers
He left no personal students however and very few writings
The following piece is a synopsis of some very basic teachings he would give to lay visitors
These teachings are especially suitable for young people
English phrases given here in parentheses were in English in the original
To receive the sympathy and compassion of others depends on a combination of our own good qualities such as energy industry perseverance strength resilience together with a heart of sympathy and compassion toward others without conceit or pride
This is what will cause those around us to feel sympathy compassion and love toward us and to want to give us help
People with gentle manners  polite and kind  are bound to attract the love of those who meet them along with their cooperation and help
This is personal magnetism
For this reason we should try to maintain the qualities mentioned above
They will become a means of helping us attain all of our objectives both now and in the future
Don't fear
Keep yourself pure and nothing will be able to harm you
Remember If you want the sympathy of others send thoughts of sympathy in their direction and you will receive their sympathy in return  this is a law of mental dynamics  and all the success you wish for will without a doubt come your way
Discouraged is a word we shouldn't use and a thing we shouldn't allow in our hearts
Let it go and get it out
If you see it arising let it go
Don't take it in
If you are careless and let it sneak into the heart then as soon as you are aware that discouragement has snuck in you must immediately get it out
Don't let it feed on the heart
Otherwise it will become a habit and you will become weak and debilitated upset over every trifling mistake
Discouragement is an enemy an obstacle
It makes the mind restless and the nerves disordered
This in turn causes the body to become disordered  diseased and restless  as well
The brain becomes dull and murky
Discouragement is a bad habit a block to clear intelligence and discernment
We must practice putting the mind back into shape
Before we do anything while we're doing it and after it's done we have to practice keeping the mind cheerful and bright with a constant sense of wellbeing
This will help us to gain strength of body and strength of mind and to enjoy living
The mind will blossom and whatever we have to learn we will understand and remember with ease just as a blossoming flower opens itself to welcome drops of dew and fresh air
The Lord Buddha taught N'atthi santi param sukham No other pleasure is greater than peace
What this means is that there are other pleasures such as the pleasure of watching a play or a movie mixing with society having a spouse the pleasure of gaining wealth status and praise
These things are actual pleasures  but they all contain hidden stress they all require continual contriving adjustment and repair  which is where they differ from the pleasure that comes from peace a pleasure that is cool and tranquil without any hidden pain without any need for a great deal of contriving  a pleasure that is easily attained right here in our own body and mind
We can give rise to it while sitting alone in a quiet place or while surrounded by society as long as we have a sense of how to make a separation inclining the heart toward the pleasure of peace so that while the body may be involved in turmoil the turmoil doesn't reach into the heart
Even when we are seriously ill with pain racking the entire body if we have a sense of how to put the mind in the pleasure of peace the pain won't be able to disturb the mind
And once the mind is calm  it can calm the body and cure its pain at the same time experiencing the pleasure of peace  and there is no greater pleasure
The Lord Buddha taught us to practice in three ways
When we see these truths the mind becomes strong resilient stable and resolute unaffected by events  because we have seen the truth with our own discernment that such things are undependable and unstable that they have to change deteriorate and disband that they don't lie under our power
Don't waste your strength of mind trying to force them
Keep the mind free and stable at all times unaffected by events  and this will keep the mind firmly established in the pleasure of peace
The mind will be free and gain power  mind power  which we can use to make all our duties and affairs succeed in accordance with our goals
It takes a peaceful mind to support a peaceful body and a peaceful body to support a peaceful mind and both a peaceful mind and a peaceful body to attain all the success that you wish
Our mistakes are our best teachers
We should be grateful to ourselves for our mistakes and take cheer in the fact that we have met with a special counselor our mistakes in line with the saying Once burned is twice forewarned We have to act on our own and make our own mistakes
These are our best teachers and our best lessons so that we will remember and be careful not to repeat them
We can make a fresh start mindful and uncomplacent
Our past mistakes are a thing of the past but our special counselors are still with us ready to whisper their warnings at every instant Be careful
Don't be complacent
Don't repeat that error again
Think carefully and you'll notice that all scientific researchers as well as all outstanding teachers of the Dhamma have without exception overcome the obstacle of their own mistakes countless times
In avoiding mistakes the important point is composure
If we have composure guarding our thoughts words and deeds at every moment we won't make any mistakes at all
The mistakes we make are due to lack of composure
We're forgetful absentminded heedless complacent exuberant or deluded  and thus we make mistakes
Remember the maxim Keep your composure as a protective shield and you'll do bravely in the field
Every form of life  human animal even plant life  survives through struggle in line with the saying Life is struggle At whatever moment we can no longer keep up the struggle we have to die
So as long as we keep our composure then even when death comes only the body dies  just as with the life of the Lord Buddha and the arahants They had full composure with every mental moment so that they never made mistakes
That was how they reached deathlessness the state of immortality
Thus their death was called parinibbana the disbanding and extinguishing of nothing more than the physical and mental phenomena termed the five aggregates body feeling perception mental processes and consciousness
Thus we should develop composure and selfawareness
Once we are done we should use mindfulness to check back and consider if anything is defective or if everything is in proper order
If anything is defective then immediately make corrections so as to be perfect the next time around
If everything is already in order keep trying to have things in even better order until reaching the ultimate
It's through the efficacy of the Triple Training  virtue concentration and discernment  that the enemy  defilement in its gross intermediate and subtle forms  can be overcome
The gross forms of defilement that transgress in the area of word and deed can be overcome through virtue
The intermediate forms of defilement that arise in the heart  liking and disliking deluded love and deluded hatred  can be overcome through concentration
The subtle forms of defilement  misunderstandings misperceptions and misconceptions concerning the true nature of natural processes  can be overcome through discernment
A person who studies and practices fully and completely in line with the Triple Training  virtue concentration and discernment  is sure to gain release from all suffering and stress without a doubt
Thus we should be interested earnest and intent on studying and practicing in line with the Triple Training at all times
The jasmine is agreed to be the most fragrant of all flowers and the purest white
The life of human beings is like a play
Try to be the hero or heroine with the best reputation just like the jasmine
Don't be the villain
And remember that the jasmine blooms fully only for two or three days and then withers away
So make yourself your best
Make your life as long as it lasts the most fragrant like the jasmine just beginning to bloom
Choose to do only the good
Choose to do only the good
A warning to prepare yourself for the future conduct of your life is the best substitute for a blessing and the most reasonable
If you do good then even if you don't receive blessings you'll have to do well
If you do evil then no matter what blessings can be contrived they can't make you do well
To do evil is like tossing a rock in the water It will have to sink immediately
No one no matter how charismatic can come and charm or plead with the rock to float back up to the surface
If you do evil you will have to sink spoiling your dignity your character and your reputation like a heavy rock sunk down into the mud
To do good is like light oil When you pour it on water it is bound to float as an iridescence over the surface
To do good adds to your dignity and to your reputation
People will be sure to praise and respect you to exalt you like the oil that floats over water
Even if you should have enemies intent on hating you reviling you to make you sink they won't have any effect and will simply fall victim to their own efforts
So make up your mind to be courageous in doing only the good without fear or apprehension for any obstacle whatsoever
The person who trusts in the Triple Gem the person with true happiness the person who prospers achieving his or her desired goals is the person who does only the good
Ajaan Khamdee was born into a farming family in Khon Kaen province in northeastern Thailand
At the age of he ordained at the local temple in line with Thai custom but was dissatisfied with the type of practice customary at village temples
As a result in he reordained in the Dhammayut sect and in the following year became a student of Ajaan Singh Khantiyagamo a senior disciple of Ajaan Mun
Taking up the life of a wandering monk he sought out quiet places in various parts of northeastern Thailand until coming to Tham Phaa Puu in Loei province near the Laotian border in
Finding it an ideal place to practice he stayed there for most of the remainder of his life moving down to the foot of the hill below the cave when he became too old to negotiate the climb
Wellknown as a teacher of strong character and gentle temperament he attracted a large following of students both lay and ordained
By the time of his death a sizable monastery had grown up around him at the foot of Grandfather Cliff
The following passages have been excerpted from talks printed in a book distributed at his funeral in
There are three sorts of Dhamma the Dhamma of theory the Dhamma of practice and the Dhamma of attainment
The Dhamma of theory refers to the teachings of the Buddha the discourses the discipline the Abhidhamma all sections of the Pali canon
This sort of Dhamma is everyone's common property
As for practice and attainment they're the individual property of those who do them
For example Ven
Moggallana's practice was his own practice
His attainment of the paths and fruitions leading to nibbana was his own attainment
The same holds true for Ven
Sariputta and each of the noble disciples all the way down to all of us practicing here
The practice and attainments of each person are that person's very own
It's like your own land and fields
They belong to you they're not common property
The Buddha set out the Dhamma of theory for each of us to practice
When we practice it it becomes our own
If we follow the precepts they become our own precepts our own virtues
If we practice concentration it becomes our own concentration
If we attain jhana or any of the paths and fruitions leading to nibbana they become our own attainments
So understand this point and practice in line with it
Knowledge comes from the practice  from listening intently pondering what we've heard and then making the effort to let go of our evil behavior and do only what's right and good
These things are called the sources of discernment
If we don't give rise to the sources of discernment within us we'll have to be forever foolish
In practicing the Dhamma there have to be causes
If there are no causes there are no results
If the causes are good the results will be good
If the causes are bad the results will be bad
This is like things outside
Take fruit for example
Fruit has to come from a tree or a plant
If there's no tree or plant there's no fruit
When orchard owners are interested in the flowers or fruit of their trees they focus on tending to the roots and trunks of the trees watering them fertilizing them cutting away weeds and protecting them from anything that will pose a danger to them
When they take good care of the trees in this way the flowers and fruits will come of their own accord
It's the same in practicing the Dhamma
The Buddha taught us to take good care of what we think say and do
If our thoughts words and deeds are good then whatever we receive in life will have to be good
If our thoughts words and deeds are bad then whatever we get will all be bad
If we get a husband he'll be a bad husband
If we get a wife she'll be a bad wife
If we get children they'll be bad children
If we get wealth it'll be bad wealth
Our problem is that we like good results but don't like creating good causes
There are three things that people generally want in the world
 beauty of the various parts of the body along with a beautiful complexion
 intelligence that's quick and sharp
For these three things to come as results they have to depend on causes
 Beauty comes from observing the precepts and keeping control over your anger
Even when anger arises in the mind you don't let it come out in your words
People who have laid this sort of groundwork are reborn with wellproportioned bodies and beautiful complexions
 Intelligence comes from practicing meditation and associating with wise teachers
People who have laid this sort of groundwork are reborn discerning and smart
To summarize If we take good care of our thoughts words and deeds we'll meet with good things in life
If we take poor care of our thoughts words and deeds we'll meet with miserable things to the day we die
The affairs of the Dhamma aren't all that different from the affairs of the world
Take wealth for example
External wealth  your possessions your wealth your status  tends to get lost because of external dangers
Internal wealth  your inner goodness and skillful attitudes  tends to get lost because of internal dangers
External wealth is subject to three kinds of danger danger from flooding danger from fire and danger from thieves
If there weren't these three kinds of danger we wouldn't have to spend so much time looking after our external wealth
We could leave our belongings lying around anywhere at all
Once we have wealth and we hold to it as our own we have to look after it and put it in safe keeping
Those with a lot of wealth have to deposit it in banks simply to keep it safe because they can't look after it all on their own
The same holds true with the crops we plant in our fields and orchards
We have to look after them because they're subject to dangers
Floods can damage them people can steal them animals can break in and eat them
If we don't look after them our wealth and belongings will be lost
In the same way we have to look after our internal wealth our inner goodness and skillful attitudes
If we don't keep looking after these qualities once we've developed them they can disappear through the power of our greed anger and delusion
These three things are our enemies
They have a great deal of power and influence over all people born into this world
Whether we're farmers merchants government officials or whatever we all lie under the power of greed anger and delusion
These three qualities can put knowledgeable people in the dark and can turn smart people into fools so that they act in ways that are mistaken and wrong
This is why the Buddha taught us to be careful to restrain ourselves from these evil influences so that they don't destroy our inner goodness and skillful attitudes so that they don't destroy our knowledge and intelligence
He taught us to look after our minds so that we can be on the lookout for greed and anger which arise out of delusion
He taught us to be very wary of these things
You can't trust that whatever comes into the mind is always you or yours
This is why we have to train the mind to make up for whatever good qualities it lacks the same as when people study traditional medicine learning about the component parts of the body and all its elements so that when illness arises from a lack or an imbalance in the elements they can find the right medicine to make up the lack
So you have to ponder the wealth of your heart to see what it lacks
Is it lacking in conviction
Persistence
Is mindfulness weak
Is it lacking in concentration so that it's distracted and obsessed with its preoccupations
Is it lacking in discernment of what's right and wrong
Then make up the lack
To strengthen our conviction our teachers advise us to trust in the principle of action and the results of our actions
They've taught us about actions that are skillful and unskillful so that we'll recognize what's right and wrong and our minds will be inclined to trust our good actions
Actually right and wrong lawful and unlawful are easy to see
We've got the eyes to see and the ears to hear
Even though we haven't studied the law we can observe what's right and wrong and keep ourselves from breaking the law  because there are people who have provided us with examples of what happens when they do wrong
This way we can choose which way is the good way and which way is not
If we choose the good way it's called associating with wise people
If we choose a way that's not good that's called associating with evil people and fools
To develop our conviction in the principle of kamma we have to observe causes and their results
People who have done good things experience ease in body and mind as a result
People who have done evil have no peace of mind
Even when they lie down they can't rest easily
Thieves for example have to hide out in the jungle in order to avoid the authorities
So we can see that those who act in good ways can live comfortably with an easy conscience
People who act in shoddy ways meet with suffering
When we reflect in this way we can observe which people or groups we can take as examples for our own behavior
Everyone has to learn from example
Boxers for instance have to have trainers
Even evil people have people they've taken as their examples
There are examples for everything good or bad
So watch observe and reflect for yourself
Greed anger and delusion are more savage than anything else in the world more savage than ferocious spirits fierce tigers or vicious snakes
There's nothing at all more savage than greed anger and delusion
They're savage in that greed can make you do savage things to yourself anger can make you hurt yourself delusion can make you harm yourself
You can get into all kinds of trouble because of delusion
I've spent my life  from my youth to my old age  wandering as an ascetic climbing mountains and hills entering forests and jungles and yet I still have yet to see a tiger eat anyone alive
I've heard reports but I've never seen it with my own eyes
I have yet to see a snake kill anyone or a fierce spirit possess anyone and cause that person to die
What I have seen is that the people of this world are suffering not from being eaten by tigers or bitten by snakes or killed by elephants but from their own greed anger and delusion
Whatever may be making them suffer greed anger and delusion are the things that destroy them
This is why the Buddha taught that fools destroy themselves as they would destroy others
They destroy themselves by acting in evil and corrupt ways as we see all around us
They're born as human beings just like everyone else but their behavior isn't like that of other human beings
So we have to be extremely careful about greed anger and delusion
They can take clearseeing people and put them in the dark
Their influence you know lies over and above everyone in the world  except for arahants and the other seven stages of noble disciples
Even among the other noble disciples those who are just streamwinners or oncereturners are still involved with these things still fooled by these things
The fact that they've attained the Dhamma eye simply means that they've come at least somewhat to recognize these things for what they are
If you really want to be at your ease you have to become a nonreturner or an arahant
The pleasure that comes from sensual objects has both its uses and its drawbacks
Feelings perceptions thoughtfabrications and consciousness also have their uses
The only exception is anger it has no use at all
It's hot and fiery
Nobody likes it
When other people are angry at us we don't like it
When we're angry at other people they don't like it either
And yet we still let ourselves get deluded into being attached to our anger  which shows that we're still runofthemill people
Sensual defilements  such as greed anger and delusion  are like fire
Sensual objects  sights sounds smells tastes tactile sensations  are trash and kindling that provide fuel for fire
Normally if there's no fuel fire won't flare up
If there's only a little fuel the fire flares up only a little
If there's a lot of fuel the fire flares up in a big way  and the heat of the fire has to be great too
When we're sitting near a fire and suffering from its heat can we blame the heat on the fuel
Actually the heat is the heat of the fire
The nature of the fuel on its own isn't hot at all isn't harmful at all
The harm comes from the fire  because the nature of fire is that it's hot
The same point holds true for sensual defilements and sensual objects
Can we blame our sufferings on sights sounds smells tastes and tactile sensations on the things that we want
The Buddha teaches us that the heart is what turns these things into suffering in the same way that fire turns fuel into something hot
So we should look for the source of our suffering inside ourselves
This is why the noble disciples can see sights hear sounds etc without experiencing any suffering because they've put out their own fires of passion aversion and delusion
These inner fires are the things that burn us with their heat that make us suffer
It's not the case that sights sounds smells tastes and tactile sensations burn us and make us suffer
We ourselves are the fires that are constantly burning ourselves
Actually our own mind is what creates suffering and stress
You can see this by observing arahants when they have knowledge and discernment taking good care of their minds they experience no suffering  because they don't pin their hopes on anything at all
When we meet up with sights tastes smells whatever we suffer because our hearts have craving desires thirsts likes and dislikes for those things
This is why the noble disciples are disenchanted with the world
Normally runofthemill people want to find happiness what's good in life through greed anger and delusion
From this we can see that the attitudes of noble disciples and the attitudes of runofthemill people are far far apart
If you practice generosity and observe the precepts but don't practice concentration you're like a person who has food for his journey who's strong ablebodied  but blind he won't be able to journey all the way to nibbana
Hair of the head hair of the body nails teeth skin these are called the five meditation themes
They were taught by the Buddha himself there's no reason to doubt this
We should contemplate these themes
If other meditation themes were better than these why didn't the Buddha tell preceptors to teach them  instead of these five  to newly ordained monks
Preceptors have to teach newly ordained monks these five themes before they teach them any other themes
So we should contemplate these themes
We can't neglect them
To begin with you can use them as a verbal repetition
But when your mindfulness and alertness are good you can contemplate them even as you walk around and do other things
You don't have to repeat the words in your mind
When you start out with the mental repetition you can say the Pali word kesa or simply think hair of the head The same holds true for loma hair of the body nakha nails danta teeth and taco skin
But don't say all five at once
Choose whichever one you like
Or you can try them one by one for seven days each
When you notice which one fits with your propensities you can continue focusing on that one indefinitely
It's as if you have five medicines to choose from
You can try each of them to see which one is right for your particular disease
When you think about the Buddha's reasons for formulating these five meditation themes you can see that it's because these five things are where people are most deluded
When we contemplate them as meditation themes it's a direct technique for curing delusion
Once we see these five things for what they truly are our delusions will loosen their grip
When we fall in love with other people or start hating them it's because these five things appear to us
If we were to strip away these five things there would be nothing to love or to hate
What would be left would simply horrify us
These five themes are a direct means for curing delusion
When we fall for each other it's because we fall for the hair the nails the teeth the skin
We fall for these things because we haven't contemplated them in a precise or detailed way
If we were to contemplate them down to their very roots we'd see that there's nothing worth falling for at all
When the mind gathers to a subtle level where it's still then even though there may be some thoughts arising focus on staying perfectly still
The words perfectly still here can be compared to a hunter waiting to trap an animal
The hunter sits still without moving at all but his eyes have to be on the lookout for the animals he's trying to trap
The same holds true for the way mindfulness has to be focused on the mind
Concerning visions whether or not they appear is not really important because our purpose in developing concentration is simply to give rise to stillness within the mind
If you can make your mind still in a single preoccupation that's enough right there
Even if no visions arise there's nothing to worry about
Some people when they meditate want to see images of heaven hell devas etc but there's nothing special about seeing things like that
We say that there's nothing special because even when you do see things like that your defilements are still the same as they always were  and with some people their defilements get even worse
They think that they're somebody special because they can see various things and so they aren't willing to bow down or show respect to anyone else
This attitude is an obstacle to heaven an obstacle to the path closing off the paths and fruitions leading to nibbana
It's a view that deviates from the principles of the Buddha's teachings
We're taught to meditate solely for the purpose of subduing our defilements
What you want to see is your own greed anger and delusion
You want to see your own passion craving and conceit
There are two kinds of release from the defilements absolute release and release through suppressing
When we meditate and the mind settles down firmly in concentration we've suppressed the defilements
This is called release through suppressing
Even though this isn't as good as absolute release it's still good that we're able to keep these things in line to some extent  better than letting them force us around
At the very least we should put up a fight against them
Once the mind has settled down then when the time comes for you to leave concentration don't come right out
Reflect first on how you were able to get into concentration
How were you able to let go of outside worries and concerns
How did you focus your mind
What object did you focus on
Reflect on how you were able to get the mind to settle down so well so that the next time you meditate you'll know how to focus your awareness
If you don't reflect in this way then the next time you meditate you'll be lost
Mindfulness and discernment are the factors that govern the heart
For this reason those of us who have authority over other people who have the duty of governing other people first have to train ourselves to govern ourselves
Only then can we govern others
For example if we're going to be teachers we first need to be able to govern ourselves if we want to be able to govern our students
We thus have to train our hearts and minds so that mindfulness and discernment can govern them so that mindfulness and discernment can act as our justices of the peace
In other words the heart is like a courtroom where we can judge our own guilt or innocence
For us to do this properly depends on our own mindfulness and discernment
We first have to work on virtue and concentration as our foundation
Only when our virtue and concentration are ready will the heart and mind have the discernment to train itself to wash away its defilements in line with our individual strength
The defilements come on three levels coarse intermediate and refined
The refined defilements are the anusaya the tendencies that lie latent in our character
We have to use our discernment to cure them
The intermediate defilements are the nivarana the five hindrances
These can be overcome when the mind is in jhana
The coarse defilements are those that lose their power through our observing the precepts
The five hindrances are as follows
These five qualities are called hindrances because they act as obstacles preventing the mind from attaining goodness
They come under the three basic defilements ie passion aversion and delusion
Sensual desire comes under the defilement of passion
Ill will comes under the defilement of aversion
Sleepiness restlessness and uncertainty come under the defilement of delusion
The hindrances are really no different from these basic defilements for both sets are obstacles to the mind preventing it from doing good from attaining the Dhamma
When they take over the mind we find no pleasure in doing good no pleasure in being generous observing the precepts or meditating
But when our concentration reaches the level of fixed penetration or jhana these intermediate defilements along with the coarse defilements are out of the way
The only defilements still remaining are the refined ones
As long as our jhana doesn't deteriorate we're in a state of release
Release here means freedom from suffering freedom from the coarse and intermediate defilements
This is something we should all try to do in order to benefit our hearts
But people for the most part no matter what country they're born in are more interested in the affairs of the body
They're not all that interested in tending to the heart and mind
They don't look after the heart and mind
When the heart is suffering they don't look into why it's suffering
They're more wrapped up in looking after the body
When the body's in the slightest pain they run to the doctor to the hospital
But when they suffer in their hearts and minds they aren't all that interested in finding out why
People who have trained their minds though investigate into the reasons and causes
When the heart is suffering and they've investigated down to the real causes they'll know how to release the heart from that suffering
You could say that they act as their own doctors
The Buddha was a master doctor a doctor specializing in the diseases of the heart and mind
As he once said The diseases of the body are few far fewer than the diseases of the heart and mind It's possible to find people who have lived to the age of or without having suffered from diseases of the body but as for diseases of the heart and mind they constantly disturb ordinary people everywhere
The diseases of the heart and mind are so many that they're innumerable all the many diseases that come out of passion aversion and delusion
That's why we're taught to train our minds
When we listen to the Dhamma and put it into practice we're said to be studying medicine for the heart and mind
Once we've learned the Dhamma we train ourselves in line with it
Once the mind attains concentration we'll have strategies and techniques for looking after our own hearts and minds
When suffering arises in the heart and mind we'll be able to contemplate it for ourselves and treat it by ourselves
This is why the Buddha says that there are great benefits great results for those who practice generosity virtue and meditation
People who do this are called sages
The word sage here can apply to women or men
It applies to anyone who knows  who knows the affairs of the heart and mind
But these affairs are hard to know
Most people abandon their own minds throw them away
This is why so many people in the world lose out in life  because they abandon the mind that can act as such a wonderful refuge
So the mind is a crucial thing to train
And as I've said we train it through generosity virtue and meditation
No matter how good your concentration  no matter how much bliss you experience or how much supranormal knowledge you gain  if insight into the three common characteristics of inconstancy stress and notself hasn't yet arisen you're still in wrong concentration
We're told that nothing is really ours
Think about the things that you hold to as your own external wealth the possessions with and without consciousness that are said to be yours
Can you really take them with you when you go
I'll let you consider on your own
Your land your home your furnishings all the things that the mind holds on to can you really claim them to be your own
Can the mind take them along as its own belongings when it goes to be reborn
I'll leave this with you to consider for yourselves but if you ask me I'd say that it can't
When you have no more breath to breathe you have no more rights to these things
You can't continue to hold onto them as my children my husband my wife my grandchildren my home my millions and thousands in the bank As the Buddha taught
None of the world's wealth belongs to us
And we don't belong to it
There's nothing but gaminiyam there's nothing but leaving and dying
When parents die their wealth falls to their children
The children use that wealth until they die when it falls to the grandchildren
In other words you can't really hold to these things as your own
You have rights over them only for this life
What the Buddha said about this is it true
True or false I leave it to you to decide
Any of the things that you hold to as your own  here I'm talking to your mind  can you take it along with you
Your external wealth when you get reborn in heaven can you take these things along with you
If you get reborn in hell or as a hungry ghost can you take them along
If you get reborn as a common animal  a cow a water buffalo a vulture a crow a dog a pig  can you take your external wealth along
Think carefully about this
I say that you can't
There's nothing you hold to inside or out that you can take along with you
You can't take any of the five aggregates  form feeling perception thoughtfabrications or sensory consciousness  along
The body for instance the parts composed of earth water fire and wind the mind holds onto it as yourself but is it really yourself
It may be yours as long as you're breathing but when there's no more breath can the mind stay in charge of it
Can it hold onto it
Can it take it along as its self
Can you say When I stop breathing don't cremate me
Leave me there in the bedroom so that we can sleep and wake up together Can you say that
Think about it
Ask your mind can you really take the body along with you
The same holds true with feelings  the feelings of pleasure pain and neither pleasure nor pain that depend on contact as when forms make contact with the eye or flavors make contact with the tongue so that you can know sweet and sour or when heat and cold soft and hard make contact with the body
Contact happens when the mind wakes up and starts working that's when feelings of pleasure and pain can arise when perceptions and mental labels can arise when the act of thought fabrication arises
Feelings of pleasure arise from contact as when forms strike the eye sounds strike the ear aromas strike the nose flavors strike the tongue and tactile sensations strike the body
When ideas strike the mind they stir it up into a reaction
All three of these mental phenomena  feelings perceptions and thought fabrications  arise from contact
When the mind awakens from sleep and gets to work there are feelings of pleasure and pain mental labels perceive and thought fabrications think
Now can the mind hold onto feelings of pleasure and pain as itself
When there's a feeling of pleasure can the mind prevent pain from arising
Can it keep that pleasure going continuously without deteriorating
Can it exert control over these things
When you use perception to study and memorize things can you exert control so that you don't forget or confuse the things you've memorized
Can you control the fabrication of good and bad thoughts
Can you order your thoughts to stop
Can you force them to think only good things
The same holds true with consciousness at the eyes ears nose tongue body and mind that arises in dependence on physical and mental phenomena
When we wake up if there are no physical or mental phenomena then consciousness doesn't have a place to stand has no place to work
The body is like a factory the mind is like a head office waiting to receive contact
Can you hold onto any of these things as your own
As the Buddha said Form arises in dependence on conditions that are inconstant stressful and notself
So how could form be constant pleasant and self
Feelings perceptions thoughtfabrications and consciousness arise in dependence on conditions that are inconstant stressful and notself
So how could they be constant pleasant and self
All the things that the mind holds to the Buddha boiled down to physical and mental phenomena the five aggregates and to all of these things he applied the three characteristics
All fabricated things are inconstant he said all fabricated things are stressful all things are notself
Whatever things whatever kinds of knowledge arise you have to use the three characteristics as your standard of judgment
Physical and mental phenomena depend on three conditions consciousness fabrication and avijja
The word avijja means unawareness being unaware of stress its cause its cessation and the path to its cessation
That's what they say in the texts
Actual unawareness is aware but there's one thing it's not aware of itself
It's like the eye
The eye can see everything except for itself
If we didn't have inventions like mirrors you'd have no hope of ever seeing your own eyes your own face
The reason we can see our face is because of mirrors
The same holds true with the awareness of the mind
The essence of the Buddha's teaching is the fruit of arahantship  irreversible release
Heedlessness is the way to death
The word death here doesn't refer to the death of the body
It refers to the death of the mind when the mind dies away from the paths and fruitions leading to nibbana
Heedfulness is the way to the deathless
In other words when we aren't heedless of goodness  when we aren't negligent in developing virtue concentration and discernment  we're sure to have the chance to go to heaven the Brahma worlds or to the paths and fruitions leading to nibbana quickly or slowly depending on the strength of our own efforts
To be heedful means to keep mindfulness focused on the body and mind
Whether we're sitting standing walking or lying down none of our movements can cause mindfulness to lapse
Only then can we say that we're heedful
Understand
To be heedless means to be lacking in mindfulness and alertness letting the mind wander among things apart from your own body and mind  wandering in line with the preoccupations of the world sights sounds smells flavors tactile sensations and thoughts
If that's the sort of person you are the Buddha says you're heedless
Even though your body may still be alive you're like a person who's dead

The Book of Protection which is an anthology of selected discourses of the Buddha compiled by the teachers of old was originally meant as a handbook for the newly ordained novice
The idea was that those novices who are not capable of studying large portions of the Discourse Collection should at least be conversant with the Book of Protection
Even today it is so
The twenty four discourses are selected from the five Nikayas or the original Collections in Pali containing the Buddha's discourses
The fact that the book was meant for the novice is clear from the prefatory paragraphs that precede the discourses
The precepts are ten and not five which are the basic principles of the lay follower
The novice is expected to observe the ten precepts
This is followed by the Questions to be Answered by a Novice and the Thirty Two Parts of the Body which is really a type of meditation on the constituent parts of one's body
Then comes the Fourfold reflection of a Monk and finally the Ten Essentials  to be reflected upon by one who has gone forth to live the holy life
The discourses come next
If one patiently and painstakingly studies these discourses he could gather a good knowledge of the essentials and fundamental teachings of the Buddha
The Mahasamaya sutta and the Atanatiya sutta ending the book may appear to some as pointless but a careful reader will no doubt appreciate their relevance
In the essay on the Value of Paritta an attempt is made to show what paritta means to a Buddhist
I have endeavored to keep as close as possible to the original wording of the text without making it too literal a translation on the one hand and a word for word translation on the other and have avoided translating the Pali stanzas into verse in order to give a very faithful easy and readable rendering
I have preserved the synonymous words and repetitions found in the suttas since they are the ipsissima verba of the Buddha handed down to us through oral tradition
In all the suttas the word Bhagava the Blessed One an epithet of the Buddha is frequently used
To avoid using the same word too often in the translation I have at times used the word the Buddha for Bhagava or a personal pronoun to denote him
The Pali words and names included in this work are lacking in diacritical marks
In some places however the smaller type with such marks are used
But students of Pali may not find any difficulty in pronouncing them
The reader may refer to the Khandhavatta Jataka when studying the Khandha Paritta
The Angulimala Paritta is a short discourse that does not appear in the Book of Protection but as it is a paritta made use of by expectant mothers in Buddhist lands I have included it in the Appendix
Other Pali stanzas used by the Buddhists when reciting the Parittas are also included in the Appendix with their English renderings

The world of English Buddhist literature has been enriched by the publication of this book entitled The Book of Protection This is a translation by the Ven
Piyadassi Maha Thera of what is well known to every Sinhala Buddhist home as the Pirit Potha which means the book of protection
It contains a collection of suttas or discourses taken from the teaching of the Buddha and are meant to be recited in temples and homes for the purpose of obtaining protection from all harm
This is achieved by recalling with saddha or confidence the virtues of the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha referred to in these discourses
There are many who listen to the recitation of these discourses but who hardly understand the import of these discourses and therefore any benefit they may gain must be necessarily slight
This translation therefore supplies a longfelt need as it will help such persons to listen with understanding when pirith is being recited
The venerable translator is therefore to be congratulated as being the first to translate a book of this nature
To translate a book is not so easy as to write a book
The work of translation calls for precision and concentrated thought
A translation that keeps too close to the original is apt to suffer from a failure to convey the spirit underlying the original text
At the same time a translation that is too free runs the risk of expressing more than the author of the original composition had intended and thereby misrepresents him
The venerable translator has certainly done well by steering clear between these two extremes and therefore deserves special praise
Further more he has by the manner of his translation made it evident that he has been at pains to facilitate the purpose for which pirith is recited
By means of explanations in parenthesis and helpful foot notes he has striven to elucidate the meaning of words and phrases where their full significance appears to be obscure
If a further clarification is needed the reader is invited to refer to Ven
Piyadassi Maha Thera's book The Buddha's Ancient Path which deals with quite a number of points concerning the Buddhadhamma
There can be no doubt that this translation of the Pirith Potha by one such as the Ven
Piyadassi Maha Thera  a reputed author of several Buddhist books and a preacher whose sermons have gained great acceptance both in the East and the West  will be hailed with delight by those who desire to obtain a full understanding of the pirith that is recited in temples and homes  sometimes with marvelous effect

'Recent research in medicine in experimental psychology and what is still called parapsychology has thrown some light on the nature of mind and its position in the world
During the last forty years the conviction has steadily grown among medical men that very many causes of diseases organic as well as functional are directly caused by mental states
The body becomes ill because the mind controlling it either secretly wants to make it ill or else because it is in such a state of agitation that it cannot prevent the body from sickening
Whatever its physical nature resistance to disease is unquestionably correlated with the physiological condition of the patient'
'Mind not only makes sick it also cures
An optimistic patient has more chance of getting well than a patient who is worried and unhappy
The recorded instances of faith healing includes cases in which even organic diseases were cured almost instantaneously'
In this connection it is interesting to observe the prevalence in Buddhist lands of listening to the recital of the dhamma or the doctrine of the Buddha in order to avert illness or danger to ward off the influence of malignant beings to obtain protection and deliverance from evil and to promote health prosperity welfare and wellbeing
The selected discourses for recital are known as paritta suttas discourses for protection
But they are not rakshana mantras or protective incantations found in Brahmanic religion nor are they magical rites
There is nothing mystical in them
Paritta in Pali paritrana in Sanskrit and pirit in Sinhala mean principally protection
Paritta suttas describe certain suttas or discourses delivered by the Buddha and regarded as affording protection
This protection is to be obtained by reciting or listening to the paritta suttas
The practice of reciting or listening to the paritta suttas began very early in the history of Buddhism
The word paritta in this context was used by the Buddha for the first time in a discourse known as Khandha Paritta in the Culla Vagga of the Vinaya Pitaka and also in the Anguttara Nikaya under the title Ahi Sutta
This discourse was recommended by the Buddha as guard or protection for the use of the members of the Order
The Buddha in this discourse exhorts the monks to cultivate metta or lovingkindness towards all beings
It is certain that paritta recital produces mental wellbeing in those who listen to them with intelligence and have confidence in the truth of the Buddha's words
Such mental well being can help those who are ill to recover and can also help not only to induce the mental attitude that brings happiness but also to overcome its opposite
Originally in India those who listened to paritta sayings of the Buddha understood what was recited and the effect on them was correspondingly great
The Buddha himself had paritta recited to him and he also requested others to recite paritta for his own disciples when they were ill
This practice is still in vogue in Buddhist lands
The Buddha and the arahants can concentrate on the paritta suttas without the aid of another
However when they are ill it is easier for them to listen to what others recite and thus focus their minds on the dhamma that the suttas contain rather than think of the dhamma by themselves
There are occasions as in the case of illness which weaken the mind when heterosuggestion has been found to be more effective than autosuggestion
According to the teachings of the Buddha the mind is so closely linked with the body that mental states affect the body's health and well being
Some doctors even say there is no such thing as purely physical disease
That even so grossly physical a complaint as dental caries may be due to mental causes was maintained in a paper read before the American Dental Congress in
The author pointed out that children living on a perfectly satisfactory diet may still suffer dental decay
In such cases investigation generally shows that the child's life at home or at school is in some way unsatisfactory
The teeth decay because their owner is under mental strain' Unless according to the Buddhist doctrine of kamma these bad mental states are caused as a result of one's own acts and are therefore unalterable it is possible so to change these mental states as to cause mental health and physical wellbeing to follow thereafter
Several factors combine to contribute towards the efficacy of paritta recitals
Paritta recital is a form of saccakiriya ie an asseveration of truth
Protection results by the power of such asseveration
This means establishing oneself in the power of truth to gain one's end
At the end of the recital of each sutta the reciters bless the listeners with the words etena sacca vajjena sotti te hotu sabbada which means by the power of the truth of these words may you ever be well The saying the power of the dhamma or Truth protects the follower of the dhamma indicates the principle behind these sutta recitals
The belief in the effective power to heal or protect of the saccakiriya or asseveration of something quite true is but another aspect of the work ascribed to the paritta
Several discourses of the Book of Protection describe the virtuous life
The starting point in Buddhism is sila
Standing on the firm ground of sila one should endeavor to achieve a collected mind
If it is true that virtue protects the virtuous then a person who listens to the recital of paritta suttas intelligently in a reflective mood with complete confidence in the Buddha's words uttered by one who has gained complete Enlightenment will acquire so virtuous a state of mind as would enable him to dominate any evil influence and to be protected from all harm
The utterances of the compassionate Buddha are never void of love
He walked the highways and byways of India enfolding all within the aura of his love and compassion instructing enlightening and gladdening the many by his teaching
The reciters of the paritta are therefore expected to do so with a heart of love and compassion wishing the listeners and others weal and happiness and protection from all harm
Love is an active force
Every act of one who truly loves is done with the pure mind to help to cheer and to make the paths of others more easy more smooth and more adapted to the conquest of sorrow the winning of the Highest Bliss

Rhys Davids commenting on amity writes The profession of amity according to Buddhist doctrine was no mere matter of pretty speech
It was to accompany and express a psychic suffusion of the hostile man or beast or spirit with benign fraternal emotion  with metta
For strong was the conviction from Sutta and Vinaya to Buddhaghosa's Visuddhi Magga that thoughts are things that psychical action emotional or intellectual is capable of working like a force among forces
Europe may yet come round further to this Indian attitude
It is believed that the vibratory sounds produced by the sonorous and mellifluous recital of the paritta suttas in their Pali verses are soothing to the nerves and induce peace and calm of mind they also bring about harmony to the physical system
How can bad influences springing from evil beings be counteracted by recital of paritta suttas
Bad influences are the results of evil thinking
They can therefore be counteracted by wholesome states of mind
One sure way of inducing a wholesome state of mind is by listening and reflecting on paritta recitals with intelligence and confidence
So great is the power of concentration that by adverting wholeheartedly to the truth contained in the paritta recitals one is able to develop a wholesome state of mind
The recital of paritta suttas can also bring material blessings in its wake through the wholesome states of mind induced by concentration and confidence in listening intelligently to the recital
According to the Buddha right effort is a necessary factor in overcoming suffering
Listening to these recitals in the proper way can also generate energy for the purpose of securing worldly progress while it also secures spiritual progress
There is no better medicine than truth for the mental and physical ills which are the causes of all suffering and misfortune
So the recital of paritta suttas in as much as they contain the dhamma may when they are listened to in the proper attitude bring into being wholesome states of mind which conduce to health material progress and spiritual progress
The effect of Pirit can also transcend distance however great
It is true that the Buddhists consider the parittas as a neverfailing potent and purifying force a supersolvent
However a question may arise whether recitals from the Book of Protection will in every case result in the protection and blessing sought for
In this connection the same reply given by the Venerable Nagasena to King Milinda's question why the recital of paritta does not in all cases protect one from death is worth remembering Due to three causes recital of paritta may have no effect kamma hindrances hindrances from defilements lack of faith 
Kamma means action and not the result of action therefore action can be counteracted by other action
Kamma is not something static but is always changing ie always in the making that being so action can be counteracted by other action
Hence bad actions on the part of the hearers of the recital may negative the beneficial effects of the recital
If the mind of the hearer is contaminated with impure thoughts then also the intended beneficial effects of the recital may not materialize
But however impure the mind of the hearer may be if there is great confidence in the efficacy of the recital then this important factor may help to secure for him the beneficial effects of the recital
This collection of paritta discourses  in Sinhala The Pirit Potha  is the most widely known Pali book in Sri Lanka
It is called The Buddhist Bible it is given an important place in the Buddhist home and is even treated with veneration
In most houses where there is a small shrine this book is kept there so that the inmates may refer to it during their devotional hour
Some have committed to memory the three well known discourses  Mangala Ratana and Karaniyametta suttas
Even children are familiar with these discourses for they learn them from their parents and elders or from the dhamma school
The habit of listening to the recital of paritta suttas among the Westerners is growing slowly but steadily
The present writer while on his missions in the European and American countries has at request of several residents there taperecorded the recital of paritta suttas for their benefit and has airmailed cassettes containing the sutta recitals to those who sent him such cassettes
Now what does this book contain
It is a collection of twenty four suttas or discourses almost all delivered by the Buddha and found scattered in the five original collections in Pali which form the Sutta Pitaka the Canonical Discourses These discourses are preceded by an enunciation of the Three Refuges the Ten Precepts and the questions asked of a novice
This collection of discourses popularly known as Pirit Potha or The Book of Protection has a less known title Catubhanavara
A th century Commentary to this written in Pali by a pupil of the Venerable Rajaguru Vanaratana of Sri Lanka is available under the title Catubhanavara Atthakatha or Sarattha Samuccaya
What is a bhanavara
It is a collection of sermons or discourses
Four such collections are called Catubhanavara
As the teachers of old have said a threeword line is made up of eight syllables four such padas make a stanza or a gatha
Thus stanzas consists of thirtytwo syllables
such stanzas is called a bhanavara which consists of syllables
The Catunabhanavara was compiled by the Maha Theras the teachers of yore of Sri Lanka and today it is known among the Buddhists of Sri Lanka as the Pirit Potha The Book of Protection
It is customary for Buddhist monks when they are invited to the homes of the laity on occasions of domestic importance such as birth days housewarming illness and similar events to recite the three popular discourses mentioned above
In the domestic and social life of the people of Sri Lanka pirit ceremony is of great significance
No festival or function religious or social is complete without the recital of the paritta
On special occasions monks are invited to recite the paritta suttas not for short periods but right through the night or for three or seven days and at times for weeks
On such occasions a pavilion is constructed for the purpose of accommodating the monks at the recital
Before the commencement of the recital the laity present at the ceremony makes a formal invitation to the monks by reciting in Pali three stanzas which explain the purpose of the recital
Then the monks generally about twelve or fourteen who have been invited will recite the three popular suttas
Thereafter a pair of monks will commence reciting the remaining suttas for two hours
They will then retire and will be followed by another pair for another two hours
Two monks must be constantly officiating
In this manner the recital will last till dawn
While the recital continues there will be found a pot of water placed on a table before the monks
On this table there is also a sacred thread
For an all night pirit ceremony the casket containing a relic of the Buddha and the Pirit Potha or The Book of Protection written on ola leaves are also brought into the pavilion
The relic represents the Buddha the Pirit Potha represents the Dhamma or the teachings of the Buddha and the reciting BhikkhuSangha represent the AriyaSangha the arahant disciples of the Buddha
The thread is drawn round the interior of the pavilion and its end twisted round the casket the neck of the pot of water and tied to the cord of the olaleaf book
While the special discourses are being recited the monks hold the thread
The purpose is to maintain an unbroken communication from the water to the relic to the Pirit Potha and to the officiating monks A ball of thread connected to The Three Jewels and the water is unloosened and passed on to the listeners who hold the thread while the recital goes on
When the recital in Pali of the entire book is over at dawn the thread sanctified by the recital is divided into pieces and distributed among the devotees to be tied round their wrists or necks
At the same time the sanctified water is sprinkled on all who even drink a little of it and sprinkle it on their heads
These are to be regarded as symbols of the protective power of the paritta that was recited
It is a service of inducing blessings
It has its psychological effects
Dr
Bernard Grad of McGill University in Montreal painstakingly proved that if a psychic healer held water in a flask and this water was later poured on barley seeds the plants significantly outgrew untreated seeds
But  and this is the intriguing part  if depressed psychiatric patients held the flasks of water the growth of seeds was retarded
'Dr
Grad suggests that there appeared to be some x factor or energy that flows from the human body to affect growth of plants and animals
A person's mood affected this energy
This previously unacknowledged energy has the widest implications for medical science from healing to lab tests Grad says'
As experimentally discovered by Dr
Grad mind can influence matter
If that be so not much thinking is necessary to draw the logical inference that mind can influence mind
Further if the human mind can influence lower animals then by a parity of reasoning the human mind can influence the minds of beings higher than animals

Thus have I heard
On one occasion the Blessed One was living near Savatthi at Jetavana at the monastery of Anathapindika
Then the Blessed One addressed the monks saying Monks  Venerable Sir they said by way of reply
The Blessed One then spoke as follows
These ten essentials must be reflected upon again and again by one who has gone forth
What are these ten
'I am now changed into a different mode of life' This must be reflected upon again and again by one who has gone forth
'My life depends on others'
'I must now behave in a different manner' This must be reflected upon again and again by one who has gone forth
'Does my mind upbraid me regarding the state of my virtue' This must be reflected upon again and again by one who has gone forth
'Do my discerning fellowmonks having tested me reproach me regarding the state of my virtue' This must be reflected upon again and again by one who has gone forth
'There will be a parting from all those who are dear and loving to me
Death brings this separation to me' This must be reflected upon again and again by one who has gone forth
'Of kamma I am constituted
Kamma is my inheritance kamma is the matrix kamma is my kinsman kamma is my refuge
Whatever kamma I perform be it good or bad to that I shall be heir' This must be reflected upon again and again by one who has gone forth
'How do I spend my nights and days' This must be reflected upon again and again by one who has gone forth
'Do I take delight in solitude' This must be reflected upon again and again by one who has gone forth
'Have I gained superhuman faculties
Have I gained that higher wisdom so that when I am questioned by fellowmonks at the last moment I will have no occasion to be depressed and downcast' This must be reflected upon again and again by one who has gone forth
These monks are the essentials that should be reflected again and again by one who has gone forth
So spoke the Blessed One
Those monks rejoiced at the words of the Blessed One
Thus have I heard
On one occasion the Blessed One was living near Savatthi at Jetavana at Anathapindika's monastery
Now when the night was far advanced a certain deity whose surpassing radiance illuminated the whole of Jetavana approached the Blessed One respectfully saluted him and stood beside him
Standing thus he addressed the Blessed One in verse

The occasion for this discourse in brief according to the commentary is as follows The city of Vesali was afflicted by a famine causing death especially to the poor folk
Due to the presence of decaying corpses the evil spirits began to haunt the city this was followed by a pestilence
Plagued by these three fears of famine nonhuman beings and pestilence the citizens sought the help of the Buddha who was then living at Rajagaha
Followed by a large number of monks including the Venerable Ananda his attendant disciple the Buddha came to the city of Vesali
With the arrival of the Master there were torrential rains which swept away the putrefying corpses
The atmosphere became purified the city was clean
Thereupon the Buddha delivered this Jewel Discourse to the Venerable Ananda and gave him instructions as to how he should tour the city with the Licchavi citizens reciting the discourse as a mark of protection to the people of Vesali
The Venerable Ananda followed the instructions and sprinkled the sanctified water from the Buddha's own alms bowl
As a consequence the evil spirits were exorcised the pestilence subsided
Thereafter the Venerable Ananda returned with the citizens of Vesali to the Public hall where the Buddha and his disciples had assembled awaiting his arrival
There the Buddha recited the same Jewel Discourse to the gathering 
O beings listen closely
May you all radiate lovingkindness to those human beings who by day and night bring offerings to you
Wherefore protect them with diligence
Whatever treasure there be either in the world beyond whatever precious jewel there be in the heavenly worlds there is nought comparable to the Tathagata
This precious jewel is the Buddha
By this truth may there be happiness
That Cessation that Detachment that Deathlessness supreme the calm and collected Sakyan Sage had realized
There is nought comparable to this Dhamma

The Supreme Buddha extolled a path of purity calling it the path which unfailingly brings concentration
There is nought comparable to this concentration

The eight persons extolled by virtuous men constitute four pairs
They are the disciples of the Buddha and are worthy of offerings
Gifts given to them yield rich results

With a steadfast mind and applying themselves well in the dispensation of the Buddha Gotama free from they have attained to that which should be attained encountering the Deathless

May there be happiness
While the Buddha was staying at Savatthi a band of monks having received subjects of meditation from the master proceeded to a forest to spend the rainy season
The tree deities inhabiting this forest were worried by their arrival as they had to descend from tree abodes and dwell on the ground
They hoped however the monks would leave soon but finding that the monks would stay the vassana period of three months harassed them in diverse ways during the night with the intention of scaring them away
Living under such conditions being impossible the monks went to the Master and informed him of their difficulties
Thereon the Buddha instructed them in the Metta sutta and advised their return equipped with this sutta for their protection
The monks went back to the forest and practicing the instruction conveyed permeated the whole atmosphere with their radiant thoughts of metta or lovingkindness
The deities so affected by this power of love henceforth allowed them to meditate in peace
The discourse gets divided into two parts
The first detailing the standard of moral conduct required by one who wishes to attain Purity and Peace and the second the method of practice of metta

He who is skilled in well being and who wishes to attain that state of Calm should act thus he should be dexterous upright exceedingly upright obedient gentle and humble
Contented easily supportable with but few responsibilities of simple livelihood controlled in the senses prudent courteous and not hanker after association with families
Let him not perform the slightest wrong for which wise men may rebuke him
'May all beings be happy and safe
May they have happy minds'

Whatever living beings there may be  feeble or strong long stout or of medium size short small large those seen or those unseen those dwelling far or near those who are born as well as those yet to be born  may all beings have happy minds
Let him not deceive another nor despise anyone anywhere
In anger or ill will let him not wish another ill
Just as a mother would protect her only child with her life even so let one cultivate a boundless love towards all beings
Let him radiate boundless love towards the entire world  above below and across  unhindered without ill will without enmity
Standing walking sitting or reclining as long as he is awake let him develop this mindfulness
This they say is 'Noble Living' here
Not falling into wrong views  being virtuous endowed with insight lust in the senses discarded  verily never again will he return to conceive in a womb
Thus have I heard
On one occasion the Blessed One was living near Savatthi at Jetavana at Anathapindika's monastery
At that time at Savatthi a certain monk had died bitten by a snake
Thereupon many monks approached the Buddha and having saluted him sat beside him
So seated those monks spoke thus to the Blessed One
Bhante a certain monk at Savatthi had died bitten by a snake
Assuredly monks said the Buddha
That monk has not suffused with thoughts of lovingkindness the four royal tribes of snakes
Had he done so that monk would not have died of snakebite
What are the four royal tribes of snakes
The royal tribe of snakes called Virupakkha Erapatha Chabyaputta and Kanhagotamaka
Monks that monk did not suffuse with thoughts of lovingkindness these four royal tribes of snakes had not done so he would not have died of snakebite
Monks I enjoin you to suffuse with thoughts of lovingkindness these four royal tribes of snakes for your safety for your preservation and for your protection So said the Blessed One
Having thus spoken the Buddha the Welcome One further said 
Infinite is the Buddha infinite is the Dhamma infinite is the Sangha
Finite are creeping creatures  snakes scorpions centipedes spiders lizards and rats
I have guarded myself I have made my protection
Depart from me ye beings
I bow down to the Blessed One and to the seven Supreme Buddhas 
Thus have I heard
On one occasion the Blessed One was living near Savatthi at Jetavana at Anathapindika's monastery
Then he addressed the monks saying Monks  Venerable Sir said the monks by way of reply
The Blessed One then spoke as follows
Monks eleven advantages are to be expected from the release of heart by familiarizing oneself with thoughts of lovingkindness by the cultivation of lovingkindness by constantly increasing these thoughts by regarding lovingkindness as a vehicle and also as something to be treasured by living in conformity with these thoughts by putting these ideas into practice and by establishing them
What are the eleven
He sleeps in comfort
He awakes in comfort
He sees no evil dreams
He is dear to human beings
He is dear to nonhuman beings
Devas protect him
Fire poison and sword cannot touch him
His mind can concentrate quickly
His countenance is serene
He dies without being confused in mind
If he fails to attain arahantship the highest sanctity here and now he will be reborn in the brahmaworld
These eleven advantages monks are to be expected from the release of heart by familiarizing oneself with thoughts of lovingkindness by cultivation of lovingkindness by constantly increasing these thoughts by regarding lovingkindness as a vehicle and also as something to be treasured by living in conformity with these thoughts by putting these ideas into practice and by establishing them
So said the Blessed One
Those monks rejoiced at the words of the Blessed One

May my adoration be to those Brahmanas who have attained Enlightenment by comprehending all dhammas
May they protect me
May my adoration be to the Buddhas to their Enlightenment
May my adoration be to those supremely secured from bondage and to their Deliverance
Having made this protection the peacock goes about seeking
There descends the golden hued one the one who has sight the one who is sole monarch the one who illuminates the earth
I adore thee the golden hued one who illuminates the earth
Protected by thee we live this night safe and secure
May my adoration be to those Brahmanas who have attained Enlightenment by comprehending all dhammas
May they protect me

May my adoration be to those supremely secured from bondage and to their Deliverance
Having made this protection the peacock spent his life happily
In Indian cosmology the major planets are regarded as deities or gods
This view at times extends to the common parlance of today eg rain god sun god etc
The Buddha was not disposed to comment on these views and so he contented himself with merely expressing the message of the Dhamma through the medium of these views
Thus have I heard
On one occasion the Blessed One was living near Savatthi at Jetavana at Anathpindika's monastery
At that time Candima the moon deity was seized by Rahu lord of Asura
Thereupon calling to mind the Blessed One Candima the moon deity recited this stanza
i
O Buddha the Hero thou art wholly free from all evil
My adoration to thee
I have fallen into distress
Be thou my refuge
Thereupon the Blessed One addressed a stanza to Rahu Lord of Asuras on behalf of Candima thus
ii
O Rahu Candima has gone for refuge to the Tathagata the Consummate One
Release Candima
The Buddhas radiate compassion on the world
Thereupon Rahu Lord of Asuras released Candima the deity and immediately came to the presence of Vepacitta Lord of Asuras and stood beside him trembling with fear and with hair standing on end
Then Vepacitta addressed Rahu in this stanza
iii
Rahu
Why did you suddenly release Candima
Why have you come trembling and why are you standing here terrified
I have been spoken to by the Buddha in a stanza
If I had not released Candima my head would have split into seven pieces
While yet I live I should have had no happiness
Thus have I heard
On one occasion the Blessed One was living near Savatthi at Jetavana at Anathapindika's monastery
At that time Suriya the sun deity was seized by Rahu Lord of Asuras
Thereupon calling to mind the Blessed One Suriya the Sun deity recited this stanza
i
O Buddha the Hero thou art wholly free from all evil
My adoration to thee
I have fallen into distress
Be thou my refuge
Thereupon the Blessed One addressed a stanza to Rahu Lord of Asuras on behalf of Suriya thus
ii
O Rahu Suriya has gone for refuge to the Tathagata the Consummate One
Release Suriya
The Buddhas radiate compassion on the world
iii
O Rahu swallow not the dispeller of darkness the shining one the radiant and effulgent traveler through the sky
Rahu release Suriya my son
Thereupon Rahu Lord of Asuras released Suriya and immediately came to the presence of Vepacitta Lord of Asuras and stood beside him trembling with fear and with hair standing on end
Then Vepacitta addressed Rahu in this stanza
iv
Rahu why did you suddenly release Suriya
Why have you come trembling and why are you standing here terrified
I have been spoken to by the Buddha in a stanza
If I had not released Suriya my head would have split into seven pieces
While yet I live I should have had no happiness
Thus have I heard
On one occasion the Blessed One was living near Savatthi at Jetavana at the monastery of Anathapindika
Then he addressed the monks saying O monks  Venerable Sir said the monks by way of reply to the Blessed One
Thereupon he spoke as follows
Monks I shall relate a former incident
There arose a battle between the Devas and Asuras
Then Sakka the Lord of the devas addressed the devas of the Tavatimsa heaven thus
'Happy ones if the devas who have gone to the battle should experience fear or terror or suffer from hair standing on end let them behold the crest of my own banner
If you do so any fear terror or hair standing on end arising in you will pass away
'If you fail to look up to the crest of my banner look at the crest of the banner of Pajapati King of gods
If you do so any fear terror or hair standing on end arising in you will pass away
'If you fail to look up to the crest of Pajapati King of the gods look at the crest of the banner of Varuna King of the gods
If you do so any fear terror or hair standing on end arising in you will pass away'
Monks any fear terror or hair standing on end arising in them who look at the crest of the banner of Sakka The Lord of the gods of Pajapati of Varuna of Isana the King of the gods any fear terror or hair standing on end may pass away or may not pass away
What is the reason for this
Sakka the Lord of gods O monks is not free from lust not free from hate not free from delusion and is therefore liable to fear terror fright and flight
I also say unto you O monks  if any fear terror or hair standing on end should arise in you when you have gone to the forest or to the foot of a tree or to an empty house then think only of me thus
'Such Indeed is the Blessed One arahant supremely enlightened endowed with knowledge and virtue welcome being knower of worlds the peerless trainer of persons teacher of gods and men the Buddha the Blessed One' Monks if you think of me any fear terror or standing of hair on end that may arise in you will pass away
If you fail to think of me then think of the Dhamma thus 'Well expounded is the Dhamma by the Blessed One a Dhamma to be realized by oneself and gives immediate results a Dhamma which invites investigation and leads up to Nibbana a Dhamma to be understood by the wise each for himself' Monks if you think of the Dhamma any fear terror or hair standing on end that may arise in you will pass away
If you fail to think of the Dhamma then think of the Sangha thus 'Of good conduct is the Order of Disciples of the Blessed One of upright conduct is the Order of Disciples of the Blessed One of wise conduct is the Order of Disciples of the Blessed One of dutiful conduct is the Order of Disciples of the Blessed One
This Order of Disciples of the Blessed One  namely those four pairs of persons the eight kinds of individuals  is worthy of offerings is worthy of hospitality is worthy of gifts is worthy of reverential salutations is an incomparable field of merit for the world' Monks if you think of the Sangha any fear terror or hair standing on end that may arise in you will pass away
What is the reason for this
The Tathagata O monks who is arahant supremely enlightened is free from lust free from hate is free from delusion and is not liable to fear terror fright or flight
So said the Blessed One
Having thus spoken the teacher the Welcome Being further said
Thus have I heard

Now at that time the Venerable Girimananda was afflicted with a disease was suffering therefrom and was gravely ill
Thereupon the Venerable Ananda approached the Buddha and having saluted him sat beside him
So seated the Venerable Ananda said this to the Blessed One
Bhante the Venerable Girimananda is afflicted with disease is suffering therefrom and is gravely ill
It were well bhante if the Blessed One would visit the Venerable Girimananda out of compassion for him
Should you Ananda visit the monk Girimananda and recite to him the ten contemplations then that monk Girimananda having heard them will be immediately cured of his disease
What are the ten
i
And what Ananda is contemplation of impermanence
Herein Ananda a monk having gone to the forest or to the foot of a tree or to an empty house contemplates thus 'Matter is impermanent feeling or sensation is impermanent perception is impermanent formations are impermanent consciousness is impermanent
Thus he dwells contemplating impermanence in these five aggregates' This Ananda is called contemplation of impermanence
ii
And what Ananda is contemplation of anatta
Herein Ananda a monk having gone to the forest or to the foot of a tree or to a lonely place contemplates thus 'The eye is not the self visible objects are not the self the ear is not the self sounds are not the self the nose is not the self smells are not the self the tongue is not the self tastes are not the self the body is not the self bodily contacts are not the self the mind is not the self mental objects are not the self' Thus he dwells contemplating not self in these internal and external bases
This Ananda is called contemplation of anatta
iii
And what Ananda is contemplation of foulness
Herein Ananda a monk contemplates this body upwards from the soles of the feet downwards from the top of the hair enclosed in skin as being full of many impurities
In this body there are headhairs bodyhairs nails teeth skin flesh sinews bones marrow kidneys heart liver pleura spleen lungs intestines intestinal tract stomach feces bile phlegm pus blood sweat fat tears grease saliva nasal mucous synovium and urine
Thus he dwells contemplating foulness in this body
This Ananda is called contemplation of foulness

Thereupon the Venerable Ananda having learned these ten contemplations from the Blessed One visited the Venerable Girimananda and recited to him the ten contemplations
When the Venerable Girimananda had heard them his affliction was immediately cured
He recovered from that affliction and thus disappeared the affliction of the Venerable Girimananda
Thus have I heard
On one occasion the Blessed One was living on Isigili mountain near Rajagaha
Then he addressed the monks saying O monks Bhante replied those monks in assent to the Blessed One
Thereupon he said this
Do you monks see this Vebhara mountain
Yes bhante
There was another name monks for this Vebhara mountain another designation
Do you monks see this Pandava mountain
Yes bhante
There was another name monks for this Pandava mountain another designation
Do you monks see this Vepulla mountain
Yes bhante
There was another name monks for this Vepulla mountain another designation
Do you monks see this Gijjhakuta mountain
Yes bhante
There was another name monks for this Gijjhakuta mountain another designation
Do you monks see this Isigili mountain
Yes bhante
This has been the very name monks the very designation for this Isigili mountain
In the past monks five hundred paccekabuddhas lived for a long time on this Isigili mountain
As they were entering the mountain they were visible but once they have entered they were invisible
People seeing this remarked 'This mountain swallows these seers ' hence the name Isigili came into being
I will tell you monks the names of the paccekabuddhas
I will reveal monks the names of the paccekabuddhas
Listen pay close attention I will speak
Yes bhante replied the monks
The blessed One said
Arittha monks was a paccekabuddha who lived for a long time on this Isigili mountain Uparittha Tagarasikhi Yasassi Sudassana Piyadassi Gandhara Pindola Upasabha Nitha Tatha Sutava Bhavitatta monks was a paccekabuddha who lived for a long time on this Isigili mountain

The names of those supreme beings who are free from sorrow and desire who have overcome their passions and have individually attained enlightenment noble among men
I make known
Listen to me
For seven weeks immediately following the enlightenment the Buddha spent his time in lonely retreat
At the close of this period he decided to proclaim the doctrine he had realized to those five ascetics who were once struggling with him for enlightenment
Knowing that they were living at Isipatana still steeped in the unmeaning rigours of extreme asceticism the master left Gaya where he attained enlightenment for distant Varanasi India's holy city
There at the Deer Park he rejoined them
Thus have I heard
On one occasion the Blessed One was living in the Deer Park at Isipatana near Varanasi
Then he addressed the group of five monks
Monks these two extremes ought not to be practiced by one who has gone forth from the household life
There is addiction to indulgence of sensepleasures which is low coarse the way of ordinary people unworthy and unprofitable and there is addiction to selfmortification which is painful unworthy and unprofitable
Avoiding both these extremes the Tathagata has realized the Middle Path it gives vision gives knowledge and leads to calm to insight to enlightenment and to Nibbana
And what is that Middle Path realized by the Tathagata
It is the Noble Eightfold path and nothing else namely right understanding right thought right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness and right concentration
This is the Middle Path realized by the Tathagata which gives vision which gives knowledge and leads to calm to insight to enlightenment and to Nibbana
The Noble Truth of Suffering monks is this Birth is suffering aging is suffering sickness is suffering death is suffering association with the unpleasant is suffering dissociation from the pleasant is suffering not to receive what one desires is suffering  in brief the five aggregates subject to grasping are suffering
The Noble Truth of the Origin of Suffering is this It is this craving which produces rebecoming accompanied by passionate greed and finding fresh delight now here and now there namely craving for sense pleasure craving for existence and craving for nonexistence
The Noble Truth of the Cessation of Suffering is this It is the complete cessation of that very craving giving it up relinquishing it liberating oneself from it and detaching oneself from it
The Noble Truth of the Path Leading to the Cessation of Suffering is this It is the Noble Eightfold Path and nothing else namely right understanding right thought right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness and right concentration
'This is the Noble Truth of Suffering' such was the vision the knowledge the wisdom the science the light that arose in me concerning things not heard before
'This suffering as a noble truth should be fully realized' such was the vision the knowledge the wisdom the science the light that arose in me concerning things not heard before
'This suffering as a noble truth has been fully realized' such was the vision the knowledge the wisdom the science the light that arose in me concerning things not heard before
'This is the Noble Truth of the Origin of Suffering' such was the vision the knowledge the wisdom the science the light that arose in me concerning things not heard before
'This Origin of Suffering as a noble truth should be eradicated' such was the vision the knowledge the wisdom the science the light that arose in me concerning things not heard before
'This Origin of suffering as a noble truth has been eradicated' such was the vision the knowledge the wisdom the science the light that arose in me concerning things not heard before
'This is the Noble Truth of the Cessation of Suffering' such was the vision the knowledge the wisdom the science the light that arose in me concerning things not heard before
'This Cessation of suffering as a noble truth should be realized' such was the vision the knowledge the wisdom the science the light that arose in me concerning things not heard before
'This Cessation of suffering as a noble truth has been realized' such was the vision the knowledge the wisdom the science the light that arose in me concerning things not heard before
'This is the Noble Truth of the Path leading to the cessation of suffering' such was the vision the knowledge the wisdom the science the light that arose in me concerning things not heard before
'This Path leading to the cessation of suffering as a noble truth should be developed' such was the vision the knowledge the wisdom the science the light that arose in me concerning things not heard before
'This Path leading to the cessation of suffering as a noble truth has been developed' such was the vision the knowledge the wisdom the science the light that arose in me concerning things not heard before
As long as my knowledge of seeing things as they really are was not quite clear in these three aspects in these twelve ways concerning the Four Noble Truths I did not claim to have realized the matchless supreme Enlightenment in this world with its gods with its Maras and Brahmas in this generation with its recluses and brahmanas with its Devas and humans
But when my knowledge of seeing things as they really are was quite clear in these three aspects in these twelve ways concerning the Four Noble Truths then I claimed to have realized the matchless supreme Enlightenment in this world with its gods with its Maras and Brahmas in this generation with its recluses and brahmanas with its Devas and humans
And a vision of insight arose in me thus 'Unshakable is the deliverance of my heart
This is the last birth
Now there is no more rebecoming' This the Blessed One said
The group of five monks was glad and they rejoiced at the words of the Blessed One
When this discourse was thus expounded there arose in the Venerable Kondañña the passionfree stainless vision of Truth dhammacakkhu in other words he attained sotapatti the first stage of sanctity and realized Whatever has the nature of arising has the nature of ceasing
Now when the Blessed One set in motion the Wheel of Truth the Bhummattha devas proclaimed The Matchless Wheel of Truth that cannot be set in motion by recluse brahmana deva Mara Brahma or any one in the world is set in motion by the Blessed One in the Deer Park at Isipatana near Varanasi
Hearing these words of the earth deities all the Catummaharajika devas proclaimed The Matchless Wheel of Truth that cannot be set in motion by recluse brahmana deva Mara Brahma or any one in the world is set in motion by the Blessed One in the Deer Park at Isipatana near Varanasi These words were heard in the upper deva realms and from Catummaharajika it was proclaimed in Tavatimsa Yama Tusita Nimmanarati Paranimmitavasavatti and the Brahmas of Brahma Parisajja Brahma Purohita Maha Brahma Parittabha Appamanabha Abhassara Parittasubha Appamana subha Subhakinna Vehapphala Aviha Atappa Sudassa Sudassi and in Akanittha The Matchless Wheel of Truth that cannot be set in motion by recluse brahmana deva Mara Brahma or any one in the world is set in motion by the Blessed One in the Deer Park at Isipatana near Varanasi
Thus at that very moment at that instant the cry spread as far as Brahma realm the system of ten thousand worlds trembled and quaked and shook
A boundless sublime radiance surpassing the effulgence of devas appeared in the world
Then the Blessed One uttered this paeon of joy Verily Kondañña has realized verily Kondañña has realized Thus it was that the Venerable Kondañña received the name Añña Knondañña'  Kondañña who realizes
With the proclamation of the Dhamma for the first time and with the conversion of the five ascetics the Deer Park at Isipatana became the birth place of the Buddha's Dispensation and the Sangha the community of monks the ordained disciples
Emperor Asoka years after the event came on pilgrimage to this holy spot and caused a series of monuments and a commemorative pillar with the lion capital to be erected
This capital with its four magnificent lions upholding the Dharma Cakra the Wheel of Dharma now stands in the museum of Sarnath and is today the official crest of India
The DharmaCakra festival is still maintained in Sri Lanka
Jawaharlal Nehru the late prime Minister of India writes At Sarnath near Benares I would almost see the Buddha preaching his first sermon and some of his recorded words would come like a distant echo to me through twothousand five hundred years
Asoka's pillars of stone with their inscriptions would speak to me in their magnificent language and tell me of a man who though an emperor was greater than any king or emperor  The Discovery of India p
Thus have I heard
On one occasion the Blessed One was living in the Mahavana near the city of Kapilavatthu in the province of the Sakyans together with a great retinue of monks all of them arahants and five hundred in number
Devas from ten thousand worldsystems frequently assembled for the purpose of seeing the Blessed One and the bhikkhusangha
Then to four devas of the Suddhavasa brahma world this thought occurred The Blessed One is living in the Mahavana near the city of Kapilavatthu in the province of the Sakyans with a great retinue of monks all of them arahants and five hundred in number
Devas are frequently assembling there for the purpose of seeing the Blessed One and the bhikkhusangha
It is well if we were also to repair to the place where the Blessed One is and each of us recite a stanza in his presence
Then those devas as quickly as a strong man might stretch out his arm or bend his outstretched arm vanished from the pure abodes and appeared before the Blessed One saluted him and stood beside him
So standing one of the devas recited this stanza in his presence
There is a great assembly in the forest
A host of devas has assembled
We have come to this dhammaassembly to see the invincible sangha
Then another deva recited this stanza in the presence of the Blessed One
The monks in this have collected their thoughts and made their minds upright
The wise guard their senses even as a charioteer holds the reins
Then another deva recited this stanza in the presence of the Blessed One
Having cut off the stake having dug up the crossbar devoid of desire they go their way pure stainless with vision clear and well tamed these young arahants move about like elephants
Then another deva recited this stanza in the presence of the Blessed One
They who go for refuge to the Buddha shall not go to evil state of existence but will quit the human body and fill the ranks of the devas
The Blessed One then addressed the monks Often monks devas from the ten worldsystems foregather to see the Tathagata and the monks the community of bhikkhus
Devas have assembled before the consummate supreme Buddhas of the past devas will appear before the consummate supreme Buddhas of the future as they do assemble now before me
I will tell you monks the names of the host of devas I will reveal the names of the host of devas
Listen pay attention
I will speak Yes Venerable Sir said the monks by way of assent
The Blessed One said this

In measured speech I will give utterance
The terrestrial devas remain in their realm
Those bent on meditation frequent rocky clefts
Well composed they live like solitary lions overcoming the fear that causes hair to stand on end with immaculate minds pure serene and undefiled
Knowing that there were in the forest near the city of Kapilavatthu five hundred and more disciples delighted in the word of the Buddha the Master thereupon addressed them
Monks hosts of devas have assembled
Do know them well And they hearing the word of the Buddha strove ardently
There arose in them knowledge of perceiving the nonhumans
Some saw one hundred some thousand nonhumans and others seventy thousand nonhumans
Some saw one hundred thousand nonhumans others saw countless numbers every quarter being filled with them
Thereupon the seeing One knowing all things through super knowledge addressed the disciples delighted in the word of the Buddha
Monks host of devas have assembled
I will announce them to you in words and in due order
Know ye them

Thus have I heard
On one occasion the Blessed One was living in the abode of Alavaka the Yakkha at Alavi
Then Alavaka approached the Blessed One and said Get out recluse  Very well friend so saying the Blessed One went out
Come in recluse  Very well friend so saying the Blessed One entered
Get out recluse said Alavaka to the Blessed One a second time
 Very well friend so saying the Blessed One went out
Come in recluse  Very well friend so saying the Blessed One entered
Get out recluse said Alavaka to the Blessed One a third time
 Very well friend so saying the Blessed One went out
Come in recluse  Very well friend so saying the Blessed One entered
Get out recluse said Alavaka to the Blessed One a fourth time
 No O friend I will not get out
Do what you will
I will ask you a question recluse
If you do not answer me I will confound your mind or cleave your heart or take you by your feet and fling you over to the further shore of the ocean
Well friend I do not see anyone in the world of Devas Maras Brahmas or among the generation of recluses brahmanas deities and humans who could either confound my mind or cleave my heart or take me by the feet and fling me over to the further shore of the ocean nevertheless friend ask what you will
Then Alavaka addressed the Blessed One in verse
Having thus spoken Alavaka said to the Blessed One
Most excellent O Gotama is thy teaching most excellent
Just as a man would set upright what is overturned reveal what is concealed point out the way to one gone astray bring an oil lamp into the darkness so that those with eyes could see objects even so the Dhamma has been declared in many a manner by the Venerable Gotama
I take refuge in the Venerable Gotama in the Dhamma and in the Sangha
May the Venerable Gotama accept me as a disciple who has taken refuge from this day forth while life lasts
Thus have I heard
On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Dakkhinagiri in the brahmana village Ekanala in Magadha
Now at that time it being the sowing season five hundred plows of the brahman Kasibharadvaja were put to use
Then in the forenoon the Blessed One having dressed himself took bowl and robe and went to the place where brahman Kasibharadvaja's work was going on
It was the time of food distribution by the brahman and the Blessed One drew near and stood at one side
Bharadvaja seeing the Blessed One standing there for alms said to him
Recluse I do plow and do sow and having plowed and sown I eat
You also recluse should plow and sow having plowed and sown you should eat
I too brahman plow and sow having plowed and sown I eat
We do not see the Venerable Gotama's yoke or plow or plowshare or goad or oxen
Nevertheless the Venerable Gotama says 'I too brahman plow and sow having plowed and sown I eat' Thereupon the brahman addressed the Blessed One in a stanza
You profess to be a plowman yet your plow we do not see asked about your plow and the rest tell us of them that we may know
Faith is my seed austerity the rain wisdom my yoke and plow modesty is the pole mind the strap mindfulness is my plowshare and goad
Controlled in speech and conduct guarded in deed and speech abstemious in food I make truth my weed cutter arahantship my deliverance complete
Exertion my team in yoke draws me to Nibbana's security and on it goes without stopping wither gone one does not suffer
Thuswise is this plowing plowed which bears the fruit of Deathlessness having plowed this plowing one is freed from every ill
Then brahman Kasibharadvaja filling a golden bowl with milkrice offered it to the Blessed One saying May the Venerable Gotama partake of this milk rice a plowman indeed is Venerable Gotama who plows a plow for the fruit of Deathlessness
What I receive by reciting verses O brahman I should not eat
It is not the tradition of those who practice right livelihood
The Buddhas reject what is received by reciting verses
This brahman is the conduct as long as Dhamma reigns
To those wholly consummate taintless and welldisciplined great sages should thou offer other food and drink sure field is that for meritseeking men
To whom then Venerable Gotama shall I give this milk rice
Brahman in the world of Devas Maras and Brahmas or among the generation of recluses brahmanas deities and humans there is no one by whom this milk rice if eaten could be wholly digested except by the Tathagata or the disciple of a Tathagata
Therefore brahman either cast this milk rice where there is no grass or into water where there are no living creatures
Thereupon the brahman flung that milk rice into water where there were no living creatures and the milk rice thrown into the water smoked and steamed making the noise cicchita citicita just like a plowshare heated during the day when thrown into water smokes and steams making the noise cicchita citicita
Then the brahman Kasibharadvaja alarmed with hair standing on end approached and fell with his head at the Blessed One's feet and said as follows
Most excellent O Gotama is thy teaching most excellent
Just as a man would set upright what is overturned reveal what is concealed point out the way to one gone astray bring an oil lamp into the darkness so that those with eyes could see objects even so the Dhamma has been declared in many a manner by the Venerable Gotama
I take refuge in the Venerable Gotama in the Dhamma and in the Sangha
I wish to receive the novice's ordination and higher ordination
Brahman Kasibharadvaja duly received both the pabbajja and upasampada from the Blessed One
Not long after his upasampada the Venrable Bharadvaja dwelling alone and aloof diligent strenuous and resolute ere long by his own insight here and now realized and attained the highest perfection the end of the Noble Life  for the sake of which men of good family go forth from home to live the homeless life
Birth is destroyed lived is the noble life done is what has to be done there is no more of this state
The Venerable Bharadvaja became one of the arahants
Having heard the discourse on Blessings which deals with things that tend to man's weal and prosperity the deities thought to themselves The Buddha has told us about the blessings but not about the downfall and decline of man what if we were to approach the Buddha and question him about the things that tend to downfall So the day after the teaching of the Blessings by the Buddha the deities came up to the Master and asked these questions

Thus have I heard
On one occasion the Blessed One was living near Savatthi at Jetavana at Anathapindika's monastery
Now when the night was far advanced a certain deity whose surpassing radiance illuminated the whole of Jetavana came to the presence of the Blessed One respectfully saluted him and stood beside him
Standing thus he addressed the Blessed One in verse
About the declining man we question thee Gotama
We have come to ask the Blessed One What is the cause of his downfall
Easily known is the progressive one easily known is the declining one
The lover of the Dhamma prospers
The hater of the Dhamma declines
We understand this as explained this is the first cause of his downfall
Tell us the second O Blessed One
What is the cause of his downfall
The vicious are dear to him
He likes not the virtuous he approves the teachings of the illnatured  this is the cause of his downfall
We understand this as explained by thee this is the second cause of his downfall
Tell us the third O Blessed One
What is the cause of his downfall
The man who is fond of sleep and company inactive and lazy and manifesting anger this is the cause of his downfall
We understand this as explained by thee this is the third cause of his downfall
Tell us the fourth O Blessed One
What is the cause of his downfall
Whoever being affluent does not support his mother and father who are old and past their prime  this is the cause of his downfall
We understand this as explained by thee this is the fourth cause of his downfall
Tell us the fifth O Blessed One
What is the cause of his downfall
Whoever by falsehood deceives either a brahmana or a samana or any other mendicant  this is the cause of his downfall
We understand this as explained by thee this is the fifth cause of his downfall
Tell us the six O Blessed One
What is the cause of his downfall
The person who is possessed of much wealth who has gold and who has an abundance of food but enjoys his delicacies all by himself  this is the cause of his downfall
We understand this as explained by thee this is the sixth cause of his downfall

Thus have I heard
On one occasion the Blessed One was living near Savatthi at Jetavana at Anathapindika's monastery
Then in the forenoon the Blessed One having dressed himself took bowl and robe and entered the city of Savatthi for alms
Now at that time a fire was burning and an offering was being prepared in the house of the brahman Aggikabharadvaja
Then the Blessed One while on his alms round came to the brahman's residence
The brahman seeing the Blessed One some way off said this Stay there you shaveling stay there you wretched monk stay there you outcast When he spoke thus the Blessed One said to the brahman Do you know brahman who an outcast is and what the conditions are that make an outcast No indeed Venerable Gotama I do not know who an outcast is nor the conditions that make an outcast
It is good if Venerable Gotama were to explain the Dhamma to me so that I may know who an outcast is and what the conditions are that make an outcast
Listen then brahman and pay attention I will speak
Yes Venerable Sir replied the brahman
Whosoever is angry harbors hatred and is reluctant to speak well of others perverted in views deceitful  know him as an outcast
Whosoever in this world kills living beings once born or twice born in whom there is no sympathy for living beings  know him as an outcast
Whosoever destroys and besieges villages and hamlets and becomes notorious as an oppressor  know him as an outcast
Be it in the village or in the forest whosoever steals what belongs to others what is not given to him  know him as an outcast
Whosoever having actually incurred a debt runs away when he is pressed to pay saying 'I owe no debt to you'  know him as an outcast
Whosoever coveting anything kills a person going along the road and grabs whatever that person has  know him as an outcast
He who for his own sake or for the sake of others or for the sake of wealth utters lies when questioned as a witness  know him as an outcast
Whosoever by force or with consent associates with the wives of relatives or friends  know him as an outcast
Whosoever being wealthy supports not his mother and father who have grown old  know him as an outcast
Whosoever strikes and annoys by speech mother father brother sister or motherinlaw or fatherinlaw  know him as an outcast
Whosoever when questioned about what is good says what is detrimental and talks in an evasive manner know him as an outcast
Whosoever having committed an evil deed wishes that it may not be known to others and commits evil in secret  know him as an outcast
Whosoever having gone to another's house and partaken of choice food does not honor that host by offering food when he repays the visit  know him as an outcast
Whosoever deceives by uttering lies a brahman or an ascetic or any other mendicant  know him as an outcast
Whosoever when a brahman or ascetic appears during mealtime angers him by harsh speech and does not offer him  know him as an outcast
Whosoever in this world shrouded in ignorance speaks harsh words or falsehood expecting to gain something  know him as an outcast
Whosoever debased by his pride exalts himself and belittles other  know him as an outcast
Whosoever is given to anger is miserly has base desires and is selfish deceitful shameless and fearless  know him as an outcast
Whosoever reviles the Enlightened One or a disciple of the Buddha recluse or a householder  know him as an outcast
Whosoever not being an arahant a Consummate One pretends to be so is a thief in the whole universe  he is the lowest of outcasts
Not by birth is one an outcast not by birth is one a brahman
By deed one becomes an outcast by deed one becomes a brahman
Know ye by the example I now cite
There was an outcast's son Sopaka who became known as Matanga
This Matanga attained the highest fame so difficult to gain
Many were the warriors and brahmans who went to attend on him
Mounting the celestial chariot along the passionfree high road reached the Brahma realm having given up sense desires
His birth did not prevent him from being reborn in the Brahma realm
There are brahmans born in the family of preceptors kinsmen of hymns
They are often seen committing evil deeds
In this life itself they are despised in the next they are born in an evil state of existence
High birth does not prevent them from falling into a woeful state or from censure
Not by birth is one an outcast not by birth is one a brahman
By deed one becomes an outcast by deed one becomes an brahman
When the Buddha had thus spoken the Brahman Aggikabharadvaja said to the Blessed One Excellent O Venerable Gotama excellent
Just as O Venerable Gotama a man were to set upright what had been overturned or were to reveal what had been hidden or were to point the way to one who had gone astray or were to hold an oil lamp in the dark so that those with eyes may see things even so in many ways has the Venerable Gotama expounded the Dhamma the doctrine
I take refuge in the Venerable Gotama the Dhamma and the Sangha the Order
May the Venerable Gotama accept me as a lay follower who has taken refuge from this day onwards while life lasts
Thus have I heard
On one occasion the Blessed One was living in the Deer Park at Isipatana near Varanasi

Thereupon he said

Thus have I heard
On one occasion the Blessed One was living on the Vulture's Peak near Rajagaha
Then four great kings having placed a guard over the four quarters with a large army of Yakkhas of Gandhabbas of Kumbhandas of Nagas having placed troops having placed a barricade of soldiers on four sides came to the presence of the Blessed One when the night was far advanced illuminating the entire Vulture's Peak with their surpassing radiance saluted the Blessed One and sat on one side
From among the Yakkhas some saluted the Blessed One and sat on one side some exchanged greetings with the Blessed One conversing in a friendly and courteous manner and sat on one side some saluted him with clasped hands and sat on one side some announced their name and lineage and sat on one side some sat on one side in silence
Then the great King Vessavana who was seated on one side said to the Blessed One
Venerable Sir there are eminent Yakkhas who are not pleased with the Blessed One there are also eminent Yakkhas pleased with the Blessed One
There are Yakkhas of middle rank who are not pleased with the Blessed One and there are those who are pleased with the Blessed One
There are Yakkhas of inferior rank who are not pleased with the Blessed One and there are those who are pleased with the Blessed One
The Yakkhas bhante as a rule are not pleased with the Blessed One
What is the reason for this
Well the Blessed One teaches the Dhamma to establish abstention from killing from stealing from sexual misconduct from false speech and from liquor that causes intoxication and negligence
To them such teaching is unpleasant and unpalatable
Surely bhante there are disciples of the Blessed One
They frequent the remote recesses of forest and woodland wilderness where there is no sound no tumult where breezes are void of human contact and suitable for man's seclusion and quiet contemplation
There are eminent Yakkhas who haunt these forests who have no faith in the word of the Blessed One
Bhante may the Blessed One learn the Atanata protection so that the displeased Yakkhas may be pleased so that the monks and nuns laymen and laywomen may be at ease guarded protected and unharmed
The Blessed One gave consent by his silence
Then the great King Vessavana knowing that the Blessed One had consented recited the Atanatiya protection

They approached the Buddha with the intention of obtaining his approval in which event they felt that this Paritta will attain a revered position satthu kathite imam parittam garu bhavissatiti pi aha
Learn ugganhatha There is nothing for the Buddha to learn afresh
As the Commentary says it was to create an opportunity for the Buddha to listen to the discourse Imam parittam savetum okasam karonto evamha
The Venerable Angulimala while on his rounds for alms in Savatthi saw a woman in travail
After his meal he approached the Buddha and told him what he had seen
Thereupon the master taught him this paritta
He then went to the presence of the suffering sister sat on a seat separated from her by a screen and made this asseveration of the Truth
Instantly she gave birth to the child with great ease
The efficacy of the Angulimala paritta persists to this day
This sutta is not included in the Book of Protection The words uttered by the Buddha by way of protection and learned by the Venerable Angulimala are found in the Angulimala sutta
The very water that washed the seat of him who recited this paritta has put an end to all danger
At that very moment this paritta effected a safe delivery of the infant
Now we shall recite that very efficacious paritta uttered by the Protector of the world which holds good for an aeon
Since I was born of Aryan birth O sister I am not aware of having intentionally deprived any living being of his life
By this asseveration of Truth may you be well
May thy unborn child be well
May devas of all world systems assemble here and listen to that sublime Dhamma of the Great Sage which confers the bliss of heaven and deliverance
Good friends now is time for listening to the Dhamma
At the end of the recital of each discourse the reciters bless the listeners thus
May all misfortunes be warded off may all ailments cease may no calamities befall you may you live long in peace
May all blessings be upon you
May all devas protect you
By the protective power of all the Buddhas may safety ever be yours
By the protective power of all the Dhamma may safety ever be yours
By the protective power of all the Sangha may safety ever be yours
By the power of this paritta may you be free from all dangers arising from malign influences of the planets demons and spirits
May thy misfortunes vanish
By the power of the Buddha may all evil omens and untoward circumstances the ominous cry of birds the malign conjunctions of the stars and evil dreams be rendered nugatory
By the power of the Dhamma be rendered nugatory
By the power of the Sangha be rendered nugatory
May those beings who suffer be free from suffering
May those beings who are in fear be free from fear
May those beings who are in grief be free from grief
May the rains fall in due season may there be a rich harvest may the world prosper may the ruler be righteous
May beings celestial and terrestrial Devas and Nagas of mighty power share this merit of ours
May they long protect the Dispensation
May all beings share this merit which we have thus acquired
May it redound to their happiness
Let this accrue to my relatives may they be well and happy
From the highest realm of existence to avici hell whatever beings that are born  those with form and the formless ones those with or without consciousness  may they all be free from suffering
May they attain Nibbana
By the power of the immense merit I have acquired by paying homage to the Triple Gem which is eminently worthy of reverence may all dangers cease

Through the power of merit that has been created may she be freed from all suffering
May all those who read this short book take its teachings to heart reflect on them and practice accordingly so as to realize true liberation
 Looang Boo Sim Buddhacaro
Now it is time for sitting meditation
Sit in the crosslegged posture place the right leg on top of the left leg and the right hand on top of the left hand
Close your eyes and inwardly recite the mantra Buddho in conjunction with the breath
Concentrate the mind on Buddho
Sitting meditation is an important way of paying homage to the Buddha
The Buddha called all our former experiences irrespective of their quality thoughts of the past
Now in this moment do not allow such thoughts to preoccupy the mind
Let them all go
Concentrate the mind on the inner recitation of the mantra and bring the mind to peace in the present in the immediate reality
It is the present moment that is important
Future matters good and bad all still lie ahead for by definition the future refers to things that have not yet taken place
The meditator must compose his mind on the present moment
If a thought surfaces in consciousness simply remind yourself that it is just a thought of the past or a thought of the future as the case may be
Don't add to or encourage such thoughts
Put good thoughts to one side for the time being and the bad ones abandon altogether
Sitting here our bodies are in a tranquil posture
The knowing is abiding within the heart and each one of us is aware
This present knowing is our true mind
The conditioned mind of thought and proliferation is almost like a demon
Through its actions external phenomena tend to become preoccupations which then obstruct or destroy meditation
But if the meditator grounds himself in the present moment then he is able to make use of the various meditation techniques
He may develop inner recitation for example or perhaps focus on parts of the physical body such as head hair body hair nails teeth skin sinews and bones
When contemplation of the body ensues in perception of its unattractiveness or of its constituent elements of hardness cohesion temperature and vibration then that is meditation
When the mind is at peace in the recitation of Buddho then that too is meditation
And the meditator is the mind
The mind itself has no color shape or form but it has energy
It is our duty to let go of and abandon the conditioned proliferating mind
But the mind of present knowing that which concentrates on Buddha listens to Dhamma and reflects on its meaning having been clearly observed that true mind should be developed
In this case to develop means to give care and attention to establishing it in peace
Peace comes by countering the outgoing stream of mentality and penetrating this present knowing
The normal unrestrained mind is absorbed by the thoughtconsciousness seeking distraction
Go against the stream by looking at the source of mental activity
It originates from this knowing
The source of the mind lies within us
However this knowing is nothing substantial
It has no color form or shape in the way that material objects do
It is a formless element
To speak in terms of the five aggregates there is
What is it that knows the true mind and what is it that knows the conditioned mind
It is just this one single knowing the same thing that hears the sound of the discourse and meditates on Buddho As there is just this single knowing muster your energies and vow to yourself I will not indulge the thinking mind
I will gather the mind into itself Not allowing the mind to wander means that it stays with Buddho
All you have to do then is to maintain Buddho
Buddho is the name of the Fully Enlightened One and should be reflected on
That we have come into contact with Buddhism with Buddha Dhamma and Sangha and that we have come to practice is due to the Buddha
The Buddha after realizing supreme enlightenment gave to the world the teachings of DhammaVinaya that we call Buddhism
The great teachers of old and the four assemblies of Buddhists have carried on the study and practice of the teachings right up until the present time
In Thailand today everywhere we go we see monasteries monks and novices eightprecept laymen and laywomen and householders with faith and inspiration in Buddhism
This is all thanks to the Buddha
It has been a long time  over years  since the Buddha entered final nibbana
Even so the Dhamma and Vinaya the teachings and the ordinances based on the and precepts still remain
We bring the virtues of the Buddha to mind in order to be able to take him as an example in our practice
Where did the Buddha come from
He came from the mind that resolved on Buddhahood and wished to ferry all beings to nibbana
From the moment of his initial resolve in whatever realm the Buddhatobe was born into then whenever he performed acts of charity refrained from unvirtuous actions and speech or practiced meditation then Buddhahood was always his motivation
Whenever he was born as a human being he accumulated virtue
Eventually the power of goodness created by his dana sila and bhavana the paramis that he had developed were strong enough for him to become Buddha
Now in recollecting the Buddha we take his virtues as our object
Buddho refers to the Lord Buddha and the one who inwardly recites Buddho is just this mind
It is just this mind that recites Buddho knows Buddho knows the breath and is aware while doing so that one is creating virtue
This mind has always been here
The knowing has been born into the world countless times but because ignorance and craving have overwhelmed it our dana sila and bhavana have been insufficient to free us from the mass of suffering with which the human organism is fraught
So we must muster our energy with firm resolve taking meditative calm as our foundation
The principles that will lead us out of this world and the mass of suffering are those of samatha and vipassana meditation
The mind must be firmly onepointed tranquil cool and at ease with samatha before vipassana is feasible
If the mind is still in movement drifting and infirm still not tranquil and motionless or onepointed it is impossible for understanding of the nature of things to take place
Take as example the founder of our religion the fully selfenlightened Buddha
Before his enlightenment he practiced calm meditation using the breath as his initial object
On the day of his enlightenment he practiced this way
On the inbreath he focussed intently on the inbreath
On the outbreath he focussed intently on the outbreath
All mental agitation and movement ceased leaving only the inbreaths and outbreaths remaining
The Lord's mind was focussed intently on the breath until his mind became calm cool and easeful attaining the firmness of khanika upacara and ultimately the unwavering appana samadhi
When the Buddhatobe's mind was thus unwaveringly and undeviatingly singlepointed vipassana took place there was clear knowing of the body and mind as impermanent of all beings and phenomena as transitory
He saw the suffering inherent in being born with a body and mind and he saw selflessness
He realized that the perception of an abiding self is based on delusion
In order to clearly know these three characteristics of aniccam dukkham and anatta the mind must be firm
Thus the effort to bring the mind to a secure and steadfast tranquillity not allowing it to become fascinated by forms sounds odors flavors physical sensations and mental phenomena is the essence of meditation techniques and something we must all develop
Take care when the eyes see forms not to let the mind waver keep up the inner recitation of Buddho
Take care not to be deluded when hearing sounds beautiful or ugly sounds are all just worldly conditions
Maintain the mind's firmness
The pleasant and offensive odors that contact the nose  know them don't be deceived by them
No matter how delicious the taste of the food on the tongue  remain equanimous
Be impassive to the various physical sensations whether hot or cold hard or soft
This is the supreme practice in Buddhism
So gather your energies and establish the mind in the present moment
In general meditator's minds are not unified and tranquil in the present moment  they are wandering up ahead and back behind taking up external matters concerning other people and dwelling on them finding pleasure and satisfaction in agreeable mental states
They are caught up entirely in superficialities
Although the mind of simple knowing is already present within us unless we bring it to the fore through meditation we will be unable to perceive the truth of suffering
When suffering arises in the body contemplate it so that the mind will accept it for what it is
When physical illness occurs the grasping mind starts clinging to the idea of being ill
In fact it is the earthelement that is unwell
If the meditator's mind is stable and clearly sees the three characteristics he will simply regard illness as an affair of the elements
He knows that the mind is formless and not subject to such pains
It is due to clinging to the idea of self and that the body belongs to self that mental suffering arises
In fact this body is merely elements and it is the elements that are sick
It is the earth water fire and air elements that are disturbed
If one can separate things in this way then the mind rests at ease
Whatever occurs in the physical body there is no clinging to it as belonging to self
It is seen as simply a matter of elements a matter of aniccam dukkham anatta it is just the nature of things
The present knowing clearly truly and constantly
The mind is cool no longer hot with clinging
Suppose someone harshly scolds or maligns us
Even if they abuse us right to our faces if we don't cling it ends right there
What has arisen passes away
But if the knowing is misled it grasps at this body and mind as being self
When someone speaks to us harshly we get angry That's nothing to do with me Due to clinging there is me and mine It is just this clinging that is the cause of suffering agitation turmoil and disease
The Buddha taught us to let go of all external affairs during meditation whatever physical or mental distress arises is just the suffering of the aggregates don't let the knowing suffer
Meditate in order to attenuate the defilements of greed hatred and delusion and ultimately bring them to an end
When the knowing is still deluded and clings to the idea of self to me and mine then it takes birth
Perhaps it becomes an animal a human being a celestial being Indra or a Brahma god
But whatever it becomes it suffers just in being that
As long as there is still clinging to the elements and aggregates to name and form and there is no awareness of the way to abandon defilements then there is suffering in the world
The five aggregates are classified as suffering in the world for when one clings to them as me and mine then right there the mass of suffering appears
We sit right on the pile of suffering in the midst of the fire of craving hatred and delusion
The fire flares up and constantly burns our heart
We are meditating now so as to gather the mind into the knowing in order to put out the fires that are burning our hearts
Don't harbor the fire of anger
Abandon it
There is no need to get angry with anyone
If you feel any jealousy or illwill towards anyone give it up
Don't allow the mind to indulge in it
This is cleansing the knowing both day and night whether standing sitting walking or laying down
It is not clinging to me and mine The aggregates do not belong to anyone they are something natural to the world
As soon as the knowing is born with a name and form it tends to grasp onto that name and form as self
But can that name and form last indefinitely
If it could nobody would die nobody would become ill nobody would experience pain or get old because the aggregates would do what they are told
It is because the aggregates don't do what they are told that the Buddha taught us not to cling to them but to see them clearly with penetrative wisdom
If there is no clear seeing then there is suffering
So don't be fooled into clinging onto things it is suffering in the world
When the knowing no longer clings it is empty it is in meditation it is cool and at ease
All the different kinds of mental turmoil come from delusion the agitated striving mind that wants to possess want to get wants to be in other words the mind of craving
Get rid of craving and clinging from the mind
Try to prevent anything from accumulating in this knowing
Make the present knowing radiant and pure
Meditate
Firmly ground the mind
Gather the knowing onto itself and abandon the cognition of externals
Let the knowing dwell in the heart
Whatever the posture of the body let the knowing know itself at all times
If an evil thought arises abandon it
If goodness occurs develop it and here the goodness we resolve to develop is exemplified by the mantra Buddho We develop it or concentrate on it internally so as to make the mind cool and happy
We prevent agitation and distress with the elements and aggregates with the bodies and minds of other people
We don't allow them inside
When the mind is thus cool and at ease it is said that Buddho is dwelling in the heart
In other words the knowing lies within
To produce this firm and enduring tranquillity you must go against the stream and enter within
Then you will understand the practice of Dhamma with the mindfulness and wisdom that are present in the heart
If there is no countering the stream and no entry within the search for virtue externally is an endless one
Truth and virtue do not lie beneath the land or sea or in the sky or in space
They lie in volitions the mind that makes effort to give up evil and do good
When the mind converges right here it becomes spacious cool and easeful it is established in Dhamma practice
Sitting there is meditation in the sitting posture standing there is meditation in the standing posture walking there is meditation while walking and lying down there is meditation until one falls asleep
As soon as we wake we continue the inner recitation of Buddho making Buddho our constant concern
Wherever the mind goes we don't follow it
We give up all the going and settle for dwelling
The knowing lies right here within us everything else is merely a passing affair
The truth lies with the knowing
Clearly observe that since our birth into this world the knowing has dwelt in the body
Wherever we go the body goes too
The knowing cannot escape from the body and mind
It drags the body with it here and there
When we sit it is the body that sits and when we lay down it is the body that lays down and so the knowing is deceived into attaching to that name and form the provisional realities of the world
Not comprehending the way to withdraw from them and put them down the defilements of greed hatred and delusion steadily accumulate
So in studying Buddhism whether it's the Dhamma or the Discipline whatever method it is being taught by having studied we must put those teachings into practice
We must compose this knowing firmly on itself
Keep the mind within don't allow it to wander about and become fascinated with sentient beings and the material world through delusion and unclear seeing
Resolve to put forth effort
Aspire to rid yourself of defilements
Greed hatred and delusion all lie here within the mind so put effort into abandoning them just here
Be vigilant and care for the mind right here
Recite Buddho right here
Compose the knowing
When we have established the knowing in this way then in whatever posture we are in there is constant meditation
Sitting here we can inwardly recite Buddho undistracted and undeceived by external matters
We have been deluded by the external world for countless lifetimes
Let us not be deluded by it any more
Now it is time for meditation
Sit in the crosslegged posture
Place your right leg on your left and your right hand on your left one
Sit up straight
The time of sitting meditation is a time to stop
Close your eyes right now there is nothing to do and nowhere to go you have no need for them
Once your eyes are closed recollect that the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha all lie within our minds
Don't conceive of them as existing outside ourselves
It is just this mind that inwardly recites Buddho on every inhalation and exhalation
It is just this mind that is the foundation of the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha
It is here that the practice takes place
The DhammaVinaya all the vast number of teachings that the Buddha gave all share the single purpose of bringing our minds to peace the attenuation and abandonment of greed hatred and delusion
The teachings of the Buddha were given over a period of fortyfive years from the time of his enlightenment until the day of his death
In the Buddhist scriptures there is a grouping of the teachings into three sections the Discourses the Monastic Regulations and the Abhidhamma
In all it is said there are teachings
Considered according to the principles of Dhamma our bodies are like the carved wooden cupboard in which the scriptures are kept
The Discourses the Monastic Regulations and the Abhidhamma are each person's action speech and mind
We can make this comparison for the reason that every single teaching was given in order to be actualized by the disciple who received it
So in our practice let us keep the precepts  or according to our situation
Let us practice samadhi and cultivate wisdom
Spiritual practice was summarized by the Buddha as the threefold training of sila samadhi and pañña
If sila is pure and samadhi is firm enough to give rise to pañña then the path to liberation from defilements is manifest
In sitting meditation do not be deceived by the thoughtdemon
Those people who only sit a little or don't sit at all are the ones who believe in the thoughtdemon
For instance we decide to sit before dawn and the thoughtdemon tells us it is too early why not sit later on
If we believe it then our morning session is lost we don't sit
Later on in the morning and perhaps we forget altogether but if we do remember just as we are about to rouse ourselves and do some sitting meditation the thoughtdemon pipes up again
You don't want to sit yet
You've just had your breakfast your stomach is still full
Have a rest first
You can always do some sitting in the afternoon If we believe it that's delusion
Before dawn it says meditate later on in the morning
Later on in the morning it says meditate in the afternoon
If you digest your food first you will feel much more comfortable If we believe it we don't sit
In the afternoon it starts again
We end up just believing the thoughtdemon all day and all night and so get nothing from meditation
Before the Buddha's enlightenment it was this belief in the thoughtdemon that obstructed him
He just kept continually procrastinating
It took six years from the time of leaving home until he finally came to his senses and stopped believing the thoughtdemon
Just picture it now
On the day of his enlightenment the Buddhatobe sat down with his back to the bodhi tree facing slightly north of east
Then he made a solemn vow an absolutely firm resolution that his sitting that night would be a lifeordeath affair under no circumstances would he rise from his seat until he was enlightened
He would die first
The Buddhatobe had seen through the thoughtdemon's tricks
He had realized that it was because of falling for the constant lies and deceptions of the thoughtdemon that he was still unenlightened
On that Visakha Puja night the Lord did not move from his seat he just sat
Even so it says in the scriptures that the daughters of Mara all the hosts of temptation attacked him strongly
But the Buddha did not give in
They urged him to get up but he would not
The Buddha focussed his attention on his breathing
If he did get up he knew that all that awaited him was death at most he might postpone it for eighty or a hundred years and so he just looked intently at his breathing
He reflected that if after inhalation some obstruction or other prevented the exhalation then he would die
If after exhalation some blockage in the lungs prevented inhalation then also he would die
The Buddha just stayed with the breath seeing death in every inhalation and exhalation
There was still no Buddha Dhamma or Sangha
The Buddha was not yet the Buddha his mind had been pushed around for so long by the thoughtdemon
So he took up the subject of death to teach his mind with every inhalation and exhalation until a strong conviction and clarity of mind arose in him that death is indeed certain that with the cutting off of the breath death is inevitable
The Buddha looked intently to see the inevitability of death with every breath
He reflected There is no one born into this world that does not die
If people do not die as children then they die as youths
If they do not die in their youth they die in their old age
If they die then I must die
I must completely abandon the defilements of greed hatred and delusion before death
I must realize enlightenment The Buddhatobe made a firm and unwavering resolve
He brought to mind all the virtues that he had developed to perfection those of giving morality renunciation wisdom endurance truthfulness resolution kindness and equanimity and he allowed them to converge in the mind as it was aware of the breathing
The Lord's mind was as solid as the earth more so perhaps because the earth is still subject to tremors
As for the mind of the Buddhatobe as he recollected the charity morality and meditation that he had practiced and concentrated them in this firm mind more solid than Mother Earth absolutely immoveable then he felt ready even to sacrifice his life
If death had come to him at that moment he would have felt no fear
The teachers of old described that moment with an image
They say the earth goddess squeezed waters from the bun of her hair that swept away the hosts of Mara into the jaws of a fabulous crocodile
This is putting it figuratively
The earth goddess is the earth
When our minds are firm and stable like the earth we can vanquish the thoughtdemon the defilementdemon overcome all the myriad forms of craving and clinging
Consider the nature of the earth
The rain falls in the monsoon season and the earth is unaffected
The sun blazes in the hot season hot enough to cause fires and in the winter the weather is so cold that frost forms on the grasstips and yet the earth remains unmoved
Mankind appears and divides the world up into countries
It digs and mines and burns the earth does all sorts of things even drops atom bombs on it
But the earth remains impassive
If the mind of an ordained or unordained person has a true and clear conviction in the Buddha's teachings then it will not waver in any way
For such a person tiredness and exhaustion is merely an affair of the aggregates
Wherever the body or form aggregate exists there is going to be hunger weariness and exhaustion as a matter of course
The body has to eat it has to sleep it needs all kinds of things
That is a matter of aggregates a matter of elements
We should not let the mind waver in the fact of those conditions
When you set out to do something sitting meditation for example don't let the demons of thought and defilement fool you
Or if as a monk you make a resolution to keep the ascetic practice of not laying down then make your resolution firm
Don't start worrying about the effects it might have on your health
No illness transcends death
Death is the worst that can happen
If you miss your sleep even if you really suffer you'll just die that's all
Let the thoughtdemon know that you are ready to battle with death and it won't come to deceive you again
Sit and cultivate Buddho with every inhalation and exhalation
If meditators' minds are firmly established in this way they will feel a lightness in body and mind and a brightness and clarity as if a powerful force has arisen within them
Such a mind is brave and courageous without fear of death or fear of tiredness not frail and timid
When you have spare time rush to meditate
Hurry it's urgent
If you don't wish to do it urgently you won't do it at all
You will believe the thoughtdemon or believe people not interested in meditation and they will discourage you
The Buddha said turitturitam singhasingham  Rush hurry it's urgent
Meditate on every inhalation and exhalation
Determine to practice right at this moment
If we don't then the demons of thought and defilement will lead us away into old age and death
Even on the day of death we still won't have the time
The people who have no time to practice are the people who believe in the thoughtdemon
All of you who are practicing Dhamma don't believe the thoughtdemon
Teach it at every breath This is the breath
It may cease at any moment The Buddha himself used the breathing process as the subject of calm meditation and the foundation of insight meditation
It was the ground of his Dhamma practice
All of us too are inhaling and exhaling we too all have body and mind
As the Buddha did if we overcome the defilements in our hearts we will clearly perceive Nibbana
This is certain
Why bother doubting about it
Indecision unwillingness to commit oneself to Dhamma practice or to put forth effort at this very moment it's just that sort of mental state that the Buddha called doubt
Get rid of your doubts
The Buddha taught us not to reach out towards the past or future
If we do we get stuck
We don't get anywhere at all
But if we ground the mind in the present we can testify to the inner knowing that lies within us all
If that knowing didn't exist then how could we talk how could we come and listen to Dhamma
It exists and it is right in that knowing that lie virtue and accumulated purity
We meditate in order to gather the energies of the mind into this inner knowing
We put down thoughts and senseconsciousness the defiled mind that goes out in search of distractions
We give up thinking of friends and families forests and streams everything that lies outside of the present moment
It's all false and wrong
What is right what is straight is that which the Buddha called tattha or in that place In that place refers to the knowing that lies within our mind
When the energy of the mind is pacified unified and grounded on the knowing a firm faith and confidence in that knowing arises
There is sila  and it is the knowing that keeps sila that cares for actions and speech
There is samadhi  and it is the knowing that is firm
There is pañña  and it is the knowing that has direct knowledge of the mass of physical and mental conditions
There is nothing that lies beyond the mind
This mind can both know truly and know deludedly
When we justly allow it to blindly follow forms sounds odors flavors tangible objects and ideas it is deceived day and night from birth until old age from old age until death
It can be fascinated by those things for innumerable lifetimes
When we come to meditate we put effort into burning up the defilements in our hearts so that they diminish and finally come to an end
Thus our effort is concentrated on this mind
We keep reminding ourselves that apart from this knowing that is established in the present moment everything  be it past or present good or bad  is all impermanent
There is nothing lasting to be found in the world
Everything outside of this knowing is unsatisfactory and impersonal
Even the knowing itself is still not sure if the masses of defilement cram and encompass it
We must put effort into burning up the defilements right here
We must develop generosity morality and meditation right here here in the mind of present knowing
Be wary of the forms that come into our line of vision and the sounds that enter the ears  don't follow them
Odors that enter at the nose flavors that pass by the tongue sensations hot and cold hard and soft  don't be deluded by them
Don't be misled by discursive thought
Don't be fooled by conditions
Why did the Buddha not want us to be deluded
Because he wanted us to know
By now all of us in the course of time have come to know all sorts of things
But what have we got from it
All we have got is old age and death
Death and then birth and then death and then birth over and over again
Can you see this
All human beings are born and then they die just like a sound that having arisen disappears or a form once created comes to an end
Wherever there is arising there must be passing away
The Buddha taught us to know this truth
It is the knowledge taught by the Buddha and all his noble disciples
They all instruct us to know our minds to be aware of ourselves not to be intoxicated by mental states thinking or craving
The Buddha described three kinds of craving the craving for sensepleasures the craving to become and the craving not to become  ie coarse middling and subtle craving
All of its forms lie within the mind and their abandonment is dependent on effort and close attention burning up the cravings rather than being swept along by them
Thus practice implies not following the cravings desires and wishes that arise
When craving starts to cause distress and turmoil in the mind we pacify it know it clearly within
The Buddha taught us to clearly see into this mind and also to see the things outside of it
He wanted us to see that there is nothing permanent or substantial anywhere at all and there is nothing that can provide us with lasting happiness
All there is is unsatisfactoriness or dukkha
We sit and there is dukkha in the sitting posture
We lay down and there is dukkha in the laying
We stand up and there is dukkha in the standing
We walk and there is dukkha in the walking
Even when we talk or give a Dhammadiscourse dukkha is present
There is no real happiness
All those things which we assume to be happiness are all false
If they were true happiness why is death followed by birth
There is no real happiness
What people call happiness is just a delusion of the worldly
The enlightened ones say that it's all just stories of dukkha and unknowing
Thus the Buddha and his disciples enlightened and unenlightened practice calm and insight meditation in every posture
They put energy into their meditation at all times continually accelerating their efforts
They go without sleep
If in the inner struggle with defilements we just indulge in rest and sleep the defilements will trample all over us we will be unable to overcome them
If we get up and sit in meditation contemplate unattractiveness or the elements so as to see the unsatisfactoriness inherent in the body and mind point out and reveal these things to our intoxicated indulgent mind then we will be able to put forth effort to burn up the defilements of ignorance and delusion
Whenever we are deluded or intoxicated with something then we lose our selfawareness and then there is pitchblack darkness
There is no path that will take us into such utter darkness as that of delusion not knowing the nature of the mind and body not perceiving the three characteristics not seeing clearly in the present moment
The deluded mind puts no effort into eradicating defilements in the present moment
It is engrossed in the pleasures derived from forms sounds odors flavors physical sensations and mental states taking them to be happiness
But that happiness is bound up with materiality it is not true happiness
The Buddha said that true happiness is the happiness of nibbana
The happiness of nibbana is a nonclinging happiness
It does not depend on obtaining or rejecting anything
It is the complete annihilation of desire hatred and delusion both internally and externally
It is because there is not a single remnant of defilement that it is called happiness
It is a true unchanging happiness not fickle and deceitful
As for happiness in the world however intense it may be it is still deceitful
Even millionaires multimillionaires kings and emperors must all still suffer through the power of defilements
The Buddha called the defilements fires Fires are hot and wherever the fire of desire occurs then that place is hot
Whenever the fire of aversion and delusion occur then those places are hot
Where do they occur
In the mind that does not know and see clearly the mind that does not let go the mind that does not abandon and release
The mind tends to cling to the idea of self
It clings to the body as being self but after death the body lies rotting on the ground and is cremated
Have you ever seen that
If you haven't yet realized that the same fate awaits you then look at other people
Parents and grandparents where have they all gone
They are dead
After they died where did their bodies go
They went to earth
In the end this body that we cling to as being me and mine will turn to earth and there's nothing we can do to prevent it
We can't forbid old age sickness and death
The Buddha said that what we can do is to prevent the mind from being deluded by it all
Create clear knowing in the mind
Apart from this knowing mind everything is aniccam impermanent
Don't be deceived by it all at any cost
Apart from this knowing mind everything is dukkham it's all unsatisfactory and unstable
Apart from this knowing mind there is no atta no independent entity
Self and others is a convention of the world
In truth none of it is self there is nothing that is really me or mine Experiment with separating out hair of the head hair of the body nails teeth skin flesh and bones
Divide things up into the elements of earth water fire and air
Have a look at what is what
There is nothing substantial there just agreed conventions
Don't be misled by those conditions
Go against the outflowing stream of the mind
Enter samadhi and pacify the mind
Establish yourself in the practice of Dhamma and keep burning up the defilements of desire aversion and delusion
As long as they still remain keep trying to gradually eliminate them
This is called not backsliding
Viriyena dukkhamacenti said the Buddha Dukkha is transcended through effort When there is effort in our minds we can free ourselves of suffering
If those who practice Dhamma believe this saying with all their hearts don't slacken but firmly resolve to practice calm and insight meditation to the best of their abilities when their spiritual faculties and accumulated purity are fully mature then they will realize enlightenment
Of this there is no doubt
So having listened to these skillful means that I have outlined and clearly appreciated the truth of them in your hearts then impress them in your memory and take them away and practice them accordingly for your welfare and happiness
In our day and age the practice of going into the forest to meditate and follow the ascetic dhutanga practices began with Phra Ajaan Sao Kantasilo the teacher of Phra Ajaan Mun and by extension Phra Ajaan Singh and Phra Ajaan Lee
Phra Ajaan Sao was inclined to be not a preacher or a speaker but a doer
When he taught his students he said very little
And those who studied directly under him are now elders who speak very little who rarely preach having picked up the habit from their teacher
Thus as Phra Ajaan Sao was not a preacher I would like to tell you a little of the way in which he taught meditation
How did Phra Ajaan Sao teach
If it so happened that someone came to him saying Ajaan sir I want to practice meditation
How should I go about it he would answer Meditate on the word 'Buddho' If the person asked What does 'Buddho' mean Ajaan Sao would answer Don't ask
What will happen after I've meditated on 'Buddho'
Don't ask
Your only duty is simply to repeat the word 'Buddho' over and over in your mind
That's how he taught no long drawnout explanations
Now if the student was sincere in putting the Ajaan's instructions into practice and was persistent in practicing the repetition if his mind then became calm and bright from entering into concentration he would come and ask Ajaan Sao When meditating on 'Buddho' my state of mind becomes suchandsuch
What should I do now If it was right Ajaan Sao would say Keep on meditating If not he would say You have to do suchandsuch
What you're doing isn't right
For example once when I was his attendant novice a senior monk of the Mahanikaya sect came and placed himself under his direction as a beginning student in meditation
Ajaan Sao taught him to meditate on Buddho Now when the monk settled down on Buddho his mind became calm and once it was calm bright
And then he stopped repeating Buddho At this point his mind was simply blank
Afterwards he sent his attention out following the brightness and a number of visions began to arise spirits of the dead hungry ghosts divine beings people animals mountains forests Sometimes it seemed as if he or rather his mind left his body and went wandering through the forest and wilderness seeing the various things mentioned above
Afterwards he went and told Ajaan Sao When I meditated down to the point were the mind became calm and bright it then went out following the bright light
Visions of ghosts divine beings people and animals appeared
Sometimes it seemed as if I went out following the visions
As soon as Ajaan Sao heard this he said This isn't right
For the mind to go knowing and seeing outside isn't right
You have to make it know inside
The monk then asked How should I go about making it know inside
Phra Ajaan Sao answered When the mind is in a bright state like that when it has forgotten or abandoned its repetition and is simply sitting empty and still look for the breath
If the sensation of the breath appears in your awareness focus on the breath as your object and then simply keep track of it following it inward until the mind becomes even calmer and brighter
And so the monk followed the Ajaan's instructions until finally the mind settled down in threshold concentration following which the breath became more and more refined ultimately to the point where it disappeared
His sensation of having a body also disappeared leaving just the state in which the mind was sitting absolutely still a state of awareness itself standing out clear with no sense of going forward or back no sense of where the mind was because at that moment there was just the mind all on its own
At this point the monk came again to ask After my mind has become calm and bright and I fix my attention on the breath and follow the breath inward until it reaches a state of being absolutely quiet and still  so still that nothing is left the breath doesn't appear the sense of having a body vanishes only the mind stands out brilliant and still When it's like this is it right or wrong
Whether it's right or wrong the Ajaan answered take that as your standard
Make an effort to be able to do this as often as possible and only when you're skilled at it should you come and see me again
So the monk followed the Ajaan's instructions and later was able to make his mind still to the point that there was no sense of having a body and the breath disappeared more and more often
He became more and more skilled and his mind became more and more firm
Eventually after he had been making his mind still very frequently  because as a rule there's the principle that virtue develops concentration concentration develops discernment discernment develops the mind  when his concentration became powerful and strong it gave rise to abhiñña  heightened knowledge and true insight
Knowledge of what
Knowledge of the true nature of the mind that is knowing the states of the mind as they occur in the present
Or so he said
After he had left this level of concentration and came to see Ajaan Sao he was told This level of concentration is fixed penetration
You can rest assured that in this level of concentration there is no insight or knowledge of anything at all
There's only the brightness and the stillness
If the mind is forever in that state it will be stuck simply on that level of stillness
So once you've made the mind still like this watch for the interval where it begins to stir out of its concentration
As soon as the mind has a sense that it's beginning to take up an object  no matter what object may appear first  focus on the act of taking up an object
That's what you should examine
The monk followed the Ajaan's instructions and afterwards he was able to make fair progress in the level of his mind
This is one instance of how Phra Ajaan Sao taught his pupils  teaching just a little at a time giving only the very heart of the practice almost as if he would say Do this and this and this with no explanations at all
Sometimes I would wonder about his way of teaching
That is I would compare it with books I had read or with the Dhammatalks I heard given by other teachers
For example Phra Ajaan Singh wrote a small handbook for the practice of meditation entitled Taking the Triple Refuge and the Techniques of Meditation and in it he said that in practicing meditation you must before all else sit with your body straight and establish mindfulness directly in front of you
That's how he put it but not how Ajaan Sao would put it
Still the principles they taught were one and the same the only difference being that Ajaan Sao was not a preacher and so didn't make use of a lot of rhetoric
As he explained to me When we make up our mind to repeat 'Buddho' the act of making up the mind is in itself the act of establishing mindfulness
When we keep thinking 'Buddho' and are not willing to let the mind slip away from 'Buddho' our mindfulness and alertness are already healthy and strong always watching over the mind to keep it with 'Buddho' As soon as our attention slips away so that we forget to think 'Buddho' and go thinking of something else it's a sign that there's a lapse in our mindfulness
But if we can keep our mindfulness under control and can think 'Buddho Buddho' continuously with no gaps our mindfulness is already strong so there's no need to go 'establishing mindfulness' anywhere
To think of an object so that it is coupled with the mind is in and of itself the act of getting mindfulness established That was how he explained it to me
This was one instance of how I saw and heard Phra Ajaan Sao teaching meditation and should be enough to serve us all as food for thought
It's not difficult to learn a little Pali through selfstudy using a textbook or two as a guide
Many people find it helpful to study with others either in a formal classroom setting or in a more relaxed Pali study group
For many of us the goal is not to become expert scholars and translators of the language but simply to become acquainted with enough of the basics of the language to enrich our personal understanding of the suttas and the Buddha's teachings
For selfstudy Warder's Introduction to Pali or de Silva's Pali Primer are the basic texts
Johansson's Pali Buddhist Texts An Introductory Reader and Grammar is also immensely helpful
See the list of Pali language textbooks for more recommended titles
Formal classroom courses in Pali are offered at many universities with strong Eastern Religions departments as well as at several Buddhist studies centers and institutes
Some universitylevel Pali courses require previous acquaintance with Sanskrit
If you are looking for a Pali teacher consider asking around at a university to see if there might be a graduate student willing to tutor you or your study group perhaps for a small fee
Some professors may be willing to let you audit a course without going through the official university registration process

Companion audio CD also available
Known popularly as Warder this is the standard Pali textbook used today
It is systematic and thorough ideally suited to those with some prior familiarity with basic linguistic concepts or to the motivated newcomer
Although beginners may at first find some of Warder's explanations impenetrable it's still the best overall Pali textbook around
The companion CD is well worth purchasing as it gives the student a good idea of what real spoken Pali should sound like
Although each chapter contains numerous exercises or passages for reading and translation the latest edition contains answers to only the first seven exercises

This is a good first book for those who think they're not ready yet for Warder
Each chapter focuses on a single concept of Pali grammar and contains numerous exercises
I found though that there comes a point in the book when the brief grammatical introductions in the beginning of the lessons begin to fall short
In particular there is no explanation of word order in Pali sentences
At this point Warder can come to the rescue
An Appendix to the book containing solutions to the exercises is reportedly forthcoming from the publisher
This book consists of short chapters each consisting of a brief passage from the Pali canon along with a wordforword grammatical analysis and translation
Useful to the student with some prior grasp of the fundamentals of Pali or when used in parallel with Warder
It also stands well on its own for newcomers who wish to develop a feel for the language
An excellent page summary of Pali grammar appears in the back of the book

Throughout its history Buddhism has worked as a civilizing force
Its teachings on karma for instance  the principle that all intentional actions have consequences  have taught morality and compassion to many societies
But on a deeper level Buddhism has always straddled the line between civilization and wilderness
The Buddha himself gained Awakening in a forest gave his first sermon in a forest and passed away in a forest
The qualities of mind he needed in order to survive physically and mentally as he went unarmed into the wilds were key to his discovery of the Dhamma
They included resilience resolve and alertness selfhonesty and circumspection steadfastness in the face of loneliness courage and ingenuity in the face of external dangers compassion and respect for the other inhabitants of the forest
These qualities formed the home culture of the Dhamma
Periodically as Buddhism spread and adapted to different societies some practitioners felt that the original message of the Dhamma had become diluted
So they returned to the wilderness in order to revive its home culture
Many wilderness traditions are still alive today especially in the Theravada countries of Sri Lanka and Southeast Asia
There mendicant ascetic monks continue to wander through the remaining rainforests in search of Awakening in the same environment where the Buddha found Awakening himself
Among these wilderness traditions the one that has attracted the largest number of Western students and is beginning to take root in the West is the Kammatthana Forest tradition of Thailand
The Kammatthana tradition was founded by Ajaan Mun Bhuridatto in the early decades of this century
Ajaan Mun's mode of practice was solitary and strict
He followed the Vinaya faithfully and also observed many of what are known as the thirteen classic dhutanga practices such as living off almsfood wearing robes made of castoff rags dwelling in the forest eating only one meal a day
Searching out secluded places in the wilds of Thailand and Laos he avoided the responsibilities of settled monastic life and spent long hours of the day and night in meditation
In spite of his reclusive nature he attracted a large following of students willing to put up with the hardships of forest life in order to study with him
He also had his detractors who accused him of not following traditional Thai Buddhist customs
He usually responded by saying that he wasn't interested in bending to the customs of any particular society  as they were by definition the customs of people with greed anger and delusion in their minds
He was more interested in finding and following the Dhamma's home culture or what he called the customs of the noble ones the practices that had enabled the Buddha and his disciples to achieve Awakening in the first place
This phrase  the customs of the noble ones  comes from an incident in the Buddha's life not long after his Awakening he returned to his home town in order to teach the Dhamma to the family he had left six years earlier
After spending the night in a forest he went for alms in town at daybreak
His father the king learned of this and immediately went to upbraid him
This is shameful the king said
No one in the lineage of our family has ever gone begging
It's against our family customs
Your majesty the Buddha replied I now belong not to the lineage of my family but to the lineage of the noble ones
Theirs are the customs I follow
Ajaan Mun devoted many years of his life to tracking those customs down
Born in the son of rice farmers in the northeastern province of Ubon he was ordained as a monk in the provincial capital in
At the time of his ordination there were two broad types of Buddhism available in Thailand
The first can be called Customary Buddhism  the mores and rites handed down over the centuries from teacher to teacher with little if any reference to the Pali canon
For the most part these customs taught monks to live a sedentary life in the village monastery serving the local villagers as doctors or fortune tellers
Monastic discipline tended to be loose
Occasionally monks would go on a pilgrimage they called dhutanga which bore little resemblance to the classic dhutanga practices
Instead it was more an undisciplined escape valve for the pressures of sedentary life
Moreover monks and lay people practiced forms of meditation that deviated from the path of tranquillity and insight outlined in the Pali canon
Their practices called vichaa aakhom or incantation knowledge involved initiations and invocations used for shamanistic purposes such as protective charms and magical powers
They rarely mentioned nirvana except as an entity to be invoked for shamanic rites
The second type of Buddhism available at the time was Reform Buddhism based on the Pali canon and begun in the 's by Prince Mongkut who later became King Rama IV
Prince Mongkut was ordained as a monk for twentyseven years before ascending the throne
After studying the canon during his early years as a monk he grew discouraged by the level of practice he saw around him in Thai monasteries
So he reordained among the Mons  an ethnic group that straddled the ThaiBurmese border and occupied a few villages across the river from Bangkok  and studied Vinaya and the classic dhutanga practices under the guidance of a Mon teacher
Later his brother King Rama III complained that it was disgraceful for member of the royal family to join an ethnic minority and so built a monastery for the PrinceMonk on the Bangkok side of the river
There Mongkut attracted a small but strong following of likeminded monks and lay supporters and in this way the Dhammayut movement was born
In its early years the Dhammayut movement was an informal grouping devoted to Pali studies focusing on Vinaya the classic dhutanga practices a rationalist interpretation of the Dhamma and the revival of meditation techniques taught in the Pali canon such as recollection of the Buddha and mindfulness of the body
None of the movement's members however could prove that the teachings of the Pali canon actually led to enlightenment
Mongkut himself was convinced that the path to nirvana was no longer open but he felt that a great deal of merit could be made by reviving at least the outward forms of the earliest Buddhist traditions
Formally taking a bodhisattva vow he dedicated the merit of his efforts to future Buddhahood
Many of his students also took vows hoping to become disciples of that future Buddha
Upon disrobing and ascending the throne after his brother's death in Rama IV was in a position to impose his reforms on the rest of the Thai Sangha but chose not to
Instead he quietly sponsored the building of new Dhammayut centers in the capital and the provinces which was how  by the time of Ajaan Mun  there came to be a handful of Dhammayut monasteries in Ubon
Ajaan Mun felt that Customary Buddhism had little to offer and so he joined the Dhammayut order taking a student of Prince Mongkut as his preceptor
Unlike many who joined the order at the time he wasn't interested in the social advancement that would come with academic study and ecclesiastical appointments
Instead his life on the farm had impressed on him the sufferings inherent in the cycle of life and death and his single aim was to find a way out of the cycle
As a result he soon left the scholarly environment of his preceptor's temple and went to live with a teacher named Ajaan Sao Kantasilo in a small meditation monastery on the outskirts of town
Ajaan Sao was unusual in the Dhammayut order in that he had no scholarly interests but was devoted to the practice of meditation
He trained Ajaan Mun in strict discipline and canonical meditation practices set in the context of the dangers and solitude of the wilderness
He could not guarantee that this practice would lead to the noble attainments but he believed that it headed in the right direction
After wandering for several years with Ajaan Sao Ajaan Mun set off on his own in search of a teacher who could show him for sure the way to the noble attainments
His search took nearly two decades and involved countless hardships as he trekked through the jungles of Laos central Thailand and Burma but he never found the teacher he sought
Gradually he realized that he would have to follow the Buddha's example and take the wilderness itself as his teacher not simply to conform to the ways of nature  for nature is samsara itself  but to break through to truths transcending them entirely
If he wanted to find the way beyond aging illness and death he would have to learn the lessons of an environment where aging illness and death are thrown into sharp relief
At the same time his encounters with other monks in the forest convinced him that learning the lessons of the wilderness involved more than just mastering the skills of physical survival
He would also have to develop the acuity not to be misled by deadend sidetracks in his meditation
So with a strong sense of the immensity of his task he returned to a mountainous region in central Thailand and settled alone in a cave
In the long course of his wilderness training Ajaan Mun learned that  contrary to Reform and Customary beliefs  the path to nirvana was not closed
The true Dhamma was to be found not in old customs or texts but in the welltrained heart and mind
The texts were pointers for training nothing more or less
The rules of the Vinaya instead of simply being external customs played an important role in physical and mental survival
As for the Dhamma texts practice was not just a matter of confirming what they said
Reading and thinking about the texts could not give an adequate understanding of what they meant  and did not count as showing them true respect
True respect for the texts meant taking them as a challenge putting their teachings seriously to the test to see if in fact they are true
In the course of testing the teachings the mind would come to many unexpected realizations that were not contained in the texts
These in turn had to be put to the test as well so that one learned gradually by trial and error to the point of an actual noble attainment
Only then Ajaan Mun would say did one understand the Dhamma
This attitude toward the Dhamma parallels what ancient cultures called warrior knowledge  the knowledge that comes from developing skills in difficult situations  as opposed to the scribe knowledge that people sitting in relative security and ease can write down in words
Of course warriors need to use words in their training but they view a text as authoritative only if its teachings are borne out in practice
The Canon itself encourages this attitude when it quotes the Buddha as teaching his aunt As for the teachings of which you may know 'These teachings lead to dispassion not to passion to being unfettered not to being fettered to divesting not to accumulating to modesty not to selfaggrandizement to contentment not to discontent to seclusion not to entanglement to aroused persistence not to laziness to being unburdensome not to being burdensome' You may definitely hold 'This is the Dhamma this is the Vinaya this is the Teacher's instruction' Thus the ultimate authority in judging a teaching is not whether the teaching can be found in a text
It lies in each person's relentless honesty in putting the Dhamma to the test and carefully monitoring the results
When Ajaan Mun had reached the point where he could guarantee that the path to the noble attainments was still open he returned to the northeast to inform Ajaan Sao and then to continue wandering
Gradually he began to attract a grassroots following
People who met him were impressed by his demeanor and teachings which were unlike those of any other monks they had known
They believed that he embodied the Dhamma and Vinaya in everything he did and said
As a teacher he took a warrior's approach to training his students
Instead of simply imparting verbal knowledge he put them into situations where they would have to develop the qualities of mind and character needed in surviving the battle with their own defilements
Instead of teaching a single meditation technique he taught them a full panoply of skills  as one student said Everything from washing spittoons on up  and then sent them into the wilds
It was after Ajaan Mun's return to the northeast that a third type of Buddhism emanating from Bangkok  State Buddhism  began to impinge on his life
In an effort to present a united front in the face of imperialist threats from Britain and France Rama V wanted to move the country from a loose feudal system to a centralized nationstate
As part of his program he and his brothers  one of whom was ordained as a monk  enacted religious reforms to prevent the encroachment of Christian missionaries
Having received their education from British tutors they created a new monastic curriculum that subjected the Dhamma and Vinaya to Victorian notions of reason and utility
Their new version of the Vinaya for instance was a compromise between Customary and Reform Buddhism designed to counter Christian attacks that monks were unreliable and lazy
Monks were instructed to give up their wanderings settle in established monasteries and accept the new state curriculum
Because the Dhammayut monks were the best educated in Thailand at the time  and had the closest connections to the royal family  they were enlisted to do advance work for the government in outlying regions
In a Dhammayut authority unsympathetic to meditation and forest wanderers took charge of religious affairs in the northeast
Trying to domesticate Ajaan Mun's following he ordered them to establish monasteries and help propagate the government's program
Ajaan Mun and a handful of his students left for the north where they were still free to roam
In the early 's Ajaan Mun was appointed the abbot of an important monastery in the city of Chieng Mai but fled the place before dawn of the following day
He returned to settle in the northeast only in the very last years of his life after the local ecclesiastical authorities had grown more favorably disposed to his way of practice
He maintained many of his dhutanga practices up to his death in
It wasn't until the 's that the movement he founded gained acceptance in Bangkok and only in the 's did it come into prominence on a nationwide level
This coincided with a widespread loss of confidence in state monks many of whom were little more than bureaucrats in robes
As a result Kammatthana monks came to represent in the eyes of many monastics and lay people a solid and reliable expression of the Dhamma in a world of fast and furious modernization
Buddhist history has shown that wilderness traditions go through a very quick life cycle
As one loses its momentum another often grows up in its place
But with the wholesale destruction of Thailand's forests in the last few decades the Kammatthana tradition may be the last great forest tradition that Thailand will produce
Fortunately we in the West have learned of it in time to gather lessons that will be help in cultivating the customs of the noble ones on Western soil and establishing authentic wilderness traditions of our own
Perhaps the most important of those lessons concerns the role that the wilderness plays in testing and correcting trends that develop among Buddhists in cities and towns
The story of the Kammatthana tradition gives lie to the facile notion that Buddhism has survived simply by adapting to its host culture
The survival of Buddhism and the survival of the Dhamma are two different things
People like Ajaan Mun  willing to make whatever sacrifices are needed to discover and practice the Dhamma on its own terms  are the ones who have kept the Dhamma alive
Of course people have always been free to engage in Buddhist traditions in whatever way they like but those who have benefited most from that engagement are those who instead of reshaping Buddhism to fit their preferences reshape themselves to fit in with the customs and traditions of the noble ones
To find these customs isn't easy given the bewildering variety of traditions that Buddhists have spawned over the centuries
To test them each individual is thrown back on his or her own powers of relentless honesty integrity and discernment
There are no easy guarantees
And perhaps this fact in itself is a measure of the Dhamma's true worth
Only people of real integrity can truly comprehend it
As Ajaan Lee one of Ajaan Mun's students once said If a person isn't true to the Buddha's teachings the Buddha's teachings won't be true to that person  and that person won't be able to know what the Buddha's true teachings are

This third edition of Bodhinyana is an adaptation of the second edition printed by the World Fellowship of Buddhists as The Practice of Buddhism For this new edition we have retained only Ajahn Chah's teachings thus this is essentially a compilation of the original Bodhinyana and a pamphlet called Fragments of a Teaching and Notes from a Session of Questions and Answers This pamphlet was first printed many years ago and has proved to be a very popular and helpful guide for many meditators
Thus by compiling this new edition we hope our efforts will be of increased benefit
As regards the translations we have tried to be as exact as possible with the content of the Teachings but have omitted much of the repetition inevitably arising in oral instruction
Pali words absorbed into the Thai language have in the course of time acquired additional meanings eg the Thai arome refers to the Pali Arammana  sense object or mental impression but its common meaning is mood or emotion The Venerable Ajahn uses these words in both ways and we have translated accordingly
Finding the middle way between a dull overliteral approach and a more flowing but less precise rendering hasn't always been easy
Each of the various translators has compromised in different ways
Hopefully we have managed to bring out both the clear simplicity the directness and the humor of these talks on the one hand and at the same time the profundity that underlies and inspires them
The translators would like to apologize for any passages which remain unclear or for clumsiness of style
We trust that this material will provide nourishing contemplation for the growing number of meditators
May all beings be free from Suffering
Ajahn Chah was born into a large and comfortable family in a rural village in Northeast Thailand
He ordained as a novice in early youth and on reaching the age of twenty took higher ordination as a monk
As a young monk he studied some basic Dhamma Discipline and scriptures
Later he practiced meditation under the guidance of several of the local Meditation Masters in the Ascetic Forest Tradition
He wandered for a number of years in the style of an ascetic monk sleeping in forests caves and cremation grounds and spent a short but enlightening period with Ajahn Mun one of the most famous and respected Thai Meditation Masters of this century
After many years of travel and practice he was invited to settle in a thick forest grove near the village of his birth
This grove was uninhabited known as a place of cobras tigers and ghosts thus being as he said the perfect location for a forest monk
Around Ajahn Chah a large monastery formed as more and more monks nuns and laypeople came to hear his teachings and stay on to practice with him
Now there are disciples teaching more than forty mountain and forest branch temples throughout Thailand and in England
On entering Wat Pah Pong one is likely to encounter monks drawing water from a well and a sign on the path that says You there be quiet
We're trying to meditate Although there is group meditation twice a day and sometimes a talk by Ajahn Chah the heart of the meditation is the way of life
Monks do manual work dye and sew their own robes make most of their own requisites and keep the monastery buildings and grounds in immaculate shape
Monks here live extremely simply following the ascetic precepts of eating once a day from the almsbowl and limiting their possessions and robes
Scattered throughout the forest are individual huts where monks live and meditate in solitude and where they practice walking meditation on cleared paths under the trees
Discipline is extremely strict enabling one to lead a simple and pure life in a harmoniously regulated community where virtue meditation and understanding may be skillfully and continuously cultivated
Ajahn Chah's simple yet profound style of teaching has a special appeal to Westerners and many have come to study and practice with him quite a few for many years
In Wat Pa Nanachat was established near Wat Pah Pong as a special training monastery for the growing numbers of Westerners interested in undertaking monastic training
Since then Ajahn Chah's large following of senior Western disciples has begun the work of spreading the Dhamma to the West
Ajahn Chah has himself traveled twice to Europe and North America and has established a thriving branch monastery in Sussex England
Wisdom is a way of living and being and Ajahn Chah has endeavored to preserve the simple lifestyle of the monks order that people may study and practice the Dhamma in the present day
Ajahn Chah's wonderfully simple style of teaching can be deceptive
It is often only after we have heard something many times that suddenly our minds are ripe and somehow the Teaching takes on a much deeper meaning
His skillful means in tailoring his explanations of Dhamma to time and place and to the understanding and sensitivity of his audience is marvelous to see
Sometimes on paper though it can make him seem inconsistent or even selfcontradictory
At such times the reader should remember that these words are a record of a living experience
Similarly if the Teachings may seem to vary at times from tradition it should be borne in mind that the Venerable Ajahn speaks always from the heart from the depths of his own meditative experience
Namo Tassa Bhagavato Arahato SammaSambuddhassa
All of you have believed in Buddhism for many years now through hearing about the Buddhist Teachings from many sources  especially from various monks and teachers
In some cases Dhamma is taught in very broad and vague terms to the point where it is difficult to know how to put it into practice in daily life
In other instances Dhamma is taught in high language or special jargon to the point where most people find it difficult to understand especially if the teaching is done too literally from scripture
Lastly there is Dhamma taught in a balanced way neither too vague nor too profound neither too broad nor too esoteric  just right for the listener to understand and practice to personally benefit from the Teachings
Today I would like share with you Teachings of the sort I have often used to instruct my disciples in the past Teachings which I hope may possibly be of personal benefit to those of you here listening today
One who wishes to reach the BuddhaDhamma must firstly be one who has faith or confidence as a foundation
He must understand the meaning of BuddhaDhamma as follows
Dhamma the characteristics of purity radiance and peace which arise from morality concentration and wisdom
Therefore one who is to reach the BuddhaDhamma is one who cultivates and develops morality concentration and wisdom within himself
Naturally people who wish to reach their home are not those who merely sit and think of traveling
They must actually undertake the process of traveling step by step and in the right direction as well in order to finally reach home
If they take the wrong path they may eventually run into difficulties such as swamps or other obstacles which are hard to get around
Or they may run into dangerous situations in this wrong direction thereby possibly never reaching home
Those who reach home can relax and sleep comfortably  home is a place of comfort for body and mind
Now they have really reached home
But if the traveler only passed by the front of his home or only walked around it he would not receive any benefit from having traveled all the way home
In the same way walking the path to reach the BuddhaDhamma is something each one of us must do individually ourselves for no one can do it for us
And we must travel along the proper path of morality concentration and wisdom until we find the blessings of purity radiance and peacefulness of mind that are the fruits of traveling the path
However if one only has knowledge of books and scriptures sermons and sutras that is only knowledge of the map or plans for the journey even in hundreds of lives one will never know purity radiance and peacefulness of mind
Instead one will just waste time and never get to the real benefits of practice
Teachers are those who only point out the direction of the Path
After listening to the teachers whether or not we walk the Path by practicing ourselves and thereby reap the fruits of practice is strictly up to each one of us
Another way to look at it is to compare practice to a bottle of medicine a doctor leaves for his patient
On the bottle is written detailed instructions on how to take the medicine but no matter how many hundred times the patient reads the directions he is bound to die if that is all he does
He will gain no benefit from the medicine
And before he dies he may complain bitterly that the doctor wasn't any good that the medicine didn't cure him
He will think that the doctor was a fake or that the medicine was worthless yet he has only spent his time examining the bottle and reading the instructions
He hasn't followed the advice of the doctor and taken the medicine
However if the patient actually follows the doctor's advice and takes the medicine regularly as prescribed he will recover
And if he is very ill it will be necessary to take a lot of medicine whereas if he is only mildly ill only a little medicine will be needed to finally cure him
The fact that we must use a lot of medicine is a result of the severity of our illness
It's only natural and you can see it for yourself with careful consideration
Doctors prescribe medicine to eliminate disease from the body
The Teachings of the Buddha are prescribed to cure disease of the mind to bring it back to its natural healthy state
So the Buddha can be considered to be a doctor who prescribes cures for the ills of the mind
He is in fact the greatest doctor in the world
Mental ills are found in each one of us without exception
When you see these mental ills does it not make sense to look to the Dhamma as support as medicine to cure your ills
Traveling the path of the BuddhaDhamma is not done with the body
You must travel with the mind to reach the benefits
We can divide these travelers into three groups
First Level this is comprised of those who understand that they must practice themselves and know how to do so
They take the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha as their refuge and have resolved to practice diligently according to the Teachings
These persons have discarded merely following customs and traditions and instead use reason to examine for themselves the nature of the world
These are the group of Buddhist believers
Middle Level This group is comprised of those who have practiced until they have an unshakable faith in the Teachings of the Buddha the Dhamma and the Sangha
They also have penetrated to the understanding of the true nature of all compounded formations
These persons gradually reduce clinging and attachment
They do not hold onto things and their minds reach deep understanding of the Dhamma
Depending upon the degree of nonattachment and wisdom they are progressively known as streamenterers oncereturners and nonreturners or simply Noble Ones
Highest Level This is the group of those whose practice has led them to the body speech and mind of the Buddha
They are above the world free of the world and free of all attachment and clinging
They are known as Arahats or Free Ones the highest level of the Noble Ones
Morality is restraint and discipline of body and speech
On the formal level this is divided into classes of precepts for lay people and for monks and nuns
However to speak in general terms there is one basic characteristic  that is INTENTION
When we are mindful or selfrecollected we have right intention
Practicing selfrecollection and mindfulness will generate good morality
It is only natural that when we put on dirty clothes and our bodies are dirty that out minds too will feel uncomfortable and depressed
However if we keep our bodies clean and wear clean neat clothes it makes our minds light and cheerful
So too when morality is not kept our bodily actions and speech are dirty and this is a cause for making the mind unhappy distressed and heavy
We are separated from right practice and this prevents us from penetrating in the essence of the Dhamma in our minds
The wholesome bodily actions and speech themselves depend on mind properly trained since mind orders body and speech
Therefore we must continue practice by training our minds
The training in concentration is practiced to make the mind firm and steady
This brings about peacefulness of mind
Usually our untrained minds are moving and restless hard to control and manage
Mind follows sense distractions wildly just like water flowing this way and that seeking the lowest level
Agriculturists and engineers though know how to control water so that it is of greater use to mankind
Men are clever they know how to dam water make large reservoirs and canals  all of this merely to channel water and make it more useable
In addition the water stored becomes a source of electrical power and light further benefits from controlling its flow so that it doesn't run wild and eventually settle into a few low spots its usefulness wasted
So too the mind which is dammed and controlled trained constantly will be of immeasurable benefit
The Buddha Himself taught The mind that has been controlled brings true happiness so train you minds well for the highest of benefits Similarly the animals we see around us  elephants horses cattle buffalo etc must be trained before they can be useful for work
Only after they have been trained is their strength of benefit to us
In the same way the mind that has been trained will bring many times the blessings of that of an untrained mind
The Buddha and His Noble Disciples all started out in the same way as us  with untrained minds but afterwards look how they became the subjects of reverence for us all and see how much benefit we can gain through their teaching
Indeed see what benefit has come to the entire world from these men who have gone through the training of the mind to reach the freedom beyond
The mind controlled and trained is better equipped to help us in all professions in all situations
The disciplined mind will keep our lives balanced make work easier and develop and nurture reason to govern our actions
In the end our happiness will increase accordingly as we follow the proper mind training
The training of the mind can be done in many way with many different methods
The method which is most useful and which can be practiced by all types of people is known as mindfulness of breathing It is the developing of mindfulness on the inbreath and the outbreath
In this monastery we concentrate our attention on the tip of the nose and develop awareness of the in and outbreaths with the mantra word BUDDHO If the meditator wishes to use another word or simply be mindful of the air moving in and out this is also fine
Adjust the practice to suit yourself
The essential factor in the meditation is that the noting or awareness of the breath be kept up in the present moment so that one is mindful of each inbreath and each outbreath just as it occurs
While doing walking meditation we try to be constantly mindful of the sensation of the feet touching the ground
This practice of meditation must be pursued as continuously as possible in order for it to bear fruit
Don't meditate for a short time one day and then in one or two weeks or even a month meditate again
This will not bring results
The Buddha taught us to practice often to practice diligently that is to be as continuous as we can in the practice of mental training
To practice meditation we should also find a suitably quiet place free from distractions
In gardens or under shady trees in our back yards or in places where we can be alone are suitable environments
If we are a monk or nun we should find a suitable hut a quiet forest or cave
The mountains offer exceptionally suitable places for practice
In any case wherever we are we must make an effort to be continuously mindful of breathing in and breathing out
If the attention wanders to other things try to pull it back to the object of concentration
Try to put away all other thoughts and cares
Don't think about anything  just watch the breath
If we are mindful of thoughts as soon as they arise and keep diligently returning to the meditation subject the mind will become quieter and quieter
When the mind is peaceful and concentrated release it from the breath as the object of concentration
Now begin to examine the body and mind comprised of the five khandas material form feelings perceptions mental formations and consciousness
Examine these five khandas as they come and go
You will see clearly that they are impermanent that this impermanence makes them unsatisfactory and undesirable and that they come and go of their own  there is no self running things
There is to be found only nature moving according to cause and effect
All things in the world fall under the characteristics of instability unsatisfactoriness and being without a permanent ego or soul
Seeing the whole of existence in this light attachment and clinging to the khandas will gradually be reduced
This is because we see the true characteristics of the world
We call this the arising of wisdom
Wisdom is to see the truth of the various manifestations of body and mind
When we use our trained and concentrated minds to examine the five khandas we will see clearly that both body and mind are impermanent unsatisfactory and soulless
In seeing all compounded things with wisdom we do not cling or grasp
Whatever we receive we receive mindfully
We are not excessively happy
When things of ours break up or disappear we are not unhappy and do not suffer painful feelings  for we see clearly the impermanent nature of all things
When we encounter illness and pain of any sort we have equanimity because our minds have been well trained
The true refuge is the trained mind
All of this is known as wisdom which knows the true characteristics of things as they arise
Wisdom arises from mindfulness and concentration
Concentration arises from a base of morality or virtue
All of these things morality concentration and wisdom are so interrelated that it is not really possible to separate them
In practice it can be looked at in this way first there is the disciplining of the mind to be attentive to breathing
This is the arising of morality
When mindfulness of breathing is practiced continuously until the mind is quiet this is the arising of concentration
Then examination showing the breath as impermanent unsatisfactory and notself and the subsequent nonattachment is the arising of wisdom
Thus the practice of mindfulness of breathing can be said to be a course for the development of morality concentration and wisdom
They all come together
When morality concentration and wisdom are all developed we call this practicing the Eightfold Path which the Buddha taught as our only way out of suffering
The Eightfold Path is above all others because if properly practiced it leads directly to Nibbana to peace
We can say that this practice reaches the BuddhaDhamma truly and precisely
When we have practiced meditation as explained above the fruits of practice will arise in the following three stages
First for those practitioners who are at the level of Buddhist be faith there will arise increasing faith in the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha
This faith will become the real inner support of each person
Also they will understand the causeandeffect nature of all things that wholesome action brings wholesome result and that unwholesome action brings unwholesome result
So for such a person there will be a great increase in happiness and mental peace
Second those who have reached the noble attainments of streamwinner oncereturner or nonreturner have unshakable faith in the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha
They are joyful and are pulled towards Nibbana
Third for those Arahats or Perfected Ones there will be the happiness free from all suffering
These are the Buddhas free from the world complete in the Faring of the Holy Way
We all have had the good fortune to be born as human beings and to hear the Teachings of the Buddha
This is an opportunity that millions of other beings do not have
Therefore do not be careless or heedless
Hurry and develop merits do good and follow the path of practice in the beginning in the middle and in the highest levels
Don't let time roll by unused and without purpose
Try to reach the truth of the Buddha's Teachings even today
Let me close with a Lao folksaying Many rounds of merriment and pleasure past soon it will be evening
Drunk with tears now rest and see soon it will be too late to finish the journey
I am happy that you have taken this opportunity to come and visit Wat Pah Pong and to see your son who is a monk here however I'm sorry I have no gift to offer you
France already has so many material things but of Dhamma there's very little
Having been there and seen for myself there isn't really any Dhamma there which could lead to peace and tranquillity
There are only things which continually make one's mind confused and troubled
France is already materially prosperous it has so many things to offer which are sensually enticing  sights sounds smells tastes and textures
However people ignorant of Dhamma only become confused by them
So today I will offer you some Dhamma to take back to France as a gift from Wat Pah Pong and Wat Pah Nanachat
What is Dhamma
Dhamma is that which can cut through the problems and difficulties of mankind gradually reducing them to nothing
That's what is called Dhamma and that's what should be studied throughout our daily lives so that when some mental impression arises in us we'll be able to deal with it and go beyond it
Problems are common to us all whether living here in Thailand or in other countries
If we don't know how to solve them we'll always be subject to suffering and distress
That which solves problems is wisdom and to have wisdom we must develop and train the mind
The subject of practice isn't far away at all it's right here in our body and mind
Westerners and Thais are the same they both have a body and mind
A confused body and mind means a confused person and a peaceful body and mind a peaceful person
Actually the mind like rain water is pure in its natural state
If we were to drop green coloring into clear rain water however it would turn green
If yellow coloring it would turn yellow
The mind reacts similarly
When a comfortable mental impression drops into the mind the mind is comfortable
When the mental impression is uncomfortable the mind is uncomfortable
The mind becomes cloudy just like the colored water
When clear water contacts yellow it turns yellow
When it contacts green it turns green
It will change color every time
Actually that water which is green or yellow is naturally clean and clear
This is also the natural state of the mind clean and pure and unconfused
It becomes confused only because it pursues mental impressions it gets lost in its moods
Let me explain more clearly
Right now we are sitting in a peaceful forest
Here if there's no wind a leaf remains still
When a wind blows it flaps and flutters
The mind is similar to that leaf
When it contacts a mental impression it too flaps and flutters according to the nature of that mental impression
And the less we know of Dhamma the more the mind will continually pursue mental impressions
Feeling happy it succumbs to happiness
Feeling suffering it succumbs to suffering
It's constant confusion
In the end people become neurotic
Why
Because they don't know
They just follow their moods and don't know how to look after their own minds
When the mind has no one to look after it it's like a child without a mother or father to take care of him
An orphan has no refuge and without a refuge he's very insecure
Likewise if the mind is not looked after if there is no training or maturation of character with right understanding it's really troublesome
The method of training the mind which I will give you today is Kammatthana
Kamma means action and thana means base In Buddhism it is the method of making the mind peaceful and tranquil
It's for you to use in training the mind and with the trained mind investigate the body
Our being is composed of two parts one is the body the other the mind
There are only these two parts
What is called the body is that which can be seen with our physical eyes
The mind on the other hand has no physical aspect
The mind can only be seen with the internal eye or the eye of the mind These two things body and mind are in a constant state of turmoil
What is the mind
The mind isn't really any thing Conventionally speaking it's that which feels or senses
That which senses receives and experiences all mental impressions is called mind Right at this moment there is mind
As I am speaking to you the mind acknowledges what I am saying
Sounds enter through the ear and you know what is being said
That which experiences this is called mind
This mind doesn't have any self or substance
It doesn't have any form
It just experiences mental activities that's all
If we teach this mind to have right view this mind won't have any problems
It will be at ease
The mind is mind
Mental objects are mental objects
Mental objects are not the mind the mind is not mental objects
In order to clearly understand our minds and the mental objects in our minds we say that the mind is that which receives the mental objects which pop into it
When these two things mind and its object come into contact with each other they give rise to feelings
Some are good some bad some cold some hot all kinds
Without wisdom to deal with these feelings however the mind will be troubled
Meditation is the way of developing the mind so that it may be a base for the arising of wisdom
Here the breath is a physical foundation
We call it Anapanasati or mindfulness of breathing Here we make breathing our mental object
We take this object of meditation because it's the simplest and because it has been the heart of meditation since ancient times
When a good occasion arises to do sitting meditation sit crosslegged right leg on top of the left leg right hand on top of the left hand
Keep your back straight and erect
Say to yourself Now I will let go of all my burdens and concerns You don't want anything that will cause you worry
Let go of all concerns for the time being
Now fix your attention on the breath
Then breathe in and breathe out
In developing awareness of breathing don't intentionally make the breath long or short
Neither make it strong or weak
Just let it flow normally and naturally
Mindfulness and selfawareness arising from the mind will know the inbreath and the outbreath
Be at ease
Don't think about anything
No need to think of this or that
The only thing you have to do is fix your attention on the breathing in and breathing out
You have nothing else to do but that
Keep your mindfulness fixed on the inand outbreaths as they occur
Be aware of the beginning middle and end of each breath
On inhalation the beginning of the breath is at the nose tip the middle at the heart and the end in the abdomen
On exhalation it's just the reverse the beginning of the breath is in the abdomen the middle at the heart and the end at the nose tip
Develop the awareness of the breath at the nose tip at the heart in the abdomen
Then in reverse in the abdomen at the heart and at the nose tip
Focusing the attention on these three points will relieve all worries
Just don't think of anything else
Keep your attention on the breath
Perhaps other thoughts will enter the mind
It will take up other themes and distract you
Don't be concerned
Just take up the breathing again as your object of attention
The mind may get caught up in judging and investigating your moods but continue to practice being constantly aware of the beginning middle and the end of each breath
Eventually the mind will be aware of the breath at these three points all the time
When you do this practice for some time the mind and body will get accustomed to the work
Fatigue will disappear
The body will feel lighter and the breath will become more and more refined
Mindfulness and selfawareness will protect the mind and watch over it
We practice like this until the mind is peaceful and calm until it is one
One means that the mind will be completely absorbed in the breathing that it doesn't separate from the breath
The mind will be unconfused and at ease
It will know the beginning middle and end of the breath and remain steadily fixed on it
Then when the mind is peaceful we fix our attention on the inbreath and outbreath at the nose tip only
We don't have to follow it up and down to the abdomen and back
Just concentrate on the tip of the nose where the breath comes in and goes out
This is called calming the mind making it relaxed and peaceful
When tranquillity arises the mind stops it stops with its single object the breath
This is what's known as making the mind peaceful so that wisdom may arise
This is the beginning the foundation of our practice
You should try to practice this every single day wherever you may be
Whether at home in a car lying or sitting down you should be mindfully aware and watch over the mind constantly
This is called mental training which should be practiced in all the four postures
Not just sitting but standing walking and lying as well
The point is that we should know what the state of the mind is at each moment and to be able to do this we must be constantly mindful and aware
Is the mind happy or suffering
Is it confused
Is it peaceful
Getting to know the mind in this manner allows it to become tranquil and when it does become tranquil wisdom will arise
With the tranquil mind investigate the meditation subject which is the body from the top of the head to the soles of the feet then back to the head
Do this over and over again
Look at and see the hair of the head hair of the body the nails teeth and skin
In this meditation we will see that this whole body is composed of four elements' earth water fire and wind
The hard and solid parts of our body make up the earth element the liquid and flowing parts the water element
Winds that pass up and down our body make up the wind element and the heat in our body the fire element
Taken together they compose what we call a human being However when the body is broken down into its component parts only these four elements remain
The Buddha taught that there is no being per se no human no Thai no Westerner no person but that ultimately there are only these four elements  that's all
We assume that there is a person or a being but in reality there isn't anything of the sort
Whether taken separately as earth water fire and wind or taken together labelling what they form a human being they're all impermanent subject to suffering and notself
They are all unstable uncertain and in a state of constant change  not stable for a single moment
Our body is unstable altering and changing constantly
Hair changes nails change teeth change skin changes  everything changes completely
Our mind too is always changing
It isn't a self or substance
It isn't really us not really them although it may think so
Maybe it will think about killing itself
Maybe it will think of happiness or of suffering  all sorts of things
It's unstable
If we don't have wisdom and we believe this mind of ours it'll lie to us continually
And we alternately suffer and be happy
This mind is an uncertain thing
This body is uncertain
Together they are impermanent
Together they are a source of suffering
Together they are devoid of self
These the Buddha pointed out are neither a being nor a person nor a self nor a soul nor us nor they
They are merely elements earth water fire and wind
Elements only
When the mind sees this it will rid itself of attachment which holds that I am beautiful I am good I am evil I am suffering I have I this or I that
You will experience a state of unity for you'll have seen that all of mankind is basically the same
There is no I There are only elements
When you contemplate and see impermanence suffering and notself there will no longer be clinging to a self a being I or he or she
The mind which sees this will give rise to Nibbida worldweariness and dispassion
It will see all things as only impermanent suffering and notself
The mind then stops
The mind is Dhamma
Greed hatred and delusion will then diminish and recede little by little until finally there is only mind  just the pure mind
This is called practicing meditation
Thus I ask you to receive this gift of Dhamma which I offer you to study and contemplate in your daily lives
Please accept this Dhamma Teaching from Wat Pah Pong and Wat Pah Nanachat as an inheritance handed down to you
All of the monks here including your son and all the Teachers make you an offering of this Dhamma to take back to France with you
It will show you the way to peace of mind it will render your mind calm and unconfused
Your body may be in turmoil but your mind will not
Those in the world may be confused but you will not
Even though there is confusion in your country you will not be confused because the mind will have seen the mind is Dhamma
This is the right path the proper way
May you remember this Teaching in the future
May you be well and happy
Sometimes when a fruit tree is in bloom a breeze stirs and scatters blossoms to the ground
Some buds remain and grow into a small green fruit
A wind blows and some of them too fall
Still others may become fruit or nearly ripe or some even fully ripe before they fall
And so it is with people
Like flowers and fruit in the wind they too fall in different stages of life
Some people die while still in the womb others within only a few days after birth
Some people live for a few years then die never having reached maturity
Men and women die in their youth
Still others reach a ripe old age before they die
When reflecting upon people consider the nature of fruit in the wind both are very uncertain
This uncertain nature of things can also be seen in the monastic life
Some people come to the monastery intending to ordain but change their minds and leave some with heads already shaved
Others are already novices then they decide to leave
Some ordain for only one Rains Retreat then disrobe
Just like fruit in the wind  all very uncertain
Our minds are also similar
A mental impression arises draws and pulls at the mind then the mind falls  just like fruit
The Buddha understood this uncertain nature of things
He observed the phenomenon of fruit in the wind and reflected upon the monks and novices who were his disciples
He found that they too were essentially of the same nature  uncertain
How could it be otherwise
This is just the way of all things
Thus for one who is practicing with awareness it isn't necessary to have someone to advise and teach all that much to be able to see and understand
An example is the case of the Buddha who in a previous life was King Chanokomun
He didn't need to study very much
All he had to do was observe a mango tree
One day while visiting a park with his retinue of ministers from atop his elephant he spied some mango trees heavily laden with ripe fruit
Not being able to stop at that time he determined in his mind to return later to partake of some
Little did he know however that his ministers coming along behind would greedily gather them all up that they would use poles to knock them down beating and breaking the branches and tearing and scattering the leaves
Returning in the evening to the mango grove the king already imagining in his mind the delicious taste of the mangoes suddenly discovered that they were all gone completely finished
And not only that but the branches and leaves had been thoroughly thrashed and scattered
The king quite disappointed and upset then noticed another mango tree nearby with its leaves and branches still intact
He wondered why
He then realized it was because that tree had no fruit
If a tree has no fruit nobody disturbs it and so its leaves and branches are not damaged
This lesson kept him absorbed in thought all the way back to the palace It is unpleasant troublesome and difficult to be a king
It requires constant concern for all his subjects
What if there are attempts to attack plunder and seize parts of his kingdom He could not rest peacefully even in his sleep he was disturbed by dreams
He saw in his mind once again the mango tree without fruit and its undamaged leaves and branches
If we become similar to that mango tree he thought our leaves and branches too would not be damaged
In his chamber he sat and meditated
Finally he decided to ordain as a monk having been inspired by this lesson of the mango tree
He compared himself to that mango tree and concluded that if one didn't become involved in the ways of the world one would be truly independent free from worries or difficulties
The mind would be untroubled
Reflecting thus he ordained
From then on wherever he went when asked who his teacher was he would answer A mango tree He didn't need to receive teaching all that much
A mango tree was the cause of his Awakening to the OpanayikoDhamma the teaching leading inwards
And with this Awakening he became a monk one who has few concerns is content with little and who delights in solitude
His royal status given up his mind was finally at peace
In this story the Buddha was a Bodhisatta who developed his practice in this way continuously
Like the Buddha as King Chanokomun we too should look around us and be observant because everything in the world is ready to teach us
With even a little intuitive wisdom we will then be able to see clearly through the ways of the world
We will come to understand that everything in the world is a teacher
Trees and vines for example can all reveal the true nature of reality
With wisdom there is no need to question anyone no need to study
We can learn from Nature enough to be enlightened as in the story of King Chanokomun because everything follows the way of Truth
It does not diverge from Truth
Associated with wisdom are selfcomposure and restraint which in turn can lead to further insight into the ways of Nature
In this way we will come to know the ultimate truth of everything being AniccaDukkhaAnatta Take trees for example all trees upon the earth are equal are One when seen through the reality of AniccaDukkhaAnatta First they come into being then grow and mature constantly changing until they die finally die as every tree must
In the same way people and animals are born grow and change during their lifetimes until they eventually die
The multitudinous changes which occur during this transition from birth to death show the Way of Dhamma
That is to say all things are impermanent having decay and dissolution as their natural condition
If we have awareness and understanding if we study with wisdom and mindfulness we will see Dhamma as reality
Thus we sill see people as constantly being born changing and finally passing away
Everyone is subject to the cycle of birth and death and because of this everyone in the universe is as One being
Thus seeing one person clearly and distinctly is the same as seeing every person in the world
In the same way everything is Dhamma
Not only the things we see with our physical eye but also the things we see in our minds
A thought arises then changes and passes away
It is Nama Dhamma simply a mental impression that arises and passes away
This is the real nature of the mind
Altogether this is the Noble Truth of Dhamma
If one doesn't look and observe in this way one doesn't really see
If one does see one will have the wisdom to listen to the Dhamma as proclaimed by the Buddha
The Buddha the Dhamma and the Sangha exist in our minds but we have to see it clearly
Some people just pick this up casually saying Oh
The Buddha the Dhamma and the Sangha exist in my mind Yet their own practice is not suitable or appropriate
It is thus not befitting that the Buddha the Dhamma and the Sangha should be found in their minds namely because the mind must first be that mind which knows the Dhamma
Bringing everything back to this point of Dhamma we will come to know that in the world Truth does exist and thus it is possible for us to practice to realize it
For instance Nama Dhamma feelings thoughts imagination etc are all uncertain
When anger arises it grows and changes and finally disappears
Happiness too arises grows and changes and finally disappears
They are empty
They are not any thing This is always the way of all things both mentally and materially
Internally there are this body and mind
Externally there are trees vines and all manner of things which display this universal law of uncertainty
Whether a tree a mountain or an animal it's all Dhamma everything is Dhamma
Where is this Dhamma
Speaking simply that which is not Dhamma doesn't exist
Dhamma is Nature
This is called the SaccaDhamma the True Dhamma
If one sees Nature one sees Dhamma if one sees Dhamma one sees Nature
Seeing Nature one know the Dhamma
And so what is the use of a lot of study when the ultimate reality of life in its every moment in its every act is just an endless cycle of births and deaths
If we are mindful and clearly aware when in all postures then selfknowledge is ready to be born that is knowing the truth of Dhamma already in existence right here and now
At present the Buddha the real Buddha is still living for He is the Dhamma itself the SaccaDhamma And SaccaDhamma that which enables one to become Buddha still exists
It hasn't fled anywhere
It gives rise to two Buddhas one in body and the other in mind
The real Dhamma the Buddha told Ananda can only be realized through practice Whoever sees the Buddha sees the Dhamma
And how is this
Previously no Buddha existed it was only when Siddhartha Gotama realized the Dhamma that he became the Buddha
If we explain it in this way then He is the same as us
If we realize the Dhamma then we will likewise be the Buddha
This is called the Buddha in mind or NamaDhamma
We must be mindful of everything we do for we become the inheritors of our own good or evil actions
In doing good we reap good
In doing evil we reap evil
All you have to do is look into your everyday lives to know that this is so
Siddhartha Gotama was enlightened to the realization of this Truth and this gave rise to the appearance of a Buddha in the world
Likewise if each and every person practices to attain to this Truth then they too will change to be Buddha
Thus the Buddha still exists
Some people are very happy saying If the Buddha still exists then I can practice Dhamma That is how you should see it
The Dhamma that the Buddha realized is the Dhamma which exists permanently in the world
It can be compared to ground water which permanently exists in the ground
When a person wishes to dig a well he must dig down deep enough to reach the ground water
The ground water is already there
He does not create the water he just discovers it
Similarly the Buddha did not invent the Dhamma did not decree the Dhamma
He merely revealed what was already there
Through contemplation the Buddha saw the Dhamma
Therefore it is said that the Buddha was Enlightened for Enlightenment is knowing the Dhamma
The Dhamma is the Truth of this world
Seeing this Siddhartha Gotama is called The Buddha And the Dhamma is that which allows other people to become a Buddha Onewhoknows one who knows Dhamma
If beings have good conduct and are loyal to the BuddhaDhamma then those beings will never be short of virtue and goodness
With understanding we will see that we are really not far from the Buddha but sitting face to face with Him
When we understand the Dhamma then at that moment we will see the Buddha
If one really practices one will hear the BuddhaDhamma whether sitting at the root of a tree lying down or in whatever posture
This is not something to merely think about
It arises from the pure mind
Just remembering these words is not enough because this depends upon seeing the Dhamma itself nothing other than this
Thus we must be determined to practice to be able to see this and then our practice will really be complete
Wherever we sit stand walk or lie we will hear the Buddha's Dhamma
In order to practice His Teaching the Buddha taught us to live in a quiet place so that we can learn to collect and restrain the senses of the eye ear nose tongue body and mind
This is the foundation for our practice since these are the places where all things arise and only in these places
Thus we collect and restrain these six senses in order to know the conditions that arise there
All good and evil arise through these six senses
They are the predominant faculties in the body
The eye is predominant in seeing the ear in hearing the nose in smelling the tongue in tasting the body in contacting hot cold hard and soft and the mind in the arising of mental impressions
All that remains for us to do is to build our practice around these points
The practice is easy because all that is necessary has already been set down by the Buddha
This is comparable to the Buddha planting an orchard and inviting us to partake of its fruit
We ourselves do not need to plant one
Whether concerning morality meditation or wisdom there is no need to create decree or speculate because all that we need to do is follow the things which already exist in the Buddha's Teaching
Therefore we are beings who have much merit and good fortune in having heard the Teachings of the Buddha
The orchard already exists the fruit is already ripe
Everything is already complete and perfect
All that is lacking is someone to partake of the fruit someone with faith enough to practice
We should consider that our merit and good fortune are very valuable
All we need to do is look around to see how much other creatures are possessed of illfortune take dogs pigs snakes and other creatures for instance
They have no chance to study Dhamma no chance to know Dhamma no chance to practice Dhamma
These are beings possessed of illfortune who are receiving karmic retribution
When one has no chance to study to know to practice Dhamma then one has no chance to be free from Suffering
As human beings we should not allow ourselves to become victims of illfortune deprived of proper manners and discipline
Do not become a victim of illfortune
That is to say one without hope of attaining the Path of Freedom to Nibbana without hope of developing virtue
Do not think that we are already without hope
By thinking in that way we would then become possessed of illfortune the same as other creatures
We are beings who have come within the sphere of influence of the Buddha
Thus we human beings are already of sufficient merit and resources
If we correct and develop our understanding opinions and knowledge in the present then it will lead us to behave and practice in such a way as to see and know Dhamma in this present life as human beings
We are thus different from other creatures beings that should be enlightened to the Dhamma
The Buddha taught that at this present moment the Dhamma exists here in front of us
The Buddha sits facing us right here and now
At what other time or place are you going to look
If we don't think rightly if we don't practice rightly we will fall back to being animals or creatures in Hell or hungry ghosts or demons
How is this
Just look in your mind
When anger arises what is it
There it is just look
When delusion arises what is it
That's it right there
When greed arises what is it
Look at it right there
By not recognizing and clearly understanding these mental states the mind changes from being that of a human being
All conditions are in the state of becoming
Becoming gives rise to birth or existence as determined by the present conditions
Thus we become and exist as our minds condition us
In our lives we have two possibilities indulging in the world or going beyond the world
The Buddha was someone who was able to free Himself from the world and thus realized spiritual Liberation
In the same way there are two types of knowledge  knowledge of the worldly realm and knowledge of the spiritual or true wisdom
If we have not yet practiced and trained ourselves no matter how much knowledge we have it is still worldly and thus cannot liberate us
Think and really look closely
The Buddha said that things of the world spin the world around
Following the world the mind is entangled in the world it defiles itself whether coming or going never remaining content
Worldly people are those who are always looking for something  who can never find enough
Worldly knowledge is really ignorance it isn't knowledge with clear understanding therefore there is never an end to it
It revolves around the worldly goals of accumulating things gaining status seeking praise and pleasure it's a mass of delusion which has us stuck fast
Once we get something there is jealousy worry and selfishness
And when we feel threatened and can't ward it off physically we use our minds to invent all sorts of devices right up to weapons and even nuclear bombs only to blow each other up
Why all this trouble and difficulty
This is the way of the world
The Buddha said that if one follows it around there is no reaching an end
Come to practice for liberation
It isn't easy to live in accordance with true wisdom but whoever earnestly seeks the Path and Fruit and aspires to Nibbana will be able to persevere and endure
Endure being contented and satisfied with little eating little sleeping little speaking little and living in moderation
By doing this we can put an end to worldliness
If the seed of worldliness has not yet been uprooted then we are continually troubled and confused in a neverending cycle
Even when you come to ordain it continues to pull you away
It creates your views your opinions it colors and embellishes all your thoughts  that's the way it is
People don't realize
They say that they will get things done in the world
It's always their hope to complete everything
Just like a new government minister who is eager to get started with his new administration
He thinks that he has all the answers so he carts away everything of the old administration saying Look out
I'll do it all myself That's all they do cart things in and cart things out never getting anything done
They try but never reach any real completion
You can never do something which will please everyone  one person likes a little another likes a lot one like short and one likes long some like salty and some like spicy
To get everyone together and in agreement just cannot be done
All of us want to accomplish something in our lives but the world with all of its complexities makes it almost impossible to bring about any real completion
Even the Buddha born with all the opportunities of a noble prince found no completion in the worldly life
The Buddha talked about desire and the six things by which desire is gratified sights sounds smells tastes touch and mindobjects
Desire and lust for happiness for suffering for good for evil and so on pervade everything
Sights there isn't any sight that's quite the same as that of a woman
Isn't that so
Doesn't a really attractive woman make you want to look
One with a really attractive figure comes walking along sak sek sak sek sak sek  you can't help but stare
How about sounds
There's no sound that grips you more than that of a woman
It pierces your heart
Smell is the same a woman's fragrance is the most alluring of all
There's no other smell that's quite the same
Taste  even the taste of the most delicious food cannot compare with that of a woman
Touch is similar when you caress a woman you are stunned intoxicated and sent spinning all around
There was once a famous master of magical spells from Taxila in ancient India
He taught his disciple all his knowledge of charms and incantations
When the disciple was wellversed and ready to fare on his own he left with this final instruction from his teacher I have taught you all that I know of spells incantations and protective verses
Creatures with sharp teeth antlers or horns and even big tusks you have no need to fear
You will be guarded from all of these I can guarantee that
However there is only one thing that I cannot ensure protection against and that is the charms of a woman
I can not help you here
There's no spell for protection against this one you'll have to look after yourself
Mental objects arise in the mind
They are born out of desire desire for valuable possessions desire to be rich and just restless seeking after things in general
This type of greed isn't all that deep or strong it isn't enough to make you faint or lose control
However when sexual desire arises you're thrown off balance and lose your control
You would even forget those raised and brought you up  your own parents
The Buddha taught that the objects of our senses are a trap  a trap of Mara's
Mara should be understood as something which harms us
The trap is something which binds us the same as a snare
It's a trap of Mara's a hunter's snare and the hunter is Mara
If animals are caught in the hunter's trap it's a sorrowful predicament
They are caught fast and held waiting for the owner of the trap
Have you ever snared birds
The snare springs and boop  caught by the neck
A good strong string now holds it fast
Wherever the bird flies it cannot escape
It flies here and flies there but it's held tight waiting for the owner of the snare
When the hunter comes along that's it  the bird is struck with fear there's no escape
The trap of sights sounds smells tastes touch and mindobjects is the same
They catch us and bind us fast
If you attach to the senses you're the same as a fish caught on a hook
When the fisherman comes struggle all you want but you can't get loose
Actually you're not caught like a fish it's more like a frog  a frog gulps down the whole hook right to its guts a fish just gets caught in its mouth
Anyone attached to the senses is the same
Like a drunk whose liver is not yet destroyed  he doesn't know when he has had enough
He continues to indulge and drink carelessly
He's caught and later suffers illness and pain
A man comes walking along a road
He is very thirsty from his journey and is craving for a drink of water
The owner of the water says you can drink this water if you like the color is good the smell is good the taste is good but if you drink it you will become ill
I must tell you this beforehand it'll make you sick enough to die or nearly die The thirsty man does not listen
He's as thirsty as a person after an operation who has been denied water for seven days  he's crying for water
It's the same with a person thirsting after the senses
The Buddha taught that they are poisonous  sights sounds smells tastes touch and mindobjects are poison they are a dangerous trap
But this man is thirsty and doesn't listen because of his thirst he is in tears crying Give me water no matter how painful the consequences let me drink So he dips out a bit and swallows it down finding it very tasty
He drinks his fill and gets so sick that he almost dies
He didn't listen because of his overpowering desire
This is how it is for a person caught in the pleasures of the senses
He drinks in sights sounds smells tastes touch and mindobjects  they are all very delicious
So he drinks without stopping and there he remains stuck fast until the day he dies
Some people die some people almost die  that's how it is to be stuck in the way of the world
Worldly wisdom seeks after the senses and their objects
However wise it is it's only wise in a worldly sense
No matter how appealing it is it's only appealing in a worldly sense
However much happiness it is it's only happiness in a worldly sense
It isn't the happiness of liberation it won't free you from the world
We have come to practice as monks in order to penetrate true wisdom to rid ourselves of attachment
Practice to be free of attachment
Investigate the body investigate everything around you until you become weary and fed up with it all and then dispassion will set in
Dispassion will not arise easily however because you still don't see clearly
We come and ordain  we study we read we practice we meditate
We determine to make our minds resolute but it's hard to do
We resolve to do a certain practice we say that we'll practice in this way  only a day or two goes by maybe just a few hours pass and we forget all about it
Then we remember and try to make our minds firm again thinking This time I'll do it right Shortly after that we are pulled away by one of our senses and it all falls apart again so we have to start all over again
This is how it is
Like a poorly built dam our practice is weak
We are still unable to see and follow true practice
And it goes on like this until we arrive at true wisdom
Once we penetrate to the Truth we are freed from everything
Only peace remains
Our minds aren't peaceful because of our old habits
We inherit these because of our past actions and thus they follow us around and constantly plague us
We struggle and search for a way out but we're bound by them and they pull us back
These habits don't forget their old grounds
They grab onto all the old familiar things to use to admire and to consume  that's how we live
The sexes of man and woman  woman cause problems for men men cause problems for women
That's the way it is they are opposites
If men live together with men then there's no trouble
If women live together with women then there's no trouble
When a man sees a woman his heart pounds like a rice pounder deung dung deung dung deung dung What is this
What are those forces
It pulls and sucks you in  no one realizes that there's a price to pay
It's the same in everything
No matter how hard you try to free yourself until you see the value of freedom and the pain in bondage you won't be able to let go
People usually just practice enduring hardships keeping the discipline following the form blindly and not in order to attain freedom or liberation
You must see the value in letting go of your desires before you can really practice only then is true practice possible
Everything that you do must be done with clarity and awareness
When you see clearly there will no longer be any need for enduring or forcing yourself
You have difficulties and are burdened because you miss this point
Peace comes from doing things completely with your whole body and mind
Whatever is left undone leaves you with a feeling of discontent
These things bind you with worry wherever you go
You want to complete everything but it's impossible to get it all done
Take the case of the merchants who regularly come here to see me
They say Oh when my debts are all paid and property in order I'll come to ordain They talk like that but will they ever finish and get it all in order
There's no end to it
They pay up their debts with another loan they pay off that one and do it all again
A merchant thinks that if he frees himself from debt he will be happy but there's no end to paying things off
That's the way worldliness fools us  we go around and around like this never realizing our predicament
In our practice we just look directly at the mind
Whenever our practice begins to slacken off we see it and make it firm  then shortly after it goes again
That's the way it pulls you around
But the person with good mindfulness takes a firm hold and constantly reestablishes himself pulling himself back training practicing and developing himself in this way
The person with poor mindfulness just lets it all fall apart he strays off and gets sidetracked again and again
He's not strong and firmly rooted in practice
Thus he's continuously pulled away by his worldly desires  something pulls him here something pulls him there
He lives following his whims and desires never putting an end to this worldly cycle
Coming to ordain is not so easy
You must determine to make your mind firm
You should be confident in the practice confident enough to continue practicing until you become fed up with both your like and dislikes and see in accordance with Truth
Usually you are dissatisfied with only your dislike if you like something then you aren't ready to give it up
You have to become fed up with both your dislike and your likes your suffering and your happiness
You don't see that this is the very essence of the Dhamma
The Dhamma of the Buddha is profound and refined
It isn't easy to comprehend
If true wisdom has not yet arisen then you can't see it
You don't look forward and you don't look back
When you experience happiness you think that there will only be happiness
Whenever there is suffering you think that there will only be suffering
You don't see that wherever there is big there is small wherever there is small there is big
You don't see it that way
You see only one side and thus it's neverending
There are two sides to everything you must see both sides
Then when happiness arises you don't get lost when suffering arises you don't get lost
When happiness arises you don't forget the suffering because you see that they are interdependent
In a similar way food is beneficial to all beings for the maintenance of the body
But actually food can also be harmful for example when it causes various stomach upsets
When you see the advantages of something you must perceive the disadvantages also and vice versa
When you feel hatred and aversion you should contemplate love and understanding
In this way you become more balanced and your mind becomes more settled
I once read a book about Zen
In Zen you know they don't teach with a lot of explanation
For instance if a monk is falling asleep during meditation they come with a stick and whack they give him a hit on the back
When the erring disciple is hit he shows his gratitude by thanking the attendant
In Zen practice one is taught to be thankful for all the feelings which give one the opportunity to develop
One day there was an assembly of monks gathered for a meeting
Outside the hall a flag was blowing in the wind
There arose a dispute between two monks as to how the flag was actually blowing in the wind
One of the monks claimed that it was because of the wind while the other argued that it was because of the flag
Thus they quarreled because of their narrow views and couldn't come to any kind of agreement
They would have argued like this until the day they died
However their Teacher intervened and said Neither of you is right
The correct understanding is that there is no flag and there is no wind
This is the practice not to have anything not to have the flag and not to have the wind
If there is a flag then there is a wind if there is a wind then there is a flag
You should contemplate and reflect on this thoroughly until you see in accordance with Truth
If considered well then there will remain nothing
It's empty  void empty of the flag and empty of the wind
In the great Void there is no flag and there is no wind
There is no birth no old age no sickness or death
Our conventional understanding of flag and wind is only a concept
In reality there is nothing
That's all
There is nothing more than empty labels
If we practice in this way we will come to see completeness and all of our problems will come to an end
In the great Void the King of Death will never find you
There is nothing for old age sickness and death to follow
When we see and understand in accordance with Truth that is with Right Understanding then there is only this great emptiness
It's here that there is no more we no they no self at all
The world with its neverending ways goes on and on
If we try to understand it all it leads us only to chaos and confusion
However if we contemplate the world clearly then true wisdom will arise
The Buddha Himself was one who was wellversed in the ways of the world
He had great ability to influence and lead because of His abundance of worldly knowledge
Through the transformation of his worldly mundane wisdom He penetrated and attained to supermundane wisdom making Him a truly superior being
So if we work with this Teaching turning it inwards for contemplation we will attain to an understanding on an entirely new level
When we see an object there is no object
When we hear a sound the is no sound
In smelling we can say that there is no smell
All of the senses are manifest but they are void of anything stable
They are just sensations that arise and then pass away
If we understand according to this reality then the senses cease to be substantial
They are just sensations which come and go
In Truth there isn't any thing If there isn't any thing then there is no we and no they If there is no we as a person then there is nothing belonging to us It's in this way that suffering is extinguished
There isn't anybody to acquire suffering so who is it who suffers
When suffering arises we attach to the suffering and thereby must really suffer
In the same way when happiness arises we attach to the happiness and consequently experience pleasure
Attachment to these feelings gives rise to the concept of self or ego and thoughts of we and they continually manifest
Nah
Here is where it all begins and then carries us around in its neverending cycle
So we come to practice meditation and live according to the Dhamma
We leave our homes to come and live in the forest and absorb the peace of mind it gives us
We have fled in order to contend with ourselves and not through fear or escapism
But people who come and live in the forest become attached to living in it just as people who live in the city become attached to the city
They lose their way in the forest and they lose their way in the city
The Buddha praised living in the forest because the physical and mental solitude that it gives us is conducive to the practice for liberation
However He didn't want us to become dependent upon living in the forest or get stuck in its peace and tranquillity
We come to practice in order for wisdom to arise
Here in the forest we can sow and cultivate the seeds of wisdom
Living amongst chaos and turmoil these seeds have difficulty in growing but once we have learned to live in the forest we can return and contend with the city and all the stimulation of the senses that it brings us
Learning to live in the forest means to allow wisdom to grow and develop
We can then apply this wisdom no matter where we go
When our senses are stimulated we become agitated and the senses become our antagonists
They antagonize us because we are still foolish and don't have the wisdom to deal with them
In reality they are our teachers but because of our ignorance we don't see it that way
When we lived in the city we never thought that our senses could teach us anything
As long as true wisdom has not yet manifested we continue to see the senses and their objects as enemies
Once true wisdom arises they are no longer our enemies but become the doorway to insight and clear understanding
A good example is the wild chickens here in the forest
We all know how much they are afraid of humans
However since I have lived here in the forest I have been able to teach them and learn from them as well
At one time I began throwing out rice for them to eat
At first they were very frightened and wouldn't go near the rice
However after a long time they got used to it and even began to expect it
You see there is something to be learned here  they originally thought that there was danger in the rice that the rice was an enemy
In truth there was no danger in the rice but they didn't know that the rice was food and so were afraid
When they finally saw for themselves that there was nothing to fear they could come and eat without any danger
The chickens learn naturally in this way
Living here in the forest we learn in a similar way
Formerly we thought that our senses were a problem and because of our ignorance in the proper use of them they caused us a lot trouble
However by experience in practice we learn to see them in accordance with Truth
We learn to make use of them just as the chickens could use the rice
Then they are no longer opposed to us and problems disappear
As long as we think investigate and understand wrongly these things will oppose us
But as soon as we begin to investigate properly that which we experience will bring us to wisdom and clear understanding just as the chickens came to their understanding
In this way we can say that they practiced Vipassana They know in accordance with Truth it's their insight
In our practice we have our senses as tools which when rightly used enable us to become enlightened to the Dhamma
This is something which all meditator should contemplate
When we don't see this clearly we remain in perpetual conflict
So as we live in the quietude of the forest we continue to develop subtle feelings and prepare the ground for cultivating wisdom
Don't think that when you have gained some peace of mind living here in the quiet forest that that's enough
Don't settle for just that
Remember that we have to cultivate and grow the seeds of wisdom
As wisdom matures and we begin to understand in accordance with the Truth we will no longer be dragged up and down
Usually if we have a pleasant mood we behave one way and if we have an unpleasant mood we are another way
We like something and we are up we dislike something and we are down
In this way we are still in conflict with enemies
When these things no longer oppose us they become stabilized and balance out
There are no longer ups and downs or highs and lows
We understand these things of the world and know that that's just the way it is
It's just worldly dhamma
Worldly dhamma changes to become the Path
Worldly dhamma has eight ways the Path has eight ways
Wherever worldly dhamma exists the Path is to be found also
When we live with clarity all of our worldly experience becomes the practicing of the Eightfold Path Without clarity worldly dhamma predominates and we are turned away from the Path When Right Understanding arises liberation from suffering lies right here before us
You will not find liberation by running around looking elsewhere
So don't be in a hurry and try to push or rush your practice
Do your meditation gently and gradually step by step
In regard to peacefulness if you want to become peaceful then accept it if you don't become peaceful then accept that also
That's the nature of the mind
We must find our own practice and persistently keep at it
Perhaps wisdom does not arise
I used to think about my practice that when there is no wisdom I could force myself to have it
But it didn't work things remained the same
Then after careful consideration I saw that to contemplate things that we don't have cannot be done
So what's the best thing to do
It's better just to practice with equanimity
If there is nothing to cause us concern then there's nothing to remedy
If there's no problem then we don't have to try to solve it
When there is a problem that's when you must solve it right there
There's no need to go searching for anything special just live normally
But know what your mind is
Live mindfully and clearly comprehending
Let wisdom be your guide don't live indulging in your moods
Be heedful and alert
If there is nothing that's fine when something arises then investigate and contemplate it
Try watching a spider
A spider spins its web in any convenient niche and then sits in the center staying still and silent
Later a fly comes along and lands on the web
As soon as it touches and shakes the web boop  the spider pounces and winds it up in thread
It stores the insect away and then returns again to collect itself silently in the center of the web
Watching a spider like this can give rise to wisdom
Our six senses have mind at the center surrounded by eye ear nose tongue and body
When one of the senses is stimulated for instance form contacting the eye it shakes and reaches the mind
The mind is that which knows that which knows form
Just this much is enough for wisdom to arise
It's that simple
Like a spider in its web we should live keeping to ourselves
As soon as the spider feels an insect contact the web it quickly grabs it ties it up and once again returns to the center
This is not at all different from our own minds
Coming to the center means living mindfully with clear comprehension being always alert and doing everything with exactness and precision  this is our center
There's really not a lot for us to do we just carefully live in this way
But that doesn't mean that we live heedlessly thinking There is no need to do siting or walking meditation and so forget all about our practice
We can't be careless
We must remain alert just as the spider waits to snatch up insects for its food
This is all that we have to know  sitting and contemplating that spider
Just this much and wisdom can arise spontaneously
Our mind is comparable to the spider our moods and mental impressions are comparable to the various insects
That's all there is to it
The senses envelop and constantly stimulate the mind when any of them contact something it immediately reaches the mind
The mind then investigates and examines it thoroughly after which it returns to the center
This is how we abide  alert acting with precision and always mindfully comprehending with wisdom
Just this much and our practice is complete
This point is very important
It isn't that we have to do sitting practice throughout the day and night or that we have to do walking meditation all day and all night long
If this is our view of practice then we really make it difficult for ourselves
We should do what we can according to our strength and energy using our physical capabilities in the proper amount
It's very important to know the mind and the other senses well
Know how they come and how they go how they arise and how they pass away
Understand this thoroughly
In the language of Dhamma we can also say that just as the spider traps the various insects the mind binds up the senses with AniccaDukkhaAnatta
Where can they go
We keep them for food these things are stored away as our nourishment
That's enough there's no more to do just this much
This is the nourishment for our minds nourishment for one who is aware and understanding
If you know that these things are impermanent bound up with suffering and that none of it is you then you would be crazy to go after them
If you don't see clearly in this way then you must suffer
When you take a good look and see these things as really impermanent even though they may seem worth going after really they are not
Why do you want them when their nature is pain and suffering
It's not ours there is no self there is nothing belonging to us
So why are you seeking after them
All problems are ended right here
Where else will you end them
Just take a good look at the spider and turn it inwards turn it back unto yourself
You will see that it's all the same
When the mind has seen AniccaDukkha Anatta it lets go and releases itself
It no longer attaches to suffering or to happiness
This is the nourishment for the mind of one who practices and really trains himself
That's all it's that simple
You don't have to go searching anywhere
So no matter what you are doing you are there no need for a lot of fuss and bother
In this way the momentum and energy of your practice will continuously grow and mature
This momentum of practice leads us towards freedom from the cycle of birth and death
We haven't escaped from that cycle because we still insist on craving and desiring
We don't commit unwholesome or immoral acts but doing this only means that we are living in accordance with the Dhamma of morality for instance the chanting when people ask that all beings not be separated from the things that they love and are fond of
If you think about it this is very childish
It's the way of people who still can't let go
This is the nature of human desire  desire for things to be other than the way that they are wishing for longevity hoping that there is no death or sickness
This is how people hope and desire then when you tell them that whatever desires they have which are not fulfilled cause suffering it clobbers them right over the head
What can they say
Nothing because it's the Truth
You're pointing right at their desires
When we talk about desires we know that everyone has them and wants them fulfilled but nobody is willing to stop nobody really wants to escape
Therefore our practice must be patiently refined down
Those who practice steadfastly without deviation or slackness and have a gentle and restrained manner always persevering with constancy those are the ones who will know
No matter what arises they will remain firm and unshakable
In the time of Ajahn Mun and Ajahn Sao life was a lot simpler a lot less complicated than it is today
In those days monks had few duties and ceremonies to perform
They lived in the forests without permanent resting places
There they could devote themselves entirely to the practice of meditation
In those times one rarely encountered the luxuries that are so commonplace today there simply weren't any
One had to make drinking cups and spittoons out of bamboo and laypeople seldom came to visit
One didn't want or expect much and was content with what one had
One could live and breathe meditation
The monks suffered many privations living like this
If someone caught malaria and went to ask for medicine the Teacher would say You don't need medicine
Keep practicing Besides there simply weren't all the drugs that are available now
All one had were the herbs and roots that grew in the forest
The environment was such that monks had to have a great deal of patience and endurance they didn't bother over minor ailments
Nowadays you get a bit of an ache and you're off to the hospital
Sometimes one had to walk ten to twelve kilometers on almsround
You would leave as soon as it was light and maybe return around ten or eleven o'clock
One didn't get very much either perhaps some glutinous rice salt or a few chilis
Whether you got anything to eat with the rice or not didn't matter
That's the way it was
No one dared complain of hunger or fatigue they were just not inclined to complain but learned to take care of themselves
They practiced in the forest with patience and endurance alongside the many dangers that lurked in the surroundings
There were many wild and fierce animals living in the jungles and there were many hardships for body and mind in the ascetic practice of the Dhutanga or ForestDwelling monk
Indeed the patience and endurance of the monks in those days was excellent because the circumstances compelled them to be so
In the present day circumstances compel us in the opposite direction
In ancient times one had to travel by foot then came the oxcart and then the automobile
Aspiration and ambition increased so that now if the car is not airconditioned one will not even sit in it impossible to go if there is no airconditioning
The virtues of patience and endurance are becoming weaker and weaker
The standards for meditation and practice are lax and getting laxer until we find that meditators these days like to follow their own opinions and desires
When the old folks talk about the old days it's like listening to a myth or a legend
You just listen indifferently but you don't understand
It just doesn't reach you
As far as we should be concerned about the ancient monks' tradition a monk should spend at least five years with his Teacher
Some days you should avoid speaking to anyone
Don't allow yourself to speak or talk very much
Don't read books
Read your own heart instead
Take Wat Pah Pong for example
These days many university graduates are coming to ordain
I try to stop them from spending their time reading books about Dhamma because these people are always reading books
They have so many opportunities for reading books but opportunities for reading their own hearts are rare
So when they come to ordain for three months following the Thai custom we try to get them to close their books and manuals
While they are ordained they have this splendid opportunity to read their own hearts
Listening to your own heart is really very interesting
This untrained heart races around following its own untrained habits
It jumps about excitedly randomly because it has never been trained
Therefore train your heart
Buddhist meditation is about the heart to develop the heart or mind to develop your own heart
This is very very important
This training of the heart is the main emphasis
Buddhism is the religion of the heart
Only this
One who practices to develop the heart is one who practices Buddhism
This heart of ours lives in a cage and what's more there's a raging tiger in that cage
If this maverick heart of ours doesn't get what it wants it makes trouble
You must discipline it with meditation with Samadhi
This is called Training the Heart At the very beginning the foundation of practice is the establishment of moral discipline
Sila is the training of the body and speech
From this arises conflict and confusion
When you don't let yourself do what you want to do there is conflict
Eat little
Sleep little
Speak little
Whatever it may be of worldly habit lessen them go against their power
Don't just do as you like don't indulge in your thought
Stop this slavish following
You must constantly go against the stream of ignorance
This is called Discipline When you discipline your heart it becomes very dissatisfied and begins to struggle
It becomes restricted and oppressed
When the heart is prevented from doing what it wants to do it starts wandering and struggling
Suffering becomes apparent to us
This Dukkha this suffering is the first of the Four Noble Truths
Most people want to get away from it
They don't want to have any kind of suffering at all
Actually this suffering is what brings us wisdom it makes us contemplate Dukkha
Happiness tends to make us close our eyes and ears
It never allows us to develop patience
Comfort and happiness make us careless
Of these two defilements Dukkha is the easiest to see
Therefore we must bring up suffering in order to put an end to our suffering
We must first know what Dukkha is before we can know how to practice meditation
In the beginning you have to train your heart like this
You may not understand what is happening or what the point of it is but when the Teacher tells you to do something then you must do it
You will develop the virtues of patience and endurance
Whatever happens you endure because that is the way it is
For example when you begin to practice Samadhi you want peace and tranquillity
But you don't get any
You don't get any because you have never practiced this way
Your heart says I'll sit until I attain tranquillity But when tranquillity doesn't arise you suffer
And when there is suffering you get up and run away
To practice like this can not be called developing the heart It's called desertion
Instead of indulging in your moods you train yourself with the Dhamma of the Buddha
Lazy or diligent you just keep on practicing
Don't you think that this is a better way
The other way the way of following your moods will never reach the Dhamma
If you practice the Dhamma then whatever the mood may be you keep on practicing constantly practicing
The other way of selfindulgence is not the way of the Buddha
When we follow our own views on practice our own opinions about the Dhamma we can never see clearly what is right and what is wrong
We don't know our own heart
We don't know ourselves
Therefore to practice following your own teachings is the slowest way
To practice following the Dhamma is the direct way
Lazy you practice diligent you practice
You are aware of time and place
This is called developing the heart
If you indulge in following your own views and try to practice accordingly then you will start thinking and doubting a lot
You think to yourself I don't have very much merit
I don't have any luck
I've been practicing meditation for years now and I'm still unenlightened
I still haven't seen the Dhamma To practice with this kind of attitude can not be called developing the heart It is called developing disaster
If at this time you are like this if you are a meditator who still doesn't know who doesn't see if you haven't renewed yourself yet it's because you've been practicing wrongly
You haven't been following the Teachings of the Buddha
The Buddha taught like this Ananda practice a lot
Develop your practice constantly
Then all your doubts all your uncertainties will vanish These doubts will never vanish through thinking nor through theorizing nor through speculation nor through discussion
Nor will doubts disappear by not doing anything
All defilements will vanish through developing the heart through right practice only
The way of developing the heart as taught by the Buddha is the exact opposite of the way of the world because his Teachings come from a pure heart
A pure heart unattached to defilements is the Way of the Buddha and His Disciples
If you practice the Dhamma you must bow your heart to the Dhamma
You must not make the Dhamma bow to you
When you practice this way
suffering arises
There isn't a single person who can escape this suffering
So when you commence your practice suffering is right there
The duties of meditators are mindfulness collectedness and contentment
These things stop us
They stop the habits of the hearts of those who have never trained
And why should we bother to do this
If you don't bother to train your heart then it remains wild following the ways of nature
It's possible to train that nature so that it can be used to advantage
This is comparable to the example of trees
If we just left trees in their natural state then we would never be able to build a house with them
We couldn't make planks or anything of use in building a house
However if a carpenter came along wanting to build a house he would go looking for trees such as these
He would take this raw material and use it to advantage
In a short time he could have a house built
Meditation and developing the heart are similar to this
You must take this untrained heart the same as you would take a tree in its natural state in the forest and train this natural heart so that it is more refined so that it's more aware of itself and is more sensitive
Everything is in its natural state
When we understand nature then we can change it we can detach from it we can let go of it
Then we won't suffer anymore
The nature of our heart is such that whenever it clings and grasps there is agitation and confusion
First it might wander over there then it might wander over here
When we come to observe this agitation we might think that it's impossible to train the heart and so we suffer accordingly
We don't understand that this is the way the heart is
There will be thought and feelings moving about like this even though we are practicing trying to attain peace
That's the way it is
When we have contemplated many times the nature of the heart then we will come to understand that this heart is just as it is and can't be otherwise
We will know that the heart's ways are just as they are
That's its nature
If we see this clearly then we can detach from thoughts and feelings
And we don't have to add on anything more by constantly having to tell ourselves that that's just the way it is When the heart truly understands it lets go of everything
Thinking and feeling will still be there but that very thinking and feeling will be deprived of power
This is similar to a child who likes to play and frolic in ways that annoy us to the extent that we scold or spank him
We should understand that it's natural for a child to act that way
Then we could let go and leave him to play in his own way
So our troubles are over
How are they over
Because we accept the ways of children
Our outlook changes and we accept the true nature of things
We let go and our heart becomes more peaceful
We have Right Understanding
If we have wrong understanding then even living in a deep dark cave would be chaos or living high up in the air would be chaos
The heart can only be at peace when there is Right Understanding Then there are no more riddles to solve and no more problems to arise
This is the way it is
You detach
You let go
Whenever there is any feeling of clinging we detach from it because we know that that very feeling is just as it is
It didn't come along especially to annoy us
We might think that it did but in truth it is just that way
If we start to think and consider it further that too is just as it is
If we let go then form is merely form sound is merely sound odor is merely odor taste is merely taste touch is merely touch and the heart is merely the heart
It's similar to oil and water
If you put the two together in a bottle they won't mix because of the difference in their nature
Oil and water are different in the same way that a wise man and an ignorant man are different
The Buddha lived with form sound odor taste touch and thought
He was an arahant so He turned away from rather than toward these things
He turned away and detached little by little since He understood that the heart is just the heart and thought is just thought
He didn't confuse and mix them together
The heart is just the heart thoughts and feelings are just thoughts and feelings
Let things be just as they are
Let form be just form let sound be just sound let thought be just thought
Why should we bother to attach to them
If we think and feel in this way then there is detachment and separateness
Our thoughts and feelings will be on one side and our heart will be on the other
Just like oil and water  they are in the same bottle but they are separate
The Buddha and His Enlightened Disciples lived with ordinary unenlightened people
They not only lived with these people but they taught these ordinary unenlightened ignorant ones how to be Noble Enlightened Wise Ones
They could do this because they knew how to practice
They knew that it's a matter of the heart just as I have explained
So as far as your practice of meditation goes don't bother to doubt it
If we run away from home to ordain it's not running away to get lost in delusion
Nor out of cowardice or fear
It's running away in order to train ourselves in order to master ourselves
If we have understanding like this then we can follow the Dhamma
The Dhamma will become clearer and clearer
The one who understands the Dhamma understands himself and the one who understands himself understands the Dhamma
Nowadays only the sterile remains of the Dhamma have become the accepted order
In reality the Dhamma is everywhere
There is no need to escape to somewhere else
Instead escape through wisdom
Escape through intelligence
Escape through skill
don't escape through ignorance
If you want peace then let it be the peace of wisdom
That's enough
Whenever we see the Dhamma then there is the right way the right path
Defilements are just defilements the heart is just the heart
Whenever we detach and separate so that there are just these things as they really are then they are merely objects to us
When we are on the right path then we are impeccable
When we are impeccable there is openness and freedom all the time
The Buddha said Listen to me Monks
You must not cling to any dhammas What are these dhammas
They are everything there isn't anything which is not dhamma
Love and hate are dhammas happiness and suffering are dhammas like and dislike are dhammas all of these things no matter how insignificant are dhammas
When we practice the Dhamma when we understand then we can let go
And thus we can comply with the Buddha's Teaching of not clinging to any dhammas
All conditions that are born in our heart all conditions of our mind all conditions of our body are always in a state of change
The Buddha taught not to cling to any of them
He taught His Disciples to practice in order to detach from all conditions and not to practice in order to attain to any more
If we follow the Teachings of the Buddha then we are right
We are right but it is also troublesome
It's not that the Teachings are troublesome but it's our defilements which are troublesome
The defilements wrongly comprehended obstruct us and cause us trouble
There isn't really anything troublesome with following the Buddha's Teaching
In fact we can say that clinging to the Path of the Buddha doesn't bring suffering because the Path is simply let go of every single dhamma
For the ultimate in the practice of Buddhist Meditation the Buddha taught the practice of letting go don't carry anything around
Detach
If you see goodness let it go
If you see rightness let it go
These words let go do not mean that we don't have to practice
It means that we have to practice following the method of letting go itself
The Buddha taught us to contemplate all dhammas to develop the Path through contemplating our own body and heart
The Dhamma isn't anywhere else
It's right here
Not someplace far away
It's right here in this very body and heart of ours
Therefore a meditator must practice with energy
Make the heart grander and brighter
Make it free and independent
Having done a good deed don't carry it around in your heart let it go
Having refrained from doing an evil deed let it go
The Buddha taught us to live in the immediacy of the present in the here and now
Don't lose yourself in the past or the future
The Teaching that people least understand and which conflicts the most with their own opinions is this Teaching of letting go or working with an empty mind This way of talking is called Dhamma language When we conceive this in worldly terms we become confused and think that we can do anything we want
It can be interpreted this way but its real meaning is closer to this It's as if we are carrying a heavy rock
After a while we begin to feel its weight but we don't know how to let it go
So we endure this heavy burden all the time
If someone tells us to throw it away we say If I throw it away I won't have anything left If told of all the benefits to be gained from throwing it away we wouldn't believe them but would keep thinking If I throw it away I will have nothing So we keep on carrying this heavy rock until we become so weak and exhausted that we can no longer endure then we drop it
Having dropped it we suddenly experience the benefits of letting go
We immediately feel better and lighter and we know for ourselves how much of a burden carrying a rock can be
Before we let go of the rock we couldn't possibly know the benefits of letting go
So if someone tells us to let go an unenlightened man wouldn't see the purpose of it
He would just blindly clutch at the rock and refuse to let go until it became so unbearably heavy that he just had to let go
Then he can feel for himself the lightness and relief and thus know for himself the benefits of letting go
Later on we may start carrying burdens again but now we know what the results will be so we can now let go more easily
This understanding that it's useless to carry burdens around and that letting go brings ease and lightness is an example of knowing ourselves
Our pride our sense of self that we depend on is the same as that heavy rock
Like that rock if we think about letting go of selfconceit we are afraid that without it there would be nothing left
But when we can finally let it go we realize for ourselves the ease and comfort of not clinging
In the training of the heart you mustn't cling to either praise or blame
To just want praise and not to want blame is the way of the world
The Way of the Buddha is to accept praise when it is appropriate and to accept blame when it is appropriate
For example in raising a child it's very good not to just scold all the time
Some people scold too much
A wise person knows the proper time to scold and the proper time to praise
Our heart is the same
Use intelligence to know the heart
Use skill in taking care of your heart
Then you will be one who is clever in the training of the heart
And when the heart is skilled it can rid us of our suffering
Suffering exists right here in our hearts
It's always complicating things creating and making the heart heavy
It's born here
It also dies here
The way of the heart is like this
Sometimes there are good thoughts sometimes there are bad thoughts
The heart is deceitful
Don't trust it
Instead look straight at the conditions of the heart itself
Accept them as they are
They're just as they are
Whether it's good or evil or whatever that's the way it is
If you don't grab hold of these conditions then they don't become anything more or less than what they already are
If we grab hold we'll get bitten and will then suffer
With Right View there's only peace
Samadhi is born and wisdom takes over
Wherever you may sit or lie down there is peace
There is peace everywhere no matter where you may go
So today you have brought your disciples here to listen to the Dhamma
You may understand some of it some of it you may not
In order for you to understand more easily I've talked about the practice of meditation
Whether you think it is right or not you should take and contemplate it
As a Teacher myself I've been in a similar predicament
I too have longed to listen to Dhamma talks because wherever I went I was giving talks to others but never had a chance to listen
So at this time you really appreciate listening to a talk from a Teacher
Time passes by so quickly when you're sitting and listening quietly
You're hungry for Dhamma so you really want to listen
At first giving talks to others is a pleasure but after awhile the pleasure is gone
You feel bored and tired
Then you want to listen
So when you listen to a talk from a Teacher you feel much inspiration and you understand easily
When you are getting old and there's hunger for Dhamma its flavor is especially delicious
Being a Teacher of others you are an example to them you're a model for other bhikkhus
You're an example to your disciples
You're an example to everybody so don't forget yourself
But don't think about yourself either
If such thoughts do arise get rid of them
If you do this then you will be one who knows himself
There are a million ways to practice Dhamma
There's no end to the things that can be said about meditation
There are so many things that can make us doubt
Just keep sweeping them out then there's no more doubt
When we have right understanding like this no matter where we sit or walk there is peace and ease
Wherever we may meditate that's the place you bring your awareness
Don't hold that one only meditates while sitting or walking
Everything and everywhere is our practice
There's awareness all the time
There is mindfulness all the time
We can see birth and death of mind and body all the time and we don't let it clutter our hearts
Let it go constantly
If love comes let it go back to its home
If greed comes let it go home
If anger comes let it go home
Follow them
Where do they live
Then escort them there
Don't keep anything
If you practice like this then you are like an empty house
Or explained another way this is an empty heart a heart empty and free of all evil
We call it an empty heart but it isn't empty as if there was nothing it's empty of evil but filled with wisdom
Then whatever you do you'll do with wisdom
You'll think with wisdom
You'll eat with wisdom
There will only be wisdom
This is the Teaching for today and I offer it to you
I've recorded it on tape
If listening to Dhamma makes your heart at peace that's good enough
You don't need to remember anything
Some may not believe this
If we make our heart peaceful and just listen letting it pass by but contemplating continuously like this then we're like a tape recorder
After some time when we turn on everything is there
Have no fear that there won't be anything
As soon as you turn on your tape recorder everything is there
I wish to offer this to every bhikkhu and to everyone
Some of you probably know only a little Thai but that doesn't matter
May you learn the language of the Dhamma
That's good enough
This short talk is for the benefit of a new disciple who will soon be returning to London
May it serve to help you understand the Teaching that you have studied here at Wat Pah Pong
Most simply this is the practice to be free of suffering in the cycle of birth and death
In order to do this practice remember to regard all the various activities of mind all those you like and all those you dislike in the same way as you would regard a cobra
The cobra is an extremely poisonous snake poisonous enough to cause death if it should bite us
And so also it is with our moods the moods that we like are poisonous the moods that we dislike are also poisonous
They prevent our minds from being free and hinder our understanding of the Truth as it was taught by the Buddha
Thus is it necessary to try to maintain our mindfulness throughout the day and night
Whatever you may be doing be it standing sitting lying down speaking or whatever you should do with mindfulness
When you are able to establish this mindfulness you'll find that there will arise clear comprehension associated with it and these two conditions will bring about wisdom
Thus mindfulness clear comprehension and wisdom will work together and you'll be like one who is awake both day and night
These Teachings left us by the Buddha are not Teachings to be just listened to or simply absorbed on an intellectual level
They are Teachings that through practice can be made to arise and known in our hearts
Wherever we go whatever we do we should have these Teachings
And what we mean by to have these Teachings or to have the Truth is that whatever we do or say we do and say with wisdom
When we think and contemplate we do so with wisdom
We say that one who has mindfulness and clear comprehension combined in this way with wisdom is one who is close to the Buddha
When you leave here you should practice bringing everything back to your own mind
Look at your mind with this mindfulness and clear comprehension and develop this wisdom
With these three conditions there will arise a letting go You'll know the constant arising and passing away of all phenomena
You should know that that which is arising and passing away is only the activity of mind
When something arises it passes away and is followed by further arising and passing away
In the Way of Dhamma we call this arising and passing away birth and death and this is everything  this is all there is
When suffering has arisen it passes away and when it has passed away suffering arises again
There's just suffering arising and passing away
When you see this much you'll be able to know constantly this arising and passing away and when your knowing is constant you'll see that this is really all there is
Everything is just birth and death
It's not as if there is anything which carries on
There's just this arising and passing away as it is  that's all
This kind of seeing will give rise to a tranquil feeling of dispassion towards the world
Such a feeling arises when we see that actually there is nothing worth wanting there is only arising and passing away a being born followed by a dying
This is when the mind arrives at letting go letting everything go according to its own nature
Things arise and pass away in our mind and we know
When happiness arises we know when dissatisfaction arises we know
And this knowing happiness means that we don't identify with it as being ours
And likewise with dissatisfaction and unhappiness we don't identify with them as being ours
When we no longer identify with and cling to happiness and suffering we are simply left with the natural way of things
So we say that mental activity is like the deadly poisonous cobra
If we don't interfere with a cobra it simply goes its own way
Even though it may be extremely poisonous we are not affected by it we don't go near it or take hold of it and it doesn't bite us
The cobra does what is natural for a cobra to do
That's the way it is
If you are clever you'll leave it alone
And so you let be that which is good
You also let be that which is not good  let it be according to its own nature
Let be your liking and your disliking the same way as you don't interfere with the cobra
So one who is intelligent will have this kind of attitude towards the various moods that arise in the mind
When goodness arises we let it be good but we know also
We understand its nature
And too we let be the notgood we let it be according to its nature
We don't take hold of it because we don't want anything
We don't want evil neither do we want good
We want neither heaviness nor lightness happiness nor suffering
When in this way our wanting is at an end peace is firmly established
When we have this kind of peace established in our minds we can depend on it
This peace we say has arisen out of confusion
Confusion has ended
The Buddha called the attainment of final Enlightenment an extinguishing in the same way that fire is extinguished
We extinguish fire at the place at which it appears
Wherever it is hot that's where we can make it cool
And so it is with Enlightenment
Nibbana is found in Samsara
Enlightenment and delusion exist in the same place just as do hot and cold
It's hot where it was cold and cold where it was hot
When heat arises the coolness disappears and when there is coolness there's no more heat
In this way Nibbana and Samsara are the same
We are told to put an end to Samsara which means to stop the everturning cycle of confusion
This putting an end to confusion is extinguishing the fire
When external fire is extinguished there is coolness
When the internal fires of sensual craving aversion and delusion are put out then this is coolness also
This is the nature of Enlightenment it's the extinguishing of fire the cooling of that which was hot
This is peace
This is the end of Samsara the cycle of birth and death
When you arrive at Enlightenment this is how it is
It's an ending of the everturning and everchanging an ending of greed aversion and delusion in our minds
We talk about it in terms of happiness because this is how worldly people understand the ideal to be but in reality it has gone beyond
It is beyond both happiness and suffering
It's perfect peace
So as you go you should take this Teaching which I have given you and contemplate it carefully
Your stay here hasn't been easy and I have had little opportunity to give you instruction but in this time you have been able to study the real meaning of our practice
May this practice lead you to happiness may it help you grow in Truth
May you be freed from the suffering of birth and death
Our way of practice is looking closely at things and making them clear
We're persistent and constant yet not rushed or hurried
Neither are we too slow
It's a matter of gradually feeling our way and bringing it together
However all of this bringing it together is working towards something there is a point to our practice
For most of us when we first start to practice it's nothing other than desire
We start to practice because of wanting
At this stage our wanting is wanting in the wrong way
That is it's deluded
It's wanting mixed with wrong understanding
If wanting is not mixed with wrong understanding like this we say that it's wanting with wisdom
It's not deluded  it's wanting with right understanding
In a case like this we say that it's due to a person's Parami or past accumulations
However this isn't the case with everyone
Some people don't want to have desire or they want not to have desires because they think that our practice is directed at not wanting
However if there is no desire then there's no way of practice
We can see this for ourselves
The Buddha and all His Disciples practiced to put an end to defilements
We must want to practice and must want to put an end to defilements
We must want to have peace of mind and want not to have confusion
However if this wanting is mixed with wrong understanding then it will only amount to more difficulties for us
If we are honest about it we really know nothing at all
Or what we do know is of no consequence since we are unable to use it properly
Everybody including the Buddha started out like this with the desire to practice  wanting to have peace of mind and wanting not to have confusion and suffering
These two kinds of desire have exactly the same value
If not understood then both wanting to be free from confusion and not wanting to have suffering are defilements
They're a foolish way of wanting  desire without wisdom
In our practice we see this desire as either sensual indulgence or selfmortification
It's in this very conflict that our Teacher the Buddha was caught up just this dilemma
He followed many ways of practice which merely ended up in these two extremes
And these days we are exactly the same
We are still afflicted by this duality and because of it we keep falling from the Way
However this is how we must start out
We start out as worldly beings as beings with defilements with wanting devoid of wisdom desire without right understanding
If we lack proper understanding then both kinds of desire work against us
Whether it's wanting or not wanting it's still craving
If we don't understand these two things then we won't know how to deal with them when they arise
We will feel that to go forward is wrong and to go backwards is wrong and yet we can't stop
Whatever we do we just find more wanting
This is because of the lack of wisdom and because of craving
It's right here with this wanting and not wanting that we can understand the Dhamma
The Dhamma which we are looking for exists right here but we don't see it
Rather we persist in our efforts to stop wanting
We want things to be a certain way and not any other way
Or we want them not to be a certain way but to be another way
Really these two things are the same
They are part of the same duality
Perhaps we may not realize that the Buddha and all of His Disciples had this kind of wanting
However the Buddha understood regarding wanting and not wanting
He understood that they are simply the activity of mind that such things merely appear in a flash and then disappear
These kinds of desires are going on all the time
When there is wisdom we don't identify with them  we are free from clinging
Whether it's wanting or not wanting we simply see it as such
In reality it's merely the activity of the natural mind
When we take a close look we see clearly that this is how it is
So it's here that our practice of contemplation will lead us to understanding
Let us take an example the example of a fisherman pulling in his net with a big fish in it
How do you think he feels about pulling it in
If he's afraid that the fish will escape he'll be rushed and start to struggle with the net grabbing and tugging at it
Before he knows it the big fish has escaped  he was trying too hard
In the olden days they would talk like this
They taught that we should do it gradually carefully gathering it in without losing it
This is how it is in our practice we gradually feel our way with it carefully gathering it in without losing it
Sometimes it happens that we don't feel like doing it
Maybe we don't want to look or maybe we don't want to know but we keep on with it
We continue feeling for it
This is practice if we feel like doing it we do it and if we don't feel like doing it we do it just the same
We just keep doing it
If we are enthusiastic about our practice the power of our faith will give energy to what we are doing
But at this stage we are still without wisdom
Even though we are very energetic we will not derive much benefit from our practice
We may continue with it for a long time and a feeling will arise that aren't going to find the Way
We may feel that we cannot find peace and tranquillity or that we aren't sufficiently equipped to do the practice
Or maybe we feel that this Way just isn't possible anymore
So we give up
At this point we must be very very careful
We must use great patience and endurance
It's just like pulling in the big fish  we gradually feel our way with it
We carefully pull it in
The struggle won't be too difficult so without stopping we continue pulling it in
Eventually after some time the fish becomes tired and stops fighting and we're able to catch it easily
Usually this is how it happens we practice gradually gathering it together
It's in this manner that we do our contemplation
If we don't have any particular knowledge or learning in the theoretical aspects of the Teachings we contemplate according to our everyday experience
We use the knowledge which we already have the knowledge derived from our everyday experience
This kind of knowledge is natural to the mind
Actually whether we study about it or not we have the reality of the mind right here already
The mind is the mind whether we have learned about it or not
This is why we say that whether the Buddha is born in the world or not everything is the way it is
Everything already exists according to its own nature
This natural condition doesn't change nor does it go anywhere
It just is that way
This is called the Sacca Dhamma
However if we don't understand about this Sacca Dhamma we won't be able to recognize it
So we practice contemplation in this way
If we aren't particularly skilled in scripture we take the mind itself to study and read
Continually we contemplate and understanding regarding the nature of the mind will gradually arise
We don't have to force anything
Until we are able to stop our mind until we reach tranquillity the mind will just continue as before
It's for this reason that the Teacher says Just keep on doing it keep on with the practice Maybe we think If I don't yet understand how can I do it Until we are able to practice properly wisdom doesn't arise
So we say just keep on with it
If we practice without stopping we'll begin to think about what we are doing
We'll start to consider our practice
Nothing happens immediately so in the beginning we can't see any results from our practice
This is like the example I have often given you of the man who tries to make fire by rubbing two sticks of wood together
He says to himself They say there's fire here and he begins rubbing energetically
He's very impetuous
He rubs on and on but his impatience doesn't end
He wants to have that fire
He keeps wanting to have that fire but the fire doesn't come
So he gets discouraged and stops to rest for awhile
He starts again but the going is slow so he rests again
By then the heat has disappeared he didn't keep at it long enough
He rubs and rubs until he tires and then he stops altogether
Not only is he tired but he becomes more and more discouraged until he gives up completely
There's no fire here Actually he was doing the work but there wasn't enough heat to start a fire
The fire was there all the time but he didn't carry on to the end
This sort of experience causes the meditator to get discouraged in his practice and so he restlessly changes from one practice to another
And this sort of experience is also similar to our own practice
It's the same for everybody
Why
Because we are still grounded in defilements
The Buddha had defilements also but He had a lot of wisdom in this respect
While still worldlings the Buddha and the arahants were just the same as us
If we are still worldlings then we don't think rightly
Thus when wanting arises we don't see it and when not wanting arises we don't see it
Sometimes we feel stirred up and sometimes we feel contented
When we have not wanting we have a kind of contentment but we also have a kind of confusion
When we have wanting this can be contentment and confusion of another kind
It's all intermixed in this way
The Buddha taught us to contemplate our body for example hair of the head hair of the body nails teeth skin it's all body
Take a look
We are told to investigate right here
If we don't see these things clearly as they are in ourselves we won't understand regarding other people
We won't see others clearly nor will we see ourselves
However if we do understand and see clearly the nature of our own bodies our doubts and wonderings regarding others will disappear
This is because body and mind are the same for everybody
It isn't necessary to go and examine all the bodies in the world since we know that they are the same as us  we are the same as them
If we have this kind of understanding then our burden becomes lighter
Without this kind of understanding all we do is develop a heavier burden
In order to know about others we would have to go and examine everybody in the entire world
That would be very difficult
We would soon become discouraged
Our Vinaya is similar to this
When we look at our Vinaya we feel that it's very difficult
We must keep every rule study every rule review our practice with every rule
If we just think about it Oh it's impossible We read the literal meaning of all the numerous rules and if we merely follow our thinking about them we could well decide that it's beyond our ability to keep them all
Anyone who has had this kind of attitude towards the Vinaya has the same feeling about it  there are a lot of rules
The scriptures tell us that we must examine ourselves regarding each and every rule and keep them all strictly
We must know them all and observe them perfectly
This is the same as saying that to understand about others we must go and examine absolutely everybody
This is a very heavy attitude
And it's like this because we take what is said literally
If we follow the textbooks this is the way we must go
Some Teachers teach in this manner  strict adherence to what the textbooks say
It just can't work that way
Actually if we study theory like this our practice won't develop at all
In fact our faith will disappear our faith in the Way will be destroyed
This is because we haven't yet understood
When there is wisdom we will understand that all the people in the entire world really amount to just this one person
They are the same as this very being
So we study and contemplate our own body and mind
With seeing and understanding the nature of our own body and mind comes understanding the bodies and minds of everyone
And so in this way the weight of our practice becomes lighter
The Buddha said to teach and instruct ourselves  nobody else can do it for us
When we study and understand the nature of our own existence we will understand the nature of all existence
Everyone is really the same
We are all the same make and come from the same company  there are only different shades that's all
Just like Borthai and Tumjai They are both painkillers and do the same thing but one type is called Borthai and the other Tumjai Really they aren't different
You will find that this way of seeing things gets easier and easier as you gradually bring it all together
We call this feeling our way and this is how we begin to practice
We'll become skilled at doing it
We keep on with it until we arrive at understanding and when this understanding arises we will see reality clearly
So we continue this practice until we have a feeling for it
After a time depending on our own particular tendencies and abilities a new kind of understanding arises
This we call Investigation of Dhamma and this is how the Seven Factors of Enlightenment arise in the mind
Investigation of Dhamma is one of them
The others are Mindfulness Energy Rapture Tranquillity concentration and Equanimity
If we have studied about the Seven Factors of Enlightenment then we'll know what the books say but we won't have seen the real Factors of Enlightenment
The real Factors of Enlightenment arise in the mind
Thus the Buddha came to give us all the various Teachings
All the Enlightened Ones have taught the way out of suffering and Their recorded Teachings we call the theoretical Teachings
This theory originally came from the practice but it has become merely book learning or words
The real Factors of Enlightenment have disappeared because we don't know them within ourselves we don't see them within our own minds
If they arise they arise out of practice
If they arise out of practice then they are factors leading to Enlightenment of the Dhamma and we can use their arising as an indication that our practice is correct
If we are not practicing rightly such things will not appear
If we practice in the right way then we can see Dhamma
So we say to keep on practicing feeling your way gradually and continually investigating
Don't think that what you are looking for can be found anywhere other than right here
One of my senior disciples had been learning Pali at a study Temple before he came here
He hadn't been very successful with his studies so he thought that since monks who practice meditation are able to see and understand everything just by sitting he would come and try this way
He came here to Wat Pah Pong with the intention of sitting in meditation so that he would be able to translate Pali scriptures
He had this kind of understanding about practice
So I explained to him about our way
He had misunderstood completely
He had thought it an easy matter just to sit and make everything clear
If we talk about understanding Dhamma then both study monks and practice monks use the same words
But the actual understanding which comes from studying theory and that which comes from practicing Dhamma is not quite the same
It may seem to be the same but one is more profound
One is deeper than the other
The kind of understanding which comes from practice leads to surrender to giving up
Until there is complete surrender we persevere  we persist in our contemplation
If desires or anger and dislike arise in our mind we aren't indifferent to them
We don't just leave them but rather take them and investigate to see how and from where they arise
If such moods are already in our mind then we contemplate and see how they work against us
We see them clearly and understand the difficulties which we cause ourselves by believing and following them
This kind of understanding is not found anywhere other than in our own pure mind
It's because of this that those who study theory and those who practice meditation misunderstand each other
Usually those who emphasize study say things like this Monks who only practice meditation just follow their own opinions
They have no basis in their Teaching Actually in one sense these two ways of study and practice are exactly the same thing
It can help us to understand if we think of it like the front and back of our hand
If we put our hand out it seems as if the back of the hand has disappeared
Actually the back of our hand hasn't disappeared anywhere it's just hidden underneath
When we say that we can't see it it doesn't mean that it has disappeared completely it just means that it's hidden underneath
When we turn our hand over the same thing happens to the palm of the hand
It doesn't go anywhere it's merely hidden underneath
We should keep this in mind when we consider practice
If we think that it has disappeared we'll go off to study hoping to get results
But it doesn't matter how much you study about Dhamma you'll never understand because you won't know in accordance with Truth
If we do understand the real nature of Dhamma then it becomes letting go
This is surrender  removing attachment not clinging anymore or if there still is clinging it becomes less and less
There is this kind of difference between the two ways of study and practice
When we talk about study we can understand it like this our eye is a subject of study our ear is a subject of study  everything is a subject of study
We can know that form is like this and like that but we attach to form and don't know the way out
We can distinguish sounds but then we attach to them
Forms sounds smells tastes bodily feelings and mental impressions are all like a snare to entrap all beings
To investigate these things is our way of practicing Dhamma
When some feeling arises we turn to our understanding to appreciate it
If we are knowledgeable regarding theory we will immediately turn to that and see how such and such a thing happens like this and then becomes that and so on
If we haven't learned theory in this way then we have just the natural state of our mind to work with
This is our Dhamma
If we have wisdom then we'll be able to examine this natural mind of ours and use this as our subject of study
It's exactly the same thing
Our natural mind is theory
The Buddha said to take whatever thoughts and feelings arise and investigate them
Use the reality of our natural mind as our theory
We rely on this reality
If you have faith it doesn't matter whether you have studied theory or not
If our believing mind leads us to develop practice if it leads us to constantly develop energy and patience then study doesn't matter
We have mindfulness as a foundation for our practice
We are mindful in all bodily postures whether sitting standing walking or lying
And if there is mindfulness there will be clear comprehension to accompany it
Mindfulness and clear comprehension will arise together
They may arise so rapidly however that we can't tell them apart
But when there is mindfulness there will also be clear comprehension
When our mind is firm and stable mindfulness will arise quickly and easily and this is also where we have wisdom
Sometimes though wisdom is insufficient or doesn't arise at the right time
There may be mindfulness and clear comprehension but these alone are not enough to control the situation
Generally if mindfulness and clear comprehension are a foundation of mind then wisdom will be there to assist
However we must constantly develop this wisdom through the practice of Insight Meditation
This means that whatever arises in the mind can be the object of mindfulness and clear comprehension
But we must see according to Anicca Dukkha Anatta
Impermanence is the basis
Dukkha refers to the quality of unsatisfactoriness and Anatta says that it is without individual entity
We see that it's simply a sensation that has arisen that it has no self no entity and that it disappears of its own accord
Just that
Someone who is deluded someone who doesn't have wisdom will miss this occasion he won't be able to use these things to advantage
If wisdom is present then mindfulness and clear comprehension will be right there with it
However at this initial stage the wisdom may not be perfectly clear
Thus mindfulness and clear comprehension aren't able to catch every object but wisdom comes to help
It can see what quality of mindfulness there is and what kind of sensation has arisen
Or in its most general aspect whatever mindfulness there is or whatever sensation there is it's all Dhamma
The Buddha took the practice of Insight Meditation as His foundation
He saw that this mindfulness and clear comprehension were both uncertain and unstable
Anything that's unstable and which we want to have stable causes us to suffer
We want things to be according to our own desires but we must suffer because things just aren't that way
This is the influence of an unclean mind the influence of a mind which is lacking wisdom
When we practice we tend to become caught up in wanting it easy wanting it to be the way we like it
We don't have to go very far to understand such an attitude
Merely look at this body
Is it ever really the way we want it
One minute we like it to be one way and the next minute we like it to be another way
Have we ever really had it the way we liked
The nature of our bodies and minds is exactly the same in this regard
It simply is the way it is
This point in our practice can be easily missed
Usually whatever we feel doesn't agree with us we throw out whatever doesn't please us we throw out
We don't stop to think whether the way we like and dislike things is really the correct way or not
We merely think that the things we find disagreeable must be wrong and those which we find agreeable must be right
This is where craving comes from
When we receive stimuli by way of eye ear nose tongue body or mind a feeling of liking or disliking arises
This shows that the mind is full of attachment
So the Buddha gave us this Teaching of Impermanence
He gave us a way to contemplate things
If we cling to something which isn't permanent then we'll experience suffering
There's no reason why we should want to have these things in accordance with our likes and dislikes
It isn't possible for us to make things be that way
We don't have that kind of authority or power
Regardless of however we may like things to be everything is already the way it is
Wanting like this is not the way out of suffering
Here we can see how the mind which is deluded understands in one way and the mind which is not deluded understands in another way
When the mind with wisdom receives some sensation for example it sees it as something not to be clung to or identified with
This is what indicates wisdom
If there isn't any wisdom then we merely follow our stupidity
This stupidity is not seeing impermanence unsatisfactoriness and notself
That which we like we see as good and right
That which we don't like we see as not good
We can't arrive at Dhamma this way  wisdom cannot arise
If we can see this then wisdom arises
The Buddha firmly established the practice of Insight Meditation in His mind and used it to investigate all the various mental impressions
Whatever arose in His mind He investigated like this even though we like it it's uncertain
It's suffering because these things which are constantly rising and falling don't follow the influence of our minds
All these things are not a being or a self they don't belong to us
The Buddha taught us to see them just as they are
It is this principle on which we stand in practice
We understand then that we aren't able to just bring about various moods as we wish
Both good moods and bad moods are going to come up
Some of them are helpful and some of them are not
If we don't understand rightly regarding these things then we won't be able to judge correctly
Rather we will go running after craving  running off following our desire
Sometimes we feel happy and sometimes we feel sad but this is natural
Sometimes we'll feel pleased and at other times disappointed
What we like we hold as good and what we don't like we hold as bad
In this way we separate ourselves further and further and further from Dhamma
When this happens we aren't able to understand or recognize Dhamma and thus we are confused
Desires increase because our minds have nothing but delusion
This is how we talk about the mind
It isn't necessary to go far away from ourselves to find understanding
We simply see that these states of mind aren't permanent
We see that they are unsatisfactory and that they aren't a permanent self
If we continue to develop our practice in this way we call it the practice of Vipassana or Insight Meditation
We say that it is recognizing the contents of our mind and in this way we develop wisdom
Our practice of Samatha is like this We establish the practice of mindfulness on the inand outbreath for example as a foundation or means of controlling the mind
By having the mind follow the flow of the breath it becomes steadfast calm and still
This practice of calming the mind is called Samatha Meditation
It's necessary to do a lot of this kind of practice because the mind is full of many disturbances
It's very confused
We can't say how many years or how many lives it's been this way
If we sit and contemplate we'll see that there's a lot that doesn't conduce to peace and calm and a lot that leads to confusion
For this reason the Buddha taught that we must find a meditation subject which is suitable to our particular tendencies a way of practice which is right for our character
For example going over and over the parts of the body hair of the head hair of the body nails teeth and skin can be very calming
The mind can become very peaceful from this practice
If contemplating these five things leads to calm it's because they are appropriate objects for contemplation according to our tendencies
Whatever we find to be appropriate in this way we can consider to be our practice and use it to subdue the defilements
Another example is recollection of death
For those who still have strong greed aversion and delusion and find them difficult to contain it's useful to take this subject of personal death as a meditation
We'll come to see that everybody has to die whether rich or poor
We'll see both good and evil people die
Everybody must die
Developing this practice we find that an attitude of dispassion arises
The more we practice the easier our sitting produces calm
This is because it's a suitable and appropriate practice for us
If this practice of Calm Meditation is not agreeable to our particular tendencies it won't produce this attitude of dispassion
If the object is truly suited to us then we'll find it arising regularly without great difficulty and we'll find ourselves thinking about it often
Regarding this we can see an example in our everyday lives
When laypeople bring trays of many different types of food to offer the monks we taste them all to see which we like
When we have tried each one we can tell which is most agreeable to us
This is just an example
That which we find agreeable to our taste we'll eat we find most suitable
We won't bother about the other various dishes
The practice of concentrating our attention on the inand outbreath is an example of a type of meditation which is suitable for us all
It seems that when we go around doing various different practices we don't feel so good
But as soon as we sit and observe our breath we have a good feeling we can see it clearly
There's no need to go looking far away we can use what is close to us and this will be better for us
Just watch the breath
It goes out and comes in out and in  we watch it like this
For a long time we keep watching our breathing in and out and slowly our mind settles
Other activity will arise but we feel like it is distant from us
Just like when we live apart from each other and don't feel so close anymore
We don't have the same strong contact anymore or perhaps no contact at all
When we have a feeling for this practice of mindfulness of breathing it becomes easier
If we keep on with this practice we gain experience and become skilled at knowing the nature of the breath
We'll know what it's like when it's long and what it's like when it's short
Looking at it one way we can talk about the food of the breath
While sitting or walking we breathe while sleeping we breathe while awake we breathe
If we don't breathe then we die
If we think about it we see that we exist only with the help of food
If we don't eat ordinary food for ten minutes an hour or even a day it doesn't matter
This is a course kind of food
However if we don't breathe for even a short time we'll die
If we don't breathe for five or ten minutes we would be dead
Try it
One who is practicing mindfulness of breathing should have this kind of understanding
The knowledge that comes from this practice is indeed wonderful
If we don't contemplate then we won't see the breath as food but actually we are eating air all the time in out in out all the time
Also you'll find that the more you contemplate in this way the greater the benefits derived from the practice and the more delicate the breath becomes
It may even happen that the breath stops
It appears as if we aren't breathing at all
Actually the breath is passing through the pores of the skin
This is called the delicate breath When our mind is perfectly calm normal breathing can cease in this way
We need not be at all startled or afraid
If there's no breathing what should we do
Just know it
Know that there is no breathing that's all
This is the right practice here
Here we are talking about the way of Samatha practice the practice of developing calm
If the object which we are using is right and appropriate for us it will lead to this kind of experience
This is the beginning but there is enough in this practice to take us all the way or at least to where we can see clearly and continue in strong faith
If we keep on with contemplation in this manner energy will come to us
This is similar to the water in an urn
We put in water and keep it topped up
We keep on filling the urn with water and thereby the insects which live in the water don't die
Making effort and doing our everyday practice is just like this
It all comes back to practice
We feel very good and peaceful
This peacefulness comes from our onepointed state of mind
This onepointed state of mind however can be very troublesome since we don't want other mental states to disturb us
Actually other mental states do come and if we think about it that in itself can be the onepointed state of mind
It's like when we see various men and women but we don't have the same feeling about them as we do about our mother and father
In reality all men are male just like our father and all women are female just like our mother but we don't have the same feeling about them
We feel that our parents are more important
They hold greater value for us
This is how it should be with our onepointed state of mind
We should have the same attitude towards it as we would have towards our own mother and father
All other activity which arises we appreciate in the same way as we feel towards men and women in general
We don't stop seeing them we simply acknowledge their presence and don't ascribe to them the same value as our parents
When our practice of Samatha arrives at calm the mind will be clear and bright
The activity of mind will become less and less
The various mental impressions which arise will be fewer
When this happens great peace and happiness will arise but we may attach to that happiness
We should contemplate that happiness as uncertain
We should also contemplate unhappiness as uncertain and impermanent
We'll understand that all the various feelings are not lasting and not to be clung to
We see things in this way because there's wisdom
We'll understand that things are this way according to their nature
If we have this kind of understanding it's like taking hold of one strand of a rope which makes up a knot
If we pull it in the right direction the knot will loosen and begin to untangle
It'll no longer be so tight or so tense
This is similar to understanding that it doesn't always have to be this way
Before we felt that things would always be the way they were and in so doing we pulled the knot tighter and tighter
This tightness is suffering
Living that way is very tense
So we loosen the knot a little and relax
Why do we loosen it
Because it's tight
If we don't cling to it then we can loosen it
It's not a permanent condition that must always be that way
We use the Teaching of Impermanence as our basis
We see that both happiness and unhappiness are not permanent
We see them as not dependable
There is absolutely nothing that's permanent
With this kind of understanding we gradually stop believing in the various moods and feelings which come up in the mind
Wrong understanding will decrease to the same degree that we stop believing in it
This is what is meant by undoing the knot
It continues to become looser
Attachment will be gradually unrooted
When we come to see impermanence unsatisfactoriness and notself in ourselves in this body and mind in this world then we'll find that a kind of boredom will arise
This isn't the everyday boredom that makes us feel like not wanting to know or see or say anything or not wanting to have anything to do with anybody at all
That isn't real boredom it still has attachment we still don't understand
We still have feelings of envy and resentment and are still clinging to the things which cause us suffering
The kind of boredom which the Buddha talked about is a condition without anger or lust
It arises out of seeing everything as impermanent
When pleasant feeling arises in our mind we see that it isn't lasting
This is the kind of boredom we have
We call it Nibbida or disenchantment
That means that it's far from sensual craving and passion
We see nothing as being worthy of desire
Whether or not things accord with our likes and dislikes it doesn't matter to us we don't identify with them
We don't give them any special value
Practicing like this we don't give things reason to cause us difficulty
We have seen suffering and have seen that identifying with moods can not give rise to any real happiness
It causes clinging to happiness and unhappiness and clinging to liking and disliking which is in itself the cause of suffering
When we are still clinging like this we don't have an evenminded attitude towards things
Some states of mind we like and others we dislike
If we are still liking and disliking then both happiness and unhappiness are suffering
It's this kind of attachment which causes suffering
The Buddha taught that whatever causes us suffering is in itself unsatisfactory
Hence we understand that the Buddha's Teaching is to know suffering and to know what causes it to arise
And further we should know freedom from suffering and the way of practice which leads to freedom
He taught us to know just these four things
When we understand these four things we'll be able to recognize suffering when it arises and will know that it has a cause
We'll know that it didn't just drift in
When we wish to be free from this suffering we'll be able to eliminate its cause
Why do we have this feeling of suffering this feeling of unsatisfactoriness
We'll see that it's because we are clinging to our various likes and dislikes
We come to know that we are suffering because of our own actions
We suffer because we ascribe value to things
So we say know suffering know the cause of suffering know freedom from suffering and know the Way to this freedom
When we know about suffering we keep untangling the knot
But we must be sure to untangle it by pulling in the right direction
That is to say we must know that this is how things are
Attachment will be torn out
This is the practice which puts an end to our suffering
Know suffering know the cause of suffering know freedom from suffering and know the Path which leads out of suffering
This is Magga
It goes like this Right View Right Thought Right Speech Right Action Right Livelihood Right Effort Right Mindfulness Right Concentration
When we have the right understanding regarding these things then we have the Path
These things can put an end to suffering
They lead us to morality concentration and wisdom
We must clearly understand these four things
We must want to understand
We must want to see these things in terms of reality
When we see these four things we call this Sacca Dhamma
Whether we look inside or in front or to the right or left all we see is Sacca Dhamma
We simply see that everything is the way it is
For someone who has arrived at Dhamma someone who really understands Dhamma wherever he goes everything will be Dhamma

Breathe in breathe out just like that
Even if others are standing on their heads that's their business
Don't bother your head over it
Just concentrate on breathing in and out just know your breath that's enough
Nothing else
Just know when the air comes in and goes out or you can say to yourself BUD on the inbreath DHO on the outbreath
Take this as your subject of awareness
Just do it like that for now
When the air comes in you know it when it goes out you know it
Then your mind will be peaceful not disturbed not restless
Just the air going in and out continuously
In the beginning keep it this simple nothing fancy
However long you may sit if you're sabai or peaceful you'll know within yourself
If you keep at it the breath becomes refined and softer the body becomes soft the mind becomes soft  that's worth having
Go ahead let it happen naturally
Sitting sabai firm in meditation not in a daze not drowsy or nodding off everything becomes effortless
Now you're peaceful
Then as you're getting up Wow what was that You can't stop thinking of that peace
Then we follow through by keeping constant clear mindfulness knowing ourselves
Whatever we say whatever we do going here going there going on almsround washing our bowls or eating we know what it is we are doing
We have mindfulness staying steady
Just keep on doing it like this
Whatever it's time to do do it with constant mindfulness
And walking meditation take a straight path between two trees about seven or eight full armspans
Walking's the same as sitting Samadhi
Collect yourself resolve that now you're going to get into this meditation and calm down your mind so that clear mindfulness will be strong enough to arise
As to methods some will start by spreading Metta to all living creatures for protection
Go ahead the chickenhearted need various approaches
Begin with your right foot first
Take a good step and walk saying to yourself BUDDHO BUDDHO with your footsteps
Keep your attention right there with your feet the whole time
If you feel restless stop till peaceful then step again
Knowing the beginning middle and end of the path and know when you're walking back
Know where you are continuously
So that's the method
You can do walking meditation
Some people will say Walking back and forth like that is looney But there's a lot of wisdom in walking meditation you know
Walk back and forth
If you're tired stop
Turn your attention inwards and bring your mind to rest by calmly being aware of your breath
Then become aware of one more thing your alternating postures
Standing walking sitting lying down we keep changing positions
We can't only stand only sit or only lie down
We live using all these postures thus we must develop awareness in each and every position and make them useful
Go ahead and do it
It's not easy
But to put it simply It's as if you take this glass and put it here for two minutes then put it there for two minutes
Move it from here to there every two minutes
Just an example but do it like this with concentration
In watching your breath it's the same you do it until you doubt and suffer and that's when wisdom can arise
Some people will say What
Moving a glass back and forth like that is nutty not useful
Are you crazy Never mind just do it
And don't forget two minutes not five minutes
Concentrate
It's all in the doing
Same with watching your breath
Sit up balanced in the crosslegged posture right leg resting on the left
Breathe in till it reaches here breathe out till all the air is out of your lungs
Breathe in until full then let it go
Now don't try to regulate it
However long or short it is it's okay good enough
Sit and watch your breath go in and out naturally
Don't let it slip away
If it does stop
Where has it gone
Find it and bring it back
Sooner or later you'll meet up with something good
Just keep at it
Don't think you can't do it
Just like sowing rice in the earth as if you're throwing it away but soon a sprout is born then it becomes a sheaf and soon you husk it and can eat khao mow
It's like that you know
That's its nature
This is the same  just sitting
Sometimes you think What am I sitting here looking at my breath for anyway
It'll go in and out by itself without me gawking at it That's just our opinionated mind always fleapicking
Ignore it
Just try to do it till peaceful because when calm the breath becomes fine body becomes relaxed mind is relaxed all's just right
Continuing on till perhaps you're just sitting there without your breath going in or out but still alive
Don't be scared
Don't run away thinking you've stopped breathing
This is already a peaceful state
You don't have to do anything just sit in it
Sometimes it's like you're not even breathing but you are
Many things like this can happen but it's okay
Just be aware of it all without being fooled by any of it
Just keep doing it and often
Right after you eat hang up your robe and just start walking BUDDHO BUDDHO Keep at it till your path becomes a kneedeep trench just keep walking
When tired go and sit
Do a lot
Do it so that you know so that you have it so that it's born so that you understand what it's all about
Not just walking a bit chung chok chung chok thinking of this and that then up to lie down in your hut soon snoring away
You'll never see anything that way
If you're lazy when will it ever be finished
If you're tired or lazy how far will you get
Just get it together work through and get beyond your laziness
Not saying Peaceful peaceful peaceful then sit and aren't peaceful right away then quit because it isn't there
It's easy to say but hard to do
Huh
Like saying Oh it's not hard to plant rice to plant and eat rice is better than this But go out and do it and you don't know the oxen from the buffalo from the plow
Actually doing it is a lot different from talking about it
That's how it is you know
All of you wanting to find peacefulness  it's there
But you still don't know anything yet
Whoever you ask you won't know
Just get to know your own breath going in and out BUDDHO BUDDHO That's enough
Just do that
You don't have to think of much
At this time know this learn this for now
I do it and I don't see anything Doesn't matter just do it
Whatever comes up okay just do it like this so you'll know what it's about
Do it and see
If you just sit like this and know what's happening it's really all okay
When your mind becomes peaceful it knows
You can sit all night till dawn and you won't feel you're even sitting you enjoy it
You can't explain it it's like enjoyment
When it gets like this you might want to give profound sermons but beware of getting verbal diarrhea expounding the Dhamma constantly driving folks nutty with your nonstop teaching
Like old Novice Sang
One night just at dusk walking meditation time I heard someone in the bamboo grove nearby carrying on Yo yo yo yo I sat and listened thinking Who's teaching who over there
Who's carrying on He didn't stop just kept babbling on
So I took my flashlight and walked over to see
Sure enough it was Novice Sang sitting under his bamboo clump lantern lit crosslegged bellowing at full blast expounding the Dhamma to the night
Sang have you flipped your lid Oh I just can't hold it in he said
When sitting I gotta teach when walking I gotta teach don't know where it'll end A real nut
Oh well that's how it is it can happen you know
But keep at it
Don't just follow your moods
When lazy keep at it
When energetic keep at it
Do the sitting and walking and even when lying down watch your breath
Before sleeping teach your mind I won't indulge in the pleasure of sleep When you awaken continue meditating
And when eating we remind ourselves I won't eat this food with greed but only as medicine to sustain my life for this day and night in order to have strength enough to carry on meditating Before sleeping we teach ourselves before eating we teach ourselves like that continually
If standing be aware if sitting be aware if lying down be aware
Everything do it that way
When you lie down lie on your right side focusing on your breath BUDDHO BUDDHO until you fall asleep
And as soon as you awaken continue BUDDHO BUDDHO as if you hadn't skipped a breath
Then peacefulness will arise be continuously mindful
Don't look at another's practice you can't do that
Regarding sitting meditation sit balanced and erect
Don't have your head tilted back or hanging down
Keep it balanced
Like the Buddha statue  now he's sitting tight and bright
If you want to change posture endure the pain to the utmost limit before changing
What you say I can't handle that But wait before moving
Endure the pain to its limit then take more
However much it hurts go ahead and endure it
And if it's too painful to keep BUDDHO in mind then take the pain as your object of awareness Pain pain pain PAIN on and on instead of BUDDHO Stay with it till the pain reaches its end and see what comes up
The Buddha said that pain arises by itself and it'll stop by itself
Let it just die don't give up
Maybe you'll break out in a sweat  drops as big as corn kernels rolling down your back
But if you can get past the feeling once then you'll know what it's about
But that comes gradually don't push yourself too far
Just slowly keep at it
And know about eating chew swallow and where does it end up
Food that's right or wrong for your body you'll know it
Know where it reaches
Refine the art of eating eat and estimate when you'll be full after five more mouthfuls then stop
Take enough water and that's it
Try and see if you can do it
Most people don't do it like that
Instead they eat till full then top up with five more mouthfuls
But that's not the way understand
The Buddha said just keep eating attentively and know you're not yet full but you will be in five more mouthfuls then stop
Take enough water till full
Then whether walking or sitting you'll not feel heavy and your meditation will become automatically better
But people don't want to do it like that
If you don't really want to train yourself then you can't do it
Otherwise you eat till you're too full topping up with another five mouthfuls
That's how it is the nature of our greed and defilements and the things the Buddha taught go in different direction
We have to watch ourselves
And sleeping being aware it's up to your knowhow
Sometimes you won't get to sleep on time sleep early sleep late never mind
That's what I do
Get to sleep late or not late doesn't matter when I first awaken I get right up
don't make a fuss over it
Cut it right there
If you awaken and are still sleepy just get right up
Get up and go wash your face and start walking meditation go right ahead and walk
That's how we must train ourselves do it
So these are the things to do
But you won't know about them from just listening to what others tell you
You can only know from actually doing the practice
So go ahead and do it
These are the first steps in training the mind
When meditating focus on only one thing
Sitting the mind only watches the breath going in and out continually watching slowly becoming peaceful
If the mind is scattered as soon as you sit you're off missing home mind reaching way over there thinking you'd like to eat some noodles
You want to eat want to drink hungry wanting missing everything
Till you're crazy
But if you go crazy then be crazy till you can work through it
But do it
Have you ever done walking meditation
How is it
Mind wanders Then stop till it comes back
If it really wanders then don't breathe until you can't stand it  your mind will come back
If you sit and your mind goes running everywhere hold your breath don't let it out and when you can't stand it it'll come back
Make the mind strong
Training the mind is not the same as training animals you know it's something that's really difficult to train
Don't be easily discouraged
At times holding your breath till your chest is about to burst is the only thing that'll catch your mind  it'll come running back
Try it and see
During this rains retreat get to know what it's about
In the daytime do it at night do it whenever you're fee go ahead and do it
Do walking meditation night and day even if you don't talk
Turn your attention right back to your meditation make it continuous
It's the same as the water in this drinking bottle
If we tilt it a bit it starts to drip drip drip we tilt it more and drippity drippity drippity That's like our mindfulness
And if we really pour it out it becomes a steady stream of water like out of a tap not just dripping
Meaning that whether we stand walk sit lie down or whatever if we are always aware then our mindfulness is the same as a steady stream of water
If we really pour it out it's a steady stream
So if our mind wanders thinks of this and that then our mindfulness is only like dripping water
So training our mind is just like this
Whether we think of this or that are restless aren't together doesn't matter
Just keep practicing continually and you'll develop awareness until it's a constant flow
Whether standing sitting lying down or whatever that awareness will be right there with you
Do it and see
Just sitting around it's not going to happen by itself you know
But if you try too hard you can't do it either
don't try at all  still can't do it
Keep that in mind
Sometimes you don't even intend to sit in meditation but your work's finished and you sit down empty your mind and pap
 you're peaceful right away
Easy because you're right there
Take this then  that's enough for now
Question I'm trying very hard in my practice but don't seem to be getting anywhere
Answer This is very important
Don't try to get anywhere in the practice
The very desire to be free or to be enlightened will be the desire that prevents your freedom
You can try as hard as you wish practice ardently night and day but if it is still with the desire to achieve in mind you will never find peace
The energy from this desire will be a cause for doubt and restlessness
No matter how long or how hard you practice wisdom will not arise from desire
So simply let go
Watch the mind and body mindfully but don't try to achieve anything
Don't cling even to the practice of enlightenment
Q What about sleep
How much should I sleep
A don't ask me I can't tell you
A good average for some is four hours a night
What is important though is that you watch and know yourself
If you try to go with too little sleep the body will feel uncomfortable and mindfulness will be difficult to sustain
Too much sleep leads to a dull or a restless mind
Find the natural balance for yourself
Carefully watch the mind and body and keep track of sleep needs until you find the optimum
If you wake up and then roll over for a snooze this is defilement
Establish mindfulness as soon as your eyes open
Q How about eating
How much should I eat
A Eating is the same as sleeping
You must know yourself
Food must be consumed to meet bodily needs
Look at your food as medicine
Are you eating so much that you only feel sleepy after the meal and are you getting fatter every day
Stop
Examine your own body and mind
There is no need to fast
Instead experiment with the amount of food you take
Find the natural balance for your body
Put all your food together in your bowl following the ascetic practice
Then you can easily judge the amount you take
Watch yourself carefully as you eat
Know yourself
The essence of our practice is just this
There is nothing special you must do
Only watch
Examine yourself
Watch the mind
Then you will know what is the natural balance for your own practice
Q Are minds of Asians and Westerners different
A Basically there is no difference
Outer customs and language may appear different but the human mind has natural characteristics which are the same for all people
Greed and hatred are the same in an Eastern or a Western mind
Suffering and the cessation of suffering are the same for all people
Q Is it advisable to read a lot or study the scriptures as a part of practice
A The Dhamma of the Buddha is not found in books
If you want to really see for yourself what the Buddha was talking about you don't need to bother with books
Watch your own mind
Examine to see how feelings come and go how thoughts come and go
don't be attached to anything
Just be mindful of whatever there is to see
This is the way to the truths of the Buddha
Be natural
Everything you do in your life here is a chance to practice
It is all Dhamma
When you do your chores try to be mindful
If you are emptying a spittoon or cleaning a toilet don't feel you are doing it as a favor for anyone else
There is Dhamma in emptying spittoons
Don't feel you are practicing only when sitting still crosslegged
Some of you have complained that there is not enough time to meditate
Is there enough time to breathe
This is your meditation mindfulness naturalness in whatever you do
Q Why don't we have daily interviews with the teacher
A If you have any questions you are welcome to come and ask them anytime
But we don't need daily interviews here
If I answer your every little question you will never understand the process of doubt in your own mind
It is essential that you learn to examine yourself to interview yourself
Listen carefully to the lecture every few days then use this teaching to compare with your own practice
Is it still the same
Is it different
Why do you have doubts
Who is it that doubts
Only through selfexamination can you understand
Q Sometimes I worry about the monks' discipline
If I kill insects accidentally is this bad
A Sila or discipline and morality are essential to our practice but you must not cling to the rules blindly
In killing animals or in breaking other rules the important thing is intention
Know your own mind
You should not be excessively concerned about the monks' discipline
If it is used properly it supports the practice but some monks are so worried about the petty rules that they can't sleep well
Discipline is not to be carried as a burden
In our practice here the foundation is discipline good discipline plus the ascetic rules and practices
Being mindful and careful of even the many supporting rules as well as the basic precepts has great benefit
It makes life very simple
There need be no wondering about how to act so you can avoid thinking and instead just be simply mindful
The discipline enables us to live together harmoniously the community runs smoothly
Outwardly everyone looks and acts the same
Discipline and morality are the stepping stones for further concentration and wisdom
By proper use of the monks' discipline and the ascetic precepts we are forced to live simply to limit our possessions
So here we have the complete practice of the Buddha refrain from evil and do good live simply keeping to basic needs purify the mind
That is be watchful of our mind and body in all postures sitting standing walking or lying know yourself
Q What can I do about doubts
Some days I'm plagued with doubts about the practice or my own progress or the teacher
A Doubting is natural
Everyone starts out with doubts
You can learn a great deal from them
What is important is that you don't identify with your doubts that is don't get caught up in them
This will spin your mind in endless circles
Instead watch the whole process of doubting of wondering
See who it is that doubts
See how doubts come and go
Then you will no longer be victimized by your doubts
You will step outside of them and your mind will be quiet
You can see how all things come and go
Just let go of what you are attached to
Let go of your doubts and simply watch
This is how to end doubting
Q What about other methods of practice
These days there seem to be so many teachers and so many different systems of meditation that it is confusing
A It is like going into town
One can approach from the north from the southeast from many roads
Often these systems just differ outwardly
Whether you walk one way or another fast or slow if you are mindful it is all the same
There is one essential point that all good practice must eventually come to  not clinging
In the end all meditation systems must be let go of
Neither can one cling to the teacher
If a system leads to relinquishment to not clinging then it is correct practice
You may wish to travel to visit other teachers and try other systems
Some of you have already done so
This is a natural desire
You will find out that a thousand questions asked and knowledge of many systems will not bring you to the truth
Eventually you will get bored
You will see that only by stopping and examining your own mind can you find out what the Buddha talked about
No need to go searching outside yourself
Eventually you must return to face your own true nature
Here is where you can understand the Dhamma
Q A lot of times it seems that many monks here are not practicing
They look sloppy or unmindful
This disturbs me
A It is not proper to watch other people
This will not help your practice
If you are annoyed watch the annoyance in your own mind
If others' discipline is bad or they are not good monks this is not for you to judge
You will not discover wisdom watching others
Monks' discipline is a tool to use for your own meditation
It is not a weapon to use to criticize or find fault
No one can do your practice for you nor can you do practice for anyone else
Just be mindful of your own doings
This is the way to practice
Q I have been extremely careful to practice sense restraint
I always keep my eyes lowered and am mindful of every little action I do
When eating for example I take a long time and try to see each touch chewing tasting swallowing etc
I take each step very deliberately and carefully
Am I practicing properly
A Sense restraint is proper practice
We should be mindful of it throughout the day
But don't overdo it
Walk and eat and act naturally
And then develop natural mindfulness of what is going on within yourself
Don't force your meditation nor force yourself into awkward patterns
This is another form of craving
Be patient
Patience and endurance are necessary
If you act naturally and are mindful wisdom will come naturally too
Q Is it necessary to sit for very long stretches
A No sitting for hours on end is not necessary
Some people think that the longer you can sit the wiser you must be
I have seen chickens sit on their nests for days on end
Wisdom comes from being mindful in all postures
Your practice should begin as you awaken in the morning
It should continue until you fall asleep
Don't be concerned about how long you can sit
What is important is only that you keep watchful whether you are working or sitting or going to the bathroom
Each person has his own natural pace
Some of you will die at age fifty some at age sixtyfive and some at age ninety
So too your practice will not be all identical
Don't think or worry about this
Try to be mindful and let things take their natural course
Then your mind will become quieter and quieter in any surroundings
It will become still like a clear forest pool
Then all kinds of wonderful and rare animals will come to drink at the pool
You will see clearly the nature of all things in the world
You will see many wonderful and strange things come and go
But you will be still
Problems will arise and you will see through them immediately
This is the happiness of the Buddha
Q I still have very many thoughts
My mind wanders a lot even though I am trying to be mindful
A Don't worry about this
Try to keep your mind in the present
Whatever there is that arises in the mind just watch it
Let go of it
Don't even wish to be rid of thoughts
Then the mind will reach its natural state
No discriminating between good and bad hot and cold fast and slow
No me and no you no self at all
Just what there is
When you walk on almsround no need to do anything special
Simply walk and see what there is
No need to cling to isolation or seclusion
Wherever you are know yourself by being natural and watching
If doubts arise watch them come and go
It's very simple
Hold on to nothing
It is as though you are walking down a road
Periodically you will run into obstacles
When you meet defilements just see them and just overcome them by letting go of them
don't think about the obstacles you have passed already
Don't worry about those you have not yet seen
Stick to the present
Don't be concerned about the length of the road or about the destination
Everything is changing
Whatever you pass do not cling to it
Eventually the mind will reach its natural balance where practice is automatic
All things will come and go of themselves
Q Have you ever looked at the Altar Sutra of the th Patriarch Hui Neng
A Hui Neng's wisdom is very keen
It is very profound teaching not easy for beginners to understand
But if you practice with our discipline and with patience if you practice notclinging you will eventually understand
Once I had a disciple who stayed in a grassroofed hut
It rained often that rainy season and one day a strong wind blew off half the roof
He did not bother to fix it just let it rain in
Several days passed and I asked him about his hut
He said he was practicing notclinging
This is notclinging without wisdom
It is about the same as the equanimity of a water buffalo
If you live a good life and live simply if you are patient and unselfish you will understand the wisdom of Hui Neng
Q You have said that samatha and vipassana or concentration and insight are the same
Could you explain this further
A It is quite simple
Concentration and wisdom work together
First the mind becomes still by holding on to a meditation object
It is quiet only while you are sitting with your eyes closed
This is samatha and eventually this samadhibase is the cause for wisdom or vipassana to arise
Then the mind is still whether you sit with your eyes closed or walk around in a busy city
It's like this
Once you were a child
Now you are an adult
Are the child and the adult the same person
You can say that they are or looking at it another way you can say that they are different
In this way samatha and vipassana could also be looked at as separate
Or it is like food and feces
Food and feces could be called the same and they can be called different
Don't just believe what I say do your practice and see for yourself
Nothing special is needed
If you examine how concentration and wisdom arise you will know the truth for yourself
These days many people cling to the words
They call their practice vipassana
Samatha is looked down on
Or they call their practice samatha
It is essential to do samatha before vipassana they say
All this is silly
Don't bother to think about it in this way
Simply do the practice and you'll see for yourself
Q Is it necessary to be able to enter absorption in our practice
A No absorption is not necessary
You must establish a modicum of tranquillity and onepointedness of mind
Then you use this to examine yourself
Nothing special is needed
If absorption comes in your practice this is OK too
Just don't hold on to it
Some people get hung up with absorption
It can be great fun to play with
You must know proper limits
If you are wise then you will know the uses and limitations of absorption just as you know the limitations of children verses grown men
Q Why do we follow the ascetic rules such as only eating out of our bowls
A The ascetic precepts are to help us cut defilement
By following the ones such as eating out of our bowls we can be more mindful of our food as medicine
If we have no defilements then it does not matter how we eat
But here we use the form to make our practice simple
The Buddha did not make the ascetic precepts necessary for all monks but he allowed them for those who wished to practice strictly
They add to our outward discipline and thereby help increase our mental resolve and strength
These rules are to be kept for yourself
Don't watch how others practice
Watch your own mind and see what is beneficial for you
The rule that we must take whatever meditation cottage assigned to us is a similarly helpful discipline
It keeps monks from being attached to their dwelling place
If they go away and return they must take a new dwelling
This is our practice  not to cling to anything
Q If putting everything together in our bowls is important why don't you as a teacher do it yourself
Don't you feel it is important for the teacher to set an example
A Yes it is true a teacher should set an example for his disciples
I don't mind that you criticize me
Ask whatever you wish
But it is important that you do not cling to the teacher
If I were absolutely perfect in outward form it would be terrible
You would all be too attached to me
Even the Buddha would sometimes tell his disciples to do one thing and then do another himself
Your doubts in your teacher can help you
You should watch your own reactions
Do you think it is possible that I keep some food out of my bowl in dishes to feed the laymen who work around the temple
Wisdom is for yourself to watch and develop
Take from the teacher what is good
Be aware of your own practice
If I am resting while you must all sit up does this make you angry
If I call the color blue red or say that male is female don't follow me blindly
One of my teachers ate very fast
He made noises as he ate
Yet he told us to eat slowly and mindfully
I used to watch him and get very upset
I suffered but he didn't
I watched the outside
Later I learned
Some people drive very fast but carefully
Others drive slowly and have many accidents
Don't cling to rules to outer form
If you watch others at most ten percent of the time and watch yourself ninety percent this is the proper practice
At first I used to watch my teacher Ajahn Tong Raht and had many doubts
People even thought he was mad
He would do strange things or get very fierce with his disciples
Outside he was angry but inside there was nothing
Nobody there
He was remarkable
He stayed clear and mindful until the moment he died
Looking outside the self is comparing discriminating
You will not find happiness that way
Nor will you find peace if you spend your time looking for the perfect man or the perfect teacher
The Buddha taught us to look at the Dhamma the truth not to look at other people
Q How can we overcome lust in our practice
Sometimes I feel as if I am a slave to my sexual desire
A Lust should be balanced by contemplation of loathsomeness
Attachment to bodily form is one extreme and one should keep in mind the opposite
Examine the body as a corpse and see the process of decay or think of the parts of the body such as the lungs spleen fat feces and so forth
Remember these and visualize this loathsome aspect of the body when lust arises
This will free you from lust
Q How about anger
What should I do when I feel anger arising
A You must use lovingkindness
When angry states of mind arise in meditation balance them by developing feelings of lovingkindness
If someone does something bad or gets angry don't get angry yourself
If you do you are being more ignorant than they
Be wise
Keep in mind compassion for that person is suffering
Fill your mind with lovingkindness as if he were a dear brother
Concentrate on the feeling of lovingkindness as a meditation subject
Spread it to all beings in the world
Only through lovingkindness is hatred overcome
Sometimes you may see other monks behaving badly
You may get annoyed
This is suffering unnecessarily
It is not yet our Dhamma
You may think like this He is not as strict as I am
They are not serious meditators like us
Those monks are not good monks This is a great defilement on your part
Do not make comparisons
Do not discriminate
Let go of your opinion as watch your opinions and watch yourself
This is our Dhamma
You can't possibly make everyone act as you wish or be like you
This wish will only make you suffer
It is a common mistake for meditators to make but watching other people won't develop wisdom
Simply examine yourself your feelings
This is how you will understand
Q I feel sleepy a great deal
It makes it hard to meditate
A There are many ways to overcome sleepiness
If you are sitting in the dark move to a lighted place
Open your eyes
Get up and wash your face or take a bath
If you are sleepy change postures
Walk a lot
Walk backwards
The fear of running into things will keep you awake
If this fails stand still clear the mind and imagine it is full daylight
Or sit on the edge of a high cliff or deep well
You won't dare sleep
If nothing works then just go to sleep
Lay down carefully and try to be aware until the moment you fall asleep
Then as you awaken get right up
Don't look at the clock or roll over
Start mindfulness from the moment you awaken
If you find yourself sleepy everyday try to eat less
Examine yourself
As soon as five more spoonfuls will make you full stop
Then take water until just properly full
Go and sit
Watch your sleepiness and hunger
You must learn to balance your eating
As your practice goes on you will feel naturally more energetic and eat less
But you must adjust yourself
Q Why must we do so much prostrating here
A Prostrating is very important
It is an outward form that is part of practice
This form should be done correctly
Bring the forehead all the way to the floor
Have the elbows near the knees and the palms of the hands on the floor about three inches apart
Prostrate slowly be mindful of your body
It is a good remedy for our conceit
We should prostrate often
When you prostrate three times you can keep in mind the qualities of the Buddha the Dhamma and the Sangha that is the qualities of mind of purity radiance and peace
So we use the outward form to train ourselves
Body and mind become harmonious
Don't make the mistake of watching how others prostrate
If young novices are sloppy or the aged monks appear unmindful this is not for you to judge
People can be difficult to train
Some learn fast but others learn slowly
Judging others will only increase your pride
Watch yourself instead
Prostrate often get rid of your pride
Those who have really become harmonious with the Dhamma get far beyond the outward form
Everything they do is a way of prostrating
Walking they prostrate eating they prostrate defecating they prostrate
This is because they have got beyond selfishness
Q What is the biggest problem of your new disciples
A Opinions
Views and ideas about all things
About themselves about practice about the teachings of the Buddha
Many of those who come here have a high rank in the community
There are wealthy merchants or college graduates teachers and government officials
Their minds are filled with opinions about things
They are too clever to listen to others
It is like water in a cup
If a cup is filled with dirty stale water it is useless
Only after the old water is thrown out can the cup become useful
You must empty your minds of opinions then you will see
Our practice goes beyond cleverness and beyond stupidity
If you think I am clever I am wealthy I am important I understand all about Buddhism You cover up the truth of anatta or noself
All you will see is self I mine
But Buddhism is letting go of self
Voidness Emptiness Nibbana
Q Are defilements such as greed or anger merely illusory or are they real
A They are both
The defilements we call lust or greed or anger or delusion these are just outward names appearances
Just as we call a bowl large small pretty or whatever
This is not reality
It is the concept we create from craving
If we want a big bowl we call this one small
Craving causes us to discriminate
The truth though is merely what is
Look at it this way
Are you a man
You can say yes This is the appearance of things
But really you are only a combination of elements or a group of changing aggregates
If the mind is free it does not discriminate
No big and small no you and me
There is nothing Anatta we say or nonself
Really in the end there is neither atta nor anatta
Q Could you explain a little more about karma
A Karma is action
Karma is clinging
Body speech and mind all make karma when we cling
We make habits
These can make us suffer in the future
This is the fruit of our clinging of our past defilement
All attachment leads to making karma
Suppose you were a thief before you became a monk
You stole made others unhappy made your parents unhappy
Now you are a monk but when you remember how you made others unhappy you feel bad and suffer yourself even today
Remember not only body but speech and mental action can make conditions for future results
If you did some act of kindness in the past and remember it today you will be happy
This happy state of mind is the result of past karma
All things are conditioned by cause  both long term and when examined moment to moment
But you need not bother to think about past or present or future
Merely watch the body and mind
You must figure karma out for yourself
Watch your mind
Practice and you will see clearly
Make sure however that you leave the karma of others to them
Don't cling to and don't watch others
If I take a poison I suffer
No need for you to share it with me
Take what is good that your teacher offers
Then you can become peaceful your mind will become like that of your teacher
If you will examine it you will see
Even if now you don't understand when you practice it will become clear
You will know by yourself
This is called practicing the Dhamma
When we were young our parents used to discipline us and get angry
Really they wanted to help us
You must see it over the long term
Parents and teachers criticize us and we get upset
Later on we see why
After long practice you will know
Those who are too clever leave after a short time
They never learn
You must get rid of your cleverness
If you think yourself better than others you will only suffer
What a pity
No need to get upset
Just watch
Q Sometimes it seems that since becoming a monk I have increased my hardships and suffering
A I know that some of you have had a background of material comfort and outward freedom
By comparison now you live an austere existence
Then in the practice I often make you sit and wait for long hours
Food and climate are different from your home
But everyone must go through some of this
This is the suffering that leads to the end of suffering
This is how you learn
When you get angry and feel sorry for yourself it is a great opportunity to understand the mind
The Buddha called defilements our teachers
All my disciples are like my children
I have only loving kindness and their welfare in mind
If I appear to make you suffer it is for your own good
I know some of you are welleducated and very knowledgeable
People with little education and worldly knowledge can practice easily
But it is as if you Westerners have a very large house to clean
When you have cleaned the house you will have a big living space
You can use the kitchen the library the living room
You must be patient
Patience and endurance are essential to our practice
When I was a young monk I did not have it as hard as you
I knew the language and was eating my native food
Even so some days I despaired
I wanted to disrobe or even commit suicide
This kind of suffering comes from wrong views
When you have seen the truth though you are free from views and opinions
Everything becomes peaceful
Q I have been developing very peaceful states of mind from meditation
What should I do now
A This is good
Make the mind peaceful concentrated
Use this concentration to examine the mind and body
When the mind is not peaceful you should also watch
Then you will know true peace
Why
Because you will see impermanence
Even peace must be seen as impermanent
If you are attached to peaceful states of mind you will suffer when you do not have them
Give up everything even peace
Q Did I hear you say that you are afraid of very diligent disciples
A Yes that's right
I am afraid
I am afraid that they are too serious
They try too hard but without wisdom
They push themselves into unnecessary suffering
Some of you are determined to become enlightened
You grit your teeth and struggle all the time
This is trying too hard
People are all the same
They don't know the nature of things
All formations mind and body are impermanent
Simply watch and don't cling
Others think they know
They criticize they watch they judge
That's OK
Leave their opinions to them
This discrimination is dangerous
It is like a road with a very sharp curve
If we think others are worse or better or the same as us we go off the curve
If we discriminate we will only suffer
Q I have been meditating many years now
My mind is open and peaceful in almost all circumstances
Now I would like to try to backtrack and practice high states of concentration or mind absorption
A This is fine
It is beneficial mental exercise
If you have wisdom you will not get hung up on concentrated states of mind
It is the same as wanting to sit for long periods
This is fine for training but really practice is separate from any posture
It is a matter of directly looking at the mind
This is wisdom
When you have examined and understood the mind then you have the wisdom to know the limitations of concentration or of books
If you have practiced and understand notclinging you can then return to the books
They will be like a sweet dessert
They can help you to teach others
Or you can go back to practice absorption
You have the wisdom to know not to hold on to anything
Q Would you review some of the main points of our discussion
A You must examine yourself
Know who you are
Know your body and mind by simply watching
In sitting in sleeping in eating know your limits
Use wisdom
The practice is not to try to achieve anything
Just be mindful of what is
Our whole meditation is looking directly at the mind
You will see suffering its cause and its end
But you must have patience much patience and endurance
Gradually you will learn
The Buddha taught his disciples to stay with their teachers for at least five years
You must learn the values of giving of patience and of devotion
Don't practice too strictly
Don't get caught up with outward form
Watching others is bad practice
Simply be natural and watch that
Our monks' discipline and monastic rules are very important
They create a simple and harmonious environment
Use them well
But remember the essence of the monks' discipline is watching intention examining the mind
You must have wisdom
Don't discriminate
Would you get upset at a small tree in the forest for not being tall and straight like some of the others
This is silly
Don't judge other people
There are all varieties
No need to carry the burden of wishing to change them all
So be patient
Practice morality
Live simply and be natural
Watch the mind
This is our practice
It will lead you to unselfishness
To peace
In the centuries immediately following the Buddha's death and the First Buddhist Council arahants and scholarmonks began recording their own commentaries to the teachings of the Tipitaka
At first these commentaries explanations amplifications meditation notes and historical recollections were passed down orally within the monastic sangha but like the Tipitaka itself many began to be recorded in writing around the turn of the Common Era
Most of these early texts  primarily written in Sinhala  remained for centuries tucked away in forest monasteries and temples in Sri Lanka accessible only to a few Sinhala scholars
It wasn't until these scattered fragments were translated into Pali and collated into coherent texts  that they became available to the wider Theravadan world
Since then these texts  variously labeled noncanonical extracanonical or postcanonical  have come to be regarded as essential supplements to the teachings of the Pali canon itself
So treasured for example is the Milindapañha that it has even been subsumed in the Burmese edition of the Tipitaka and in some parts of the Theravadan world Buddhaghosa's monumental Visuddhimagga is regarded as a more definitive guide to Buddhist meditation practice than even the Tipitaka itself
Taken together the Tipitaka and much of this noncanonical Pali literature constitute the complete body of classical Theravada texts
For a more detailed overview see Beyond the Tipitaka A Field Guide to Postcanonical Pali Literature
Access to Insight offers only a handful of translations of noncanonical Pali texts
The Itivuttaka a collection of short discourses takes its name from the statement at the beginning of each of its discourses this was said by the Blessed One
The collection as a whole is attributed to a laywoman named Khujjuttara who worked in the palace of King Udena of Kosambi as a servant to one of his queens Samavati
Because the Queen could not leave the palace to hear the Buddha's discourses Khujjuttara went in her place memorized what the Buddha said and then returned to the palace to teach the Queen and her ladiesinwaiting
For her efforts the Buddha cited Khujjuttara as the foremost of his laywomen disciples in terms of her learning
She was also an effective teacher when the inner apartments of the palace later burned down killing the Queen and her entourage the Buddha commented that all of the women had reached at least the first stage of Awakening
The name of the Itivuttaka is included in the standard early list of the nine divisions of the Buddha's teachings  a list that predates the organization of the Pali canon as we now know it
It's impossible to determine though the extent to which the extant Pali Itivuttaka corresponds to the Itivuttaka mentioned in that list
The Chinese canon contains a translation of an Itivuttaka attributed to Hsantsang that strongly resembles the text of the Pali Itivuttaka the major difference being that parts of the Group of Threes and all of the Group of Fours in the Pali are missing in Hsantsang's translation
Either these parts were later additions to the text that found their way into the Pali but not into the Sanskrit version translated by Hsantsang or the Sanskrit text was incomplete or Hsantsang's translation was left unfinished
The early history of the Itivuttaka is made even more complex by the fact that it was originally an oral tradition first written down several centuries after the Buddha's passing away
For a discussion of this issue see the Historical Notes appended to Dhammapada A Translation
Whatever the history of the text though it has long been one of the favorite collections in the Pali canon for it covers a wide range of the Buddha's teachings  from the simplest to the most profound  in a form that is accessible appealing and to the point
However although the discourses in the Itivuttaka cover many topics they all relate to a common theme the consequences of one's actions or kamma
Because this theme is so central to these discourses and because it is so commonly misunderstood I would like briefly to explain it here
The Buddha's teachings on action or kamma and his accompanying teachings on rebirth are often dismissed as unessential to his teaching something he simply picked up from his Indian environment
Actually they are central to his teaching and form one of his most original insights
Although many people assume that the Buddha derived his teachings on kamma from a view of the cosmos as a whole the line of experiential proof was actually the other way around
After directly observing and analyzing the role of action in shaping his experience of time he then followed the implications of his observations to confirm his vision of the process of rebirth and the structure of the cosmos that lies under the sway of time
In the course of his Awakening the Buddha discovered that the experience of the present moment consists of three factors results from past actions present actions and the results of present actions
This means that kamma acts in feedback loops with the present moment being shaped both by past and by present actions while present actions shape not only the present but also the future
This constant opening for present input into the causal processes shaping one's life makes free will possible
In fact will  or intention  forms the essence of action
Furthermore the quality of the intention determines the quality of the act and of its results
On the mundane level there are three types of intentions skillful leading to pleasant results unskillful leading to painful results and mixed leading to mixed results all these results being experienced within the realm of space and time
However the fact that the experience of space and time requires not only the results of past actions but also the input of present actions means that it is possible to unravel the experience of space and time by bringing the mind to a point of equilibrium where it contributes no intentions or actions to the present moment
The intentions that converge at this equilibrium are thus a fourth type of intention  transcendent skillful intentions  which lead to release from the results of mundane intentions and ultimately to the ending of all action
The Buddha's direct perception of the power of intention confirmed for him the process of rebirth if experience of the present moment requires the influence of past intentions then there is no way to account for experience at the beginning of life other than through the intentions of a previous lifetime
At the same time the power of the quality of intention provided the framework for Buddha's vision of the cosmos in which the process of rebirth takes place there are pleasant levels of rebirth  the worlds of the Brahmas and the higher devas unpleasant levels  hell the realms of the hungry shades common animals and the angry demons and mixed levels  the human realm and some of the lower deva realms
Even in the pleasant levels of rebirth however the pleasure is unstable and impermanent giving no sure release from suffering and pain
The only secure release comes through transcendent skillful intentions leading to the experience of nibbana totally beyond the process of rebirth and the constraints of space and time
Nibbana itself is totally unconditioned and so cannot be analyzed apart from a distinction in how it is experienced before and after death
However the path of practice leading to nibbana can be analyzed
It has eight factors  right view right resolve right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness and right concentration  and goes through four levels of Awakening
The early texts say very little about the content of these Awakening experiences but are very specific about how these experiences function in effecting lasting changes in the mind
Streamentry  in which one enters the stream to nibbana gaining one's first glimpse of the deathless and cutting through the mental fetters of selfidentity views uncertainty and grasping at precepts and practices  ensures that one will be reborn at most only seven more times
Oncereturning ensures that one will be reborn only once more on the human level
Nonreturning  which cuts through the mental fetters of sensual passion and resistance  ensures that one will never be reborn on the human level
If one goes no further in this life one will be reborn in one of the five Brahma realms called the Pure Abodes and attain full Awakening there
Arahantship  which cuts through the mental fetters of passion for form passion for formlessness restlessness conceit and ignorance  frees one entirely from the suffering caused by craving and from the cycle of rebirth as a whole
This then is the picture of the cosmos that derives from the Buddha's insight into the power of intention
And what shapes skillful intention
Two connected qualities appropriate attention and right view
Appropriate attention focuses on questions that help foster skillfulness in one's actions and avoids questions that get in the way of developing that skill
On the mundane level right view provides a proper understanding of action and its potential for producing mundane pleasure and pain
On the transcendent level it reduces experience simply to cause and effect skillful and unskillful  expressed in terms of the four noble truths  without focusing on whether there is anyone performing the action or experiencing the result
This untangles the mind from issues of space and time and allows it to act in a way that opens to transcendent release
Simply put appropriate attention asks the right questions right view provides the right answers
The interplay between these two mental qualities explains the questionandanswer format used in many of the discourses in the Itivuttaka
And given the role of right view in skillful action the fact that all of the discourses deal with right view means that they are all aimed  directly or indirectly  at helping the reader reach true happiness by using those views to foster skillful intentions in his or her own life

The Wings to Awakening is the Buddha's own list of his most important teachings
It includes teachings on the Four Frames of Reference the Four Right Exertions the Four Bases of Power the Five Faculties the Five Strengths the Seven Factors for Awakening and the Noble Eightfold Path
Toward the end of his life the Buddha stated several times that as long as the teachings in this list were remembered and put into practice his message would endure
The Buddha himself described the Wings to Awakening as being what was most worth mastering and passing along to others
The material gathered in this anthology consists of more than newly translated passages from the suttas along with extensive commentary to help the reader grasp their full meaning and their relation to the practice of meditation
This volume is thus both a treasurehouse of important passages from the Canon covering the key points of the Buddha's teachings as well as a practical manual to help the serious meditation student navigate through some of the most fundamental and profound points of Dhamma
The Jataka one of the books in the Khuddaka Nikaya contains stories the Buddha told of his previous lifetimes as an aspiring Bodhisatta
The Jataka stories are classic Buddhist morality tales often witty and filled with a host of colorful characters clever monkeys wise elephants brave princes wicked ogres and the occasional benign tree spirit
Although they have sometimes been compared to the West's Grimms' fairy tales they are not simply amusing diversions from serious Dhamma literature
Unlike Grimms' whose moral lessons are often ambiguous and occasionally even downright sinister the Jataka tales are replete with important lessons woven from the unmistakable threads of heightened virtue and liberating wisdom twin hallmarks of the Buddha's legacy of transcendent freedom
In this series the authors have breathed new life into Cowell's classic compilation of th c
translations of the Jataka by adapting them into lively English for a contemporary audience
The clarity of the retellings coupled with the authors' selection of the stories themselves makes this series a valuable introduction to this important body of Theravada canonical literature
These retellings will appeal not only to experienced students of Buddhism but also to parents looking for engaging stories of upright morality to share with an inquisitive young child
The Sri Lanka Tripitaka Project is a public domain electronic version of the Pali Canon
It is presented here in in its raw unformatted form
The SLTP edition is known to contain transcription errors I offer it strictly asis
Apart from the changes listed at the bottom of this page I have no plans to make any corrections
If you are doing serious research you will definitely want to crossreference this edition with other editions that have been more thoroughly proofread
Use at your own risk
Please also bear in mind that the translations that appear on Access to Insight are not derived from this SLTP edition but from other Tipitaka editions  most notably the PTS Thai and Burmese editions
There are significant differences between the various editions
Pali students might nevertheless find this SLTP edition useful as a starting point in their studies
This is the Unicode version which contains all the Pali diacritics
A modern Unicode font is required to view the nonroman characters correctly
I have inserted HTML anchors in the files to facilitate linking to specific PTS page numbers
For example you'll find the Pali that appears on page of the Pali Text Society edition of volume II of the Digha Nikaya at this link DNIIutfhtmlpts
Most sutta translations on the website now link directly to these pages simply click on the PTS reference number that appears above the sutta title and the Pali will appear in a new browser window or tab
Thank you AZ for this tip
I have made a few edits to the original SLTP files to improve compatibility with the rest of the website

The four noble truths are the most basic expression of the Buddha's teaching
As Ven
Sariputta once said they encompass the entire teaching just as the footprint of an elephant can encompass the footprints of all other footed beings on earth
These four truths are best understood not as beliefs but as categories of experience
They offer an alternative to the ordinary way we categorize what we can know and describe in terms of menot me and beingnot being
These ordinary categories create trouble for the attempt to maintain full being for one's sense of me is a stressful effort doomed to failure in that all of the components of that me are inconstant stressful and thus not worthy of identifying as me or mine
To counter this problem the four noble truths drop ideas of menot me and beingnot being and replace them with two sets of variables cause and effect skillful and unskillful
In other words there is the truth of stress and suffering the truth of the origination of stress the truth of the cessation of stress and the truth of the path to the cessation of stress
Each of these truths entails a duty stress is to be comprehended the origination of stress abandoned the cessation of stress realized and the path to the cessation of stress developed
When all of these duties have been fully performed the mind gains total release
Many people have charged Buddhism with being pessimistic because the four truths start out with stress and suffering but this charge misses the fact that the first truth is part of a strategy of diagnosis and therapy focusing on the basic problem in life so as to offer a solution to it
Thus the Buddha was like a doctor focusing on the disease he wanted to cure
Charging him with pessimism is like charging a doctor with pessimism when he asks Where does it hurt The total cure the Buddha promised as a result of his course of therapy shows that in actuality he was much less pessimistic than the vast majority of the world for whom wisdom means accepting the bad things in life with the good assuming that there is no chance in this life for unalloyed happiness
The Buddha was an extremely demanding person unwilling to bend to this supposed wisdom or to rest with anything less than absolute happiness
His course of therapy points to the fact that such a happiness is possible and can be attained through our own efforts
Another charge often leveled at Buddhism is that its focus is narrow aiming only at the issue of stress and pain and ignoring the larger or more uplifting issues of spiritual life
This again misses the thrust of the Buddha's cure for the ills of the heart and mind
One of the most important insights leading up to the Buddha's Awakening was his realization that the act of comprehending pain lay at the essence of the spiritual quest
In trying to comprehend pain one begins to delve into the nonverbal subconscious levels of the mind bringing to light many illformed and hidden processes of which one was previously unaware
In this sense pain is like a watering hole where all the animals in the forest  all the mind's subconscious tendencies  will eventually come to drink
Just as a naturalist who wants to make a survey of the wildlife in a particular area can simply station himself near a watering hole in the same way a meditator who wants to understand the mind can simply keep watch right at pain in order to see what subconscious reactions will appear
Thus the act of trying to comprehend pain leads not only to an improved understanding of pain itself but also to an increased awareness of the most basic processes at work in the mind
As one fully comprehends pain one gains a full comprehension of other spiritual issues as well realizing which questions were worth asking and which ones weren't at the same time gaining answers to the first set of questions and learning how to put the second set aside
Thus the study of the four noble truths is aimed first at understanding these four categories and then at applying them to experience so that one may act properly toward each of the categories and thus attain the highest most total happiness possible
The material in this study guide starts with a basic exercise in categorizing one's actions in terms of the variables at the heart of the four noble truths cause and effect and skillful and unskillful
It then builds on this understanding by discussing the role of the four noble truths in the course of the practice and then analyzing in detail each of the truths together with the duty appropriate to each

The Buddha What do you think Rahula What is a mirror for
Rahula For reflection sir
The Buddha In the same way Rahula bodily acts verbal acts  mental acts are to be done with repeated reflection
Whenever you want to perform a bodily act you should reflect on it 'This bodily act I want to perform  would it lead to selfaffliction to the affliction of others or to both
Is it an unskillful bodily act with painful consequences painful results' If on reflection you know that it would lead to selfaffliction to the affliction of others or to both it would be an unskillful bodily act with painful consequences painful results then any bodily act of that sort is absolutely unfit for you to do
But if on reflection you know that it would not cause affliction it would be a skillful bodily act with happy consequences happy results then any bodily act of that sort is fit for you to do
While you are performing a bodily act you should reflect on it 'This bodily act I am doing  is it leading to selfaffliction to the affliction of others or to both
Is it an unskillful bodily act with painful consequences painful results' If on reflection you know that it is leading to selfaffliction to affliction of others or both you should give it up
But if on reflection you know that it is not you may continue with it
Having performed a bodily act you should reflect on it If on reflection you know that it led to selfaffliction to the affliction of others or to both it was an unskillful bodily act with painful consequences painful results then you should confess it reveal it lay it open to the Teacher or to a knowledgeable companion in the holy life
Having confessed it you should exercise restraint in the future
But if on reflection you know that it did not lead to affliction it was a skillful bodily act with happy consequences happy results then you should stay mentally refreshed  joyful training day  night in skillful mental qualities
Having performed a mental act you should reflect on it If on reflection you know that it led to selfaffliction to the affliction of others or to both it was an unskillful mental act with painful consequences painful results then you should feel horrified humiliated  disgusted with it
Feeling horrified you should exercise restraint in the future
But if on reflection you know that it did not lead to affliction it was a skillful mental act with happy consequences happy results then you should stay mentally refreshed  joyful training day  night in skillful mental qualities
Rahula all the brahmans  contemplatives in the course of the past who purified their bodily acts verbal acts  mental acts did it through repeated reflection on their bodily acts verbal acts  mental acts in just this way
All the brahmans  contemplatives in the course of the future All the brahmans  contemplatives at present who purify their bodily acts verbal acts  mental acts do it through repeated reflection on their bodily acts verbal acts  mental acts in just this way
And so Rahula you should train yourself 'I will purify my bodily acts through repeated reflection
I will purify my verbal acts through repeated reflection
I will purify my mental acts through repeated reflection' That's how you should train yourself
That is what the Blessed One said
Gratified Ven
Rahula delighted in the Blessed One's words
Once the Blessed One was staying at Kosambi in the Simsapa tree grove
Then picking up a few Simsapa leaves with his hand he asked the monks What do you think monks Which are more numerous the few Simsapa leaves in my hand or those overhead in the Simsapa grove
The leaves in the hand of the Blessed One are few in number lord
Those overhead in the grove are far more numerous
In the same way monks those things that I have known with direct knowledge but have not taught are far more numerous than the things I have taught
And why haven't I taught them
Because they are not connected with the goal do not relate to the rudiments of the holy life and do not lead to disenchantment to dispassion to cessation to calm to direct knowledge to selfawakening to Unbinding
That is why I have not taught them
And what have I taught
'This is stress This is the origination of stress This is the cessation of stress This is the path of practice leading to the cessation of stress' This is what I have taught
And why have I taught these things
Because they are connected with the goal relate to the rudiments of the holy life and lead to disenchantment to dispassion to cessation to calm to direct knowledge to selfawakening to Unbinding
This is why I have taught them
Therefore your duty is the contemplation 'This is stress This is the origination of stress This is the cessation of stress This is the path of practice leading to the cessation of stress'
'Stress should be known
The cause by which stress comes into play should be known
The diversity in stress should be known
The result of stress should be known
The cessation of stress should be known
The path of practice for the cessation of stress should be known' Thus it has been said
Why was it said
Birth is stressful aging is stressful death is stressful sorrow lamentation pain distress  despair are stressful association with what is not loved is stressful separation from what is loved is stressful not getting what is wanted is stressful
In short the five clingingaggregates are stressful
And what is the cause by which stress comes into play
Craving is the cause by which stress comes into play
And what is the diversity in stress
There is major stress  minor slowly fading  quickly fading
This is called the diversity in stress
And what is the result of stress
There are some cases in which a person overcome with pain his mind exhausted grieves mourns laments beats his breast  becomes bewildered
Or one overcome with pain his mind exhausted comes to search outside 'Who knows a way or two to stop this pain' I tell you monks that stress results either in bewilderment or in search
And what is the cessation of stress
The cessation of craving is the cessation of stress and just this noble eightfold path is the path of practice leading to the cessation of stress right view right resolve right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness right concentration
Now when a disciple of the noble ones discerns stress in this way the cause by which stress comes into play in this way the diversity of stress in this way the result of stress in this way the cessation of stress in this way  the path of practice leading to the cessation of stress in this way then he discerns this penetrative holy life as the cessation of stress
'Stress should be known
The cause by which stress comes into play The variations in stress The result of stress The cessation of stress The path of practice for the cessation of stress should be experienced' Thus it has been said and this is why it was said
Vision arose clear knowing arose discernment arose knowledge arose illumination arose within me with regard to things never heard before 'This is the noble truth of stress This noble truth of stress is to be comprehended This noble truth of stress has been comprehended This is the noble truth of the origination of stress This noble truth of the origination of stress is to be abandoned This noble truth of the origination of stress has been abandoned This is the noble truth of the cessation of stress This noble truth of the cessation of stress is to be realized This noble truth of the cessation of stress has been realized This is the noble truth of the path of practice leading to the cessation of stress This noble truth of the path of practice leading to the cessation of stress is to be developed This noble truth of the path of practice leading to the cessation of stress has been developed'
And monks as long as this knowledge  vision of mine  with its three rounds  twelve permutations concerning these four noble truths as they actually are  was not pure I did not claim to have directly awakened to the unexcelled right selfawakening But as soon as this knowledge  vision of mine  with its three rounds  twelve permutations concerning these four noble truths as they actually are  was truly pure only then did I claim to have directly awakened to the unexcelled right selfawakening The knowledge  vision arose in me 'Unprovoked is my release
This is the last birth
There is now no further becoming'
Sariputta There are these three forms of stressfulness my friend the stressfulness of pain the stressfulness of fabrication the stressfulness of change
These are the three forms of stressfulness
Sariputta Now what friends is the noble truth of stress
Birth is stressful aging is stressful death is stressful sorrow lamentation pain distress  despair are stressful not getting what is wanted is stressful
In short the five clingingaggregates are stressful
Now what is birth
Whatever birth taking birth descent comingtobe comingforth appearance of aggregates  acquisition of sense media of the various beings in this or that group of beings that is called birth
And what is aging
Whatever aging decrepitude brokenness graying wrinkling decline of lifeforce weakening of the faculties of the various beings in this or that group of beings that is called aging
And what is death
Whatever deceasing passing away breaking up disappearance dying death completion of time break up of the aggregates casting off of the body interruption in the life faculty of the various beings in this or that group of beings that is called death
And what is sorrow
Whatever sorrow sorrowing sadness inward sorrow inward sadness of anyone suffering from misfortune touched by a painful thing that is called sorrow
And what is lamentation
Whatever crying grieving lamenting weeping wailing lamentation of anyone suffering from misfortune touched by a painful thing that is called lamentation
And what is pain
Whatever is experienced as bodily pain bodily discomfort pain or discomfort born of bodily contact that is called pain
And what is distress
Whatever is experienced as mental pain mental discomfort pain or discomfort born of mental contact that is called distress
And what is despair
Whatever despair despondency desperation of anyone suffering from misfortune touched by a painful thing that is called despair
And what is the stress of not getting what one wants
In beings subject to birth the wish arises 'O may we not be subject to birth and may birth not come to us' But this is not to be achieved by wishing
This is the stress of not getting what one wants
In beings subject to aging illness death sorrow lamentation pain distress  despair the wish arises 'O may we not be subject to aging illness death sorrow lamentation pain distress  despair and may aging illness death sorrow lamentation pain distress  despair not come to us' But this is not to be achieved by wishing
This is the stress of not getting what one wants
And what are the five clingingaggregates that in short are stressful
Form as a clingingaggregate feeling as a clingingaggregate perception as a clingingaggregate fabrications as a clingingaggregate consciousness as a clingingaggregate These are called the five clingingaggregates that in short are stressful
This is called the noble truth of stress
At Savatthi
There the Blessed One said Monks I will teach you the five aggregates  the five clingingaggregates
Listen  pay close attention
I will speak
As you say lord the monks responded
The Blessed One said Now what monks are the five aggregates
Whatever form is past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or near that is called the form aggregate
Whatever feeling is past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or near that is called the feeling aggregate
Whatever perception is past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or near that is called the perception aggregate
Whatever fabrications are past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or near those are called the fabrication aggregate
Whatever consciousness is past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or near that is called the consciousness aggregate
These are called the five aggregates
And what are the five clingingaggregates
Whatever form  past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or near  is clingable offers sustenance and is accompanied with mental fermentation that is called form as clingingaggregate
Whatever feeling  past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or near  is clingable offers sustenance and is accompanied with mental fermentation that is called feeling as a clingingaggregate
Whatever perception  past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or near  is clingable offers sustenance and is accompanied with mental fermentation that is called perception as a clingingaggregate
Whatever fabrications  past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or near  are clingable offer sustenance and are accompanied with mental fermentation those are called fabrication as a clingingaggregate
Whatever consciousness  past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or near  is clingable offers sustenance and is accompanied with mental fermentation that is called consciousness as a clingingaggregate
These are called the five clingingaggregates
The Buddha These are the five clingingaggregates form as a clingingaggregate feeling as a clingingaggregate perception as a clingingaggregate fabrications as a clingingaggregate consciousness as a clingingaggregate These five clingingaggregates are rooted in desire A certain monk Is it the case that clinging and the five clingingaggregates are the same thing or are they separate
The Buddha Clinging is neither the same thing as the five clingingaggregates nor are they separate
Whatever desire  passion there is with regard to the five clingingaggregates that is the clinging there The monk What is the cause what is the condition for the discernibility of the form aggregate feeling aggregate perception aggregate fabrications aggregate consciousness aggregate
The Buddha The four great existents are the cause  condition for the discernibility of the form aggregate
Contact is the cause  condition for the discernibility of the feeling perception fabrications aggregate
Name  form are the cause  condition for the discernibility of the consciousness aggregate
And why do you call it 'form'
Because it is afflicted thus it is called 'form' Afflicted with what
With cold  heat  hunger  thirst with the touch of flies mosquitoes wind sun  reptiles
Because it is afflicted it is called form
And why do you call it 'feeling'
Because it feels thus it is called 'feeling' What does it feel
It feels pleasure it feels pain it feels neitherpleasurenorpain
Because it feels it is called feeling
And why do you call it 'perception'
Because it perceives thus it is called 'perception' What does it perceive
It perceives blue it perceives yellow it perceives red it perceives white
Because it perceives it is called perception
And why do you call them 'fabrications'
Because they fabricate fabricated things thus they are called 'fabrications' What do they fabricate as a fabricated thing
From formness they fabricate form as a fabricated thing
From feelingness they fabricate feeling as a fabricated thing
From perceptionhoodFrom fabricationhoodFrom consciousnesshood they fabricate consciousness as a fabricated thing
Because they fabricate fabricated things they are called fabrications
And why do you call it 'consciousness'
Because it cognizes thus it is called consciousness
What does it cognize
It cognizes what is sour bitter pungent sweet alkaline nonalkaline salty  unsalty
Because it cognizes it is called consciousness
MahaKotthita Feeling perception  consciousness are these qualities conjoined or disjoined
And is it possible having divided them to describe their separateness
Sariputta Feeling perception  consciousness are conjoined not disjoined and it is impossible having divided them to describe their separateness
For what one feels that one perceives and what one perceives that one cognizes
Form
Sariputta And what friends is form as a clingingaggregate
The four great existents and the form derived from them
And what are the four great existents
They are the earthproperty the water property the fire property  the wind property
And what is the earth property
The earth property may be either internal or external
What is the internal earth property
Whatever internal belonging to oneself is solid solidified  sustained head hairs body hairs nails teeth skin flesh tendons bones bone marrow kidneys heart liver pleura spleen lungs large intestines small intestines contents of the stomach feces or whatever else internally belonging to oneself is solid solidified  sustained This is called the internal earth property
Now both the internal earth property and the external earth property are simply earth property
And that should be seen as it actually is present with right discernment 'This is not mine this is not me this is not my self' When one sees it thus as it actually is present with right discernment one becomes disenchanted with the earth property and makes the earth property fade from the mind
And what is the water property
The water property may be either internal or external
What is the internal water property
Whatever internal belonging to oneself is liquid watery  sustained bile phlegm pus blood sweat fat tears skinoil saliva mucus oilofthejoints urine or whatever else internally belonging to oneself is liquid watery  sustained This is called the internal water property
Now both the internal water property and the external water property are simply water property
And that should be seen as it actually is present with right discernment 'This is not mine this is not me this is not my self' When one sees it thus as it actually is present with right discernment one becomes disenchanted with the water property and makes the water property fade from the mind
And what is the fire property
The fire property may be either internal or external
What is the internal fire property
Whatever internal belonging to oneself is fire fiery  sustained that by which one is warmed ages  wastes away and that by which what is eaten drunk consumed  tasted gets completely digested or whatever else internally belonging to oneself is fire fiery  sustained This is called the internal fire property
Now both the internal fire property and the external fire property are simply fire property
And that should be seen as it actually is present with right discernment 'This is not mine this is not me this is not my self' When one sees it thus as it actually is present with right discernment one becomes disenchanted with the fire property and makes the fire property fade from the mind
And what is the wind property
The wind property may be either internal or external
What is the internal wind property
Whatever internal belonging to oneself is wind windy  sustained upgoing winds downgoing winds winds in the stomach winds in the intestines winds that course through the body inout breathing or whatever else internally belonging to oneself is wind windy  sustained This is called the internal wind property
Now both the internal wind property and the external wind property are simply wind property
And that should be seen as it actually is present with right discernment 'This is not mine this is not me this is not my self' When one sees it thus as it actually is present with right discernment one becomes disenchanted with the wind property and makes the wind property fade from the mind
Feeling
Sister Dhammadinna There are three kinds of feeling pleasant feeling painful feeling  neitherpleasantnorpainful feeling Whatever is experienced physically or mentally as pleasant  gratifying is pleasant feeling
Whatever is experienced physically or mentally as painful  hurting is painful feeling
Whatever is experienced physically or mentally as neither gratifying nor hurting is neitherpleasantnorpainful feeling Pleasant feeling is pleasant in remaining and painful in changing
Painful feeling is painful in remaining and pleasant in changing
Neitherpleasantnorpainful feeling is pleasant when conjoined with knowledge and painful when devoid of knowledge
Fabrications
And what are fabrications
There are these six classes of intention intention aimed at sights sounds aromas tastes tactile sensations  ideas
These are called fabrications
Three kinds of fabrications meritorious fabrications demeritorious fabrications  imperturbable fabrications
Sister Dhammadinna Inout breathing is bodily bound up with the body therefore is it called a bodily fabrication
Having directed one's thought and evaluated one breaks into speech
Therefore directed thought  evaluation are called verbal fabrications
Perception  feeling are mental bound up with the mind
Therefore perception  feeling are called mental fabrications
Consciousness
Consciousness is classified simply by the condition in dependence on which it arises
When consciousness arises in dependence on eye  forms it is classified simply as eyeconsciousness
When consciousness arises in dependence on ear  sounds it is classified simply as earconsciousness
When consciousness arises in dependence on nose  smells it is classified simply as noseconsciousness
When consciousness arises in dependence on tongue  tastes it is classified simply as tongueconsciousness
When consciousness arises in dependence on body  tactile sensations it is classified simply as bodyconsciousness
When consciousness arises in dependence on intellect  ideas it is classified simply as intellectconsciousness
Just as fire is classified simply by the condition in dependence on which it burns  a fire burning in dependence on logs is classified simply as a log fire a fire burning in dependence on rubbish is classified simply as a rubbish fire in the same way consciousness is classified simply by the condition in dependence on which it arises
Now what is the noble truth of the origination of stress
The craving that makes for further becoming  accompanied by passion  delight relishing now here  now there  ie craving for sensuality craving for becoming craving for nonbecoming And what is the noble truth of the cessation of stress
The remainderless fading  cessation renunciation relinquishment release  letting go of that very craving
And what is the noble method that is rightly seen  rightly ferreted out by discernment
There is the case where a disciple of the noble ones notices
Now from the remainderless fading  cessation of that very ignorance there is the cessation of fabrications
From the cessation of fabrications there is the cessation of consciousness
From the cessation of consciousness there is the cessation of name  form
From the cessation of name  form there is the cessation of the six sense spheres
From the cessation of the six sense spheres there is the cessation of contact
From the cessation of contact there is the cessation of feeling
From the cessation of feeling there is the cessation of craving
From the cessation of craving there is the cessation of clingingsustenance
From the cessation of clingingsustenance there is the cessation of becoming
From the cessation of becoming there is the cessation of birth
From the cessation of birth then old age  death sorrow lamentation pain distress  despair all cease
Such is the cessation of this entire mass of stress  suffering
This is the noble method that is rightly seen  rightly ferreted out by discernment
Sariputta Now the Blessed One has said 'Whoever sees dependent coarising sees the Dhamma whoever sees the Dhamma sees dependent coarising'
First there is the knowledge of the steadfastness of the Dhamma after which there is the knowledge of Unbinding
Now what is becoming
These three are becomings sensual becoming form becoming  formless becoming
This is called becoming
And what is clingingsustenance
These four are clingings sensuality clinging view clinging precept  practice clinging and doctrine of self clinging
This is called clinging
And what is craving
These six are classes of craving craving for forms craving for sounds craving for smells craving for tastes craving for tactile sensations craving for ideas
This is called craving
And what is feeling
These six are classes of feeling feeling born from eyecontact feeling born from earcontact feeling born from nosecontact feeling born from tonguecontact feeling born from bodycontact feeling born from intellectcontact
This is called feeling
And what is contact
These six are classes of contact eyecontact earcontact nosecontact tonguecontact bodycontact intellectcontact
This is called contact
And what are the six sense spheres
These six are sense spheres the eyesphere the earsphere the nosesphere the tonguesphere the bodysphere the intellectsphere
These are called the six sense spheres
And what is name  form
Feeling perception intention contact  attention This is called name
The four great elements and the form dependent on the four great elements This is called form
This name  this form are called name  form
And what is consciousness
These six are classes of consciousness eyeconsciousness earconsciousness noseconsciousness tongueconsciousness bodyconsciousness intellectconsciousness
This is called consciousness
And what are fabrications
These three are fabrications bodily fabrications verbal fabrications mental fabrications
These are called fabrications
And what is ignorance
Not knowing stress not knowing the origination of stress not knowing the cessation of stress not knowing the way of practice leading to the cessation of stress This is called ignorance
The ending of the fermentations is for one who knows  sees I tell you not for one who does not know  see
For one who knows what  sees what
'Such is form such its origination such its disappearance
Such is feeling Such is perception Such are fabrications Such is consciousness such its origination such its disappearance' The ending of the fermentations is for one who knows in this way  sees in this way
The knowledge of ending in the presence of ending has its prerequisite I tell you
It is not without a prerequisite
And what is its prerequisite
Release Release has its prerequisite I tell you
It is not without a prerequisite
And what is its prerequisite
Dispassion Disenchantment Knowledge  vision of things as they actually are present Concentration Pleasure Serenity Rapture Joy Conviction Stress  suffering Birth Becoming Clinging Craving Feeling Contact The six sense media Name  form Consciousness Fabrications Fabrications have their prerequisite I tell you
They are not without a prerequisite
And what is their prerequisite
Ignorance
Just as when the gods pour rain in heavy drops  crash thunder on the upper mountains The water flowing down along the slopes fills the mountain clefts  rifts  gullies
When the mountain clefts  rifts  gullies are full they fill the little ponds
When the little ponds are full they fill the big lakes the little rivers the big rivers
When the big rivers are full they fill the great ocean
In the same way
One attached is unreleased one unattached is released
Should consciousness when standing stand attached to form supported by form established on form watered with delight it would exhibit growth increase  development
Should consciousness when standing stand attached to feeling to perception to fabrications it would exhibit growth increase  development
Were someone to say 'I will describe a coming a going a passing away an arising a growth an increase or a development of consciousness apart from form from feeling from perception from fabrications' that would be impossible
If a monk abandons passion for the property of form feeling perception fabrications consciousness then owing to the abandoning of passion the support is cut off and consciousness is unestablished
Consciousness thus unestablished undeveloped not performing any function is released
Owing to its release it stays firm
Owing to its staying firm it is contented
Owing to its contentment it is not agitated
Not agitated he is totally unbound right within himself
He discerns that 'Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task done
There is nothing further for this world'
There are these four nutriments for the establishing of beings or for the support of those in search of a place to be born
What four
Physical food gross or refined contact as the second consciousness the third and intellectual intention the fourth
These are the four nutriments for the establishing of beings or for the support of those in search of a place to be born
Where there is passion delight  craving for the nutriment of physical food consciousness lands there and grows
Where consciousness lands and grows name  form alight
Where name  form alight there is the growth of fabrications
Where there is the growth of fabrications there is the production of renewed becoming in the future
Where there is the production of renewed becoming in the future there is future birth aging  death together I tell you with sorrow affliction  despair
Just as  when there is dye lac yellow orpiment indigo or crimson  a dyer or painter would paint the picture of a woman or a man complete in all its parts on a wellpolished panel or wall or on a piece of cloth in the same way where there is passion delight  craving for the nutriment of physical food consciousness lands there  grows together I tell you with sorrow affliction  despair
Where there is no passion for physical nutriment where there is no delight no craving consciousness does not land there or grow Name  form do not alight There is no growth of fabrications There is no production of renewed becoming in the future
Where there is no production of renewed becoming in the future there is no future birth aging  death
That I tell you has no sorrow affliction or despair
Just as if there were a roofed house or a roofed hall having windows on the north the south or the east
When the sun rises and a ray has entered by way of the window where does it land
On the western wall lord
And if there is no western wall
On the ground lord
And if there is no ground
On the water lord
And if there is no water
It does not land lord
In the same way where there is no passion for physical nutriment consciousness does not land or grow That I tell you has no sorrow affliction or despair
Consciousness without feature without end luminous all around Here water earth fire  wind have no footing
Here long  short coarse  fine fair  foul name  form without remnant are brought to an end
With the cessation of consciousness each is here brought to an end
There is that dimension where there is neither earth nor water nor fire nor wind neither dimension of the infinitude of space nor dimension of the infinitude of consciousness nor dimension of nothingness nor dimension of neither perception nor nonperception neither this world nor the next world nor sun nor moon
And there I say there is neither coming nor going nor staying neither passing away nor arising unestablished unevolving without support
This just this is the end of stress
There is monks an unborn  unbecome  unmade  unfabricated
If there were not that unborn  unbecome  unmade  unfabricated there would not be the case that emancipation from the born  become  made  fabricated would be discerned
But precisely because there is an unborn  unbecome  unmade  unfabricated emancipation from the born  become  made  fabricated is discerned
One who is dependent has wavering
One who is independent has no wavering
There being no wavering there is calm
There being calm there is no desire
There being no desire there is no coming or going
There being no coming or going there is no passing away or arising
There being no passing away or arising there is neither a here nor a there nor a betweenthetwo
This just this is the end of stress
There are these two extremes that are not to be indulged in by one who has gone forth
Which two
That which is devoted to sensual pleasure in connection with sensuality base domestic common ignoble unprofitable and that which is devoted to selfaffliction painful ignoble unprofitable
Avoiding both of these extremes the middle way realized by the Tathagata  producing vision producing knowledge  leads to calm to direct knowledge to selfawakening to Unbinding
And what is the middle way realized by the Tathagata that  producing vision producing knowledge  leads to calm to direct knowledge to selfawakening to Unbinding
Precisely this Noble Eightfold Path right view right resolve right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness right concentration
This is the middle way realized by the Tathagata that  producing vision producing knowledge  leads to calm to direct knowledge to selfawakening to Unbinding
Analysis of the Path
Monks what is the noble eightfold path
Right view right resolve right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness right concentration
And what is right view
Knowledge with regard to stress knowledge with regard to the origination of stress knowledge with regard to the cessation of stress knowledge with regard to the way of practice leading to the cessation of stress This is called right view
And what is right resolve
Resolve aimed at freedom from sensuality at freedom from ill will at harmlessness This is called right resolve
And what is right speech
Abstaining from lying from divisive speech from abusive speech  from idle chatter This is called right speech
And what is right action
Abstaining from taking life from stealing  from unchastity
This is called right action
And what is right livelihood
There is the case where a disciple of the noble ones having abandoned dishonest livelihood keeps his life going with right livelihood This is called right livelihood
And what is right effort
There is the case where a monk generates desire endeavors activates persistence upholds  exerts his intent for the sake of the nonarising of evil unskillful qualities that have not yet arisen for the sake of the abandoning of evil unskillful qualities that have arisen for the sake of the arising of skillful qualities that have not yet arisen for the maintenance nonconfusion increase plenitude development  culmination of skillful qualities that have arisen This is called right effort
And what is right mindfulness
There is the case where a monk remains focused on the body in  of itself  ardent alert  mindful  putting away greed  distress with reference to the world
He remains focused on feelings in  of themselves the mind in  of itself mental qualities in  of themselves  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the world
This is called right mindfulness
And what is right concentration
There is the case where a monk  quite withdrawn from sensuality withdrawn from unskillful qualities  enters  remains in the first jhana rapture  pleasure born from withdrawal accompanied by directed thought  evaluation
With the stilling of directed thoughts  evaluations he enters  remains in the second jhana rapture  pleasure born of composure unification of awareness free from directed thought  evaluation  internal assurance
With the fading of rapture he remains equanimous mindful  alert and senses pleasure with the body
He enters  remains in the third jhana of which the Noble Ones declare 'Equanimous  mindful he has a pleasant abiding' With the abandoning of pleasure  pain  as with the earlier disappearance of elation  distress  he enters  remains in the fourth jhana purity of equanimity  mindfulness neither pleasure nor pain
This is called right concentration
Suppose a man in need of oil looking for oil wandering in search of oil would pile gravel in a tub and press it sprinkling it again  again with water
If he were to pile gravel in a tub and press it sprinkling it again  again with water even when having made a wish having made no wish both having made a wish and having made no wish neither having made a wish nor having made no wish he would be incapable of obtaining results
Why is that
Because it is an inappropriate way of obtaining results
In the same way any brahmans or contemplatives endowed with wrong view wrong resolve wrong speech wrong action wrong livelihood wrong effort wrong mindfulness  wrong concentration If they follow the holy life even when having made a wish having made no wish both having made a wish and having made no wish neither having made a wish nor having made no wish they are incapable of obtaining results
Why is that
Because it is an inappropriate way of obtaining results
Suppose a man in need of oil looking for oil wandering in search of oil would pile sesame seeds in a tub and press them sprinkling them again  again with water
If he were to pile sesame seeds in a tub and press them sprinkling them again  again with water even when having made a wish having made no wish both having made a wish and having made no wish neither having made a wish nor having made no wish he would be capable of obtaining results
Why is that
Because it is an appropriate way of obtaining results
In the same way any brahmans or contemplatives endowed with right view right resolve right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness  right concentration If they follow the holy life even when having made a wish having made no wish both having made a wish and having made no wish neither having made a wish nor having made no wish they are capable of obtaining results
Why is that
Because it is an appropriate way of obtaining results
Monks ignorance is the leader in the attainment of unskillful qualities followed by lack of conscience  lack of concern
In a unknowledgeable person immersed in ignorance wrong view arises
In one of wrong view wrong resolve arises
In one of wrong resolve wrong speech In one of wrong speech wrong action In one of wrong action wrong livelihood In one of wrong livelihood wrong effort In one of wrong effort wrong mindfulness In one of wrong mindfulness wrong concentration arises
Clear knowing is the leader in the attainment of skillful qualities followed by conscience  concern
In a knowledgeable person immersed in clear knowing right view arises
In one of right view right resolve arises
In one of right resolve right speech In one of right speech right action In one of right action right livelihood In one of right livelihood right effort In one of right effort right mindfulness In one of right mindfulness right concentration arises
Ven
Ananda went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to the Blessed One sat to one side
As he was sitting there Ven
Ananda said to the Blessed One This is half of the holy life lord having admirable people as friends companions  colleagues
Don't say that Ananda
Don't say that
Having admirable people as friends companions  colleagues is actually the whole of the holy life
When a monk has admirable people as friends companions  colleagues he can be expected to develop  pursue the noble eightfold path
And how does a monk who has admirable people as friends companions  colleagues develop  pursue the noble eightfold path
There is the case where a monk develops right view dependent on seclusion dependent on dispassion dependent on cessation resulting in relinquishment
He develops right resolve right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness right concentration dependent on seclusion dependent on dispassion dependent on cessation resulting in relinquishment
This is how a monk who has admirable people as friends companions  colleagues develops  pursues the noble eightfold path
And through this line of reasoning one may know how having admirable people as friends companions  colleagues is actually the whole of the holy life It is in dependence on me as an admirable friend that beings subject to birth have gained release from birth that beings subject to aging have gained release from aging that beings subject to death have gained release from death that beings subject to sorrow lamentation pain distress  despair have gained release from sorrow lamentation pain distress  despair
It is through this line of reasoning that one may know how having admirable people as friends companions  colleagues is actually the whole of the holy life
More on Right View
And how is right view the forerunner
One discerns wrong view as wrong view
One discerns right view as right view
This is one's right view
And what is wrong view
'There is nothing given nothing offered nothing sacrificed
There is no fruit or result of good or bad actions
There is no this world no next world no mother no father no spontaneously reborn beings no brahmans or contemplatives who faring rightly  practicing rightly proclaim this world  the next after having directly known  realized it for themselves' This is wrong view
And what is right view
Right view I tell you is of two sorts There is right view with fermentations siding with merit resulting in the paraphernalia and there is noble right view free from fermentations transcendent a factor of the path
And what is the right view that has fermentations sides with merit  results in paraphernalia
'There is what is given what is offered what is sacrificed
There are fruits  results of good  bad actions
There is this world  the next world
There is mother  father
There are spontaneously reborn beings there are brahmans  contemplatives who faring rightly  practicing rightly proclaim this world  the next after having directly known  realized it for themselves' This is the right view that has fermentations sides with merit  results in paraphernalia
And what is the right view that is free from fermentations transcendent a factor of the path
The discernment the faculty of discernment the strength of discernment analysis of qualities as a factor for Awakening the path factor of right view in one developing the noble path whose mind is noble whose mind is free from fermentations who is fully possessed of the noble path
This is the right view that is free from fermentations transcendent a factor of the path
One tries to abandon wrong view  to enter into right view This is one's right effort
One is mindful to abandon wrong view  to enter  remain in right view This is one's right mindfulness
Thus these three qualities  right view right effort  right mindfulness  run  circle around right view

Right Mindfulness
This is the direct path for the purification of beings for the overcoming of sorrow  lamentation for the disappearance of pain  distress for the attainment of the right method  for the realization of Unbinding  in other words the four frames of reference
What four
There is the case where a monk remains focused on the body in  of itself  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the world
He remains focused on feelings mind mental qualities in  of themselves  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the world
And how is does the monk remain focused on the body in  of itself
There is the case of a monk who having gone to the wilderness to the shade of a tree or to an empty building sits down folding his legs crosswise holding his body erect and setting mindfulness to the fore
Always mindful he breathes in mindful he breathes out
Breathing in long he discerns 'I am breathing in long' or breathing out long he discerns 'I am breathing out long' Or breathing in short he discerns 'I am breathing in short' or breathing out short he discerns 'I am breathing out short' He trains himself 'I will breathe in sensitive to the entire body' He trains himself 'I will breathe out sensitive to the entire body' He trains himself 'I will breathe in calming bodily fabrication' He trains himself 'I will breathe out calming bodily fabrication' Just as a skilled turner or his apprentice when making a long turn discerns 'I am making a long turn' or when making a short turn discerns 'I am making a short turn' in the same way the monk when breathing in long discerns 'I am breathing in long' or breathing out long he discerns 'I am breathing out long' He trains himself 'I will breathe in calming bodily fabrication' He trains himself 'I will breathe out calming bodily fabrication'
In this way he remains focused internally on the body in  of itself or externally on the body in  of itself or both internally  externally on the body in  of itself
Or he remains focused on the phenomenon of origination with regard to the body on the phenomenon of passing away with regard to the body or on the phenomenon of origination  passing away with regard to the body
Or his mindfulness that 'There is a body' is maintained to the extent of knowledge  remembrance
And he remains unsustained by anything in the world
This is how a monk remains focused on the body in  of itself
Furthermore when walking the monk discerns 'I am walking' When standing he discerns 'I am standing' When sitting he discerns 'I am sitting' When lying down he discerns 'I am lying down' Or however his body is disposed that is how he discerns it
In this way he remains focused internally on the body in  of itself or focused externally unsustained by anything in the world
This is how a monk remains focused on the body in  of itself
Furthermore when going forward  returning he makes himself fully alert when looking toward  looking away when bending  extending his limbs when carrying his outer cloak his upper robe  his bowl when eating drinking chewing  savoring when urinating  defecating when walking standing sitting falling asleep waking up talking  remaining silent he makes himself fully alert
In this way he remains focused internally on the body in  of itself or focused externally unsustained by anything in the world
This is how a monk remains focused on the body in  of itself
Furthermore just as if a sack with openings at both ends were full of various kinds of grain  wheat rice mung beans kidney beans sesame seeds husked rice  and a man with good eyesight pouring it out were to reflect 'This is wheat
This is rice
These are mung beans
These are kidney beans
These are sesame seeds
This is husked rice' in the same way monks a monk reflects on this very body from the soles of the feet on up from the crown of the head on down surrounded by skin and full of various kinds of unclean things 'In this body there are head hairs body hairs nails teeth skin flesh tendons bones bone marrow kidneys heart liver pleura spleen lungs large intestines small intestines gorge feces bile phlegm pus blood sweat fat tears skinoil saliva mucus fluid in the joints urine'
In this way he remains focused internally on the body in  of itself or focused externally unsustained by anything in the world
This is how a monk remains focused on the body in  of itself
Furthermore just as a skilled butcher or his apprentice having killed a cow would sit at a crossroads cutting it up into pieces the monk contemplates this very body  however it stands however it is disposed  in terms of properties 'In this body there is the earth property the liquid property the heat property  the wind property'
In this way he remains focused internally on the body in  of itself or focused externally unsustained by anything in the world
This is how a monk remains focused on the body in  of itself
Furthermore as if he were to see a corpse cast away in a charnel ground  one day two days three days dead  bloated livid  festering he applies it to this very body 'This body too Such is its nature such is its future such its unavoidable fate'
Or again as if he were to see a corpse cast away in a charnel ground picked at by crows vultures  hawks by dogs hyenas  various other creatures a skeleton smeared with flesh  blood connected with tendons a fleshless skeleton smeared with blood connected with tendons a skeleton without flesh or blood connected with tendons bones detached from their tendons scattered in all directions  here a hand bone there a foot bone here a shin bone there a thigh bone here a hip bone there a back bone here a rib there a breast bone here a shoulder bone there a neck bone here a jaw bone there a tooth here a skull the bones whitened somewhat like the color of shells piled up more than a year old decomposed into a powder He applies it to this very body 'This body too Such is its nature such is its future such its unavoidable fate'
In this way he remains focused internally on the body in  of itself or externally on the body in  of itself or both internally  externally on the body in  of itself
Or he remains focused on the phenomenon of origination with regard to the body on the phenomenon of passing away with regard to the body or on the phenomenon of origination  passing away with regard to the body
Or his mindfulness that 'There is a body' is maintained to the extent of knowledge  remembrance
And he remains unsustained by anything in the world
This is how a monk remains focused on the body in  of itself
And how does a monk remain focused on feelings in  of themselves
There is the case where a monk when feeling a painful feeling discerns 'I am feeling a painful feeling' When feeling a pleasant feeling he discerns 'I am feeling a pleasant feeling' When feeling a neitherpainfulnorpleasant feeling he discerns 'I am feeling a neitherpainfulnorpleasant feeling'
When feeling a painful feeling of the flesh he discerns 'I am feeling a painful feeling of the flesh' When feeling a painful feeling not of the flesh he discerns 'I am feeling a painful feeling not of the flesh' When feeling a pleasant feeling of the flesh he discerns 'I am feeling a pleasant feeling of the flesh' When feeling a pleasant feeling not of the flesh he discerns 'I am feeling a pleasant feeling not of the flesh' When feeling a neitherpainfulnorpleasant feeling of the flesh he discerns 'I am feeling a neitherpainfulnorpleasant feeling of the flesh' When feeling a neitherpainfulnorpleasant feeling not of the flesh he discerns 'I am feeling a neitherpainfulnorpleasant feeling not of the flesh'
In this way he remains focused internally on feelings in  of themselves or externally on feelings in  of themselves or both internally  externally on feelings in  of themselves
Or he remains focused on the phenomenon of origination with regard to feelings on the phenomenon of passing away with regard to feelings or on the phenomenon of origination  passing away with regard to feelings
Or his mindfulness that 'There are feelings' is maintained to the extent of knowledge  remembrance
And he remains unsustained by anything in the world
This is how a monk remains focused on feelings in  of themselves
And how does a monk remain focused on the mind in  of itself
There is the case where a monk when the mind has passion discerns that the mind has passion
When the mind is without passion he discerns that the mind is without passion

Or he remains focused on the phenomenon of origination with regard to the mind on the phenomenon of passing away with regard to the mind or on the phenomenon of origination  passing away with regard to the mind
Or his mindfulness that 'There is a mind' is maintained to the extent of knowledge  remembrance
And he remains unsustained by anything in the world
This is how a monk remains focused on the mind in  of itself
And how does a monk remain focused on mental qualities in  of themselves
There is the case where a monk remains focused on mental qualities in  of themselves with reference to the five hindrances
And how does a monk remain focused on mental qualities in  of themselves with reference to the five hindrances
There is the case where there being sensual desire present within a monk discerns that 'There is sensual desire present within me' Or there being no sensual desire present within he discerns that 'There is no sensual desire present within me' He discerns how there is the arising of unarisen sensual desire
And he discerns how there is the abandoning of sensual desire once it has arisen
And he discerns how there is no future arising of sensual desire that has been abandoned

In this way he remains focused internally on mental qualities in  of themselves or externally on mental qualities in  of themselves or both internally  externally on mental qualities in  of themselves

This is how a monk remains focused on mental qualities in  of themselves with reference to the five hindrances
Furthermore the monk remains focused on mental qualities in  of themselves with reference to the seven factors for Awakening
And how does a monk remain focused on mental qualities in  of themselves with reference to the seven factors for Awakening
There is the case where there being mindfulness as a factor for Awakening present within a monk discerns that 'Mindfulness as a factor for Awakening is present within me' Or there being no mindfulness as a factor for Awakening present within he discerns that 'Mindfulness as a factor for Awakening is not present within me' He discerns how there is the arising of unarisen mindfulness as a factor for Awakening
And he discerns how there is the culmination of the development of mindfulness as a factor for Awakening once it has arisen

In this way he remains focused internally on mental qualities in  of themselves or externally unsustained by anything in the world
This is how a monk remains focused on mental qualities in  of themselves with reference to the seven factors for Awakening
Now in anyone who would develop these four frames of reference in this way for seven years one of two fruits can be expected either gnosis right here  now or  if there be any remnant of clingingsustenance  nonreturn
Let alone seven years
In anyone who would develop these four frames of reference in this way for six years five four three two years one year seven months six months five four three two months one month half a month one of two fruits can be expected either gnosis right here  now or  if there be any remnant of clingingsustenance  nonreturn
Let alone half a month
In anyone who would develop these four frames of reference in this way for seven days one of two fruits can be expected either gnosis right here  now or  if there be any remnant of clingingsustenance  nonreturn
'This is the direct path for the purification of beings for the overcoming of sorrow  lamentation for the disappearance of pain  distress for the attainment of the right method  for the realization of Unbinding  in other words the four frames of reference' Thus was it said and in reference to this was it said
Breath Meditation
And how is mindfulness of inout breathing developed  pursued so as to bring the four frames of reference to their culmination
On whatever occasion a monk breathing in long discerns that he is breathing in long or breathing out long discerns that he is breathing out long or breathing in short discerns that he is breathing in short or breathing out short discerns that he is breathing out short trains himself to breathe in  out sensitive to the entire body trains himself to breathe in  out calming bodily fabrications On that occasion monks the monk remains focused on the body in  of itself  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the world
I tell you monks that this  the inout breath  is classed as a body among bodies which is why the monk on that occasion remains focused on the body in  of itself  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the world
On whatever occasion a monk trains himself to breathe in  out sensitive to rapture trains himself to breathe in  out sensitive to pleasure trains himself to breathe in  out sensitive to mental fabrications trains himself to breathe in  out calming mental fabrications On that occasion the monk remains focused on feelings in  of themselves  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the world
I tell you monks that this  careful attention to inout breaths  is classed as a feeling among feelings which is why the monk on that occasion remains focused on feelings in  of themselves  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the world
On whatever occasion a monk trains himself to breathe in  out sensitive to the mind trains himself to breathe in  out satisfying the mind trains himself to breathe in  out steadying the mind trains himself to breathe in  out releasing the mind On that occasion the monk remains focused on the mind in  of itself  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the world
I don't say that there is mindfulness of inout breathing in one of confused mindfulness and no presence of mind which is why the monk on that occasion remains focused on the mind in  of itself  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the world
On whatever occasion a monk trains himself to breathe in  out focusing on inconstancy trains himself to breathe in  out focusing on dispassion trains himself to breathe in  out focusing on cessation trains himself to breathe in  out focusing on relinquishment On that occasion the monk remains focused on mental qualities in  of themselves  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the world
He who sees clearly with discernment the abandoning of greed  distress is one who oversees with equanimity which is why the monk on that occasion remains focused on mental qualities in  of themselves  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the world
This is how mindfulness of inout breathing is developed  pursued so as to bring the four frames of reference to their culmination
Mindfulness  Concentration
Having abandoned the five hindrances  imperfections of awareness that weaken discernment  the monk remains focused on the body in  of itself  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the world
He remains focused on feelings mind mental qualities in  of themselves  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the world
Just as if an elephant trainer were to plant a large post in the ground and were to bind a forest elephant to it by the neck in order to overcome its forest habits overcome its forest memories  resolves overcome its distraction fatigue  fever over leaving the forest to make it delight in the town and to inculcate in it habits congenial to human beings
In the same way these four frames of reference are bindings for the awareness of the disciple of the noble ones for the sake of overcoming his household habits overcoming his household memories  resolves overcoming his distraction fatigue  fever over leaving the household life for the attainment of the right method and the realization of Unbinding
Then the Tathagata trains him further Come monk remain focused on the body in  of itself but do not think any thoughts connected with the body
Remain focused on feelings in  of themselves but do not think any thoughts connected with feelings
Remain focused on the mind in  of itself but do not think any thoughts connected with mind
Remain focused on mental qualities in  of themselves but do not think any thoughts connected with mental qualities With the stilling of directed thoughts  evaluations he enters the second jhana
Right Concentration
Visakha Now what is concentration what qualities are its themes what qualities are its requisites and what is its development
Sister Dhammadinna Singleness of mind is concentration the four frames of reference are its themes the four right exertions are its requisites and any cultivation development  pursuit of these qualities is its development
These are the four developments of concentration
What four
There is the development of concentration that when developed  pursued leads to a pleasant abiding in the here  now
There is the development of concentration that leads to the attainment of knowledge  vision
There is the development of concentration that leads to mindfulness  alertness
There is the development of concentration that when developed  pursued leads to the ending of the effluents
And what is the development of concentration that when developed  pursued leads to a pleasant abiding in the here  now
There is the case where a monk  quite withdrawn from sensuality withdrawn from unskillful qualities  enters  remains in the first jhana rapture  pleasure born from withdrawal accompanied by directed thought  evaluation
With the stilling of directed thoughts  evaluations he enters  remains in the second jhana rapture  pleasure born of composure unification of awareness free from directed thought  evaluation  internal assurance
With the fading of rapture he remains equanimous mindful  alert and senses pleasure with the body
He enters  remains in the third jhana of which the Noble Ones declare 'Equanimous  mindful he has a pleasant abiding' With the abandoning of pleasure  pain  as with the earlier disappearance of elation  distress  he enters  remains in the fourth jhana purity of equanimity  mindfulness neither pleasure nor pain
This is the development of concentration that leads to a pleasant abiding in the here  now
And what is the development of concentration that leads to the attainment of knowledge  vision
There is the case where a monk has the perception of light the perception of daytime wellfixed  well in hand
Day is the same as night night is the same as day
By means of an awareness open  unhampered he develops a brightened mind
This is the development of concentration that leads to the attainment of knowledge  vision
And what is the development of concentration that leads to mindfulness  alertness
There is the case where a monk is conscious of feelings as they arise as they persist as they go totally to their end
He is conscious of perceptions as they arise as they persist as they go totally to their end
He is conscious of thoughts as they arise as they persist as they go totally to their end
This is the development of concentration that leads to mindfulness  alertness
And what is the development of concentration that leads to the ending of the effluents
There is the case where a monk remains focused on arising  falling away with reference to the five clingingaggregates 'Such is form such its origination such its passing away
Such is feeling Such is perception Such are fabrications Such is consciousness such its origination such its passing away' This is the development of concentration that leads to the ending of the effluents
These are the four developments of concentration
Now what monks is the fivefactored noble right concentration
There is the case where a monk  quite withdrawn from sensuality withdrawn from unskillful qualities  enters  remains in the first jhana rapture  pleasure born from withdrawal accompanied by directed thought  evaluation
He permeates  pervades suffuses  fills this very body with the rapture  pleasure born from withdrawal
There is nothing of his entire body unpervaded by rapture  pleasure born from withdrawal
Just as if a skilled bathman or bathman's apprentice would pour bath powder into a brass basin and knead it together sprinkling it again  again with water so that his ball of bath powder  saturated moistureladen permeated within  without  would nevertheless not drip even so monks the monk permeates this very body with the rapture  pleasure born of withdrawal
There is nothing of his entire body unpervaded by rapture  pleasure born from withdrawal
This is the first development of the fivefactored noble right concentration
Furthermore with the stilling of directed thoughts  evaluations he enters  remains in the second jhana rapture  pleasure born of composure onepointedness of awareness free from directed thought  evaluation  internal assurance
He permeates  pervades suffuses  fills this very body with the rapture  pleasure born of composure
There is nothing of his entire body unpervaded by rapture  pleasure born of composure
Just like a lake with springwater welling up from within having no inflow from east west north or south and with the skies periodically supplying abundant showers so that the cool fount of water welling up from within the lake would permeate  pervade suffuse  fill it with cool waters there being no part of the lake unpervaded by the cool waters even so monks the monk permeates this very body with the rapture  pleasure born of composure
There is nothing of his entire body unpervaded by rapture  pleasure born of composure
This is the second development of the fivefactored noble right concentration
And furthermore with the fading of rapture he remains equanimous mindful  alert and senses pleasure with the body
He enters  remains in the third jhana of which the Noble Ones declare 'Equanimous  mindful he has a pleasant abiding' He permeates  pervades suffuses  fills this very body with the pleasure divested of rapture so that there is nothing of his entire body unpervaded with pleasure divested of rapture
Just as in a blue white or redlotus pond there may be some of the blue white or red lotuses which born  growing in the water stay immersed in the water and flourish without standing up out of the water so that they are permeated  pervaded suffused  filled with cool water from their roots to their tips and nothing of those blue white or red lotuses would be unpervaded with cool water even so monks the monk permeates this very body with the pleasure divested of rapture
There is nothing of his entire body unpervaded with pleasure divested of rapture
This is the third development of the fivefactored noble right concentration
And furthermore with the abandoning of pleasure  stress  as with the earlier disappearance of elation  distress  he enters  remains in the fourth jhana purity of equanimity  mindfulness neitherpleasurenorpain
He sits permeating the body with a pure bright awareness so that there is nothing of his entire body unpervaded by pure bright awareness
Just as if a man were sitting covered from head to foot with a white cloth so that there would be no part of his body to which the white cloth did not extend even so monks the monk sits permeating his body with a pure bright awareness
There is nothing of his entire body unpervaded by pure bright awareness
This is the fourth development of the fivefactored noble right concentration
And furthermore the monk has his theme of reflection well in hand well attended to wellpondered wellpenetrated by means of discernment
Just as if one person were to reflect on another or a standing person were to reflect on a sitting person or a sitting person were to reflect on a person lying down even so monks the monk has his theme of reflection well in hand well attended to wellpondered wellpenetrated by means of discernment
This is the fifth development of the fivefactored noble right concentration
When a monk has developed  pursued the fivefactored noble right concentration in this way then whichever of the six higher knowledges he turns his mind to know  realize he can witness them for himself whenever there is an opening
Suppose that there were a water jar set on a stand brimful of water so that a crow could drink from it
If a strong man were to tip it in any way at all would water spill out
Yes lord
In the same way when a monk has developed  pursued the fivefactored noble right concentration in this way then whichever of the six higher knowledges he turns his mind to know  realize he can witness them for himself whenever there is an opening
Suppose there were a rectangular water tank  set on level round bounded by dykes  brimful of water so that a crow could drink from it
If a strong man were to loosen the dykes anywhere at all would water spill out
Yes lord Suppose there were a chariot on level ground at four crossroads harnessed to thoroughbreds waiting with whips lying ready so that a skilled driver a trainer of tamable horses might mount and  taking the reins with his left hand and the whip with his right  drive out  back to whatever place and by whichever road he liked in the same way when a monk has developed  pursued the fivefactored noble right concentration in this way then whichever of the six higher knowledges he turns his mind to know  realize he can witness them for himself whenever there is an opening

Concentration  Discernment
Suppose that an archer or archer's apprentice were to practice on a straw man or mound of clay so that after a while he would become able to shoot long distances to fire accurate shots in rapid succession  to pierce great masses
In the same way there is the case where a monk enters  remains in the first jhana rapture  pleasure born of withdrawal accompanied by directed thought  evaluation
He regards whatever phenomena there that are connected with form feeling perception fabrications  consciousness as inconstant stressful a disease a cancer an arrow painful an affliction alien a dissolution an emptiness notself
He turns his mind away from those phenomena and having done so inclines his mind to the quality of deathlessness 'This is peace this is exquisite  the resolution of all fabrications the relinquishment of all mental acquisitions the passing away of craving dispassion cessation Unbinding'
Having attained this point he reaches the ending of the mental fermentations
Or if not then  through passion  delight for this very quality and from the total wasting away of the first five of the Fetters  he is due to be reborn there to be totally unbound never again to return from that world 
Discernment  Release
With his mind thus concentrated purified  bright the monk directs it to the knowledge of the ending of the mental fermentations
Just as if there were a pool of water in a mountain glen  clear limpid  unsullied  where a man with good eyesight standing on the bank could see shells gravel  pebbles and also shoals of fish swimming about  resting and it would occur to him 'This pool of water is clear limpid  unsullied
Here are these shells gravel  pebbles and also these shoals of fish swimming about  resting' In the same way the monk discerns as it has come to be that 'This is stress This is the origination of stress This is the cessation of stress This is the way leading to the cessation of stress These are mental fermentations This is the origination of fermentations This is the cessation of fermentations This is the way leading to the cessation of fermentations' His heart thus knowing thus seeing is released from the fermentations of sensuality becoming  ignorance
With release there is the knowledge 'Released' He discerns that 'Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task done
There is nothing further for this world' This too is a reward of the contemplative life visible here  now more excellent than the previous ones and more sublime
And as for another visible fruit of the contemplative life higher  more sublime than this there is none

The present work offers a translation of the Itivuttaka a collection of short discourses of the Buddha in both prose and verse
The text belongs to the Pali canon of the Theravada school being placed between the Udana and the Sutta Nipata
It was previously translated by FWoodward and published together with his translation of the Udana in Minor Anthologies of the Pali Canon Vol
II
According to the commentarial tradition the suttas or discourses of the Itivuttaka were collected by the woman laydisciple Khujjuttara from sermons given by the Buddha while he was staying at Kosambi
Khujjuttara was a servant of Samavati the consort of King Udena
She had become a streamenterer after meeting the Buddha and subsequently converted the women of the palace headed by Samavati to the teaching
She used to go regularly to listen to the Buddha and then later repeated what she had heard to the other women
The collection of these sayings became the Itivuttaka
It is said that the emphatic statements at the beginning and end of each of the suttas reproduced here only in the first and last were made by Khujjuttara to stress that they were the Buddha's words and not her own
Whether or not this story is true the Itivuttaka is the only book in the Pali canon that introduces and concludes its suttas in this fashion and it is from the opening statement that the title is derived This was said by the Lord so I heard  hence Itivuttaka The Sowassaid or Sayings
These Sayings are grouped into four unequal sections arranged like the Anguttara Nikaya according to the number of items they contain from one to four
Besides these four sections  The Ones The Twos The Threes and The Fours  the text is further subdivided into vaggas groups of roughly ten suttas
But to simplify the presentation in this translation these subgroupings have been ignored
Only the four main sections have been retained and the suttas numbered from to as in the PTS edition
A number of the suttas and verses are also found in other parts of the Sutta Pitaka especially the Anguttara Nikaya but many are unique to this collection
In translating the Itivuttaka I have attempted to follow the text as closely as possible and to produce an exact and literal rendition
With the verses however while remaining faithful to the meaning I occasionally found it necessary to depart from the syntax of the Pali
Although I did not attempt to produce a metrical translation by transposing lines and words and controlling the number of syllables in the line I aimed at producing a readable and rhythmic English rendering of the original Pali verse
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Sāvatthī at the Eastern Monastery the palace of Migāra's mother
And on that occasion the Blessed One  it being the observance day  was sitting surrounded by the community of monks
Then Ven
nanda  when the night was far advanced at the end of the first watch  got up from his seat arranged his robe over one shoulder stood facing the Blessed One paying homage with his hands placed palmtopalm over his heart and said to him Lord the night is far advanced
The first watch has ended
The community of monks has been sitting here long
May the Blessed One recite the Pāṭimokkha to them When this was said the Blessed One remained silent
Then a second time when the night was far advanced at the end of the middle watch Ven
nanda got up from his seat arranged his robe over one shoulder stood facing the Blessed One paying homage with his hands placed palmtopalm over his heart and said to him Lord the night is far advanced
The second watch has ended
The community of monks has been sitting here long
May the Blessed One recite the Pāṭimokkha to them When this was said the Blessed One remained silent
Then a third time when the night was far advanced at the end of the last watch as dawn was approaching and the face of the night was beaming Ven
nanda got up from his seat arranged his robe over one shoulder stood facing the Blessed One paying homage with his hands placed palmtopalm over his heart and said to him Lord the night is far advanced
The last watch has ended
Dawn is approaching and the face of the night is beaming
The community of monks has been sitting here long
May the Blessed One recite the Pāṭimokkha to the community of monks
nanda the gathering isn't pure
Then the thought occurred to Ven
Mahā Moggallāna In reference to which individual did the Blessed One just now say 'nanda the gathering isn't pure' So he directed his mind encompassing with his awareness the awareness of the entire community of monks
He saw that individual  unprincipled evil unclean and suspect in his undertakings hidden in his actions not a contemplative though claiming to be one not leading the holy life though claiming to do so inwardly rotten oozing with desire filthy by nature  sitting in the midst of the community of monks
On seeing him he got up went over to that individual and on reaching him said Get up friend
You have been seen by the Blessed One
You have no affiliation with the community of monks Then the individual remained silent
A second time A third time Ven
Mahā Moggallāna said Get up friend
You have been seen by the Blessed One
You have no affiliation with the community of monks And for a third time the individual remained silent
Then Ven
Mahā Moggallāna grabbing that individual by the arm having expelled him through the outside door of the porch and locking the bolt approached the Blessed One and on arrival said I have expelled that individual lord
The gathering is now pure
Let the Blessed One recite the Pāṭimokkha to the community of monks
Isn't it amazing Moggallāna
Isn't it astounding how that worthless man waited until he was grabbed by the arm Then the Blessed One addressed the monks From now on I will no longer perform the observance or recite the Pāṭimokkha
From now on you alone monks will perform the observance and recite the Pāṭimokkha
It is impossible it cannot happen that a Tathāgata would perform the observance or recite the Pāṭimokkha with an impure gathering

Then on realizing the significance of that the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed
Summary There are are many ways to generate Pali diacritics
Here is a review of seven of them
Pali is a phonetic language with no written alphabet of its own
Students of the language have therefore relied on their own native alphabets to read and write Pali ever since the st century BCE when Sri Lankan scribes first recorded the Tipitaka in the Sinhala alphabet
But when Europeans began to take an interest in South Asian languages in the th century they quickly discovered that their own roman alphabet was no match for the wide range of phonemes present in South Asian languages
European scholars thus began representing the more problematic Pali phonemes by augmenting the roman alphabet with a system of letterpairs and diacritics including the macron dotover dotunder and tilde
Until well into the midth century Pali typefaces using these characters were used almost exclusively by specialty book publishers a scholar's daytoday duties of transcribing translating and editing had to be laboriously carried out with typewriter pen and a steady hand with which to apply the diacritics
Unfortunately the first personal computers failed to address the typographic challenge of diacritics as they were designed around a very limited character set that was only barely able to accommodate the upper and lowercase roman letters ten digits and a modest sprinkling of punctuation marks
The extendedASCII set which soon followed offered a suite of additional special symbols including many required for northern and eastern European alphabets
But still no macrons or dotunders
In the absence of a universally accepted computer representation of nonASCII characters students of nonEuropean languages were left to invent their own stopgap methods
These range from giving ordinary punctuation marks doubleduty as standins for diacritics to designing special diacritic fonts and everything in between
A good written phonetic representation of Pali  indeed of any language  using one's native alphabet as a starting point should aspire to each of the following ideals
No single method simultaneously realizes all of these goals no single method is best Your method of choice therefore depends both on your particular needs and on the typing printing and computing resources at your disposal
In what follows I've singled out some of the more common strategies that Pali students have used in recent decades running the gamut from ignoring diacritics altogether to using Unicode fonts
I evaluate the success of each strategy in achieving the abovementioned goals to help you decide which method best suits your needs
This is certainly the simplest method
But the cost of that simplicity is heavy the irretrievable loss of crucial pronunciation details
This is the method often used here at Access to Insight

Capitalized letters represent letters with an accompanying diacritic
The method is simple but it has ambiguities how for example would you distinguish between the palatal and guttural n
In the Velthuis scheme two basic rules are observed
Of the plainASCII methods this one is the most precise as it carefully preserves the significance of each special character
To the uninitiated however the sight of all those doubled vowels and misplaced periods is utterly bewildering perhaps leaving them to wonder if someone's keyboard is broken
HTML has access to the extended ASCII character set which includes many accented nonEnglish European vowels some of which can serve as reasonable standins for the long Pali vowels
The palatal n is straightforward ñ
Whatever type of accent you adopt use it consistently
This method attempts to clear up the stuttering of Method 's doubled vowels by using a little HTML
For highquality print projects nothing beats a welldesigned Pali font
For an extensive review of available Pali and Sanskrit fonts see Transliteration and Devanagari Fonts for Sanskrit by Ulrich Stiehl
The Association for Insight Meditation's Pali Font Resources page offers several ANSI and Unicode fonts suitable for working with Pali
Unicode has emerged in recent years as the international standard for representing characters from most of the world's alphabets
All the special characters we need for Pali transliteration may be found in Unicode's Latin ExtendedA and Latin Extended Additional code charts
They can therefore be easily generated using HTML provided that your web browser uses a Unicodesavvy font
There are many Unicode fonts available that contain the characters needed for Pali
The following table lists the HTML Unicode entities required to generate each of the special Pali characters
If your web browser supports Unicode the characters appearing in the last column of the table should resemble those appearing the shaded column
If they do not match then you may have to upgrade your web browser install Unicode fonts on your computer or both
For details about configuring your computer and browser to use Unicode see the Unicode website
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Sāvatthī at Jeta's Grove Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery
And on that occasion Ven
Nanda  the Blessed One's brother son of his maternal aunt  announced to a large number of monks I don't enjoy leading the holy life my friends
I can't keep up the holy life
Giving up the training I will return to the common life
Then a certain monk went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side
As he was sitting there he told the Blessed One Lord Ven
Nanda  the Blessed One's brother son of his maternal aunt  has announced to a large number of monks 'I don't enjoy leading the holy life my friends
I can't keep up the holy life
Giving up the training I will return to the common life' Then the Blessed One told a certain monk Come monk
In my name call Nanda saying 'The Teacher calls you friend Nanda' Responding As you say lord to the Blessed One the monk went to Ven
Nanda on arrival he said The Teacher calls you friend Nanda
Responding As you say my friend to the monk Ven
Nanda went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side
As he was sitting there the Blessed One said to him Is it true Nanda that you have announced to a large number of monks 'I don't enjoy leading the holy life my friends
I can't keep up the holy life
Giving up the training I will return to the common life'
Yes lord
But why Nanda don't you enjoy leading the holy life
Why can't you keep up the holy life
Why giving up the training will you return to the common life
Lord as I was leaving home a Sakyan girl  the envy of the countryside  glanced up at me with her hair halfcombed and said 'Hurry back master' Recollecting that I don't enjoy leading the holy life
I can't keep up the holy life
Giving up the training I will return to the common life
Then taking Ven
Nanda by the arm  as a strong man might flex his extended arm or extend his flexed arm  the Blessed One disappeared from Jeta's Grove and reappeared among the devas of the heaven of the Thirtythree
Now on that occasion about dovefooted nymphs had come to wait upon Sakka the ruler of the devas
The Blessed One said to Ven
Nanda Nanda do you see these dovefooted nymphs
Yes lord
What do you think Nanda
Which is lovelier better looking more charming the Sakyan girl the envy of the countryside or these dovefooted nymphs
Lord compared to these dovefooted nymphs the Sakyan girl the envy of the countryside is like a cauterized monkey with its ears  nose cut off
She doesn't count
She's not even a small fraction
There's no comparison
The dovefooted nymphs are lovelier better looking more charming
Then take joy Nanda
Take joy
I am your guarantor for getting dovefooted nymphs
If the Blessed One is my guarantor for getting dovefooted nymphs I will enjoy leading the holy life under the Blessed One
Then taking Ven
Nanda by the arm  as a strong man might flex his extended arm or extend his flexed arm  the Blessed One disappeared from among the devas of the heaven of the Thirtythree and reappeared at Jeta's Grove
The monks heard They say that Ven
Nanda  the Blessed One's brother son of his maternal aunt  is leading the holy life for the sake of nymphs
They say that the Blessed One is his guarantor for getting dovefooted nymphs
Then the monks who were companions of Ven
Nanda went around addressing him as they would a hired hand  a person who had been bought Venerable Nanda they say has been hired
Venerable Nanda they say has been bought
He's leading the holy life for the sake of nymphs
The Blessed One is his guarantor for getting dovefooted nymphs
Then Ven
Nanda  humiliated ashamed  disgusted that the monks who were his companions were addressing him as they would a hired hand  a person who had been bought  went to dwell alone secluded heedful ardent  resolute
He in no long time entered  remained in the supreme goal of the holy life for which clansmen rightly go forth from home into homelessness knowing  realizing it for himself right in the herenow
He knew Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task done
There is nothing further for the sake of this world And thus Ven
Nanda became another one of the arahants
Then a certain devatā in the far extreme of the night her extreme radiance lighting up the entirety of Jeta's Grove approached the Blessed One
On arrival having bowed down to him she stood to one side
As she was standing there she said to the Blessed One Lord Ven
Nanda  the Blessed One's brother son of his maternal aunt  through the ending of the effluents has entered  remains in the effluentfree awarenessrelease  discernmentrelease directly knowing  realizing them for himself right in the herenow And within the Blessed One the knowledge arose Nanda through the ending of the effluents has entered  remains in the effluentfree awarenessrelease  discernmentrelease directly knowing  realizing them for himself right in the herenow
Then when the night had passed Ven
Nanda went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side
As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One Lord about the Blessed One's being my guarantor for getting dovefooted nymphs I hereby release the Blessed One from that promise
Nanda having comprehended your awareness with my own awareness I realized that 'Nanda through the ending of the effluents has entered  remains in the effluentfree awarenessrelease  discernmentrelease directly knowing  realizing them for himself right in the herenow' And a devatā informed me that 'Ven
Nanda through the ending of the effluents has entered  remains in the effluentfree awarenessrelease  discernmentrelease directly knowing  realizing them for himself right in the herenow' When your mind through lack of clinging was released from the effluents I was thereby released from that promise
Then on realizing the significance of that the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed
The doctrine of kamma is one of the Buddha's central teachings
There is a modern myth that he simply picked up his ideas on kamma from the worldview prevalent in his day and that they aren't really integral to his message
Nothing could be further from the truth
Early Buddhists often cited the Buddha's teaching on kamma as one of the prime teachings that set him apart from his contemporaries and a study of his teachings on kamma will show that they underlie everything else he taught
The following readings from the Pali canon are designed to give an overview of the Buddha's teachings on kamma
Before tackling them you might want to read a few introductory articles on the topic including the following ones available on Access to Insight Karma A Refuge in Skillful Action and Samsara Divided by Zero
The readings here are divided into three main sections
The first section provides background for the Buddhist teachings on kamma by showing how the early Buddhists viewed the way other contemporary schools of thought explained kamma
The second section focuses on the Buddha's basic observation that underlay his teachings on kamma that it is possible to develop a skill
This simple fact carries a number of important implications for any teaching on action
Actions give results and their results follow a discernible pattern
Otherwise it would not be possible to develop a skill
Some results are more desirable than others
Otherwise there would be no point in developing a skill
By observing one's mistakes one may learn from them and use that knowledge to act more skillfully in the future
This means that the mind is a crucial agent in determining actions and their results and there is an opening for feedback to influence the process of action
It is thus a nonlinear process and there is room for free will
Results can be observed while one is acting as well as after the action is done
This means that actions have both immediate results and longterm results a fact that makes the nonlinear process very complex
The passages in the second section discuss how these observations apply in practice
 discusses how the Buddha applied the principle of skillfulness to reach Awakening
 shows how to use it to decide what teachings are valid
 discusses how to apply it to all of one's actions
The remaining passages are selfexplanatory
The third section on kamma consists of passages that build a larger theory of action based on these observations
These passages are divided into three subsections based on a classification given in 
Subsection A is the most theoretical part of this study guide
It covers the Buddha's basic theory of causation and treats the place of intention  the factor that the Buddha identified as the essence of kamma  in the context of the Buddha's analysis of physical and mental phenomena
In the light of the Buddha's observation in  that views influence kamma this subsection concludes with two levels of right view mundane right view which informs the sort of good kamma that brings about happy results within the process of death and rebirth and transcendent right view which informs the sort of kamma that brings freedom from that process
Subsection B focuses on the issue of how long it takes for the results of kamma to appear and gives particular attention to some of the complexities that arise from the fact that kamma is nonlinear
Sometimes the results of an action don't appear immediately or even in the immediate next life
 discusses the role that the mind plays in determining how the results of kamma are experienced and  treats the intelligent way to use the Buddha's teachings on kamma when reflecting on one's own past bad kamma so as to train oneself in the proper frame of mind
Subsection C is divided into two further subsections based on a classification in 
The first of these two subsections discusses types of actions and mental qualities that lead to good or bad results within the process of rebirth and death
In some passages the emphasis is on results in the present life in others on results in future lives
The second of these two subsections discusses the type of kamma  and the right views underlying that kamma  leading to freedom the cessation of kamma the realization of nibbana
The concluding passages make the point that transcendent right view contains the seeds for its own transcendence once it has done its duty in cutting away other attachments it creates the momentum so that the mind can then abandon attachment to views of any sort right or wrong mundane or transcendent
That is how true freedom is gained
There are brahmans  contemplatives who hold this teaching hold this view 'Whatever a person experiences  pleasant painful or neither pleasant nor painful  that is all caused by what was done in the past' There are brahmans  contemplatives who hold this teaching hold this view 'Whatever a person experiences  pleasant painful or neither pleasant nor painful  that is all caused by a supreme being's act of creation' There are brahmans  contemplatives who hold this teaching hold this view 'Whatever a person experiences  pleasant painful or neither pleasant nor painful  that is all without cause  without condition'
Having approached the brahmans  contemplatives who hold that whatever a person experiences is all caused by what was done in the past' I said to them 'Is it true that you hold that whatever a person experiences is all caused by what was done in the past' Thus asked by me they admitted 'Yes' Then I said to them 'Then in that case a person is a killer of living beings because of what was done in the past
A person is a thief unchaste a liar a divisive speaker an abusive speaker an idle chatterer covetous malevolent a holder of wrong views because of what was done in the past' When one falls back on what was done in the past as being essential monks there is no desire no effort 'This should be done
This shouldn't be done' When one can't pin down as a truth or reality what should  shouldn't be done one dwells bewildered  unprotected
One cannot righteously refer to oneself as a contemplative

King Ajatasattu Purana Kassapa said to me 'Great king in acting or getting others to act in mutilating or getting others to mutilate in torturing or getting others to torture in inflicting sorrow or in getting others to inflict sorrow in tormenting or getting others to torment in intimidating or getting others to intimidate in taking life taking what is not given breaking into houses plundering wealth committing burglary ambushing highways committing adultery speaking lies  one does no evil
If with a razoredged disk one were to turn all the living beings on this earth to a single heap of flesh a single pile of flesh there would be no evil from that cause no coming of evil
Even if one were to go along the right bank of the Ganges killing and getting others to kill mutilating and getting others to mutilate torturing and getting others to torture there would be no evil from that cause no coming of evil
Even if one were to go along the left bank of the Ganges killing and getting others to kill mutilating and getting others to mutilate torturing and getting others to torture there would be no evil from that cause no coming of evil
Through generosity selfcontrol restraint and truthful speech there is no merit from that cause no coming of merit'
Ajita Kesakambalin said to me 'Great king there is nothing given nothing offered nothing sacrificed
There is no fruit or result of good or bad actions
There is no this world no next world no mother no father no spontaneously reborn beings no brahmans or contemplatives who faring rightly and practicing rightly proclaim this world and the next after having directly known and realized it for themselves
A person is a composite of four primary elements
At death the earth returns to and merges with the earthsubstance
The fire returns to and merges with the external firesubstance
The liquid returns to and merges with the external liquidsubstance
The wind returns to and merges with the external windsubstance
The sensefaculties scatter into space
Four men with the bier as the fifth carry the corpse
Its eulogies are sounded only as far as the charnel ground
The bones turn pigeoncolored
The offerings end in ashes
Generosity is taught by idiots
The words of those who speak of existence after death are false empty chatter
With the breakup of the body the wise and the foolish alike are annihilated destroyed
They do not exist after death'
Pakudha Kaccayana said to me 'Great king there are these seven substances  unmade irreducible uncreated without a creator barren stable as a mountainpeak standing firm like a pillar  that do not alter do not change do not interfere with one another are incapable of causing one another pleasure pain or both pleasure and pain
Which seven
The earthsubstance the liquidsubstance the firesubstance the windsubstance pleasure pain and the soul as the seventh
These are the seven substances And among them there is no killer nor one who causes killing no hearer nor one who causes hearing no cognizer nor one who causes cognition
When one cuts off head there is no one taking anyone's life
It is simply between the seven substances that the sword passes'
There is the case of a certain brahman or contemplative who does not discern as it actually is that 'This is skillful' or that 'This is unskillful' 'If I not discerning as it actually is that This is skillful or that This is unskillful were to declare that This is skillful or that This is unskillful  There are brahmans and contemplatives who are pundits subtle skilled in debate who prowl about like hairsplitting marksmen as it were shooting philosophical positions to pieces with their dialectic
They might crossquestion me press me for reasons rebuke me
I might not be able to stand my ground that would be a distress for me an obstacle for me' So out of a fear for questioning a loathing for questioning he resorts to verbal contortions to eellike wriggling
There is the case of a certain brahman or contemplative who is dull  exceedingly stupid
Out of dullness  exceeding stupidity he  being asked questions regarding this or that  resorts to verbal contortions to eellike wriggling 'If you ask me if there exists another world if I thought that there exists another world would I declare that to you
I don't think so
I don't think in that way
I don't think otherwise
I don't think not
I don't think not not
If you asked me if there isn't another world both is  isn't neither is nor isn't if there are beings who transmigrate if there aren't both are  aren't neither are nor aren't if the Tathagata exists after death doesn't both neither I don't think so
I don't think in that way
I don't think otherwise
I don't think not
I don't think not not'
Develop what is skillful monks
It's possible to develop what is skillful
If it were not possible to develop what is skillful I would not say to you 'Develop what is skillful' But because it is possible to develop what is skillful I say to you 'Develop what is skillful' If this development of what is skillful were conducive to harm  suffering I would not say to you 'Develop what is skillful' But because this development of what is skillful is conducive to benefit  happiness I say to you 'Develop what is skillful'
Before my selfawakening when I was still just an unawakened Bodhisatta the thought occurred to me 'Why don't I keep dividing my thinking into two classes' So I made thinking imbued with sensuality thinking imbued with malevolence  thinking imbued with harmfulness one class and thinking imbued with renunciation thinking imbued with nonmalevolence  thinking imbued with harmlessness another class
And as I remained thus heedful ardent  resolute thinking imbued with sensuality arose in me
I discerned that 'Thinking imbued with sensuality has arisen in me and that leads to my own affliction or to the affliction of others or to the affliction of both
It obstructs discernment promotes vexation  does not lead to Unbinding'
As I noticed that it leads to my own affliction it subsided
As I noticed that it leads to the affliction of others to the affliction of both it obstructs discernment promotes vexation  does not lead to Unbinding it subsided
Whenever thinking imbued with sensuality had arisen I simply abandoned it destroyed it dispelled it wiped it out of existence

Whatever a monk keeps pursuing with his thinking  pondering that becomes the inclination of his awareness
If a monk keeps pursuing thinking imbued with sensuality abandoning thinking imbued with renunciation his mind is bent by that thinking imbued with sensuality

Just as in the last month of the Rains in the autumn season when the crops are ripening a cowherd would look after his cows He would tap  poke  check  curb them with a stick on this side  that
Why is that
Because he foresees flogging or imprisonment or a fine or public censure arising from that
In the same way I foresaw in unskillful qualities drawbacks degradation  defilement and I foresaw in skillful qualities rewards related to renunciation  promoting cleansing
And as I remained thus heedful ardent  resolute thinking imbued with renunciation arose in me
I discerned that 'Thinking imbued with renunciation has arisen in me and that leads neither to my own affliction nor to the affliction of others nor to the affliction of both
It fosters discernment promotes lack of vexation  leads to Unbinding
If I were to think  ponder in line with that even for a night even for a day even for a day  night I do not envision any danger that would come from it except that thinking  pondering a long time would tire the body
When the body is tired the mind is disturbed and a disturbed mind is far from concentration' So I steadied my mind right within settled unified  concentrated it
Why is that
So that my mind would not be disturbed

Whatever a monk keeps pursuing with his thinking  pondering that becomes the inclination of his awareness
If a monk keeps pursuing thinking imbued with renunciation abandoning thinking imbued with sensuality his mind is bent by that thinking imbued with renunciation

Just as in the last month of the hot season when all the crops have been gathered into the village a cowherd would look after his cows While resting under the shade of a tree or out in the open he simply keeps himself mindful of 'those cows' In the same way I simply kept myself mindful of 'those mental qualities'
Unflagging persistence was aroused in me and unmuddled mindfulness established
My body was calm  unaroused my mind concentrated  single
Quite withdrawn from sensuality withdrawn from unskillful mental qualities I entered  remained in the first jhana rapture  pleasure born from withdrawal accompanied by directed thought  evaluation
With the stilling of directed thoughts  evaluations I entered  remained in the second jhana rapture  pleasure born of composure unification of awareness free from directed thought  evaluation  internal assurance
With the fading of rapture I remained in equanimity mindful  alert and physically sensitive of pleasure
I entered  remained in the third jhana of which the Noble Ones declare 'Equanimous  mindful he has a pleasant abiding' With the abandoning of pleasure  pain  as with the earlier disappearance of elation  distress  I entered  remained in the fourth jhana purity of equanimity  mindfulness neither pleasure nor pain
When the mind was thus concentrated purified bright unblemished rid of defilement pliant malleable steady  attained to imperturbability I directed it to the knowledge of recollecting my past lives
I recollected my manifold past lives ie one birth two five ten fifty a hundred a thousand a hundred thousand many eons of cosmic contraction many eons of cosmic expansion many eons of cosmic contraction  expansion 'There I had such a name belonged to such a clan had such an appearance
Such was my food such my experience of pleasure  pain such the end of my life
Passing away from that state I rearose there
There too I had such a name belonged to such a clan had such an appearance
Such was my food such my experience of pleasure  pain such the end of my life
Passing away from that state I rearose here' Thus I remembered my manifold past lives in their modes  details
This was the first knowledge I attained in the first watch of the night
Ignorance was destroyed knowledge arose darkness was destroyed light arose  as happens in one who is heedful ardent  resolute
When the mind was thus concentrated  attained to imperturbability I directed it to the knowledge of the passing away  reappearance of beings
I saw  by means of the divine eye purified  surpassing the human  beings passing away  reappearing and I discerned how they are inferior  superior beautiful  ugly fortunate  unfortunate in accordance with their kamma 'These beings  who were endowed with bad conduct of body speech  mind who reviled the Noble Ones held wrong views and undertook actions under the influence of wrong views  with the breakup of the body after death have reappeared in the plane of deprivation the bad destination the lower realms in hell
But these beings  who were endowed with good conduct of body speech  mind who did not revile the Noble Ones who held right views and undertook actions under the influence of right views  with the breakup of the body after death have reappeared in the good destinations in the heavenly world' Thus  by means of the divine eye purified  surpassing the human  I saw beings passing away  reappearing and I discerned how they are inferior  superior beautiful  ugly fortunate  unfortunate in accordance with their kamma
This was the second knowledge I attained in the second watch of the night
Ignorance was destroyed knowledge arose darkness was destroyed light arose  as happens in one who is heedful ardent  resolute
When the mind was thus concentrated purified bright unblemished rid of defilement pliant malleable steady  attained to imperturbability I directed it to the knowledge of the ending of mental fermentations
I discerned as it had come to be that 'This is stress This is the origination of stress This is the cessation of stress This is the way leading to the cessation of stress These are fermentations This is the origination of fermentations This is the cessation of fermentations This is the way leading to the cessation of fermentations' My heart thus knowing thus seeing was released from the fermentation of sensuality released from the fermentation of becoming released from the fermentation of ignorance
With release there was the knowledge 'Released' I discerned that 'Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task done
There is nothing further for this world'
This was the third knowledge I attained in the third watch of the night
Ignorance was destroyed knowledge arose darkness was destroyed light arose  as happens in one who is heedful ardent  resolute
Of course you are uncertain Kalamas
Of course you are doubtful
When there are reasons for doubt uncertainty is born
So in this case Kalamas don't go by reports by legends by traditions by scripture by conjecture by inference by analogies by agreement through pondering views by probability or by the thought 'This contemplative is our teacher' When you know for yourselves that 'These qualities are unskillful these qualities are blameworthy these qualities are criticized by the wise these qualities when adopted  carried out lead to harm  to suffering'  then you should abandon them
What do you think Kalamas when greed arises in a person does it arise for benefit or for harm
For harm lord
And this greedy person overcome by greed his mind possessed by greed doesn't he kill living beings take what is not given go after another person's wife tell lies and induce others to do likewise all of which is for longterm harm  suffering
Yes lord
So what do you think Kalamas are these qualities skillful or unskillful
Unskillful lord
Blameworthy or blameless
Blameworthy lord
Criticized by the wise or praised by the wise
Criticized by the wise lord
When adopted  carried out do they lead to harm  suffering or not
When adopted  carried out they lead to harm  to suffering Now Kalamas don't go by reports by legends by traditions by scripture by conjecture by inference by analogies by agreement through pondering views by probability or by the thought 'This contemplative is our teacher' When you know for yourselves that 'These qualities are skillful these qualities are blameless these qualities are praised by the wise these qualities when adopted  carried out lead to benefit  to happiness'  then you should enter  remain in them
What do you think Kalamas when lack of greed arises in a person does it arise for benefit or for harm
For benefit lord
And this ungreedy person not overcome by greed his mind not possessed by greed he doesn't kill living beings take what is not given go after another person's wife tell lies or induce others to do likewise all of which is for longterm benefit  happiness  right
Yes lord
So what do you think Kalamas are these qualities skillful or unskillful
Skillful lord
Blameworthy or blameless
Blameless lord
Criticized by the wise or praised by the wise
Praised by the wise lord
When adopted  carried out do they lead to benefit  to happiness or not
When adopted  carried out they lead to benefit  to happiness
The Buddha What do you think Rahula What is a mirror for
Rahula For reflection sir
The Buddha In the same way Rahula bodily acts verbal acts  mental acts are to be done with repeated reflection
Whenever you want to perform a bodily act you should reflect on it 'This bodily act I want to perform  would it lead to selfaffliction to the affliction of others or to both
Is it an unskillful bodily act with painful consequences painful results' If on reflection you know that it would lead to selfaffliction to the affliction of others or to both it would be an unskillful bodily act with painful consequences painful results then any bodily act of that sort is absolutely unfit for you to do
But if on reflection you know that it would not cause affliction it would be a skillful bodily act with happy consequences happy results then any bodily act of that sort is fit for you to do

While you are performing a bodily act you should reflect on it 'This bodily act I am doing  is it leading to selfaffliction to the affliction of others or to both
Is it an unskillful bodily act with painful consequences painful results' If on reflection you know that it is leading to selfaffliction to affliction of others or both you should give it up
But if on reflection you know that it is not you may continue with it

Having performed a bodily act you should reflect on it If on reflection you know that it led to selfaffliction to the affliction of others or to both it was an unskillful bodily act with painful consequences painful results then you should confess it reveal it lay it open to the Teacher or to a knowledgeable companion in the holy life
Having confessed it you should exercise restraint in the future
But if on reflection you know that it did not lead to affliction it was a skillful bodily act with happy consequences happy results then you should stay mentally refreshed  joyful training day  night in skillful mental qualities

Having performed a mental act you should reflect on it If on reflection you know that it led to selfaffliction to the affliction of others or to both it was an unskillful mental act with painful consequences painful results then you should feel horrified humiliated  disgusted with it
Feeling horrified you should exercise restraint in the future
But if on reflection you know that it did not lead to affliction it was a skillful mental act with happy consequences happy results then you should stay mentally refreshed  joyful training day  night in skillful mental qualities
Rahula all the brahmans  contemplatives in the course of the past who purified their bodily acts verbal acts  mental acts did it through repeated reflection on their bodily acts verbal acts  mental acts in just this way
All the brahmans  contemplatives in the course of the future All the brahmans  contemplatives at present who purify their bodily acts verbal acts  mental acts do it through repeated reflection on their bodily acts verbal acts  mental acts in just this way
So Rahula you should train yourself 'I will purify my bodily acts verbal acts my mental acts through repeated reflection' That's how you should train yourself
That is what the Blessed One said
Gratified Ven
Rahula delighted in the Blessed One's words
And what are the roots of unskillful things
Greed aversion delusion These are termed the roots of unskillful things
And what is skillful
Abstaining from taking life is skillful abstaining from taking what is not given from sexual misconduct from lying from abusive speech from divisive talebearing abstaining from idle chatter is skillful
Lack of covetousness lack of malevolence right views are skillful
These things are termed skillful
And what are the roots of skillful things
Lack of greed lack of aversion lack of delusion These are termed the roots of skillful things
And how is one made pure in three ways by bodily action
There is the case where a certain person abandoning the taking of life abstains from taking life
He dwells with his rod laid down his knife laid down scrupulous merciful compassionate for the benefit of all living beings
Abandoning the taking of what is not given he abstains from taking what is not given
He does not take in the manner of a thief things in a village or a wilderness that belong to others and have not been given by them
Abandoning illicit sex he abstains from illicit sex
He does not get sexually involved with those who are protected by their mothers their fathers their brothers their sisters their relatives or their Dhamma those with husbands those who entail punishments or even those crowned with flowers by another man
This is how one is made pure in three ways by bodily action
And how is one made pure in four ways by verbal action
There is the case where a certain person abandoning false speech abstains from false speech
When he has been called to a town meeting a group meeting a gathering of his relatives his guild or of the royalty if he is asked as a witness 'Come  tell good man what you know' If he doesn't know he says 'I don't know' If he does know he says 'I know' If he hasn't seen he says 'I haven't seen' If he has seen he says 'I have seen' Thus he doesn't consciously tell a lie for his own sake for the sake of another or for the sake of any reward
Abandoning false speech he abstains from false speech
He speaks the truth holds to the truth is firm reliable no deceiver of the world
Abandoning divisive speech he abstains from divisive speech
What he has heard here he does not tell there to break those people apart from these people here
What he has heard there he does not tell here to break these people apart from those people there
Thus reconciling those who have broken apart or cementing those who are united he loves concord delights in concord enjoys concord speaks things that create concord
Abandoning abusive speech he abstains from abusive speech
He speaks words that are soothing to the ear that are affectionate that go to the heart that are polite appealing  pleasing to people at large
Abandoning idle chatter he abstains from idle chatter
He speaks in season speaks what is factual what is in accordance with the goal the Dhamma  the Vinaya
He speaks words worth treasuring seasonable reasonable circumscribed connected with the goal
This is how one is made pure in four ways by verbal action
And how is one made pure in three ways by mental action
There is the case where a certain person is not covetous
He does not covet the belongings of others thinking 'O that what belongs to others would be mine' He bears no malevolence and is not corrupt in the resolves of his heart
'May these beings be free from animosity free from oppression free from trouble and may they look after themselves with ease' He has right view and is not warped in the way he sees things 'There is what is given what is offered what is sacrificed
There are fruits  results of good  bad actions
There is this world  the next world
There is mother  father
There are spontaneously reborn beings there are brahmans  contemplatives who faring rightly  practicing rightly proclaim this world  the next after having directly known  realized it for themselves' This is how one is made pure in three ways by mental action
These Cunda are the ten courses of skillful action
When a person is endowed with these ten courses of skillful action then even if he gets up at the proper time from his bed and touches the earth he is still pure
If he doesn't touch the earth he is still pure
If he touches wet cow dung he is still pure
If he doesn't touch wet cow dung he is still pure
If he touches green grass If he doesn't touch green grass If he worships a fire If he doesn't worship a fire If he pays homage to the sun with clasped hands If he doesn't pay homage to the sun with clasped hands If he goes down into the water three times by nightfall If he doesn't go down into the water three times by nightfall he is still pure
Why is that
Because these ten courses of skillful action are pure and cause purity
Furthermore as a result of being endowed with these ten courses of skillful action the devas is declared human beings is declared  that or any other good destination
A person endowed with three things is to be recognized as a fool
Which three
Bodily misconduct verbal misconduct mental misconduct
A person endowed with three things is to be recognized as a wise person
Which three
Good bodily conduct good verbal conduct good mental conduct
Thus monks you should train yourselves 'We will avoid the three things that endowed with which one is to be recognized as a fool
We will undertake  maintain the three things that endowed with which one is to be recognized as a wise person' That's how you should train yourselves
Now as for the course of action that is unpleasant to do and that when done leads to what is unprofitable one considers it as not worth doing for both reasons because the course of action is unpleasant to do and because the course of action when done leads to what is unprofitable
As for the course of action that is unpleasant to do but that when done leads to what is profitable it's in light of this course of action that one may be known as a wise person or a fool
For a fool doesn't reflect 'Even though this course of action is unpleasant to do still when it is done it leads to what is profitable' So he doesn't do it and thus the nondoing of that course of action leads to what is unprofitable for him
But a wise person reflects 'Even though this course of action is unpleasant to do still when it is done it leads to what is profitable' So he does it and thus the doing of that course of action leads to what is profitable for him
As for the course of action that is pleasant to do but that when done leads to what is unprofitable it's in light of this course of action that one may be known as a wise person or a fool
For a fool doesn't reflect 'Even though this course of action is pleasant to do still when it is done it leads to what is unprofitable' So he does it and thus the doing of that course of action leads to what is unprofitable for him
But a wise person reflects 'Even though this course of action is pleasant to do still when it is done it leads to what is unprofitable' So he doesn't do it and thus the nondoing of that course of action leads to what is profitable for him
As for the course of action that is pleasant to do and that when done leads to what is profitable one considers it as worth doing for both reasons because the course of action is pleasant to do and because the course of action when done leads to what is profitable
These are the four courses of action
Intention I tell you is kamma
Intending one does kamma by way of body speech  intellect
And what is the cause by which kamma comes into play
Contact
And what is the diversity in kamma
There is kamma to be experienced in hell kamma to be experienced in the realm of common animals kamma to be experienced in the realm of the hungry shades kamma to be experienced in the human world kamma to be experienced in the heavenly worlds
And what is the result of kamma
The result of kamma is of three sorts I tell you that which arises right here  now that which arises later and that which arises following that
And what is the cessation of kamma
From the cessation of contact is the cessation of kamma and just this noble eightfold path  right view right resolve right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness right concentration  is the path of practice leading to the cessation of kamma
Now when a noble disciple discerns kamma in this way the cause by which kamma comes into play in this way the diversity of kamma in this way the result of kamma in this way the cessation of kamma in this way  the path of practice leading to the cessation of kamma in this way then he discerns this penetrative holy life as the cessation of kamma
And why do you call it 'feeling'
Because it feels thus it is called 'feeling' What does it feel
It feels pleasure it feels pain it feels neitherpleasurenorpain
Because it feels it is called feeling
And why do you call it 'perception'
Because it perceives thus it is called 'perception' What does it perceive
It perceives blue it perceives yellow it perceives red it perceives white
Because it perceives it is called perception
And why do you call them 'fabrications'
Because they fabricate fabricated things thus they are called 'fabrications' What do they fabricate as a fabricated thing
From formness they fabricate form as a fabricated thing
From feelingness they fabricate feeling as a fabricated thing
From perceptionhoodFrom fabricationhoodFrom consciousnesshood they fabricate consciousness as a fabricated thing
Because they fabricate fabricated things they are called fabrications
And why do you call it 'consciousness'
Because it cognizes thus it is called consciousness
What does it cognize
It cognizes what is sour bitter pungent sweet alkaline nonalkaline salty  unsalty
Because it cognizes it is called consciousness
And what is right view
Right view I tell you is of two sorts There is right view with fermentations siding with merit resulting in the acquisitions and there is noble right view without fermentations transcendent a factor of the path
And what is the right view that has fermentations sides with merit  results in acquisitions
'There is what is given what is offered what is sacrificed
There are fruits  results of good  bad actions
There is this world  the next world
There is mother  father
There are spontaneously reborn beings there are brahmans  contemplatives who faring rightly  practicing rightly proclaim this world  the next after having directly known  realized it for themselves' This is the right view that has fermentations sides with merit  results in acquisitions
And what is new kamma
Whatever kamma one does now with the body with speech or with the intellect
This is called new kamma
The Buddha There are cases where some feelings arise based on bile
You yourself should know how some feelings arise based on bile
Even the world is agreed on how some feelings arise based on bile
So any brahmans  contemplatives who are of the doctrine  view that whatever an individual feels  pleasure pain neitherpleasurenorpain  is entirely caused by what was done before  slip past what they themselves know slip past what is agreed on by the world
Therefore I say that those brahmans  contemplatives are wrong
There are cases where some feelings arise based on phlegm based on internal winds based on a combination of bodily humors from the change of the seasons from uneven care of the body from attacks from the result of kamma
You yourself should know how some feelings arise from the result of kamma
Even the world is agreed on how some feelings arise from the result of kamma
So any brahmans  contemplatives who are of the doctrine  view that whatever an individual feels  pleasure pain neither pleasurenorpain  is entirely caused by what was done before  slip past what they themselves know slip past what is agreed on by the world
Therefore I say that those brahmans  contemplatives are wrong
Now there is the case where a certain person is seen garlanded  adorned freshly bathed  groomed with hair  beard trimmed enjoying the sensualities of women as if he were a king
They ask about him 'My good man what has this man done that he has been garlanded  adorned as if he were a king' They answer 'My good man this man attacked the king's enemy and took his life
The king gratified with him rewarded him
That is why he is garlanded  adorned as if he were a king'
Then there is the case where a certain person is seen bound with a stout rope with his arms pinned tightly against his back his head shaved bald marched to a harshsounding drum from street to street crossroads to crossroads evicted through the south gate and beheaded to the south of the city
They ask about him 'My good man what has this man done that he is bound with a stout rope and beheaded to the south of the city' They answer 'My good man this man an enemy of the king has taken the life of a man or a woman
That is why the rulers having had him seized inflicted such a punishment upon him'
Now what do you think headman have you ever seen or heard of such a case
I have seen this lord have heard of it and will hear of it
So headman when those brahmans  contemplatives who hold a doctrine and view like this say 'All those who kill living beings experience pain  distress in the here  now' do they speak truthfully or falsely  Falsely lord
And those who babble empty falsehood are they moral or immoral
Immoral lord
And those who are immoral and of evil character are they practicing wrongly or rightly  Wrongly lord
And those who are practicing wrongly do they hold wrong view or right view  Wrong view lord
And is it proper to place confidence in those who hold wrong view
No lord

Nigantha Nataputta teaches the Dhamma to his disciples in this way lord 'All those who take life are destined for the plane of deprivation are destined for hell
All those who steal All those who indulge in illicit sex All those who tell lies are destined for the plane of deprivation are destined for hell
Whatever one keeps doing frequently by that is one led' That's how Nigantha Nataputta teaches the Dhamma to his disciples
If it's true that 'Whatever one keeps doing frequently by that is one led' then no one is destined for the plane of deprivation or destined to hell in line with Nigantha Nataputta's words
What do you think headman If a man is one who takes life then taking into consideration time spent doing  not doing whether by day or by night which time is more the time he spends taking life or the time he spends not taking life
 the time he spends taking life is less lord and the time he spends not taking life is certainly more
If it's true that 'Whatever one keeps doing frequently by that is one led' then no one is destined for the plane of deprivation or destined to hell in line with Nigantha Nataputta's words
What do you think headman If a man is one who steals indulges in illicit sex tells lies then taking into consideration time spent doing  not doing whether by day or by night which time is more the time he spends telling lies or the time he spends not telling lies

I too am destined for the plane of deprivation am destined for hell' He fastens onto that view
If he doesn't abandon that doctrine doesn't abandon that state of mind doesn't relinquish that view then as if he were to be carried off he would thus be placed in hell
 'Our teacher holds this doctrine holds this view 'All those who steal All those who indulge in illicit sex All those who tell lies are destined for the plane of deprivation are destined for hell' There are lies that I have told

A disciple has faith in that teacher and reflects 'The Blessed One in a variety of ways criticizes  censures the taking of life and says Abstain from taking life There are living beings that I have killed to a greater or lesser extent
That was not right
That was not good
But if I become remorseful for that reason that evil deed of mine will not be undone' So reflecting thus he abandons right then the taking of life and in the future refrains from taking life
This is how there comes to be the abandoning of that evil deed
This is how there comes to be the transcending of that evil deed
 'The Blessed One in a variety of ways criticizes  censures stealing indulging in illicit sex the telling of lies and says Abstain from the telling of lies There are lies I have told to a greater or lesser extent

This is how there comes to be the abandoning of that evil deed
This is how there comes to be the transcending of that evil deed
Having abandoned the taking of life he refrains from taking life he refrains from stealing he refrains from illicit sex he refrains from lies he refrains from divisive speech he refrains from abusive speech he refrains from idle chatter
Having abandoned covetousness he becomes uncovetous

And what is kamma that is dark with dark result
There is the case where a certain person fabricates an injurious bodily fabrication an injurious verbal fabrication an injurious mental fabrication He rearises in an injurious world where he is touched by injurious contacts He experiences feelings that are exclusively painful like those of the beings in hell

And what is kamma that is neither dark nor bright with neither dark nor bright result leading to the ending of kamma
The intention right there to abandon this kamma that is dark with dark result this kamma that is bright with bright result this kamma that is dark  bright with dark  bright result
This is called kamma that is neither dark nor bright with neither dark nor bright result leading to the ending of kamma
A related discourse repeats most of the above defining dark kamma with dark result with the following example
There is the case of a certain person who kills living beings steals what is not given engages in illicit sex tells lies and drinks fermented  distilled liquors that are the basis for heedlessness and bright kamma with bright result with the following example There is the case of a certain person who abstains from killing living beings abstains from stealing what is not given abstains from engaging in illicit sex abstains from telling lies and abstains from drinking fermented  distilled liquors that are the basis for heedlessness
These are three causes for the origination of actions
Now these three are causes for the origination of actions
Which three
Nongreed is a cause for the origination of actions
Nonaversion is a cause for the origination of actions
Nondelusion is a cause for the origination of actions
Any action performed with nongreed  born of nongreed caused by nongreed originating from nongreed When greed is gone that action is thus abandoned its root destroyed made like a palmyra stump deprived of the conditions of development not destined for future arising
Just as when seeds are not broken not rotten not damaged by wind  heat capable of sprouting wellburied planted in wellprepared soil and a man would burn them with fire and burning them with fire would make them into fine ashes
Having made them into fine ashes he would winnow them before a high wind or wash them away in a swiftflowing stream
Those seeds would thus be destroyed at the root made like a palmyra stump deprived of the conditions of development not destined for future arising
In the same way any action performed with nongreed performed with nonaversion performed with nondelusion  born of nondelusion caused by nondelusion originating from nondelusion When delusion is gone that action is thus abandoned its root destroyed made like a palmyra stump deprived of the conditions of development not destined for future arising
These monks are three causes for the origination of action

Very well then headman I will question you on this matter
Answer as you see fit
Suppose a man were to throw a large boulder into a deep lake of water and a great crowd of people gathering  congregating would pray praise  circumambulate with their hands palmtopalm over the heart 'Rise up O boulder
Come floating up O boulder
Come float to the shore O boulder' What do you think would that boulder  because of the prayers praise  circumambulation of that great crowd of people  rise up come floating up or come float to the shore
No lord
So it is with any man who takes life steals indulges in illicit sex is a liar one who speaks divisive speech abusive speech  idle chatter is covetous malevolent  holds to wrong views
Even though a great crowd of people gathering  congregating would pray praise  circumambulate with their hands palmtopalm over the heart  'May this man at the breakup of the body after death reappear in a good destination the heavenly world'  still at the breakup of the body after death he would reappear in destitution a bad destination the lower realms hell
Now suppose a man were to throw a jar of ghee or a jar of oil into a deep lake of water where it would break
There the shards  jarfragments would go down while the ghee or oil would come up
Then a great crowd of people gathering  congregating would pray praise  circumambulate with their hands palmtopalm over the heart 'Sink O gheeoil
Submerge O gheeoil
Go down O gheeoil' What do you think would that gheeoil because of the prayers praise  circumambulation of that great crowd of people sink submerge or go down

Greed itself is unskillful
Whatever a greedy person fabricates by means of body speech or intellect that too is unskillful
Whatever suffering a greedy person  his mind overcome with greed his mind consumed  wrongly inflicts on another person through beating or imprisonment or confiscation or placing blame or banishment 'I have power
I want power' that too is unskillful
Thus it is that many evil unskillful qualitiesevents  born of greed caused by greed originated through greed conditioned by greed  come into play
And a person like this is called one who speaks at the wrong time speaks what is unfactual speaks what is irrelevant speaks contrary to the Dhamma speaks contrary to the Vinaya
Why
Because of having wrongly inflicted suffering on another person through beating or imprisonment or confiscation or placing blame or banishment 'I have power
I want power' When told what is factual he denies it and doesn't acknowledge it
When told what is unfactual he doesn't make an ardent effort to untangle it 'This is unfactual
This is baseless' That's why a person like this is called one who speaks at the wrong time speaks what is unfactual speaks what is irrelevant speaks contrary to the Dhamma speaks contrary to the Vinaya
A person like this  his mind overcome with evil unskillful qualities born of greed born of aversion born of delusion his mind consumed  dwells in suffering right in the herenow  feeling threatened turbulent feverish  and at the breakup of the body after death can expect a bad destination
Just as a sal tree a birch or an aspen when smothered  surrounded by three parasitic vines falls into misfortune falls into disaster falls into misfortune  disaster in the same way a person like this  his mind overcome with evil unskillful qualities born of greed born of aversion born of delusion his mind consumed  dwells in suffering right in the herenow  feeling threatened turbulent feverish  and at the breakup of the body after death can expect a bad destination
There is one quality great king that keeps both kinds of benefits secure  those pertaining to the present life  those to the future life
But what lord is that one quality
Heedfulness great king
Just as the footprints of all living beings with legs can be encompassed by the footprint of the elephant and the elephant's footprint is declared to be supreme among them in terms of its great size in the same way heedfulness is the one quality that keeps both kinds of benefits secure  those in the present life  those in the future life
That is what the Blessed One said
Having said that the One WellGone the Teacher said further
And what is the path of practice leading to the cessation of kamma
Just this noble eightfold path This is called the path of practice leading to the cessation of kamma
And what is right view
Knowledge in terms of stress knowledge in terms of the origination of stress knowledge in terms of the cessation of stress knowledge in terms of the way of practice leading to the cessation of stress
And what is right resolve
Being resolved on renunciation on freedom from malevolence on harmlessness
And what is right speech
Abstaining from lying abstaining from divisive speech abstaining from abusive speech abstaining from idle chatter
And what is right action
Abstaining from taking life abstaining from stealing abstaining from illicit sex
And what is right livelihood
There is the case where a noble disciple having abandoned dishonest livelihood keeps his life going with right livelihood
And what is right effort
There is the case where a monk generates desire endeavors activates persistence upholds  exerts his intent for the sake of the nonarising of evil unskillful qualities that have not yet arisen
He generates desire endeavors activates persistence upholds  exerts his intent for the sake of the abandonment of evil unskillful qualities that have arisen
He generates desire endeavors activates persistence upholds  exerts his intent for the sake of the arising of skillful qualities that have not yet arisen
He generates desire endeavors activates persistence upholds  exerts his intent for the maintenance nonconfusion increase plenitude development  culmination of skillful qualities that have arisen
And what is right mindfulness
There is the case where a monk remains focused on the body in  of itself  ardent aware  mindful  putting away greed  distress with reference to the world
He remains focused on feelings in  of themselves  ardent aware  mindful  putting away greed  distress with reference to the world
He remains focused on the mind in  of itself  ardent aware  mindful  putting away greed  distress with reference to the world
He remains focused on mental qualities in  of themselves  ardent aware  mindful  putting away greed  distress with reference to the world
And what is right concentration
There is the case where a monk  quite withdrawn from sensuality withdrawn from unskillful qualities  enters  remains in the first jhana rapture  pleasure born from withdrawal accompanied by directed thought  evaluation
With the stilling of directed thoughts  evaluations he enters  remains in the second jhana rapture  pleasure born of concentration unification of awareness free from directed thought  evaluation  internal assurance
With the fading of rapture he remains equanimous mindful  alert and senses pleasure with the body
He enters  remains in the third jhana of which the Noble Ones declare 'Equanimous  mindful he has a pleasant abiding' With the abandoning of pleasure  pain  as with the earlier disappearance of elation  distress  he enters  remains in the fourth jhana purity of equanimity  mindfulness neither pleasure nor pain
This monks is called right concentration
This is how he attends inappropriately 'Was I in the past
Was I not in the past
What was I in the past
How was I in the past
Having been what what was I in the past
Shall I be in the future
Shall I not be in the future
What shall I be in the future
How shall I be in the future
Having been what what shall I be in the future' Or else he is inwardly perplexed about the immediate present 'Am I
Am I not
What am I
How am I
Where has this being come from
Where is it bound'
As he attends inappropriately in this way one of six kinds of view arises in him The view I have a self arises in him as true  established or the view I have no self or the view It is precisely by means of self that I perceive self or the view It is precisely by means of self that I perceive notself or the view It is precisely by means of notself that I perceive self arises in him as true  established or else he has a view like this This very self of mine  the knower that is sensitive here  there to the ripening of good  bad actions  is the self of mine that is constant everlasting eternal not subject to change and will endure as long as eternity
This is called a thicket of views a wilderness of views a contortion of views a writhing of views a fetter of views
Bound by a fetter of views the uninstructed runofthemill person is not freed from birth aging  death from sorrow lamentation pain distress  despair
He is not freed I tell you from suffering  stress
The wellinstructed noble disciple  who has regard for noble ones is wellversed  disciplined in their Dhamma who has regard for men of integrity is wellversed  disciplined in their Dhamma  discerns what ideas are fit for attention and what ideas are unfit for attention
This being so he does not attend to ideas unfit for attention and attends to ideas fit for attention
He attends appropriately This is stress This is the origination of stress This is the cessation of stress This is the way leading to the cessation of stress
As he attends appropriately in this way three fetters are abandoned in him identityview doubt and grasping at precepts  practices
These are called the fermentations to be abandoned by seeing
Then the Blessed One having encompassed with his awareness the awareness of that monk addressed the monks It's possible that a foolish man  his awareness immersed in ignorance  governed by craving  might think that the Teacher's message can be slipped past in this way 'It seems then that form is notself feeling perception fabrications consciousness is notself
So what self will be touched by the actions done by what is notself' Haven't I counterquestioned  trained you with regard to each of these phenomena
What do you think monks is form constant or inconstant Inconstant lord And is that which is inconstant easeful or stressful Stressful lord And is it fitting to regard what is inconstant stressful subject to change as 'This is mine
This is my self
This is what I am' No lord
 Is feeling constant or inconstant Inconstant lord
 Is perception constant or inconstant Inconstant lord
 Are fabrications constant or inconstant Inconstant lord
What do you think monks  Is consciousness constant or inconstant Inconstant lord And is that which is inconstant easeful or stressful Stressful lord And is it fitting to regard what is inconstant stressful subject to change as 'This is mine
This is my self
This is what I am' No lord
Thus monks any form whatsoever that is past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or near every form is to be seen as it actually is with right discernment as 'This is not mine
This is not my self
This is not what I am'
Any feeling Any perception Any fabrications
Any consciousness whatsoever that is past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or near every consciousness is to be seen as it actually is with right discernment as 'This is not mine
This is not my self
This is not what I am'
Seeing thus the instructed noble disciple grows disenchanted with form disenchanted with feeling disenchanted with perception disenchanted with fabrications disenchanted with consciousness
Disenchanted he becomes dispassionate
Through dispassion he is fully released
With full release there is the knowledge 'Fully released' He discerns that 'Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task done
There is nothing further for this world'
The Buddha  'The one who acts is the same one who experiences' is one extreme
The brahman Then Master Gotama is the one who acts someone other than the one who experiences
The Buddha  'The one who acts is someone other than the one who experiences' is the second extreme
Avoiding both of these extremes the Tathagata teaches the Dhamma by means of the middle
From ignorance as a requisite condition come fabrications
From fabrications as a requisite condition comes consciousness
From consciousness as a requisite condition comes nameform
From nameform as a requisite condition come the six sense media
From the six sense media as a requisite condition comes contact
From contact as a requisite condition comes feeling
From feeling as a requisite condition comes craving
From craving as a requisite condition comes clingingsustenance
From clingingsustenance as a requisite condition comes becoming
From becoming as a requisite condition comes birth
From birth as a requisite condition then aging  death sorrow lamentation pain distress  despair come into play
Such is the origination of this entire mass of stress  suffering
Now from the remainderless fading  cessation of that very ignorance comes the cessation of fabrications
From the cessation of fabrications comes the cessation of consciousness
From the cessation of consciousness comes the cessation of nameform the cessation of the six sense media the cessation of contact the cessation of feeling the cessation of craving cessation of clingingsustenance the cessation of becoming the cessation of birth
From the cessation of birth then aging  death sorrow lamentation pain distress  despair all cease
Such is the cessation of this entire mass of stress  suffering
When this was said a certain monk said to the Blessed One Which aging  death lord
And to whom does this aging  death belong
Not a valid question the Blessed One said
If a monk were to ask 'Which aging  death
And to whom does this aging  death belong' and if a monk were to ask 'Is aging  death one thing and does it belong to someonesomething else' both of them would have the same meaning even though their words would differ
When a monk is of the view that the soul is the same as the body there is no leading the holy life
And when a monk is of the view that the soul is one thing and the body another there is no leading the holy life
Avoiding these two extremes the Tathagata points out the Dhamma in between them From birth as a requisite condition comes aging  death
Which birth lord
And to whom does this birth belong
Not a valid question the Blessed One said
Avoiding these two extremes the Tathagata points out the Dhamma in between them From ignorance as a requisite condition come fabrications
Now from the remainderless fading  cessation of that very ignorance every one of these writhings  wrigglings  wigglings  'Which aging  death
And to whom does this aging  death belong' or 'Is aging  death one thing and does it belong to someonesomething else' or 'The soul is the same as the body' or 'The soul is one thing and the body another'  are abandoned their root destroyed made like a palmyra stump deprived of the conditions of development not destined for future arising
Or he doesn't assume form to be the self but he assumes the self as possessing form form as in the self self as in form
Now that assumption is a fabrication
What is the cause of that fabrication
To an uninstructed runofthemill person touched by the feeling born of contact with ignorance craving arises
That fabrication is born of that
And that fabrication is inconstant fabricated dependently coarisen
That craving That feeling That contact That ignorance is inconstant fabricated dependently coarisen
It is by knowing  seeing in this way that one without delay puts an end to the fermentations
Or he may have a view such as this This self is the same as the cosmos
This I will be after death constant lasting eternal not subject to change This eternalist view is a fabrication Or he may have a view such as this I would not be neither would there be what is mine
I will not be neither will there be what is mine This annihilationist view is a fabrication Or he may be doubtful  uncertain having come to no conclusion with regard to the true Dhamma
That doubt uncertainty  comingtonoconclusion is a fabrication
What is the cause of that fabrication
To an uninstructed runofthemill person touched by what is felt born of contact with ignorance craving arises
That fabrication is born of that
And that fabrication is inconstant fabricated dependently coarisen
That craving That feeling That contact That ignorance is inconstant fabricated dependently coarisen
It is by knowing  seeing in this way that one without delay puts an end to the fermentations
Venerable sirs I don't know entirely what views the Blessed One has
Well well
So you don't know entirely what views Gotama the contemplative has
Then tell us what views the monks have
I don't even know entirely what views the monks have
So you don't know entirely what views Gotama the contemplative has or even that the monks have
Then tell us what views you have
It wouldn't be difficult for me to expound to you what views I have
But please let the venerable ones expound each in line with his position and then it won't be difficult for me to expound to you what views I have
When this had been said one of the wanderers said to Anathapindika the householder The cosmos is eternal
Only this is true anything otherwise is worthless
This is the sort of view I have
Another wanderer said to Anathapindika The cosmos is not eternal
Only this is true anything otherwise is worthless
This is the sort of view I have
Another wanderer said The cosmos is finite The cosmos is infinite The soul  the body are the same The soul is one thing and the body another After death a Tathagata exists After death a Tathagata does not exist After death a Tathagata both does  does not exist After death a Tathagata neither does nor does not exist
Only this is true anything otherwise is worthless
This is the sort of view I have
When this had been said Anathapindika the householder said to the wanderers As for the venerable one who says 'The cosmos is eternal
Only this is true anything otherwise is worthless
This is the sort of view I have' his view arises from his own inappropriate attention or in dependence on the words of another
Now this view has been brought into being is fabricated willed dependently coarisen
Whatever has been brought into being is fabricated willed dependently coarisen that is inconstant
Whatever is inconstant is stress
This venerable one thus adheres to that very stress submits himself to that very stress 
When this had been said the wanderers said to Anathapindika the householder We have each  every one expounded to you in line with our own positions
Now tell us what views you have
Whatever has been brought into being is fabricated willed dependently coarisen that is inconstant
Whatever is inconstant is stress
Whatever is stress is not mine is not what I am is not my self
This is the sort of view I have
So householder whatever has been brought into being is fabricated willed dependently coarisen that is inconstant
Whatever is inconstant is stress
You thus adhere to that very stress submit yourself to that very stress
Venerable sirs whatever has been brought into being is fabricated willed dependently coarisen that is inconstant
Whatever is inconstant is stress
Whatever is stress is not mine is not what I am is not my self
Having seen this well with right discernment as it actually is present I also discern the higher escape from it as it actually is present
When this had been said the wanderers fell silent abashed sitting with their shoulders drooping their heads down brooding at a loss for words
Anathapindika the householder perceiving that the wanderers were silent abashed at a loss for words got up  left
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Sāvatthī at Jeta's Grove Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery
And on that occasion there were many contemplatives brahmans  wanderers of various sects living around Sāvatthī with differing views differing opinions differing beliefs dependent for support on their differing views
Some of the contemplatives  brahmans held this doctrine this view The cosmos is eternal
Only this is true anything otherwise is worthless
Some of the contemplatives  brahmans held this doctrine this view The cosmos is not eternal The cosmos is finite The cosmos is infinite The soul is the same thing as the body The soul is one thing and the body another After death a Tathāgata exists After death a Tathāgata does not exist After death a Tathāgata both exists  does not exist After death a Tathāgata neither exists nor does not exist
Only this is true anything otherwise is worthless
And they kept on arguing quarreling  disputing wounding one another with weapons of the mouth saying The Dhamma is like this it's not like that
The Dhamma's not like that it's like this
Then in the early morning a large number of monks adjusted their under robes and  carrying their bowls  robes  went into Sāvatthī for alms
Having gone for alms in Sāvatthī after the meal returning from their alms round they went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side
As they were sitting there they said to the Blessed One Lord there are many contemplatives brahmans  wanderers of various sects living around Sāvatthī with differing views differing opinions differing beliefs dependent for support on their differing views And they keep on arguing quarreling  disputing wounding one another with weapons of the mouth saying 'The Dhamma is like this it's not like that
The Dhamma's not like that it's like this' Monks the wanderers of other sects are blind  eyeless
They don't know what is beneficial and what is harmful
They don't know what is the Dhamma and what is nonDhamma
Not knowing what is beneficial and what is harmful not knowing what is Dhamma and what is nonDhamma they keep on arguing quarreling  disputing wounding one another with weapons of the mouth saying 'The Dhamma is like this it's not like that
The Dhamma's not like that it's like this'
Once monks in this same Sāvatthī there was a certain king and the king said to a certain man 'Come my good man
Gather together all the people in Sāvatthī who have been blind from birth' Responding 'As you say your majesty' to the king the man  having rounded up all the people in Sāvatthī who had been blind from birth  went to the king and on arrival said 'Your majesty the people in Sāvatthī who have been blind from birth have been gathered together'
'Very well then I say show the blind people an elephant'
Responding 'As you say your majesty' to the king the man showed the blind people an elephant
To some of the blind people he showed the elephant's head saying 'This blind people is what an elephant is like' To some of them he showed the elephant's ear saying 'This blind people is what an elephant is like' To some of them he showed the elephant's tusk the elephant's trunk the elephant's body the elephant's foot the elephant's hindquarters the elephant's tail the tuft at the end of the elephant's tail saying 'This blind people is what an elephant is like'
Then having shown the blind people the elephant the man went to the king and on arrival said 'Your majesty the blind people have seen the elephant
May your majesty do what you think it is now time to do'
Then the king went to the blind people and on arrival asked them 'Blind people have you seen the elephant'
'Yes your majesty
We have seen the elephant'
'Now tell me blind people what the elephant is like'
The blind people who had been shown the elephant's head said 'The elephant your majesty is just like a jar'
Those who had been shown the elephant's ear said 'The elephant your majesty is just like a winnowing basket'
Those who had been shown the elephant's tusk said 'The elephant your majesty is just like plowshare'
Those who had been shown the elephant's trunk said 'The elephant your majesty is just like the pole of a plow'
Those who had been shown the elephant's body said 'The elephant your majesty is just like a granary'
Those who had been shown the elephant's foot said 'The elephant your majesty is just like a post'
Those who had been shown the elephant's hindquarters said 'The elephant your majesty is just like a mortar'
Those who had been shown the elephant's tail said 'The elephant your majesty is just like a pestle'
Those who had been shown the tuft at the end of the elephant's tail said 'The elephant your majesty is just like a broom'
Saying 'The elephant is like this it's not like that
The elephant's not like that it's like this' they struck one another with their fists
That gratified the king
In the same way monks the wanderers of other sects are blind  eyeless
They don't know what is beneficial and what is harmful
They don't know what is the Dhamma and what is nonDhamma
Not knowing what is beneficial and what is harmful not knowing what is Dhamma and what is nonDhamma they keep on arguing quarreling  disputing wounding one another with weapons of the mouth saying 'The Dhamma is like this it's not like that
The Dhamma's not like that it's like this' Then on realizing the significance of that the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed
This book contains two sets of newly revised Dhamma talks
The edition of Amata Dhamma has been completely revised and has new additions including its new title To the Last Breath
Directions for Insight  the second part of this book  was only slightly revised although it now has its proper title back which somehow had become lost in the first printing

As Acharn Panyavaddho explained in the introduction he wrote for the Amata Dhamma  of these talks were given for the benefit of Mrs
Powpanga Vathanakul who had been staying in Wat Pa Bahn Tahd Udornthani Thailand since the beginning of November
The other talk The Middle Way was actually given to the assembly of bhikkhus at the Wat in and was one which Mrs
Powpanga found useful She stayed at Wat Pa Bahn Tahd for almost four months and Ven
Acharn Maha Boowa gave about talks during that period
The second part of this collection Directions for Insight seems to fit in well with the general approach of To the Last Breath
It is made up of six Dhamma Talks by Acharn Kor Khaosuanluang
Khun Phoon Phongphanit a lay disciple of Acharn Kor suggested a joint translation of these six Dhamma talks originally printed under the title Na Naew Mong Darn Ny
They form one booklet of a series printed over the years by Upasika Kee Nanayon who used the pen name Kor Khaosuanluang
Khun Phoon Phongphanit should receive special thanks for all his work in seeing that translation into print
The first translation of To the Last Breath was mainly the work of Ven
Bhikkhu Aj
The present editor who also assisted at that time has now completely revised the whole translation and so must bear responsibility for the errors
Any merit arising from my work on this book may it be dedicated to my mother
May she find peace and happiness
Anyone who has visited the forest monasteries of Thailand will need no introduction
They will have seen Acharns who teach in a spontaneous and direct way and who live as they teach
This is Forest Dhamma vigorous but without pretension inspiring one to live and practice the Way rather than reading about it
Yet here is a book  and a translation of a book at that  that can only attempt to offer a partial view of certain aspects of that Teaching
This is especially so with the first part of this collection of Dhamma talks To the Last Breath
For these were given under quite special circumstances A person quite knowledgeable about Buddhism is dying of cancer
The emphasis is therefore very much on dealing with pain suffering and finally death
And pointing towards that which is beyond suffering and death
These circumstances mean that the beginning fundamentals of Dhamma practice are generally assumed to be already understood
For those new to Dhamma however it is important to remember the special context and to take into account the other Dhamma qualities that make an essential foundation that will need to be cultivated
The Lord Buddha gave an important example of this when he would begin his Dhamma Teaching with the Progressive or Graduated Sermon
Then the Lord delivered a graduated discourse to 'Kutadanta' on generosity on morality and on heaven showing the danger degradation and corruption of sensedesires and the profit of renunciation
And when the Lord knew that Kutadanta's mind was ready pliable free from the hindrances joyful and calm then he preached a sermon on Dhamma in brief on suffering its origin its cessation and the path 
It is this 'joyful calm pliable ready mind'  already settled firmly upon foundations of generosity and morality  that is receptive to the powerful Truths about pain suffering and death
It is at this point that the emphasis changes to energetic striving to overcoming the obstacles that prevent insight and pin us blindly to the wheel of birth and death
Then the Lord said to the monks 'Now monks I declare to you all conditioned things are of a nature to decay  strive on untiringly' These were the Tathagata's last words 
In this book you will find both these aspects
There are constant references to 'gradually' 'steadily' 'step by step' 'level by level'
These lead into a growing emphasis on earnestness and diligence in practice
Any translation is the impossible search for just the right word
The expression that conveys both the sense and accuracy in a pleasing way and that also brings with it the spirit of the original
This translation is much more of a blind groping
First there is the wide language and cultural gap between Thai and English
Then there is the change of medium from the living word to the printed page which must always lose the dynamism of the original experience
Finally and perhaps the most important point there is the great profundity of Dhamma which is really beyond the translators' level of understanding
The reader will therefore need to make due allowance for the deficiencies in this translation effort
The only way truly to understand is to translate it back into your own life your own experience and practice
Even with its errors and inadequacies this book is the result of a great effort by many people
It will have all been worth while if a single person finds some truth in it that can help him or her face up to their situation their illness and pain
Insight into that suffering may they go beyond a mere book's description to true liberation
Venerable Acharn Maha Boowa was born in Udornthani Northeast Thailand in
He became a monk in the customary way at a local monastery and went on to study the Pali language and texts
At this time he also started to meditate but had not yet found a suitable Teacher
Then he caught sight of the Ven
Acharn Mun and immediately felt that this was someone really special someone who obviously had achieved something from his Dhamma practice
After finishing his Grade Three Pali studies he therefore left the study monastery and followed Ven
Acharn Mun into the forests of NE
Thailand
When he caught up with Ven
Acharn Mun he was told to put his academic knowledge to one side and concentrate on meditation
And that was what he did
He often went into solitary retreat in the mountains and jungle but always returned for help and advice from Ven
Acharn Mun
He stayed with Ven
Acharn Mun for seven years right until the Ven
Acharn's passing away
The vigour and uncompromising determination of his Dhamma practice attracted other monks dedicated to meditation and this eventually resulted in the founding of Wat Pa Bahn Tahd in some forest near the village where he was born
This enabled his mother to come and live as a nun at the monastery
Ven
Acharn Maha Boowa is well known for the fluency and skill of his Dhamma talks and their direct and dynamic approach
They obviously reflect his own attitude and the way he personally practiced Dhamma
This is best exemplified in the Dhamma talks he gives to those who go to meditate at Wat Pa Bahn Tahd
Such talks usually take place in the cool of the evening with lamps lit and the only sound being the insects and cicadas in the surrounding jungle
He often begins the Dhamma talk with a few moments of stillness  this is the most preparation he needs  and then quietly begins the Dhamma exposition
As the theme naturally develops the pace quickens and those listening increasingly feel its strength and depth
The formal Dhamma talk might last from thirtyfive to sixty minutes
Then after a more general talk the listeners would all go back to their solitary huts in the jungle to continue the practice to try to find the Dhamma they had been listening about  inside themselves
This heart of ours is much like a child
The child is unable to take care of itself and so has to depend on mother and father on guardians and nursemaids holding on to various people
But the child at least has parents and guardians to look after it to make sure it seldom meets with harm
Whereas although the heart is always grasping and clinging to various things it doesn't find any such safety and security
The heart can't rely on itself and therefore always likes to cling onto things
For the most part it tends to reach for wrong things for things that do it harm
The reason it likes to search for and hold on to things is so that it can find safety security and comfort for itself
The things it clings to however are not dependable and so they pose a constant danger for the heart
Whether we are children or already grown up this is the way our minds tend to be
Instead of trying to rely on ourselves we always put our hopes in other things other people
We can't stand on own two feet
This is because the heart isn't wise enough to check whether the objects it grasps hold of are right or wrong good or bad
It doesn't know how to care for itself how to help itself because there's no one to teach it
There's nobody to advise on how to know which things are dangerous and which are beneficial which things should be held on to and which things shouldn't
The heart therefore continues indiscriminately to grasp hold of anything whether good or bad as long as it likes the look of it
Even if it isn't gratifying the heart's characteristic trait is still to keep on grasping and clinging
Why should it be like this
Normally one wouldn't think that a mood or a thing that's displeasing is worth clinging to
Yet the heart continues to grasp hold of such things
It clings to anger to delusion and lust hatred and disgust because it becomes involved and caught up in them
We can never say that the heart simply knows an object for it always gets caught up in it and clings to it
For the most part those things have nothing good in them
Why does the heart have to go and grasp at things
It's because it is attracted without realizing the repercussions of its attachment
Even though you may wish to break away from it you can't because there's something else which is powerful enough to force the heart to grasp and hang on
The object then becomes caught up in emotions which continually overcloud and obscure yourself
Here we're talking about emotional objects and moods
Now I'll speak about material objects
The heart will grasp at and cling to whatever object is present
It doesn't matter how trifling or significant how valuable or worthless it might be the heart can and will attach itself
We wouldn't be wrong if we were to call the heart an expert 'hangeron'
This is because it's still unable to rely on itself and so must depend on outside things until the end of the body that has led one through the changing situations
It may even forget itself by surrendering to the power of external objects even though their control is baseless and leads the wrong way
The Lord Buddha taught that self is the protector of self
Try to cure the heart of its dependency of the tendency it has of always hoping to rely on other things
Disengage yourself from such objects and turn inward to rely more on your own resources and abilities
Don't depend on your parents friends and others so much that you forget yourself
Our human trait of continually seeking support in other people develops eventually into a personal habit
It's like this all over the world and in this regard we can hardly even measure up to some kinds of animals
This then is why the Lord Buddha taught about selfreliance
In our commonplace and coarse affairs like work and other such responsibilities we should try to be more selfreliant
Coming in towards Dhamma  the practice of meditation in the heart  we need to have had sufficient training under a Teacher to know the right direction in which to proceed
The actual practice though is the duty of each one of us to find assurance in our selfreliance following the principles of Dhamma
The Lord Buddha taught for example about cultivating goodness and virtue through generosity precepts and meditation
This is so that we can develop selfreliance which is the heart firmly holding to good and wholesome objects
There is then peace and happiness in both the present and future lives because they are beneficial things and originate from wholesome actions
They make up fine objects or superior quality food for the heart
We are taught to meditate which is a step higher in refinement
This effort to train ourselves in meditation is a way of selfreliance that is steadily taken onto a firmer and more dependable level
We use a meditationword as the means to direct and control the heart
For as the mind is not yet able to sustain itself we have to rely on the meditationword as the object to soothe and bring peace and calm
The settling of the mind in buddho buddho buddho is one example of this
It is an object for the heart to occupy itself with which is correct and right and appropriate to finding refuge in Dhamma
In the beginning of the practice the heart is still restless and distracted still unable to settle itself on Dhamma principles and become selfreliant
It has to depend on a meditationword to direct it until it merges in with that meditationword and gathers into stillness
When it enters calm even the meditationword itself ceases to be an issue
This is one step towards selfreliance for the meditationword can be released at this stage as the heart is well settled in calm
This is a foundation and refuge for the heart that can be clearly seen
Even with just this much there's calm and ease in the heart that used to be restless and distracted unable to find any peace
This is because the heart normally does not know peace but only trouble and unrest hunger and thirst worries and concerns over affairs that are of no use to it at all
For the most part these affairs are the heart's own thoughts and imaginings which poison and burn oneself  without anyone else being involved
The Lord Buddha discovered the correct way to practice and achieved results to his heart's contentment
He was therefore able to explain about the causes or the way to practice together with their fulfillment and fruits
He taught us that the way to depend on oneself is through meditation and that this is the direct route to a firmly established selfreliance
Basing the heart in calm to whatever degree brings increasingly selfassurance and confidence  without having to ask anyone else about it
You will know from within yourself
This is termed paccatam or sanditthiko
The knowledge of good or bad what needs remedying removing or developing will then arise in the heart
This will be understood by oneself and for oneself as the heart is more and more firmly established
The level of concentration once reached is already sufficient to form a foundation for the heart a home where the heart can find shelter and peace
At the moment when we think so much that we feel fainthearted and weary we should turn inwards and meditate
The heart can then rest and be stilled from all its preoccupations finding peace and calm
This is called going inward for refuge to find a resting place of comfort and ease
This is one level of refuge for the heart
The next steps even though they're still concerned with samadhi are proceeding into more subtle and refined aspects of the heart
The levels of momentary concentration access concentration and attainment concentration show the refining of samadhi
This culminates in attainment concentration and beyond that samadhi can't advance
Once the heart has some degree of calm according to the level of samadhi achieved it is stilled and refined
However without developing mindfulness and wisdom it will just remain at that level lacking wisdom radically to uproot its defilements
If we compare the defilements to a tree although we may have pruned the branches the main trunk remains uncut and is still capable of sending out new branches
This is why we're taught to investigate by way of wisdom
Wisdom is a keen intelligence and ingenuity
It is able to investigate and follow through without any limitation
The Lord Buddha described wisdomandknowledge  being even more refined than wisdom  in the Discourse of Setting the Wheel of Dhamma in Motion
Listen to this
Nyaanam udapaadi panyaa udapaadi vijjaa udapaadi aaloko udapaadi
Knowledge arose wisdom arose higherknowledge arose light arose
Knowledge or vijjaa refers basically to the Threefold Knowledge
Wisdom arose and with greater refinement higher knowledge arose  arising right from this same heart
Wisdom is that which removes the defilements covering the heart whereas samadhi is simply that which herds the defilements together in quietness within the heart
It is not yet capable of cutting off any defilements
The heart's attachment which embroils it with various things remains intact though it's weakening
Once the heart gains some calm and peace wisdom can come into its own as the important weapon that strikes down and uproots all the different defilements in the heart step by step
Samaadhiparibhaavitaa panyaa mahapphalaa hoti mahaanisamsaa
There
Wisdom once supported and nurtured in samadhi is of great fruit and great advantage Its examination becomes skilled its scrutiny agile and bold so that it is able to cut away the defilements one after another
Panyaaparibhaavitam cittam sammadeva aasavehi vimuccati
The heart nurtured with wisdom gains proper release from the cankers
Listen to that
It's wisdom alone that can uproot the defilements it doesn't matter whether they are gross intermediate or subtle no defilement lies beyond the scope of wisdom
This is a primary principle that secures the quality and value of our practice which is the total elimination of the defilements from the heart
It's the same practice which the Lord Buddha and his Noble Disciples have already completed before us
Thus samadhi and wisdom can't be separated from each other
Whatever our character and tendencies might be samadhi is always needed as a quiet resting place for the heart
The heart rests from work by stilling in samadhi its thoughts and preoccupations
Even work in the world requires a period of rest and recuperation  making do without is just not possible
This may certainly use up workingtime but just as eating uses up food and the money needed to buy that food it is necessary that the body has renewed vigour to continue its work
Resting and sleeping may waste some time but again they give the constitution new strength to fulfill its duties and tasks
Otherwise it won't be able to go on
This use of time and material to provide for and restrengthen the body is certainly not wasted
Rather they act like fuel for a car which won't go anywhere without it
Samadhi and wisdom have the same sort of relationship
The mind needs time to be still and calm in samadhi and after it has rested it can then continue its investigation using mindfulness and wisdom in line with its abilities
This word wisdom describes something very subtle and broad ranging to accord with the character and tendencies of the person bringing it into use
Any approach we use to investigate for the sake of uprooting the defilements is termed right wisdom
It's not necessary always to have to go and read the scriptures in order to know how to deal with the defilements and in order for it to be 'Dhamma'
These texts were extracted from the heart that is Dhamma which had actually performed the uprooting of the defilements and clearly seen the fruits
Only then was it written down in the scriptures
So it's not the case that the texts originated before the Truth  which is the actual practice
The Lord Buddha was the first to practice and so no scriptures had been made for him to use
When he taught his disciples the Noble Truths he didn't write them down in palm leaf texts
He taught them by word of mouth and then his disciples themselves carried on the Teaching through word of mouth
Where did they get their teachings
 From the reality in their hearts which they had seen clearly as a result of their own practice
It is for this reason that the techniques and strategies of mindfulness and wisdom depend primarily on the individual
Each of us needs to think examine investigate and work out strategies using our own intelligence and abilities according to each case
Therefore there's no need always to go back to retrieve scriptural authority with questions like I've thought this up myself so it can't possibly deal with the defilements This way of thinking is not in accord with the principles of Dhamma and can't be called right wisdom
When those things we remember from the scriptures can't be actualized in ridding our heart of any defilements then this too for us isn't right wisdom
It may be right wisdom in the scriptures but it's wrong in the way it's used
The Dhamma is only explained to a limited extent in the scriptures
It's not really all that much
If we compare it to a medicine it's a general nonspecific remedy rather than one aimed at a particular illness
Our integrating and formulating a specific approach capable of dealing with each particular defilement is termed medicine
It is a remedy aimed at steadily uprooting a certain defilement
This is why those who are successfully practicing in the way of wisdom have Dhamma have mindfulness and wisdom with them wherever they are
Ven
Acharn Mun once said that he listened to Dhamma day and night
Just think of that
Things keep making contact with our senses of sight hearing smell taste and touch at all times
If the knowledge of this contact doesn't arise at the heart which is waiting with acknowledgment where else is it going to occur
What is it that acknowledges
The heart's acknowledging also stirs up mindfulness and wisdom which must come in to examine the ongoing involvement with a wellfounded scrutiny that accords with cause and effect
It checks out the contact and when it knows it is able progressively to withdraw or let go
This is what is called 'listening to Dhamma day and night' listening to Dhamma in the primal principles of nature
Defilements are natural principles together with the heart
Dhamma with its virtue samadhi and wisdom are natural principles within the heart
It all depends on how we bring them out to use in our investigating utilizing them to full advantage according to the ability of mindfulness and wisdom which is the ideal instrument to use
The body
Listen
Elements aggregates body
The Lord Buddha had them and all his disciples have had them
At one stage they seized hold and attached to those aggregates just as we do now
Such defilements were the same for them as they are now for us
But by grasping and attaching to we establish conditions and causes for the accumulation of defilement in our hearts
The Lord Buddha and his arahant disciples formerly had defilements  just like us now  so why was it possible for them to uproot them
The body is the same the five aggregates are the same yet they could release their attachment whereas we can't
Why
We don't seem able to understand yet how was it that they were able to gain realization
Why can't we also comprehend
The heart is present and mindfulness and wisdom can be built up in each aspect according to whatever angle we wish to take up for examination
This body which exists right with us here now is something that can be known and understood
When we say that the heart can't depend on itself what it all comes down to is that it needs to depend on the body
Moreover it not only relies on the aggregates but also holds to them as being self
There
We depend on them and unashamedly uphold them as self
What about that then
Even with some measure of shame they inevitably must be held onto because comprehension is still lacking and without it any possibility of lettinggo
So it is quite correct to say that we've been shameless and we need to admit to our stupidity
From here we must endeavor to develop some cleverness that will see these things and let go of them through the strength of our own efforts
So for once let's get down to the facts
These things follow the principles of nature and remain as they are they whereas we exert ourselves to pull them in as ourself
Now that is going to make problems because it goes against the truth of things
To be in line with the facts you have to investigate to see according to the truth about them
Repeatedly examine and keep on investigating until you can understand
Once you understand you won't have to order the mind to let go
It will let go on its own because these things are poisonous and harmful to us owing to our own attachment
There are certainly no benefits in this attachment
If there were any merit or advantage the Lord Buddha would have told us to grasp hold  but then such advice would not be needed as the heart would have already involved itself
It is that attachment that is the truly poisonous and harmful thing
Even though those things may be dangerous to us we still seize and bring them close in
We hold them by making the assumptions that I'm like this I'm like that they are me they are mine
The trouble arises right there with these assumptions and notions based in delusion
None of these aggregates have any meaningfulness in themselves
They exist in truth in the same way as trees and mountains and such like
We are conscious of their various aspects and this makes it the affair and concern of the heart
Once dead we can't be aware of them which shows that it's all mixed up with the heart
If we are here there is no happiness if we go there's no contentment if we grasp hold there's no peace
And this goes on and on and on
How exasperating and vexing this can be
This heart is totally filled with delusion
Whatever aspect it exposes there is nothing but delusion and harmful attachments
We murmur that 'the heart can't depend on itself' and so has to go and hang onto this thing or that
Our investigation through wisdom is carried forth so that we can understand this whole situation
Then we can push away press on out disentangle and steadily attain to selfreliance
We give other things a complete looking over and can manage to understand them
We look at building homes women men animals and material things
We can tell whether they're good or bad valuable or not worth keeping or not  yet why can't we realize this about our body
Not only do we fail to understand but we also love and grasp hold of it in attachment
We wouldn't dare love or hold on to outside things in the same way especially if we know there's nothing good in them
We wouldn't have anything to do with them
Yet here we will take it all  the good with the bad
What can one say
This is where we really show our stupidity
These eyes in our head see what the body is like our heart knows but it's all on the superficial level of commonplace people
It therefore keeps on going in a stubborn unrelenting way without true knowledge following the commonplace mundane understanding
This is really the commonplace way of ignorance the ordinary type of delusion in the circle of knowledge
It's out of line with the truth which is why we must find a way to introduce truth into the heart for this is wisdom
Once wisdom is there we will realize the truth  no longer concealed  about ourselves incorporated in this physical body
Inspect it carefully
This body is not all that big a fathom long a cubit wide and just a hand's span thick
We ought to be able to look it all over  externally it should only take a moment
On the inside look deeply with a heartfelt examination following its present state and conditions to its final dissolution
It doesn't really go anywhere it does nothing but advance towards its disintegration and a return to its original elements
And that's all
Using wisdom make a deepreaching and heartfelt investigation of this truth
When the truth goes straight to the heart in a way beyond dispute the grasping and attachment will immediately withdraw
If the truth hasn't yet penetrated then investigate with wisdom until it does
This wisdom doesn't appear from anyone else
This profound insight into the body  which is right with us here  is something that arises from your own investigation your own understanding
When that understanding is complete you'll completely let go
You're the one who's been holding on and no one else can let go for you so investigate and free yourself
Just look on the body as something to lean upon and abide with
If through your stupidity and lack of wisdom you see it as yourself or as belonging to you it will cause you endless suffering
This is especially so at the final breakup of the aggregates
Your worries and regrets loves and attachments will all go out of control
Even more than 'a kite with broken string on high' you'll spin along with the wind
No one will know where you'll come down and all this in spite of the fact that the body is not worth such affection and regret
It is wholly made up of things destined for dissolution
Are you going to persist in resisting the truth
When the time comes there's no denying that the aggregates must break apart
This is the truth
Are you going to set yourself against it by still loving and cherishing not wanting them to fail and fall apart
In this opposition to the truth you will only heap up suffering for yourself until finally there will be no way out
Unless of course you take this present moment quickly to dispatch it through wisdom
If you succeed in this then you will receive that great gain  the supreme happiness of Nibbaana Nibbaanam paramam sukham
However if you should go against Dhamma then it's also quite possible that at that moment you'll lose your faculties and wits
Wisdom is a state of the art weapon system that should penetrate through your investigation to the truth
Release and let go in accordance with the truth both now while you're still living here and at the time of disintegration
Wisdom will then have clearly appraised the present situation and the future  nothing can now pose a problem
Pleasures and pains are still present because the aggregates are still functioning
These things arise in dependence on one another
And it's the heart that acknowledges and takes responsibility
It knows but doesn't grasp
You should understand that there are two possible ways in which it can know  either knowinginlinewiththetruth or by knowingandseizinghold
Feelings of whatever type or level are present with the aggregates but not in the purified heart
The arahant does not have to bear with the feelings of both aggregate and heart whereas 'us lot' take up the contract to build the cycleofrebirth
When this condition of various aggregates tilts and skews we follow and when it topples and falls we're knocked sprawling with it
It's because of the reliance we put on them
They lead us to tilt and we tilt to fall over and we fall too
When they lead us to stand in place we might be able also to hold up to a certain extent but they aren't willing to stand still
Even if they persist and haven't yet reached death we are more upset about dying than they are
It's therefore necessary for us to investigate clearly to see with wisdom that these things are solely something to abide with
Days minutes time steadily consumes everything
If we see the way time and nature eat away gnaw away at these things we'll see that it's like a dog gnawing away on a meaty bone
There's no difference at all
It keeps gnawing away biting and tearing until there's nothing left to get its teeth into
So there is the eating away in just the same way
They keep disintegrating bit by bit until they reach their final truth
Whether we're sitting standing walking lying down or sleeping soundly time keeps on eating away gnawing away
Disintegration diminishing and decline
The continual gnawing and consuming
So you think that you can oppose and stop this
No there's no halting this
It is the course of nature  something of massive proportions
Our assumptions are wrong and what's wrong is no match for what's right and true
Disintegration is quite the correct course it is following their principle of nature
To resist their essential nature is the heart's error that must end in suffering
Start right now with an allround investigation of these things
When the time comes finally to go there will then be no trembling because your investigation and understanding are complete and you'll know that this is the inevitable way of things
There's just no alternative
So then let each thing go its own separate way
Whatever happens let it occur without trying to resist the truth
Painful feelings burn away at the body and it gradually becomes brittle and 'overdone'
It steadily declines until it breaks apart and disintegrates
However a heart circled with mindfulness and wisdom won't be broken won't be extinguished and won't 'hang on'
It is its own self by itself selfreliant without needing to depend on anything  and infinitely at ease
Right here is where we see the importance of investigation its value for the heart
This is why sages beginning with the Lord Buddha teach mindfulness and wisdom as their major point  so that we can take the mind drag the mind out of the bonfire and release it from danger
The Teachings of every Buddha are taught in the same way
This is because the natural principles are the same and the defilements are always the same
No Buddha will teach differently or diverge from this
The practice is always to remove the defilements  whether great or small  from the heart
This follows from the basic principles of Dhamma which they all teach
If we deviate from these principles we'll be the laughing stock of the defilements
Therefore investigate
No matter how broadly or how narrowly  take the whole universe and worldly elements
Is there anything there on which the heart can depend and which offers refuge
Take note of this term 'refuge'
Even those things that are intimately associated with ourself are not safe
Farther out than the body there's no hope of finding refuge in anything
Even those things closely connected with us aren't trustworthy
If we can't discern the threat they pose then where else will we be able to see it
It's here where the danger must be seen and the heart withdrawn from its peril
The quality that then arises in full measure is called
'Attaa hi attano naatho' 'self is the protector of self'
It doesn't depend on anything
'Virtue' 'samadhi' or 'wisdom' in the final stage of release are also terms no longer needed
Why should a refuge be found in tools and instruments that have successfully done their job of clearing out the defilements
The tools are laid down in accordance with their condition
A knife taken up to chop vegetables or to peel fruit is put aside when we take the food and eat it
It's obvious that we don't eat the knife as well
Virtue samadhi and wisdom are tools for dealing with the defilements
When the defilements are eliminated all the problems for the heart also go
While life remains these tools can be utilized for the sake of the world in line with conventional notions
However they won't be needed to correct the defilements ever again
In particular at the final time when the passage from the elements and aggregates will take place there's definitely no need for anything
Mindfulness and wisdom are no longer an issue and the body poses no problem because all problems in the heart are already finished with
Nothing can possible cause concern
So you should move forward to this ending of problems for this is where all your worries will cease
If you still have problems  then that is a problem
We hear of problems concerning suffering and hardship concerning birth aging sickness and death
They follow on from what we call 'problems'
With the ending of problems all issues cease
Investigate and understand
All the things I've mentioned here lie in your own body or heart
Analyze them through the power of your mindfulness and wisdom
Examine day after day
Don't be complacent
It's not that mindfulness and wisdom are something that can be brought in to cook and eat but they can be brought in to deal with the defilements
By utilizing them in this way the removal can carry on all day long
However complacency will only lead you to sink  and there's certainly nothing to be gained by that
The final result will be that when you're stuck in a corner you won't even know where your wisdom has disappeared to
You'll end up banging your head against the walls
That certainly won't do
We're not disciples of a Tathaagata the Lord Buddha who banged his head against the wall
The Lord Buddha didn't do it neither did the Noble Disciples whom we revere with Sangham saranam gacchaami
How can we go and bang our heads in this way
You must endeavor using whatever means and strategies to find the way that leads out
Try to the best of your ability
Reaching the limit of our capability then that's all we can manage
Whatever state or level we reach we accept it  because that's as much as we can do
But as long as it's not beyond our ability we can strive to go further struggling crawling and forcing our way through
Sinking into the cycle of birth and death is similar to when a ship capsizes and everything on board goes down
The ship the goods and cargo all sink together and the people die
We go down with the elements and aggregates through delusion and ignorance
The body goes down in accordance with its nature but our heart sinks because of its own stupidity
Do you approve of that
There's nothing good about this fall
The heart goes straight down into the deep under the compulsion of delusion and that surely isn't good
In fact it's disastrously bad and unwished for
It's for this reason that we have to make sure that we steadily look for a way out
Investigate to see the truth and especially the truth of the painful and unpleasant feelings of the body and heart
This is of great importance
The heart goes in and seizes hold so much that it becomes a mental disease on top of everything else
Realize that the five conditions are not 'me' Body feelings memory or perception mental formations and consciousness are particular conditions interdependent within the elements and aggregates
The heart is something apart
By successfully analysing and dissecting using your mindfulness and wisdom you'll reach safety from all danger
Death  just let it go along its way
All the things of this world die they have death builtin
How can you expect them to be constant and enduring  when the time comes for them to die they have to die
Nothing can constrain or contradict this
Even arahants have to die for them however there is the difference that they pass away without concern and worry
As for us we're worried even before we come to die  perturbed and possessive
On death the worry and possessiveness intensify so that they pile up into a threat bigger than a mountain
Be careful not to let that happen to you
Make sure you get beyond such anxieties
As I'm always saying prepare and establish yourself with sufficient qualities  'kusalaa dhammaa' 'enough skill and intelligence'
This is our 'kusalaa'
Kusalaa dhammaa akusalaa dhammaa 
Wherever there's akusalaa  unskillfulness or stupidity  drive it out with kusalaa skillfulness which is your own mindfulness and wisdom
This is what is called 'chanting kusalaa for oneself' and it's something you have to do for yourself
Depending on others to track down monks to chant kusalaa dhammaa after your death causes so much fuss and bother
Something we don't want
Kusalaa dhammaa prepare yourself enough skillfulness complete and all encompassing and there will be no need for anything else
You'll die without turmoil and confusion like a 'sugato'
So then that's all for now
Self is the protector of self for who else could protector be
Listening here to this Dhamma talk please make sure that you don't allow the mind to wander away
Keep it within yourself rather than sending it out following after various moods and imaginings
Don't look back and pine after past thoughts and conceptions for here and now they can't bring any benefit
At this time you should be trying to suffuse the heart with Dhamma for it has become parched through its long deficiency
It's similar to a droughtridden jungle lacking in moisture where the dried out vegetation easily ignites
Both living and dead trees are then scorched and consumed
Forest fires during the rainy season are rare but the hot season when the vegetation dries out brings a danger of fire
This may happen even in a forest monastery when it is very dry
Bahn Tahd forest monastery has in fact caught on fire several times
This is due to its becoming dry and parched
When the heart becomes parched through lack of Dhamma to cool and nourish it the fire of the defilements can rapidly take hold
This will then scorch everything coming into experience
Fire brings damage so when the defilements blaze within the heart how can the heart itself escape harm
Regardless of its value it will become tarnished and eventually worthless
Such is the way of the heart that has been constantly scorched and consumed by fire
A fire will damage our possessions depending on its intensity and extent
Unless of course they happen to be stored in a safeplace like a security vault which banks use to protect their valuables
But do we have a safety vault or safe place within our hearts
Or are we continually exposing ourselves to danger always leaving ourselves vulnerable without any concern for our deserving heart
We can use this approach when considering our situation and learning a lesson
The heart cannot find any happiness because it's constantly being burnt
This fire is the blaze of greed hatred and delusion that is described in the Fire Sermon
There's nothing doubtful or uncertain about this
It's a timeless truth
We need to take these Dhamma questions onto a personal level carefully comparing and considering the correctness and truth of them there and then we'll at least be in a position to escape the heat
We will have found a breathing space a safe cool place and will no longer be always caught up in the conflagration
Each of you has made the effort to come here to practice
You may consider it as a search for a safeplace for your riches  which are the virtue and skillfulness you have gathered and their protection from the devastation of the three great fires
Fighting ordinary outside fires is difficult enough especially when the blaze has taken such a hold that even water can't contain it
The hoses always seem to clog up and if that can't be fixed then the house will soon be charred remains and ashes
Turning to extinguish the inner blaze however relies on the assiduous cultivation of virtue
The meditation on loving kindness for instance
The heart is then calmed and concentrated cooled and strengthened so that it can quench the harmful fires within
Fire almost by definition must be hot
Even sparks burn and sting if we're in their way when they fly up
So if we go along allowing ourselves to be burnt day after day after day  what's going to be left
The heart will be burnt out
The body may remain but the heart will survive with a poor and indifferent sort of knowing without wholesome aspect because it's totally given over to the allconsuming defilements
It is a knowingness invested with suffering not with comfort and ease
It lacks lucidity and wisdom and is completely overwhelmed in suffering
So much so that the heart seems worthless
It will need a sustained effort in cultivating meditation to extinguish the fire within the heart
This will steadily bring peace and happiness
All the teachings of the Lord Buddha are within our reach and range
He never offered impossibilities or taught blindly and haphazardly
Those of us who practice should see these Dhamma teachings as being of vital importance and take them deeply to heart
Just as we all shy away from pain and suffering  which nobody wants  so we must incline towards the remedy and antidote
And that is Dhamma
On analysing the situation we will find that in doing the practice the question of easiness or difficulty doesn't appear so important
We have already carefully reasoned it out and are satisfied and convinced of its effectiveness
It's this that has obliged us to take up the practice
We can only do our best
For who isn't lazy when the defilements rule the roost
This laziness which loathes acting towards anything good or beneficial is with us all
It always likes to hold the lead but is certainly not going to deliver us from suffering
We remain complacent and negligent steadily being dragged down through the deceit and coercion of the defilements
The Lord Buddha himself also went through and then overcame these oppressions of the heart
This is something we should use as a reflection on our own situation
Then when laziness and discouragement overwhelm us we can encourage and arouse ourselves with his ideal example
A way will appear of resistance and commitment without always having to yield and submit
It's difficult yes but just carry on and do it
The way to overcome and transcend suffering takes on a crucial importance if we acknowledge the truth of suffering
Otherwise this predicament that we detest and dread will always confront us
But merely intellectualizing about ways of escape without actually taking remedial action isn't going to get us anywhere
It doesn't matter whether a technique is easy or difficult as long as it's effective in ridding the heart of its torments it must be applied
We are all fellows and equal in suffering in birth and death amid the various realms of existence
Even after so long we are still equal first with no one coming in behind
Each of us has gone through repeated birth and death matching each other in the suffering involved
There can be no competition or rivalry here for we all manage an equal first and are all in the same boat
Instead of achieving our top marks with the heart and Dhamma they come from being foremost together in suffering following the guidance and direction of the defilements
Without going against that lead there will never be an end to suffering
Dhamma is concerned with resisting the influence of the defilements
It uses careful analysis and reason perceiving that the source of suffering and danger must be remedied in such and such a way
The puttingtoright may be difficult or easy but that is beside the point
When the craftsman works he selects the appropriate tool for the job in hand
As he selects his tool he isn't concerned with its weight but only with steadily accomplishing his task
The tools selected to be used against the defilements and for establishing the heart in genuine wholeness and integrity come from the Dhamma
These Dhamma tools are varied and need to be chosen to fit the circumstances
If the heart is only mildly disturbed by the defilements we may apply a lighter control
The level of mindfulness and wisdom the strength of application the length of our sitting or walking or investigating isn't yet of great significance because the work isn't at the critical stage
However when the defilements rise up to disturb and obsess the heart and it finds it can't unburden or release itself we can no longer remain idle and indifferent
Now is the time for action
Whatever is available is thrown in with a doordie attitude and without thought of surrender or defeat unless death does indeed come for it's then beyond us
Our response must be to mobilize all our resources and willingly endure the painful predicament
Our resistance might bring with it suffering but that's nothing compared with the aberrant effects of defilementborn suffering
It's this that sinks one so thoroughly that there's no telling when one might emerge
We all know about the discomfort and pain of sitting or walking in meditation for long periods
We've experienced the difficulties involved in finding strategies and skillful means to oppose the defilements
We know this much
But when the fruits of our exertion arise it will be experienced as something truly remarkable
The happiness and wonder that arises
The new insight with such ingenuity and resourcefulness
This is exactly what we have been hoping for
Once the results arrive to join up with the cause we'll be able to cope with any obstacle or difficulty that may arise
If there were only hardship and struggle without the final rewarding peace and contentment then no one in this world would be able to continue
I don't mean just us ordinary people but even the Lord Buddha couldn't have awakened nor his enlightened disciples  whom we celebrate with
Buddham Dhammam Sangham saranam gacchaami
I go for refuge to the Lord Buddha Dhamma and Sangha
The right time and opportunity will always eventually arrive and we will then be able to manage the task
Perseverance is therefore crucial as is a steady and systematic use of clear reasoning but should this weaken the defilements will immediately grow more threatening and incisive
With strong effort with mindfulness and wisdom sharp and keen the defilements will gradually fall away
Defilements only fear Dhamma for nothing else can contain and subdue them
Dhamma is faith diligent effort mindfulness samadhi and wisdom
Faith is trust in the fruits of the Lord Buddha's Realization
That the Dhamma he offered to the world definitely leads out from suffering  it is the Niyyaanika Dhamma
That if we too practice following the Lord's teaching we will steadily and surely come to those same fruits
Diligent effort will always bring the right and proper result to any action
Whether the task be internal or external it will be well accomplished when supported by diligent effort
This will be evident in its outstanding and appropriate result
Mindfulness is the vital factor that oversees each task preventing any negligence or error
Samadhi is the firm undistracted commitment to the task in hand right up to its final completion
That is the causal aspect while the samadhi of result appears in the established concentrated mind
The heart of peace and contentment
The samadhi of cause concentrates on the action without vacillation or bias and the resulting samadhi state is that of tranquillity
This leads up to ekaggataa which the Lord Buddha described as 'the mind having only one object' without depending on anything else
Wisdom is penetrative discernment which is necessary in checking out each situation will it be damaging or fulfilling and effective
We must rely on wisdom to investigate and analyze
These are the factors of Dhamma that will steadily lead us out from suffering accomplishing the work we set out to do
The Lord Buddha also described the Four Ways to Success as being of equal importance
They are
Satisfaction
What is it that brings satisfaction to us
If we are content with defilements then that is what will spring up
Whatever gratified us becomes the object of our search
We want that and so that is what arises
However the Four Ways to Success are not concerned with such low gratifications but are directed at fulfilling our high and virtuous aspirations
They are the four means to achieve those aims that lie within the reach of us human beings
Together with satisfaction there is diligent effort attentiveness and application to the work and allaround wisdom
These combine to form a single effective force in accomplishing the single objective
This is the Dhamma that builds the complete and whole human being
The heart becomes firmly based
Efforts to accomplish the work are consolidated with excellent principles methods and suitable customs and traditions
All of this ensures that those who take up the practice do not go counter to the basic principles of Dhamma
Once the heart is attuned to Dhamma in this way it is safeguarded with the Dhammaprotection and will steadily prosper
Harmful factors will fade because regardless of how long the heart had fallen into misery it was not ruined without any hope of renewal
For once the heart is purged through exertion it will be left bright serene and happy
This then is the key the vital instrument in turning our aspiration into full reality
A mere passive wishing or easy discouragement will abort such accomplishments
Whatever you are doing or thinking never forget our great Teacher the Lord Buddha
When discouragement presses down recollect his example
His persistent exertion and his Awakening through using these Dhamma factors of faith effort mindfulness samadhi and wisdom
This is how he attained to Awakening
What direction should one take to develop and nourish peace of mind
So that at the very least you can claim to be following the way with a guide and teacher
The Lord Buddha explained his own fruitful practice in an orderly and methodical way so there's really no alternative way to try
Dhammam saranam gacchaami I go to refuge in Dhamma  this phrase finds its source in the five factors of faith diligent effort mindfulness samadhi and wisdom
It's these five factors that arose with the Lord Buddha himself
Sangham saranam gacchaami  going for refuge to the Sangha is just the same
None of the noble disciples regardless of their wealth or class were weakwilled or easily discouraged
Once gone forth into Dhamma's Way they were characterized by their energy and diligent effort
This aspect of exertion is a vital factor in steadily uplifting the quality of one's heart
These five factors and four ways go together to raise the heart releasing it from the oppressed condition of worldlings sunk in suffering
Some of the disciples walked on their meditation path until their feet blistered
How's that for striving
Some didn't lie down for three months at a time
The Ven
Cakkhupala strove like that until his eyes ruptured and were broken and blinded
Is that enduring in one's endeavor or not
As for us there's no need to ruin our body but it would be good if we could at least make the defilements suffer a bit so that they run away and hide
Don't let them swarm all over the eyes ears nose tongue body and mind
Once infested with defilements you'll never be able to find Dhamma or anything essential within the heart
How on earth are you going to find any peace
We must rely on these Dhamma factors to overcome those defilements that remain dominant in the heart
These principles of Dhamma must be taken deeply to heart  don't cherish anything else
They are the tools that will steadily deliver the heart to the perfect freedom that we all prize so highly
Your choice is between the heart of freedom and the heart under the domination of the defilements
So which is better the slave totally deprived of liberty or the free person
We have long been passively submissive under the mass of defilements and craving
It's only when we become weary of their domination and start to recognize their curse that we'll be able to resist by whatever way we can
Ultimately we'll have to rely on these five essential Dhamma tools to finish off and eliminate the defilements
Where is the arena and battleground for anyone going into Dhamma practice
What do those who relentlessly walk their meditation path or sit crosslegged day and night take as their battlefield and zone of investigation
The Lord Buddha brought forward the Four Noble Truths from the principles of Dhamma
These Four Noble Truths are there within the body and mind of human beings
You are human so when you walk or sit in meditation searching for truth and Dhamma it's obvious that you must look for the Noble Truths
We are aware of the suffering that arises in the body and mind of human beings and animals
We unlike the animals know a way to remedy the situation
How can this suffering be so welcome and desirable
When it appears in the body it's plainly unwished for yet even with bodily ease and comfort any suffering that comes up will bring anxiety and negative unsightly behavior
And increasing distress manifests in an even more unattractive way
The tormented heart will always expose itself in detrimental ways for instead of alleviating and ridding itself of suffering it actually makes the situation worse
The idea that one can be rid of suffering  'get it off one's chest'  with harsh words and offensiveness is completely mistaken
In reality the perpetrator not only hurts others with outpourings from a soiled heart but also increases his own suffering
He spreads and multiplies his troubles rather than throwing them out
One element of the Noble Truths concerns the searching into how suffering actually arises
We may be aware of suffering but to do anything about it we need to know its rootcause
This is the originator the producer of suffering or samudaya
The Lord Buddha usually explained this as sensual craving craving for existence and craving for noexistence
Desire for things that I love and aversion for what I dislike is the source of our suffering
Those thought fabrications based in defilements are producing suffering and so can be classed as a source
All these branches and ramifications spring from one main trunk  and that's in the heart
The heart is embedded with the roots of greed hatred and delusion
Examine your body and then turn your inspection inward to the heart
Check on its ongoing thoughts and fabrications
What do you find
The endless proliferating of thoughts that contrive and process suffering for both yourself and others
The Lord Buddha taught about the application of mindfulness and wisdom to inspect what's going on
The heart appears anxious and concerned for these aggregates
But what's the point in that
The aggregates have their space here so surely there's room enough in a cemetery or crematorium ahead just as there is for everyone else in the world
What can all this concern and possessiveness achieve
Where's the advantage
Won't the result be that of 'unfulfilled desires that breed suffering' for the heart
The Lord Buddha therefore advised against indulging such desires and to turn and examine the actual situation
The bodily aggregate is fashioned and put together and is thus also destined for eventual breakup
Just that
This can be irrefutably seen once wisdom is brought to bear and then any possessiveness seems altogether pointless
We can then let go our grasp and allow the body to follow its own nature whether it's still holding together or has entered the inevitable final phase of dissolution
This world is full of cemeteries awaiting each person and animal
Examining the truth we can no longer doubt the reality of our reserved plot or indeed the inevitability of our future death
Clearly acknowledging this mortality means we can then let go of our worries and concern
Death is a fundamental part of the law of nature that can neither be denied or defied
Let nature take its course and the earth water air and fire will follow their own essential natures
That which knows should genuinely know and not mistake water fire and air as 'myself'
This acts like a parasite hooking in and trapping the heart in turmoil
We mistake them for self and thereby fall into suffering
The aggregate of feeling is much the same
We have experienced pleasure and pain from the day of our birth up to the present
Whether it was a feeling of body or heart it's all about impermanence suffering and notself
It arises so as to pass away When this assumptions and suppositions has come forward nothing is able to keep steady and unchanging
Where exactly is the suffering in feeling
Bodily pains are not too difficult to examine when wisdom penetrates through
But the painful feeling in the heart  this is important
When there is bodily pain there is also pain and suffering in the heart that arises because of the source of suffering
This is the way that the defilements trick all beings in the world with their beguilements
The deception of taking this body as myself must be cleared by a thorough analysis of the true nature of the body
The investigation of pleasant and unpleasant feeling is aimed at erasing from the heart the notion that this feeling is myself
Let things be as they truly are feeling is feeling while this is me which is that knowingness
Don't mix them up
But anyway that's not possible as they are intrinsically different
How can they become merged together into one
Can two individuals be combined as only one
Having to bear the burden of one person is heavy enough  but to have the extra weight of two three four or five others We don't just take up the body but also shoulder the other four aggregates which press down with the weight of attachment
It's the heart that takes responsibility and so the heart alone must bear the consequences
That is suffering  and there's no compensation to be found
And yet we still persist with such hanging on
This needs looking at to see the true nature of pain
There is then the aggregate of perception or memory that remembers something only to forget it again
When that memory is required we may recall it anew and then it will fade away again  sanyaa vaassa vim hati
That's how the Lord Buddha described it and who can argue with that
Perception is impermanent memory fades into forgetfulness  sanyaa aniccaa
This aniccaa was explained by the Lord Buddha and it's this that we now use when we chant for the dead
Aniccaa vata sankhaaraa  impermanent are all conditioned things
But no chants or spells are able to conjure up a person or a self
You won't find any sign of self in all the five aggregates for they are impermanent suffering and notself
Investigate and analyze through to a more refined understanding
Don't be so afraid of dying for death like that isn't found with the heart
By bringing in such fears you'll only succeed in deceiving yourself and piling up suffering
This goes counter to Dhamma to the truth taught by the Lord Buddha
If you accept his Way then obviously you should follow it and see the truth for yourself rather than going against it
This is the true going for refuge
Buddham saranam gacchaami It's a discerning of the truth of the heart rather than a mere mouthing of words
The Lord Buddha offered this Teaching to all creatures of the world and as that includes us why shouldn't we too be able to comprehend the Four Noble Truths
They're there within each one of us
Now about thoughtconcocting formations
Is this contriving and fabricating of thoughts trustworthy
We think up various forms from various things  for instance take the form of a doll that is quickly broken
Our thoughtfabrications are much the same
We think up good or bad anything at all becomes a concoction to fool ourselves
This is why the heart is the chief of fools gullible and easily taken in by any deception
It believes in anything and is endlessly played false
However when wisdom is also present it will be able to keep in check and carefully screen such fabrications
They may appear a hundred or thousand times a second but wisdom is ready at every turn
What can fool wisdom
It realizes that formations are formations and that knowingness is the heart
How can it be deceived by them
Why be startled and react to shadows arising from oneself  for this is what formations are
It is the same with consciousness that flicks on and off whenever anything contacts through the senses and is known by the heart
It is then concocted through formations and memory into selfcontrived delusions
We repeatedly fall for our selfmade fancies and it's this wrong taking up of objects that creates suffering
The damage is done here and this is where it must be seen
You will learn about the Noble Truths right at this point
Follow and probe into it with greater precision and refinement without concern over how many times you have to go over it
The importance lies in the eventual clear penetration of wisdom which can pierce through any attachment even if it may seem as big as a mountain
When wisdom is in close pursuit craving will have to retreat into the big cave into the heart
Driving forward with wisdom using impermanence suffering and notself exactly where the real substance of these shadows is found
Penetrating further you will see that it only exists there in the heart where they have gathered together
Elsewhere it's just disassociated shadows excitement and deception over form feeling perception formations and consciousness
Once they have all converged the heart must turn and investigate right there in the heart
At this point we must be willing to follow them in and destroy them there in their hiding place in the heart
They are like brigands in ambush waiting to shoot our heads off
When bandits take over a place no matter how valuable the building might be we must go in with explosives and blow them out destroying it all including the bandits
If all must be obliterated  so be it
We still have life and can build again for we managed to avoid dying too
This is how to deal with this most subtle sort of defilement hiding out in the heart
Hit them hard with the truth of impermanence suffering and notself because these defilements are the essence of sammuti  all our suppositions about the world
They must be crushed and dispersed from the heart and then we'll see whether the heart has also been annihilated
No it is not destroyed
The heart has no cemetery
It is undying by its very nature  even when it still has defilements
The Lord Buddha called this the complete dissolution of the defilements the end of danger the quenching of the fires of greed hatred and delusion by the pouring of the Undying Dhamma elixir
With the defilements gone only spotless purity remains
It is here in this fully purified heart that perfect happiness is to be found
All work finishes here all projects end here
The Lord said
Done is the task fulfilled is the holy life there is no further work to do All suffering ends with this right understanding
The summit of Dhamma is found in this purified heart
The Buddham Dhammam Sangham saranam gacchaami that we repeat to reverently recollect the Lord Buddha all gather and converge in this pure nature
Buddho Dhammo Sangho are exactly this pure nature
Concern with questions about the Lord Buddha's final passing away in India  'how many centuries ago is it now'  will now end
The true nature of Buddha Dhamma and Sangha will now be evident in 'one's own' heart of purity
This is the heart's priceless treasure where the true state of things is seen and all questions settled
Where did the Lord Buddha go when he finally passed away
The bodily aggregate certainly disintegrated following its nature  bodies being the same anywhere
However the purified nature Buddho was not destroyed or annihilated for it is not confined by time or position
It is this that we refer to in Buddham Dhammam Sangham saranam gacchaami
When we can experience this for ourselves we will be able to verify with complete certainty that this nature cannot be annihilated
The arahant disciples understand this
Wherever they may be they are together with Dhamma with 'Buddha Dhamma and Sangha' having constant audience with the Lord Buddha
Their minds are unshakable because the fires of desire are quenched with the waters of Dhamma
The quelling and cessation of all conditioning factors is supreme happiness These conditioning factors are really samudaya the source of suffering so when this is ended all that remains is supreme happiness
The means and the results the good and the bad are within all of us who are aware and care
This nature that knows is uniquely suited to all levels of Dhamma up to and including the state of purity and there's nothing apart from this knowledge
Please try steadily to purify this nature that knows ridding it of all obstructions and oppressive influences
There will then be no need to make enquiries about Nibbana for having experienced the purified heart all questions will be finally settled
It's appropriate to stop this Dhamma talk here
The Dhamma of the Lord Buddha was revealed correctly and properly
It was neither hidden nor obscured but was clearly presented on every level according to the truth
For example it states that virtue and wrongdoing heaven and hell Nibbaana all really do exist
It continues unequivocally to maintain that the defilements are also things present and extant
These truths can't be denied
Yet why do such things pose a problem for us
The Dhamma was openly and forthrightly presented
There was nothing esoteric and mysterious about it for it was expounded entirely in accordance with truth  the reality that's present now
It was offered from every aspect and level of truth and yet we still can't understand it
It's as if the Lord Buddha is saying to the blind and the deaf Look here
Look at this
Apparently we must be like those blind people who can only grope around but can't actually see
Even though we know that the Lord has already explained all about it we still always seem to bump into suffering
We've been told that suffering isn't something to welcome and yet we are constantly caught up by it
This is because our motives  the causes we put into effect  become aimed entirely at amassing the fire of suffering to heap on ourselves
One quality of Dhamma that the Lord has pointed out is that it is visible here and now  sanditthiko
Happiness and suffering can both be seen and experienced within ourselves
Death is one example of this
The other qualities of ehipassiko and opanayiko are also very important principles
Ehipassiko means 'calling one to come and see' the genuine Dhamma
This though does not mean that we should go out calling other people to come and see it
'Ehi' refers to teaching the one listening to Dhamma and practicing it so turn your heart to look inwards to where the truth is found
Using more worldly terms we can say that the truth is constantly proclaiming itself constantly inviting and challenging  because of its candour and honesty it challenges us to look here
This 'ehi' invites you to look rather than getting other people to come and see
How can others see when they neither know the truth nor where to look for it
The truth is in themselves but if they don't search for it there then they are certainly not going to find the truth inside us
Ehipassiko  the Lord taught us to look at the truth the truth about ourselves that is right here
Opanayiko means to 'bring within'
Whatever we see or hear or touch needs leading inside so that we can make good use of it
Anything coming into contact through the eyes ears nose tongue and body or appearing in the heart must always be opanayiko  brought inward
Whether it is concerned with goodness or wickedness happiness or suffering the internal or external past or future it must all  opanayiko  incline towards the heart
For this is the principle source of all internal affairs
The heart is preeminent and nothing surpasses it in importance
The issue of the heart is therefore pressing and critical All dhammas originate from the heart
This statement alone is enough to shake up the entire physical world
One's slightest movement must originate in the mind and in fact all dhammas must look to the heart as being foremost
Only the heart is able to know about all the various things
What are these various kinds of dhamma
There are wholesome dhammas and unwholesome dhammas These are only found in the heart
Wholesome dhammas come from the resourcefulness and cleverness of the heart which enables it to respond quickly and appropriately to the ongoing situation
In fact the various issues and consequences of these ongoing events spring from our own heart
When unwholesome dhamma arises in the heart bring up the investigative wisdom of wholesome dhamma to examine and rectify our foolishness  which is that unwholesome dhamma  so that it can be disposed of
Opanayiko is the inclining drawing inward of any experience
Whether it be one of foolishness or cleverness happiness or suffering coming from anyone whatsoever it all needs to be brought inside and made a lesson for the heart
Ehipassiko is the viewing of the point source the well spring of all issues
And that is the heart
It's involved in neverending activity outperforming commonplace machinery that starts and stops according to its fixed schedule
The heart is never shut down but goes on and on until the last day of life
It makes no difference how much we grumble and complain about the suffering involved in this state of affairs
Only by correcting it at its root cause will there be any practical value
Rectify the cause and the resultant suffering will diminish  in proportion to the proficiency of our circumspection and wise judgment
The Lord Buddha never pointed away from these principles for that would be like teaching one to catch hold of distant shadows
There over there  whereby one overlooks the real perpetrator the original cause
This is of paramount importance because that's where the defilements are born
What are we going to do
How are we going to cope
What is the origin of the suffering and the hardship that all beings must endure
What is the source of birth aging sickness and death
The defilements are the source and the primemover and yet they themselves can only arise in the heart
They are right here
That's why the Lord didn't teach about other places
So when we get down seriously to investigate the structure the cause and effect of all this and gradually see the truth and steadily uproot the defilement  we must do it here
This is the spot where our ignorance and stupidity binds and confines us allowing the defilements to accumulate and grow
This is also the place where mindfulness and wisdom as they increase in their range and discernment must uproot the defilements
Mindfulness must be maintained there with care and vigilance
This place  which is the heart  needs to be closely protected and sustained nourished with mindfulness and with meditation
Mindfulness protects the heart by not allowing it to stray outside whereby it would involve itself in external affairs and finally return with fire
From protection one moves to eradication by analysing and probing into the reasons for this situation
We must then try to correct whatever is detrimental by examining its fundamental nature and rectifying it at its place of origin
The essential point at issue lies with the heart
It is the heart that takes up birth and endlessly wanders through the repeated cycles of birth and death
The accumulated corpses of just one person would be enough to fill the whole world  yet ignorance so blinds the 'owner' that nothing is known about the true extent of the situation
What remains is just deception and delusion where no essence of truth can be found
This is where you should try to advance your mindfulness so that it can come to terms with the thoughts and imaginings bubbling up in the heart
With awareness in attendance the slightest rippling of agitation in the heart will simultaneously arouse 'mindfulness and wisdom' As we sit and watch right at the place where all developments originate  right at the heart  we will gradually start to notice the first flurries of activity
This is where the deception of the heart begins and the heart will need wisdom to get to the truth of it
We'll also have to investigate the nature of the body until insight is implanted in the heart so that the truth of each bodily part is deeply felt by the heart
By repeatedly examining and going over each part the heart will understand more and more and the initial understanding will deepen to profound conviction
Form
Listen what is this form
Hair of the head hair of the body nails teeth and skin flesh sinews and bones These are all form
This includes every internal bodily part and organ that is on the physical and material side
The Lord called this the form aggregate or simply the body
All right then
Let's look at this
While exploring and probing mindfulness will need to follow each observation of a part or organ of the body
Let mindfulness direct the work of investigation being constantly in attendance
Let wisdom screen and process the information for a more and more subtle understanding
This is our work and task
Our previous occupation with thinking and imagining with drifting and wandering always lacking in mindfulness has been of enormous harm to the heart
Whereas this other work is directly leading to the ending of the internal suffering and danger
Mindfulness holds down each piece of work while wisdom explores and knowledge follows through each bodily part and provides a guideline for the heart to follow
Mindfulness and wisdom must constantly follow along closely as writing follows the ruled line
This is the 'Kammatthana Tour' the sightseeing meditation trip around the cemetery found within ourselves
You must not allow wishful overeagerness for a speedy realization to interfere with the investigation
Keep your understanding following what is currently being investigated
Continue the analysis and differentiate and penetrate into the nature of this bodily aggregate
It's covered with a mere membrane of skin  that still manages to deceive the eyes of us all
It's not even as thick as a palmleaf manuscript
That's skin
Yet whichever way your investigations proceed they must always be aimed at the overcoming of delusion
That won't be all for they will soon start to become a quite fascinating and absorbing exercise too
Alright
Let's take this body and look up to the top and down to the bottom
Let's see its outside and its inside
Let's immerse ourselves in this tour not merely 'going along for the ride' but with mindfulness in full attendance together with wisdom checking each experience
In this way wherever you look you'll find the true Dhamma
This can be considered the work of purging and eliminating the poison of attachment which infiltrates and infects every part of the body
It is primarily because of this attachment that suffering is spread everywhere
This 'universal suffering' refers to the suffering in the heart caused by attachment rather than any other sort
The bodily pain and suffering arising from illness  the aggregates must always fall under the law of impermanence suffering and notself  was experienced by the Lord Buddha and the noble disciples
But the heart that has transcended those conditions or is in a position to do so can observe  without negligence  these things so that it's no longer affected by them
This is because the envisioning of oneself is done so that you can investigate and get to the truth
This is the important factor in preventing anything from affecting the heart
In other words suffering can no longer arise within because the body is no longer imagined and credited as being 'me' or 'mine'
Examine this body
Probe right into it
Alright then what is skin really like
How about those animal hides that are made into handbags and shoes
Let's look at the whole lot the flesh sinews and bone
See here
Both animal flesh and human flesh are much the same
Delve into it  what's the nature of bone
What's the difference between animal and human bone
Look to see the full truth within yourself
Carry on in
Penetrating this body that inherently poses such a challenge to us
So why can't we fathom it out
Why isn't the heart bold and courageous
Once we begin to see the truth it will be enough to start challenging the deception
The truth realized with wisdom is potent and able gradually to wipe out those false and treacherous views until they are entirely eliminated
The truth that appears within the heart arises through mindfulness and wisdom
This truth is valid in two aspects or conditions In one respect there's the truth of the aggregates whose very existence offers us a challenge
And then when wisdom has fathomed and realized the truth of those conditions there will be the truth within the heart
Such is the way of uprooting the defilements
Once these two truths meet and connect they are no longer harmful and will expel all the poison and danger out from the heart
While on the 'Kammatthana sightseeing tour' of the body we have examined and investigated its various organs both large and small
Now we have to continue this Kammatthana trip to see how this body ends in transformation and dissolution
We must fix our attention here to see in what way it will decay and rot until it has disintegrated and dispersed
The body must definitely go this way though which aspects we target can be adjusted according to inclination and preference
Suppose that we wish to fix our attention on one particular object so as to clearly see it within the heart
Whatever object we take  skin for instance  must be firmly held and targeted so that it appears as an image in the heart
Should the image appear high or low don't speculate about its position
The object under investigation must be taken as the target for our awareness with mindfulness directing the way without distraction
However much the object might appear to expand just see it as it is in the present
Whether it's high or low let there just be awareness of that without wondering if it's too high or too low or has already left the body
At first we might wonder why it is that although we set our investigation inside the body the particular part now seems to be external to it
Don't allow such thoughts to intervene
By not permitting awareness to wander from its target  whatever position it may have assumed  the object will give us a sight of 'the extraordinary and wondrous'
For example if you concentrate on flesh of whatever part of the body see it clearly within yourself and then you'll observe that it will gradually transform itself
With mindfulness firmly established  which is when we have undivided attention firmly fixed in front of us  the heart will know that it is doing the work and that wisdom is doing the analysis
In a short while that object begins to transform itself
It starts to decay and decompose
Right then
Let's get to see this clearly without fear of death
Why should we be afraid when we are looking at the truth of the matter and not our own mortality
Go ahead then let it disintegrate
I did my own investigations in this way
Each of the different bodilyparts just brokeup
It was really fascinating doing this investigation this exploration into one's own body
Yet while being absorbed in the investigation it then seemed as if the body had completely disappeared
Awareness of the body was not apparent even though I was investigating the body
So
The body disintegrates
The head falls off and an arm breaks off right there in front of one
Then the other arm goes and a length of bone and everything inside ruptures and bursts out
Keep on looking
Be absorbed in watching the body as it falls apart
Some of the bodily fluids seep out into the ground and some evaporate into the air
That's the way it goes
Once all the liquids are lost into the ground and atmosphere the bodily parts start to dry out and steadily dehydrate until they finally crumble into dust
Then the dust from the bones of the body and the earth itself merge into one
This is seen so clearly
Those more solid parts like a bone for instance could be taken up and seen as if it's burnt in a fire or as it slowly decomposes and crumbles away
Eventually they all seem to have become one with the earth
In this particular investigation both the earth and water elements appeared the most vivid but especially the earth element
The water element seemed to remain as water while neither the air nor fire elements posed any problem
Unlike the courser more solid parts they didn't seem the weighty objects of this investigation and therefore didn't appear so vividly to the heart
Once this stuff had completely dispersed into and become one with the earth the heart was empty and bare
At that moment everything was void
However when you are doing the investigation please don't speculate about such things
Just take the truth within yourself as your own as your living testimony
Don't bring in outside speculation for witness and mode of practice because that's about other people and doesn't belong to you
What you have realized by yourself is your own and whatever that might be let it happen within yourself
Your own realization and experience are what matters
So remember this as you go further
At other times the results of the practice were not always exactly the same
Although they would still be following the natural course of things
On occasion the body would have dispersed into the earth but some skeletal parts were left in a partial state of decomposition
Then a thought appeared in the heart predicting that 'even though they haven't all gone yet what's left is still doomed to return to the earth again'
This when there was no awareness of one's body  yet the heart was still able to create such things
A moment later and the ground suddenly seemed to swell up out of nowhere and the rest of the remains were swallowed up
And so they all were transformed into earth
When that was done the heart turned around to another angle and everything disappeared
Even the ground that had so suddenly swallowed up the bone fragments was no longer there
There was the knowledge and realization that 'Aha
Every part of the body is made of earth and has returned to earth' Then the heart turned around and everything disappeared with only pure awareness remaining
An indescribable feeling of wonder and amazement arose because my investigation had never ended like this before
But now it had actually happened and was vividly perceived and experienced
The heart was now one without a single moment of duality because it was steadfast and constant in a true state of oneness
as soon as the heart begins to stir it will form two with the thought process but here there was absolutely no thought process
All that remained was bare awareness which was marvellous and amazing
At that moment there was no physical world  no trees no mountains
Nothing was present
It was empty and void as if it was all space however there was also no conjectures using such ideas
Only knowingness was present
The heart was stilled like this for hours and then having emerged from that condition any object focused upon appeared empty and void
Such an experience probably only happens once for each practitioner
For me it happened just that one time and has never occurred again
However the investigative process can be repeated and will eventually be successful every time depending on the skillfulness of the heart
The transformation process into earth water air and fire will then be vividly seen every time one investigates it
This repeated experience strengthens the heart familiarizes it with the truth of the elements and enables it steadily to uproot the view that they are 'me' or 'mine'
For that's how things really are  this body is made up of elements when one talks in terms of elements or it's the earth element
It is not 'me' or 'mine' as one's various opinions and imaginings like to impute and depict
Repeated investigations will steadily deepen your insight until you are able clearly to comprehend and detach yourself from seeing the body as 'me' and 'mine'
Then there will be merely the body and we can also say that even that's only a label
We could also call it a conditioned phenomenon if we wanted to
Once this is sufficiently understood nothing can pose a problem any more
Whatever the heart may call it it won't make any difficulties because the problem has always lain solely within the heart
Our problems have to be dealt with by disengaging from fantasy and delusion and by entering into the truth of Dhamma
This is that 'bare awareness' of the 'bare elements'
We might designate body but that's just the bare elements
Turning in towards the heart is bare awareness
We then have the two as the bare truth
Alright then if feeling springs up let it carry on for it's 'elemental' or a natural process similar to the body
This is how they are connected
Perception or notions are concerned with knowledge of the heart's engaging in thought concoctions
We know that it has gone out from the heart and is engaged in a particular thought fabrication or supposition
On becoming aware of this the heart will withdraw and perception will stop straight away
But if we are not aware it will continue on connecting up with this and that in progression like a chain link to link
And it will only stop the moment that mindfulness catches up
For it will then cease to concoct concepts and associations of ideas
This is what is meant by mindfulness matching up  and if it can't catch up with the train of thoughts they will perpetually go on and on
Investigating the body should become one of your major concerns
The Lord Buddha therefore taught the Four Foundations of Mindfulness that are all found within this body and mind
And this includes the Noble Truths
Yet what might be the purpose of all these investigations
They are aimed at enabling the heart to understand the truth of the situation and thereby let go of its deluded attachment
It will then come up against this beingaself
So then when our confused misconceptions concerning the four elements and the five aggregates are resolved we must then turn to investigate the delusion of the heart
See
There is a problem remaining
This level of delusion is more insidious due to the subtle nature of its defilements
We need to move in closer to examine and then decide what to use as the basis for this investigation
We are investigating the heart and the heart is naamadhamma
So are feelings defilements and wisdom itself so it doesn't just apply to the heart
Naamadhamma's are able to coexist and interrelate and this means that the defilements and the heart can associate together
It's wisdom then that must do the probing for it too is a naamadhamma
We must investigate in the same way as we did with the aggregates by differentiating and analysing so as to see through to the true nature
Then we must put the heart in the dock and hit hard at the accused the offender
The heart has gathered its offenses into itself and is conceited thinking itself allwise and allknowing
It thinks it knows everything about this physical world of sense impressions and aggregates
But it doesn't yet know about itself
This is where it gets stuck
This is where it is ignorant
Wisdom must now be turned loose into the heart dissecting and cutting away so as to penetrate it
We must thrust through to that knowingness which is the body of conceited awareness which forms the real delusion of the heart
A careful and thorough scrutiny and analysis of the condition that has infiltrated within the heart will show that it's just another natural process
The heart therefore won't come to ruin by such a rigorous investigation
Nevertheless one's investigation can't be eased back for fear of harming it because if the heart is able to stand up to the truth it will prevail and won't be destroyed
It will be true to its nature and so will not only survive but will go beyond all offenses to purity
Let's see whether the heart will be annihilated or not
Delve and dig into it
Don't be hesitant or over protective of anything not even of the heart
Don't be afraid that the heart will be destroyed or ruined
Once wisdom has completely wiped out the infiltrators every kind of defilement will disappear
For it's this that makes up all the falsity existing within the heart
When the investigation really gets moving properly those things that are vulnerable to dispersion will not be able to resist and will be annihilated
But the nature that can't be annihilated will come through and stand
Please notice therefore that it is the heart that is dominated by the defilements
And that once wisdom has totally shattered and cleared the defilements away the heart will be transformed into the state of purity
This is the genuine purity
How can it vanish
Were it to disappear how could it be pure
That dies that is ruined but this is the genuine deathless the undying
It is undying through purity and doesn't turn  unlike the immortality that spins with the revolving wheel of birth and death
This is the vital truth present in the midst of our aggregates
So we come to the main culprit the one that incites and agitates the heart pressing it into falling for the world for the elements for the aggregates for pain illness and confusion
In truth these things don't have anything to say about the matter
The body is how it is
Feeling arises as it should  it doesn't know that it's pain or pleasure or neutral feeling
It is this heart that goes and gives meaning to them and afterwards is duped by those selfmade meanings
It gains nothing but harm and affliction for itself in the process
We must therefore inquire into this
What can be lost by a vigorous examination into the true state of affairs
If the body should break let it break
It comes like all things in the world under the law of impermanence suffering and notself  just as the Lord always said it did
How can we interfere
Let go of it
If it can't endure then let it go
Everything in this physical world is breaking and dissolving
Some sooner others later but surely our aggregates can't last for aeons and aeons for they too fall under the same law and limit
So let's investigate to see our aggregates according to truth before they break up
This is encompassing allaround wisdom ready clearly to see painful feeling coming on the scene
Alright then
Today we climb into the ring
That's it
Today we are going into the ring to see and realize the truth in accordance with Dhamma
We're certainly not going in there to fall down or collapse
When painfulfeeling arises that's pain's business but the investigation of it belongs to mindfulness and wisdom
We are searching for the truth so how can we be knocked down
We don't do it for our downfall but for victory and for penetrative insight
For the allembracing realization of truth  of every aspect of truth within our heart
Victory will bring us freedom and it's this that is 'the highest blessing'
The Lord said that
The realization of Nibbaana is the highest blessing
So you can see that this is the way to go
Nibbaana is concealed because the heart is covered and obscured by defilements craving and ignorance
This has to be cleared and put right by investigation and an analysis to gain insight into the truth
It is the way to uncover and reveal all the things that have been hidden
It's called the way of realizing Nibbaana and seeing it clearly within the heart  here is the highest blessing
What can be any higher than this
From here on it is
Whatever comes into contact this heart is no longer shaken or upset
Nothing can reach it or affect it Asoka viraja khema etam mangalamuttama
This is the secure and blissful heart  khemam  and it is the highest blessing
These two blessings that I've mentioned are found in the heart and nowhere else
It is the heart that is the blessing yet it can also become a bane
Right at this moment we are turning the malediction that has infiltrated our hearts into the benediction 'Nibbaana sacchikiriya'
So then let's open and clear all of this
Tapo ca brahmacariyanca Ariya sacca na dassanam
Here 'tapo' means the burning up of defilements
They sear the heart with their own heat so we must turn on them the dhammatorch which is mindfulness and wisdom
It's putting the heat on the defilements and burning them out
'Ariya Sacca' and 'dassanam' is the realization of the Four Noble Truths Suffering is now fully understood by the heart its Cause is completely relinquished the Path is fully developed to its ultimate level of greatermindfulness and wisdom
All that's left to say is the Cessation of suffering is now fully apparent
This is what is meant by seeing the Truth of Dhamma and the one who truly knows this is the one who reveals Nibbaana
This one is the heart that is no longer shaken and upset by all the worldly dhammas
So then shouldn't we try to reach the essential the heart of the matter
As far as the aggregates and body go well we already have gone into that
It's the heart that really counts
If any thing should break up and come apart well let it
That's the way the world goes along and it's been like that from time immemorial
We have followed that way for so long dying and being born again and again Continuing along the old highway
This socalled 'highway' is really the common course of things the way the world gets along
No one can block this path and all must follow it
Yet surely by now you are starting to have an inkling of the truth
What else can I say I can't present anything more
Please take this up and examine it with care
Don't be careless and complacent
Endeavoring for the realization of Nibbaana is the highest blessing
 Nibbaana sacchikiriya ca etammangalamuttamam
And one day it must definitely belong to the followers of the Lord Buddha to those who determinedly strive on
May I close this Dhamma talk with that
Asokam virajam khemam etam mangalamuttamam
Whenever Ven
Acharn Mun touched on this particular topic in his Dhamma talks or conversation he would always say I think it's in the Muttodaya collection
But there it's only couched in general terms whereas I recorded it in more detail than the compiler of Muttodaya
The Ven
Acharn himself didn't always go into detailed analysis but what he said was enough for us to understand the implications
When he brought up the whole tree trunk the finer points and branches would come along too
What he said was this
The Dhamma of the Lord Buddha is pure by nature but when it comes to stay in an ordinary worldling it becomes counterfeit and is corrupted
Only when it's placed in a Noble One is it the real genuine Dhamma
That was the general way in which he described it
There are many levels of Noble Ones Streamenterers are the first level followed by oncereturners nonreturners and then arahants as the fourth
When we analyze it in this way we can then go on to say that in the hearts of streamenterers the dhamma of streamentry is pure and true but the dhammas of oncereturning nonreturning and arahantship are still corrupted
The streamenterer may commit all these dhammas to memory and fully know the way to reach them yet even so they remain falsified in his heart in spite of his awareness
The oncereturner is still counterfeit on the levels of nonreturning and arahantship while the nonreturner remains false to the dhamma of arahantship
Only when arahantship is attained does every level of the Dhamma become fully complete in the heart with no corruptions at all
Some may argue that 'since the Dhamma of the Lord Buddha is real and pure it must remain so wherever it might be
It can be compared with pure gold which though fallen in the mire is still pure gold
It can't turn into mud or muck'
If we fail to analyze this further it does indeed seem that 'gold can't change into mud'
But who will deny that there isn't any mud around
The dirt is smeared over and contaminates the gold as they lie there together
Is there no difference between gold that has fallen in mud and that which hasn't
Of course there is
How can anyone assert that the pure uncontaminated gold and slime covered gold are both equally pure
Surely there must be a difference
A second illustration could consider food prepared and ready to eat
If the morsel was to drop from our fingers and land in some dirt then what had been eminently eatable becomes unacceptable  and even offensively so
Alternatively if the actual food container is soiled then regardless of how succulent the food appears once it's placed in the dirty vessel it too becomes contaminated
How can it remain pure when it's mixed with dirt
The Dhamma of the Lord Buddha is much the same
In this case the vessel equates to the heart which alone is suitable for receiving Dhamma
However much the heart has been soiled will rub off on the Dhamma when it comes into contact and associates with it
It is this impurity that the Lord described as 'counterfeit and corrupted'
Furthermore although the palmleaf scriptures are Dhamma when we look them up and study them we can only commit them to memory and retain them in mind
Yet that mind is already full with defilements so the Dhamma that comes into the heart is really more a 'rotelearned Dhamma' than the genuine thing
If it is the authentic Dhamma why don't the defilements all disappear from our hearts since each of us has studied and engraved it in our memory
We've gone into every intellectual aspect of Dhamma  including the subject of Nibbana  and yet we can't go beyond the fact that our hearts remain brimful with defilements
This is why 'Dhamma' can be false
Take up the Lord Buddha's Dhamma both the theory and the practice and open it up through practicing what was correctly taught there
Only then will the true Dhamma begin to emerge from what has been memorized
We committed it to memory as an outline and plan ready to put into practice rather than just storing it away
It's similar to the building plans for a house
Regardless of how many hundreds or thousands of designs might have been drawn up they are still merely specifications and not a house
It can't be properly called a house until its construction  following the blue print  is completed
Committing it to memory for practical use is one thing but simply to store it away without any interest in its practical application is something else
Whatever happens that which has been studied must then be put into practice
Having practiced you'll then undoubtedly experience the results of practice which are steady penetrating discernment and realization
We Buddhists should take both the theory and the practice as being basic to the Teaching being its fundamental Dhamma
By so doing the Teaching and its followers will excel in Dhamma in virtue and in the knowledge and understanding that brings calm and peace to both the individual and all the community
The case then is that the Teaching is merely retained in memory or it just remains inscribed on palm leaves
The person goes one way that which has been memorized goes another way and the way of practice goes in yet another direction
They don't harmonize and are all in a constant state of conflict right there in the same individual
Furthermore it also disturbs and annoys other people making them wonder how the followers of the Lord Buddha can be in such a mess
Such criticism is wellfounded and irrefutable
Whatever is wrong must be accepted as such
Once the theory is put into practice the results will be in harmony and you'll truly be able to understand according to your present ability
Whatever your practice has enabled you to experience in the heart can plainly be described
You'll be bold and confident when talking about them without fear of contradiction  for you've seen it for yourself
How could there be any misgivings
There'll be no scruples or twinge of conscience because it isn't a matter of guessing or blind hypothesizing
You spoke from your own experience and insight and didn't plagiarize anybody else
How can it be wrong and how can one be intimidated or shaken
Every one of us is seeking for the truth
We know the truth as far as our ability allows and can talk about it so far as we know it
How then can there be any diffidence or misgivings
There are none of course
It was never said that the Lord Buddha took a 'Nibbana course' at any institution
Nor did he go to any school to study about the Eightfold Path or the Middle Way of Practice
On the contrary this was something he taught himself through analysis and investigation leading up to Enlightenment
He realized and experienced Dhamma to his heart's contentment and then declared this Dhamma to the world
Who can be more accomplished than the Lord Buddha for he is a Selfenlightened One and the founder of the Way of Buddhism
If we wish to match up to the Teaching to find the way to growth and benefit we must make ourselves worthy followers of that Noble Teaching
It then wouldn't be a case of vainly carrying the stack of scriptures
At the same time being unable to use them to make even a scratch on the defilements resident in the heart or to gain any practical value
This doesn't measure up to the reputation of the Lord Buddha nor to the purpose of his Teaching which is the removal and elimination of the defilements
Instead we shoulder the burden of the defilements by merely learning the Dhamma by rote
That's quite contrary to the purpose of the Teaching
And it explains how Dhamma becomes worldly and mundane
The way for Dhamma really to be Dhamma is by the practice that I've already mentioned
When the texts have been studied and one turns to practice only then will the truth be learned
This is because the Lord Buddha's way of teaching was the Wellproclaimed Dhamma
It doesn't go wrong or deviate from this principle unless it's through the practitioner's own misunderstanding
If that happens there isn't much that can be done because it runs contrary to the truth which is Dhamma
The Dhamma Teachings of the Lord Buddha are like merchandise that boldly challenge any test of validity or quality
This 'Dhamma merchandise' regardless of the market place will put all the other products out of business because people are always on the lookout for a good and genuine product
Once they've seen it how can they fail to recognize its worth  even small children can perceive that much
However Dhamma is no material commodity that can be advertised to compete with other products
It can only be appreciated by those who have experienced it and can only be individually realized
Yet this isn't aimed at the accumulation of defilements whether boastfulness or conceit
Every stage of insight and realization is for the sake of uprooting defilements for these are inimical to both oneself and others
How then could one show off and boast  for that's promoting and exhibiting the defilements
That's enough to make anyone sick and it certainly isn't the way to get rid of them
It's because of this that those who practice and understand anything about Dhamma appear serene and at peace
Their speech is appropriate to the circumstances and when there's no reason to say anything they remain silent
They are neither grasping nor covetous but live like a samana responding serenely and appropriately with words or stillness
This is what the Lord referred to when he said
To behold a samana who is free from corruption and perversion is the highest blessing
The samana here can be considered in four stages The first is streamenterer the second nonreturner the third oncereturner and the arahant as the fourth
The standard viewpoint refers to those who have become a samana by virtue of their attainment to the various levels of Dhamma streamentry oncereturning nonreturning and arahantship
All of them are a blessing to those who look to them with respect
This is the external samana
Turning within to the internal samana
We see the first second and third samana in the heart by investigating the Dhammatruth
It's this that uncovers the Path and the Fruit so that they can be clearly perceived within the heart
And it forms another of the highest blessings
We must turn inward for our own benefit or else we will be constantly searching for the external samana always speculating as to who is at what stage
None of the streamenterers oncereturners nonreturners or arahants wear labels or insignia like military officers so how can we pick them out
And if they are genuine how can we know from their behavior and deportment
They would never flaunt their achievement in the gross way the world likes to indulge in
Those with impeccable virtue who seek after and are imbued with the Truth and Dhamma can't possibly behave in this way
Seeking out this kind of samana to pay our respects is far from easy
It's so difficult to know when we might come across them
Instead we should take up the Teaching that points towards those four levels of samana and with application we'll be able to reach those same stages within ourselves
This is by far the most fitting way and really gets us to the heart of the problem without wasting time in hunting for clues and chasing after shadows
When we actually encounter a teacher imbued with truth and Dhamma peaceful in body speech and heart  or better still a first second third or fourth level samana  we mustn't let slip the first second third and fourth levels of samana that could appear within our own hearts
When the necessary conditions are fulfilled we would then definitely reap the fruits of our practice because the Lord Buddha did not reserve those fruits exclusively to himself
Sota means 'stream'
It is the entry into the stream of Nibbana
However we tend rather to indulge in speculation using various theories and models to try to work out what it's really like
'How wide or narrow how deep or shallow how coarse or subtle is this stream' This merely grows into subjective emotional ideas without practical value
In fact 'the stream' refers to the sphere of certitude and assurance of definitely reaching release from suffering
Nevertheless whatever happens stream or no stream as one who practices you should try to have inner peace
It is the heart itself that with constant attention and wholesome care will become Nibbana
A home is a home a house is a house earth is earth water is water air is air and fire is fire
Neither earth sky nor space can become Nibbana nor lead one to Nibbana
Nor can they be developed into a streamenterer oncereturner nonreturner or an arahant
How then can it ever be possible to transform them into Nibbana
It is only the heart through Dhamma practice that is able steadily to uncover the darkness that shrouds the vision of the heart
Peace and happiness will then naturally occur
It hasn't happened before because of those dark things that continually try to provoke agitation in us
Day and night they disturb us with worry and anxiety and confusion and in every position whether standing walking sitting or lying down
These are the defilements that constantly agitate and disturb choking out any peace and calm
The defilements have been an endless source of trouble for all the creatures of the world  even though they may not have been recognized as such
In fact people commonly hold them up as being something good and never give a thought to letting them go
If they are really so wonderful why is there all this grumbling we hear in the world
It's really the defilements that cause all our moaning because it's they that bring about suffering and hardship
So this is why the Lord taught that we have to develop the samana dhamma
'Samana' here means calm and serenity
With calm slowly but steadily the first samana and the second and the third and the fourth appears within our heart
Yet how do we practice to reach these four samana
The Lord explained this in general terms in the First Sermon the Turning of the Dhamma Wheel
Although there it wasn't presented in too great a detail so a beginner in the way of practice might find it quite difficult to understand
The Lord spoke there about
The Noble Truth of Suffering that is birth old age and death are suffering association with the unwanted is suffering separation from the loved is suffering 
This is the story of suffering
Now how does this suffering come about
It arises from birth
Birth is the cause for the arising of suffering
The 'real agent of birth' has its root in 'ignorance conditions the arising of determinations'
Indeed other than avijjaa paccaya sankhaaraa what else can condition birth
The Lord started right here at the principal determinant
Ven
Acharn Mun's way of analysing it was very interesting
He said Thiti bh tam avijjaa paccaya sankhaaraa
How is it possible for ignorance to arise and persist if it has nothing to depend on no father and mother for its origin
It must rely on thiti bhutam avijjaa paccaya sankhaaraa as the basis for birth for life and existence
This can then be separated into three categories
Accompanied by enjoyment and lust and enjoying this and that in other words craving for sensual pleasure craving for being and craving for nonbeing
The Lord called these the Source of Suffering
This is the Noble Truth but what can be used to remedy it
The Noble Truth of the Origin of Suffering is all about the darkening of the heart about a nature that agitates and sullies
Thinking in material terms it's as if the heart is all messed up with dirt and mud
These three cravings that are the source of suffering are the hankering and hunger the inability to continue at ease the loss of peace and the ability to live alone with oneself
Craving is necessarily hungry and ravenous with a driven restless struggling towards sensual pleasure being and non being
This is putting it simply and vividly for that's how it continually hounds and oppresses the heart
The heart is unable to sustain its natural poise because these agents continually come in to upset and disturb so that it can't find any peace
How can we remedy this
The Lord taught the Noble Truth of the Path that begins with right view and right thought
He described this as the Way to overcome that nature or condition that is responsible for creating through the power of craving and discontent all the upheaval and confusion
Once anyone is consumed by desire  and it's just the same for animals  they will openly or covertly take up the chase and using fair means or foul grasp hold of it
This is due to compulsive craving ambition and insatiability with the heart struggling after its desires through torment and suffering
Why suffering
Suffering because of samudaya
And it's this cause that oppresses the hearts of all beings
By day and night whether walking standing sitting or lying down beings of all the realms of existence come under its yoke
As each train of thought goes out only to be taken under its sway what can we do to save the situation
The 'state of the art' instruments to use for the combating and the eradication of these three cravings from the heart are the eight factors of the Path
These are right view right thought right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness and right samadhi
Nothing else can match the Middle Way of Practice
This right view is the seeing of what rightly
For us here now everything is wrongly seen and goes to make up the wrong views of desire for sensual pleasure being and nonbeing
This is the way that our body and heart unfailing take
Why should we feel affection and love
What's the reason behind it
Use mindfulness and wisdom to examine the body which forms the immediate object of affection
We first cherish this body before being attracted to other bodies
This is where you'll find sensual craving
You must get to the bottom of this and find out the reason for such love and affection
So it's love for the skin the flesh the muscles the bones the hair of head and body  Is that it
But whether mine or whoevers' they're much the same
So what's with this fondness
This analysis and dissection is called the right view of the Path
It's that discerning examination that searches out the object of attachment and the reason behind it
What value does this object of attachment bring
Really instead of giving comfort benefit and happiness it brings a blazing fire to sear the heart with suffering and torment
It arises out of the false notion that such an object belongs to me and is myself
This is all nonsense
It's up to wisdom therefore to follow up and straighten out the wrong idea
This was why the Lord taught about the investigation with mindfulness of the body
Probe into it
Examine both inside and out above and below internally and externally
Do it thoroughly and judiciously over and over again until you come to discern it clearly
This is the way of wisdom that is able to quash the craving and thirst of the defilements
It's only right view and right thought can overcome and cure us of our desires for they are factors of the Eightfold Path
And that is the Noble Truth which tames every kind of defilement
This is the way we should go
You must hit hard with mindfulness and wisdom for this is the instrument that can counter any stratagem of the defilements
Without hesitating carefully probe into anywhere that appears dark and obscure  for that's where the viper will be lurking
Whenever wisdom fails to follow up quickly enough that becomes the place for the arising of the views of 'self' of 'creature or 'person' of 'me' or 'they' of 'mine' or 'theirs'
Wisdom must therefore penetrate to see according to the living scriptures  which are this body and mind
The truth will then be revealed and there will be no more notions about 'person' 'animal' 'I' and 'they'
Once wisdom has fathomed the truth the conjurations and suppositions will be seen for the fraud they really are having been designed by those masters of deception the defilements
Wisdom then steadily follows through with its cleanup work until everything had been dealt with
The heart long crushed under the weight of attachment will now be freed and uplifted through mindfulness and wisdom
The 'title deeds' of 'me' and 'mine' and the claims of territorial right especially over the five aggregates will be overturned
These claims have stood since birth  the flesh the sinews and the bones the arms and the legs
Each bodily part has been taken as 'me'
They have been declared 'me' and 'mine' even though they know nothing about such claims
We draw up the boundaries of our own domain and as other things impinge or intrude they give rise to unease and pain to suffering within the heart
It's suffering of heart not only of body which arises because of attraction and possessiveness in the setting out of our domain
The Lord described this examination into the true state of things as 'investigating the Noble Truth with wisdom and right view'
In essence this refers to the correct view concerning the four Noble Truths  the right view about Suffering for instance
Right thought is reflection aimed at uprooting defilements
The Lord divided this into three
First the nonholding of thoughts of malice or enmity against others
This concerns all those defilements based in hostility and resentment
Second not thinking of being cruel to oneself or others
Third is the thought and resolution to be free from all entanglement  free from delight in sense pleasures for example
There's a natural principle that insists that before anything can go out to disturb other people it must affect oneself first
This is where right view comes in to rectify matters for the problem arises due to defilementenforced wrong view
Right thought and right view coming together are like single strands spliced into a strengthened cord
They are the heart's activity the thinking processes and together they become wisdom  the resourcefulness and ingenuity of the heart become one with the heart
When all eight strands combine and splice together as one this is called the Middle Way
Ever since the time of the Lord Buddha this had formed the most fitting way to deal with the defilements
Your investigation needs to be aimed at those things that are currently entangling the heart
They will have to be disentangled using the Path  right thought for example  for only this can rid the heart of defilements
By using mindfulness and wisdom we can investigate and challenge delusion in the arena of the body and aggregates
These will form our target so we must penetrate to their true nature
Personally I find that it goes against the grain to teach from other angles  but elucidating on these themes goes right to the heart because these things are for real
The defilements and the Path are both found here
The Four Noble Truths exist right here
As the Path steadily quells defilements so the Cessation of suffering comes about for it's dependent on the strength of the Path that is the factor moving things along
It is mindfulness and wisdom that subdue and eradicate defilements systematically bringing about the cessation of suffering
It's no good thinking anyone can aim at putting an end to suffering without treading the Path
The Lord said that Cessation had to be clearly realized yet the only way to achieve that is through the Path
Concentrating all one's efforts on knowing Cessation without having the Path to clear the way can't succeed because this Dhamma is the fruit of the Path
The Lord taught about all these conditions
However the important principle to remember is that mindfulness and wisdom have to be fixed on a particular point and from there they will steadily resonate through to all four Noble Truths
They simultaneously work together like the various parts of a single clockwork mechanism
Trying to distinguish each independent function would be as confusing as trying to follow individual ox tracks inside the stall
It's just not possible
We therefore should investigate a single object within the r pa or naama dhammas the body or mind
For example by taking up one of the many different bodily parts
Although feeling may arise during this investigation there shouldn't be any upset or bother because while the body is r pa feeling is mental phenomenon
Where is 'this self' 'this creature' 'this person' 'this me' or 'them'
All feeling whether pleasant or painful has similar characteristics  there's nothing there about self creatures or people  and they're just mental phenomena arising in the heart
The heart can be aware of an arising condition
That it has attributes of pain or pleasure and will disappear following those causes that lead to its ceasing
Alright then
There is a way for wisdom to discern the situation because these things really are present
They manifest themselves openly without being mysterious or hidden entirely dependent on their root causes
The bodily aggregate We are with this body day in day out  putting it to bed lulling it to sleep discharging its wastes standing it up and taking it for walks
The aggregate of feeling is also constantly manifesting itself even right at this very moment
If it isn't pleasant it's painful as feelings alternate and change
The important point is that the heart doesn't take on board that pain and suffering
When pain is present be aware that it is part of the aggregates with their impermanence suffering and notself
If you don't allow the heart to involve itself with them it won't be suffering
Feeling  I've talked about this each day so listen carefully and get to understand it
The defilements tenaciously cling to these five aggregates and they've done it day after day for countless ages
This is why it's inadequate to think of making an examination every now and again
The occasional Dhamma talk is also insufficient for the point needs repeatedly driving home until it is definitely understood
You must also repeatedly examine this until you comprehend and then the lettinggo will happen of itself
There
Get to see it clearly
Where is feeling where is painful feeling
If it's present you can't deny its existence nor make it in to something else
It must always be true to its natural state
Perception is recollection
We've been looking back from the day of our birth right up to the present
In all of that have we managed to find anything that's of fundamental significance
If amongst it all there really were 'self 'creature' or 'person' then probably we wouldn't be able to find a chest big enough to store them all  because we're continually recalling more and more of them all the time
Yet really as soon as they are recalled they pass away without remainder
Listen then what sort of essence can be found in them
The thinking processing perpetually concocts from dawn till dusk dusk to dawn
Sometimes it thinks so much that it overheats and the heart becoming exhausted
This may continue to the point of nervous breakdown and may even end up killing someone
For instance take the person who pines away through some sorrow or disappointment
The defilements takeover this aggregate as their concoctingdevice as their tool to keep up the pressure of proliferating thoughts and imaginings
Only mindfulness and wisdom can effectively check this proliferation
When the defilements take over this recollecting and thought processing they can pierce right through to the heart
The results are torment and suffering in no small measure
When it's worse than this it may end with insanity
We are tormented because of so much thinking yet we don't ask ourselves whether it's all worthwhile
Consciousness is the plain awareness of an object present through contact which then dies away together with it
Where in this is any core or substance to be found
It's here with these objects where we fall into delusion
Other than this it's merely the byproduct of the defilements
These are the fundamental principles
This is the way to tread the Path of Practice and it is here that we must investigate to achieve clear insight
In other words this is the Truth of the Path and is the means of correcting and overcoming our delusion
Then as the result of our letting go the heart can be at peace and free from all worries
Death is a basic principle beyond the world's challenge or objection
The laws of impermanence suffering and notself are like a highway for they shape the way and course of nature
If tenure isn't yet up won't break apart but when the time finally comes there's no stopping it  however tenaciously we may cling and hold back
It will just go its own way along the highway the way of nature which takes precedence and can't be blocked or stayed
Nature must take its course for this is an undeniable principle directing things throughout this world
We must investigate so that we can see according to their true nature  as they say 'felling a tree from the windward side'
So don't go against the Lord Buddha's Dhamma that accords with the 'natural course' but rather achieve knowledge by following the truth
The heart will then be at peace
But when the heart coexists with the defilements it dwells in confusion and consequently reaps suffering
We have already seen the harm of this and so must make sure the heart stays with Dhamma with mindfulness and wisdom
The heart will then be safeguarded and at peace
Strive to overcome these things known as 'defilements' wherever you find them
After dealing with the external ones turn to those involved with the body and then inside the heart itself
Deploy wisdom for a complete allround penetration of them  these authors of the concepts of 'creature' and 'person'
All notions of 'self' of 'creature' and 'person' will cease to be a problem the moment the defilements have been entirely dispersed
They will disappear by themselves and we will no longer pointlessly fantasize about them
While the truth remains as it actually is bringing peace of mind and freedom from all anxiety
Yet this peace shouldn't be thought of as the Noble Truth itself  for that is concerned with suffering
It is the suffering of body and heart that is called the Truth of Suffering the Truth of the Source of Suffering is the affair of all defilements and taints the Truth of the Path from right view through to right samadhi is the instrument for the correction and eradication of defilements
The Truth of Cessation follows the steady extinguishing of suffering until the total penetrative realization of the nature of the Source is accomplished
The complete elimination of this Source  which though only existing within the heart makes up the principal culprit  together with that of the defilements is the Truth of the Cessation of Suffering
The one that knows the ending of suffering through the Path's destruction of the defilements is the one that knows freedom
That was the Noble Truth and this is Freedom
This is the purified one and it is not the Four Noble Truths  for they are the means to an end and when that end is reached they naturally lose their raison d'etre without need of coercion or force
It's a natural consequence just as the stairs lose their significance once we have climbed to our final goal so traveling the Path comes to an end
Mindfulness and wisdom have accomplished their task and the heart has gone beyond  so their instrumental work in dispelling the defilements is over
This is our arrival at the summit
It's the Samana Dhamma the supreme samana the fourth class of recluse
The first samana we encountered in our practice was the streamenterer the second was the oncereturner and the third the nonreturner
The fourth samana is the arahant the Arahatta Dhamma
This is the ultimate and final achievement realized through the Path of Practice that most penetrating and luminous of ways
The four samanas are now found within the heart  Etam mangalamuttamam the highest blessing arises there
There's no need to seek for it elsewhere because when the heart goes beyond all oppressive domination to perfect purity then that itself is the supreme blessing
Whatever has been discussed here about the four Noble Truths or the four samanas is all found within the 'one that knows' and nowhere else
This is the one who can uphold the four samanas through the work of emancipation and who arrives at freedom
In brief 'that which knows' is the one 'with absolute certainty' in consistently being able to deal with anything that comes to awareness
The defilements are capable of ruining many things but they can't destroy the heart
Although they may be up to bringing the heart to experience hardship and suffering they can't possibly annihilate it
This nature is constant
It is upright and consistent and only appears otherwise  taking on differing characteristics  because of the things it associates and involves itself with
Once shaken off and cleaned free of all stain this nature is poised and wholly imperturbable
It's this that people call the 'perfect fourth samana' while in Dhamma terms it's the Arahatta Dhamma inside the heart
This heart is now wholly Dhamma
The citta is Dhamma the Dhamma is citta
Whichever way you want to put it this truth is beyond dispute
There can be no more contradictions because there are no more defilements left to agitate
This is how all issues are resolved
They cease right here
Suffering ends here birth and becoming finish at this point
It can't happen anywhere else
It was from here that birth and existence came into being  this one was the seed of birth and existence because it originates with the defilements which were together with the heart
This is the reason why there is the wandering through the various realms of existence
There has been endless suffering affliction upset and hardship arising from this seed that generates and perpetuates these experiences
Once the cankerous shell and fecund kernel can be completely cut out every difficulty and problem will be removed
Please take up and make sure you examine it until you realize your situation and achieve the results
Whether woman or man ordained or lay the heart of those individuals who practice can attain to this insight and realization
All can succeed because it doesn't depend on gender or age or anything else like that
Therefore may I conclude this Dhamma talk with this
Today is Magha Puja day
It's the day when the Lord Buddha declared his intention to let go of the conditioned state bidding goodbye to the world and to the prison of the cycle of birth and death
He chose to relinquish and discard his body after having carried it for eighty years and throughout that period it had always been an oppressive load to bear
But then such is the nature of this body
Other things in contrast have their times of heaviness and lightness occasionally allowing us to catch a breath
Carrying food and water are heavy when we first shoulder them but become progressively lighter as we steadily use them up
Yet we have been bearing the load of our body since birth and it never seems to get any lighter
It's always heavy
In fact as we advance in years and decline in strength it seems increasingly heavy
That is why the Lord Buddha asserted that
These five aggregates are an extremely heavy burden
Apart from shouldering the heavy load of this form or body there is also painful feeling and the rest of the aggregates
They are not only heavy and oppressive but also have razor sharp barbs that pierce through our body and heart
The Lord Buddha put up with this until he was eighty years old
To put it simply he must have said
Ah
This body is beyond bearing
It's time to leave it
Thus he declared that in three months time he would relinquish his life and lay down the burden
He made the decision on the full moon day of the third lunar month
On that very same day twelve hundred and fifty noble disciples assembled spontaneously and without invitation each coming through his own initiative
The Lord Buddha therefore presented this teaching to the arahant disciples delighting them with the bliss of the Buddhadhamma
The gathering thus became the Pure Assembly
Here is a brief outline of what was said on that day
kusalass'uupasampadaa The doing of what is good
Sacitta pariyodapanam The purifying of one's own heart
etam Buddhaanasaasanam
This is the Teaching of the Buddhas
Anuupavaado anuupaghaato Not insulting not harming
paatimokkhe ca samvaro Restraint according to the Patimokkha
Mattanyutaa ca bhattasmim Moderation in taking food
pantanyca sayanaasanam Having a secluded place
Adhicitte ca aayogo Intent on the pure heart
etam Buddhaanasaasanam
This is the Teaching of the Buddhas
The Buddha gave this teaching to the twelve hundred and fifty as a form of diversion on that afternoon which accords with today
For those arahants it was more of an enjoyment than an exhortation because they were already pure no longer needing instruction to cleanse the defilements from their hearts
That is why they were called the Pure Assembly
This was a unique event in the Buddha's teaching life never again were arahant disciples to gatherand be offered such teaching
We celebrate the Buddhas and arahants because of their prodigious and brilliant nature
They were figures of wonder among the majority of people because the worldly people's hearts remain corrupted by the staining defilements  not one of them could compare with the spotless arahants
Sabbapaapassa akaranam to refrain from unwholesome downcasting actions that give rise to all kinds of suffering
It's this base side of the heart that is so critically important
Depraved actions and speech have natural limitations but the depravity of the heart which depresses and downcasts itself is propelled by our own continuous thinking and imagining
It's these agents that drive the heart into gloom and dark depression that are exactly the things in the heart that are already murky and defiled
The Lord Buddha named them 'defilements'
They are those factors that manoeuvre and instigate memory and thought processes into action
While another sort of defilement causes the heart to become gloomy and disconsolate
Wrongdoing and base deeds don't just refer to robbery looting and plundering
That's evil on a gross level but we manage continually to generate similar depravities on the intermediate and more subtle level
This is equivalent to constantly depressing our own heart
This downcast heart will continue to be cast down wherever we may go because we are also generating depression for the heart
Walking standing sitting lying down  the heart is always concocting and contriving and thus becoming miserable in every posture
One aspect of the Lord Buddha's teaching therefore is his emphasizing that we shouldn't indulge in creating gloom and misery for ourselves
What method can we find to avoid this depression
Kusalass' uupasampadaa wisdom must be sufficiently developed to remedy this depression by cleaning out the gloommakers and the base evils we will then have
Sacitta pariyodapanam a bright and cheerful heart
When our cleverness which is mindfulness and wisdom has cleaned out all the filth and gloom from the heart it becomes bright and clear  sacitta pariyodapanam
The evil whether great or small will then start to wane as our heart becomes pure
The Teaching of all the Buddhas is like this
They all say Do it this way
There's no alternative
Any alternative easier way would have been known to the wisest of all the Lord Buddha
He might have woven us all a hammock to lounge in while we steadily swatted at and ridded ourselves of defilements
This might seem to accord with his fame as a teacher full of love and compassion to a world full of frail and grumbling beings
In fact the Lord Buddha had already used all his skill and ability in establishing the shortest and most direct path
Each of the Buddhas had to cultivate the perfections before realizing Buddhahood
They used the Dhamma in their hearts to drive out the defilements and then taught this as the true and correct way
They tested and selected with the maximum power of their minds before discovering and teaching the Dhamma which is most suitable for all living beings
Suitable here does not mean that it fits in with people's own fancies but rather that it points to a practice appropriate to overcoming their defilements
This is Dhamma
Nothing else can surpass the Middle Way of practice as passed on from the Lord Buddha
The defilements fear no other means methods or dhammas
Nothing else can eject them from the heart or even scratch their skins
Anuupavaado Don't slander other people
Anuupaghaato Don't harm or kill human beings or animals
Paatimokkhe ca samvaro Keep your behavior within the bounds of Dhamma for this is the means of uprooting the defilements
Mattanyutaa ca bhattasmim Know the right measure in using food and live simply and frugally
Don't indulge and exceed what is reasonable for one who practices
Know the right amount in whatever you're involved with
Pantanyca sayanaasanam Look for seclusion and use this solitude to deal with the defilements
Adhicitte ca aayogo Develop the heart to excel in Dhamma employing mindfulness and wisdom step by step
This is the essence of the Teaching of all the Buddhas
This was the Dhamma with which the Lord Buddha delighted all the noble disciples
To those who were not yet arahant he also taught sabbapaapassa akaranam
It is an essential practice being the only way we can hope to use gradually to drive the defilements from our heart
Yet do we truly take it to heart
Or is it rather that hammock hanging over there that takes our fancy
The essence of the pure Dhamma imparted by each Buddha is directly drawn from each of their hearts
But do we receive it into ours
The Lord Buddha bequeathed it with his great compassion
But do we receive it with full devotion and trust
With total mind and heart
If we merely feign acceptance of the Dhamma and later come to discard it then it will all have been worthless
It would in fact have gone against the Lord Buddha's original intention
The Lord Buddha decided to relinquish the body on the full moon of the sixth lunar month and made the announcement to that effect on the third month's full moon  which is today
From that moment on the constraints and irritations of the elements and aggregates would vanish
This is the complete passing away without remainder with no more concerns or obligations to any worldly condition
This is the Dhamma transcending the world
The ultimate Dhamma
'World' is the whole gamut of suppositions and assumptions existing in this world  the three worlds are the worlds of supposition and change the worlds governed by impermanence suffering and notself
Whatever one's birth or state these three marks spin that world with confusion and no one can bar their course
But once one has got beyond them all concerns come to an end
Nicchato parinibbuto craving totally ends mundane suppositions are gone
It is out of this Dhamma that all the truths taught by the Lord Buddha resound
If we take this Dhamma deeply to heart in our practice then it will 'ring and roar' in our heart
At first it will resonate in a cool calm and peaceful condition of heart  which are the various levels of samadhi
Then it will reverberate with wisdom in our thinking and analysis so that we can steadily free ourselves
Finally it will resound in the pure state of complete freedom
There
Nicchato parinibutto craving is totally extinguished
The source of those cravings was defilement of every sort because it is never sated or satisfied
Natthi tanhaa samaa nadii the waters of river and ocean can't equal the defilementinspired craving
They perpetually engulf the hearts of sentient beings and never run out
How can we dry up these waters
We must bail them out using the energy of the one who practices until they eventually ebb and diminish
