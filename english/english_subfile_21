A woman prohibited by conventionThis includes close female relatives forbidden as partners by social tradition nuns and other women under a vow of celibacy and those prohibited as partners by the law of the landFrom the standpoint of a woman two kinds of men are considered illicit partnersFor a married woman any man other than her husband is out of boundsThus a married woman violates the precept if she breaks her vow of fidelity to her husbandBut a widow or divorcee is free to remarryFor any woman any man forbidden by convention such as close relatives and those under a vow of celibacy is an illicit partnerBesides these any case of forced violent or coercive sexual union constitutes a transgressionBut in such a case the violation falls only on the offender not on the one compelled to submitThe positive virtue corresponding to the abstinence is for laypeople marital fidelityHusband and wife should each be faithful and devoted to the other content with the relationship and should not risk a breakup to the union by seeking outside partnersThe principle does not however confine sexual relations to the marital unionIt is flexible enough to allow for variations depending on social conventionThe essential purpose as was said is to prevent sexual relations which are hurtful to othersWhen mature independent people though unmarried enter into a sexual relationship through free consent so long as no other person is intentionally harmed no breach of the training factor is involvedOrdained monks and nuns including men and women who have undertaken the eight or ten precepts are obliged to observe celibacyThey must abstain not only from sexual misconduct but from all sexual involvements at least during the period of their vowsThe holy life at its highest aims at complete purity in thought word and deed and this requires turning back the tide of sexual desireRight livelihood is concerned with ensuring that one earns ones living in a righteous wayFor a lay disciple the Buddha teaches that wealth should be gained in accordance with certain standardsOne should acquire it only by legal means not illegally one should acquire it peacefully without coercion or violence one should acquire it honestly not by trickery or deceit and one should acquire it in ways which do not entail harm and suffering for othersThe Buddha mentions five specific kinds of livelihood which bring harm to others and are therefore to be avoided dealing in weapons in living beings in meat production and butchery in poisons and in intoxicantsHe further names several dishonest means of gaining wealth which fall under wrong livelihood practicing deceit treachery soothsaying trickery and usuryObviously any occupation that requires violation of right speech and right action is a wrong form of livelihood but other occupations such as selling weapons or intoxicants may not violate those factors and yet be wrong because of their consequences for othersThe Thai treatise discusses the positive aspects of right livelihood under the three convenient headings of rightness regarding actions rightness regarding persons and rightness regarding objectsRightness regarding actions means that workers should fulfill their duties diligently and conscientiously not idling away time claiming to have worked longer hours than they did or pocketing the companys goodsRightness regarding persons means that due respect and consideration should be shown to employers employees colleagues and customersAn employer for example should assign his workers chores according to their ability pay them adequately promote them when they deserve a promotion and give them occasional vacations and bonusesColleagues should try to cooperate rather than compete while merchants should be equitable in their dealings with customersRightness regarding objects means that in business transactions and sales the articles to be sold should be presented truthfullyThere should be no deceptive advertising misrepresentations of quality or quantity or dishonest manoeuversThe purification of conduct established by the prior three factors serves as the basis for the next division of the path the division of concentrationThis present phase of practice which advances from moral restraint to direct mental training comprises the three factors of right effort right mindfulness and right concentrationIt gains its name from the goal to which it aspires the power of sustained concentration itself required as the support for insightwisdomWisdom is the primary tool for deliverance but the penetrating vision it yields can only open up when the mind has been composed and collectedRight concentration brings the requisite stillness to the mind by unifying it with undistracted focus on a suitable objectTo do so however the factor of concentration needs the aid of effort and mindfulnessRight effort provides the energy demanded by the task right mindfulness the steadying points for awarenessThe commentators illustrate the interdependence of the three factors within the concentration group with a simple simileThree boys go to a park to playWhile walking along they see a tree with flowering tops and decide they want to gather the flowersBut the flowers are beyond the reach even of the tallest boyThen one friend bends down and offers his backThe tall boy climbs up but still hesitates to reach for the flowers from fear of fallingSo the third boy comes over and offers his shoulder for supportThe first boy standing on the back of the second boy then leans on the shoulder of the third boy reaches up and gathers the flowersIn this simile the tall boy who picks the flowers represents concentration with its function of unifying the mindBut to unify the mind concentration needs support the energy provided by right effort which is like the boy who offers his backIt also requires the stabilizing awareness provided by mindfulness which is like the boy who offers his shoulderWhen right concentration receives this support then empowered by right effort and balanced by right mindfulness it can draw in the scattered strands of thought and fix the mind firmly on its objectEnergy the mental factor behind right effort can appear in either wholesome or unwholesome formsThe same factor fuels desire aggression violence and ambition on the one hand and generosity selfdiscipline kindness concentration and understanding on the otherThe exertion involved in right effort is a wholesome form of energy but it is something more specific namely the energy in wholesome states of consciousness directed to liberation from sufferingThis last qualifying phrase is especially importantFor wholesome energy to become a contributor to the path it has to be guided by right view and right intention and to work in association with the other path factorsOtherwise as the energy in ordinary wholesome states of mind it merely engenders an accumulation of merit that ripens within the round of birth and death it does not issue in liberation from the roundTime and again the Buddha has stressed the need for effort for diligence exertion and unflagging perseveranceThe reason why effort is so crucial is that each person has to work out his or her own deliveranceThe Buddha does what he can by pointing out the path to liberation the rest involves putting the path into practice a task that demands energyThis energy is to be applied to the cultivation of the mind which forms the focus of the entire pathThe starting point is the defiled mind afflicted and deluded the goal is the liberated mind purified and illuminated by wisdomWhat comes in between is the unremitting effort to transform the defiled mind into the liberated mindThe work of selfcultivation is not easy  there is no one who can do it for us but ourselves  but it is not impossibleThe Buddha himself and his accomplished disciples provide the living proof that the task is not beyond our reachThey assure us too that anyone who follows the path can accomplish the same goalBut what is needed is effort the work of practice taken up with the determination I shall not give up my efforts until I have attained whatever is attainable by manly perseverance energy and endeavorThe nature of the mental process effects a division of right effort into four great endeavorsThe unwholesome states are the defilements and the thoughts emotions and intentions derived from them whether breaking forth into action or remaining confined withinThe wholesome states are states of mind untainted by defilements especially those conducing to deliveranceEach of the two kinds of mental states imposes a double taskThe unwholesome side requires that the defilements lying dormant be prevented from erupting and that the active defilements already present be expelledThe wholesome side requires that the undeveloped liberating factors first be brought into being then persistently developed to the point of full maturityNow we will examine each of these four divisions of right effort giving special attention to their most fertile field of application the cultivation of the mind through meditationTo prevent the arising of unarisen unwholesome statesHerein the disciple rouses his will to avoid the arising of evil unwholesome states that have not yet arisen and he makes effort stirs up his energy exerts his mind and strivesThe first side of right effort aims at overcoming unwholesome states states of mind tainted by defilementsInsofar as they impede concentration the defilements are usually presented in a fivefold set called the five hindrances sensual desire ill will dullness and drowsiness restlessness and worry and doubtThey receive the name hindrances because they block the path to liberation they grow up and over the mind preventing calm and insight the primary instruments for progressThe first two hindrances sensual desire and ill will are the strongest of the set the most formidable barriers to meditative growth representing respectively the unwholesome roots of greed and aversionThe other three hindrances less toxic but still obstructive are offshoots of delusion usually in association with other defilementsSensual desire is interpreted in two waysSometimes it is understood in a narrow sense as lust for the five strands of sense pleasure ie agreeable sights sounds smells tastes and touches sometimes a broader interpretation is given by which the term becomes inclusive of craving in all its modes whether for sense pleasures wealth power position fame or anything else it can settle uponThe second hindrance ill will is a synonym for aversionIt comprises hatred anger resentment repulsion of every shade whether directed towards other people towards oneself towards objects or towards situationsThe third hindrance dullness and drowsiness is a compound of two factors linked together by their common feature of mental unwieldinessOne is dullness manifest as mental inertia the other is drowsiness seen in mental sinking heaviness of mind or excessive inclination to sleepAt the opposite extreme is the fourth hindrance restlessness and worryThis too is a compound with its two members linked by their common feature of disquietudeRestlessness is agitation or excitement which drives the mind from thought to thought with speed and frenzy worry is remorse over past mistakes and anxiety about their possible undesired consequencesThe fifth hindrance doubt signifies a chronic indecisiveness and lack of resolution not the probing of critical intelligence an attitude encouraged by the Buddha but a persistent inability to commit oneself to the course of spiritual training due to lingering doubts concerning the Buddha his doctrine and his pathThe first effort to be made regarding the hindrances is the effort to prevent the unarisen hindrances from arising this is also called the endeavor to restrainThe effort to hold the hindrances in check is imperative both at the start of meditative training and throughout the course of its developmentFor when the hindrances arise they disperse attention and darken the quality of awareness to the detriment of calm and clarityThe hindrances do not come from outside the mind but from withinThey appear through the activation of certain tendencies constantly lying dormant in the deep recesses of the mental continuum awaiting the opportunity to surfaceGenerally what sparks the hindrances into activity is the input afforded by sense experienceThe physical organism is equipped with five sense faculties each receptive to its own specific kind of data  the eye to forms the ear to sounds the nose to smells the tongue to tastes the body to tangiblesSense objects continuously impinge on the senses which relay the information they receive to the mind where it is processed evaluated and accorded an appropriate responseBut the mind can deal with the impressions it receives in different ways governed in the first place by the manner in which it attends to themWhen the mind adverts to the incoming data carelessly with unwise consideration the sense objects tend to stir up unwholesome statesThey do this either directly through their immediate impact or else indirectly by depositing memory traces which later may swell up as the objects of defiled thoughts images and fantasiesAs a general rule the defilement that is activated corresponds to the object attractive objects provoke desire disagreeable objects provoke ill will and indeterminate objects provoke the defilements connected with delusionSince an uncontrolled response to the sensory input stimulates the latent defilements what is evidently needed to prevent them from arising is control over the sensesThus the Buddha teaches as the discipline for keeping the hindrances in check an exercise called the restraint of the sense facultiesWhen he perceives a form with the eye a sound with the ear an odor with the nose a taste with the tongue an impression with the body or an object with the mind he apprehends neither the sign nor the particularsAnd he strives to ward off that through which evil and unwholesome states greed and sorrow would arise if he remained with unguarded senses and he watches over his senses restrains his sensesRestraint of the senses does not mean denial of the senses retreating into a total withdrawal from the sensory worldThis is impossible and even if it could be achieved the real problem would still not be solved for the defilements lie in the mind not in the sense organs or objectsThe key to sense control is indicated by the phrase not apprehending the sign or the particulars The sign is the objects general appearance insofar as this appearance is grasped as the basis for defiled thoughts the particulars are its less conspicuous featuresIf sense control is lacking the mind roams recklessly over the sense fieldsFirst it grasps the sign which sets the defilements into motion then it explores the particulars which permits them to multiply and thriveTo restrain the senses requires that mindfulness and clear understanding be applied to the encounter with the sense fieldsSense consciousness occurs in a series as a sequence of momentary cognitive acts each having its own special taskThe initial stages in the series occur as automatic functions first the mind adverts to the object then apprehends it then admits the percept examines it and identifies itImmediately following the identification a space opens up in which there occurs a free evaluation of the object leading to the choice of a responseWhen mindfulness is absent the latent defilements pushing for an opportunity to emerge will motivate a wrong considerationOne will grasp the sign of the object explore its details and thereby give the defilements their opportunity on account of greed one will become fascinated by an agreeable object on account of aversion one will be repelled by a disagreeable objectBut when one applies mindfulness to the sensory encounter one nips the cognitive process in the bud before it can evolve into the stages that stimulate the dormant taintsMindfulness holds the hindrances in check by keeping the mind at the level of what is sensedIt rivets awareness on the given preventing the mind from embellishing the datum with ideas born of greed aversion and delusionThen with this lucent awareness as a guide the mind can proceed to comprehend the object as it is without being led astrayTo abandon the arisen unwholesome statesHerein the disciple rouses his will to overcome the evil unwholesome states that have already arisen and he makes effort stirs up his energy exerts his mind and strivesDespite the effort at sense control the defilements may still surfaceThey swell up from the depths of the mental continuum from the buried strata of past accumulations to congeal into unwholesome thoughts and emotionsWhen this happens a new kind of effort becomes necessary the effort to abandon arisen unwholesome states called for short the endeavor to abandonHe does not retain any thought of sensual lust ill will or harmfulness or any other evil and unwholesome states that may have arisen he abandons them dispels them destroys them causes them to disappearJust as a skilled physician has different medicines for different ailments so the Buddha has different antidotes for the different hindrances some equally applicable to all some geared to a particular hindranceIn an important discourse the Buddha explains five techniques for expelling distracting thoughtsThe first is to expel the defiled thought with a wholesome thought which is its exact opposite analogous to the way a carpenter might use a new peg to drive out an old oneFor each of the five hindrances there is a specific remedy a line of meditation designed expressly to deflate it and destroy itThis remedy can be applied intermittently when a hindrance springs up and disrupts meditation on the primary subject or it can be taken as a primary subject itself used to counter a defilement repeatedly seen to be a persistent obstacle to ones practiceBut for the antidote to become effective in the first role as a temporary expedient required by the upsurge of a hindrance it is best to gain some familiarity with it by making it a primary object at least for short periodsFor desire a remedy of general application is the meditation on impermanence which knocks away the underlying prop of clinging the implicit assumption that the objects clung to are stable and durableFor desire in the specific form of sensual lust the most potent antidote is the contemplation of the unattractive nature of the body to be dealt with at greater length in the next chapterIll will meets its proper remedy in the meditation on lovingkindness which banishes all traces of hatred and anger through the methodical radiation of the altruistic wish that all beings be well and happyThe dispelling of dullness and drowsiness calls for a special effort to arouse energy for which several methods are suggested the visualization of a brilliant ball of light getting up and doing a period of brisk walking meditation reflection on death or simply making a firm determination to continue strivingRestlessness and worry are most effectively countered by turning the mind to a simple object that tends to calm it down the method usually recommended is mindfulness of breathing attention to the inandout flow of the breathIn the case of doubt the special remedy is investigation to make inquiries ask questions and study the teachings until the obscure points become clearWhereas this first of the five methods for expelling the hindrances involves a onetoone alignment between a hindrance and its remedy the other four utilize general approachesThe second marshals the forces of shame and moral dread to abandon the unwanted thought one reflects on the thought as vile and ignoble or considers its undesirable consequences until an inner revulsion sets in which drives the thought awayThe third method involves a deliberate diversion of attentionWhen an unwholesome thought arises and clamours to be noticed instead of indulging it one simply shuts it out by redirecting ones attention elsewhere as if closing ones eyes or looking away to avoid an unpleasant sightThe fourth method uses the opposite approachInstead of turning away from the unwanted thought one confronts it directly as an object scrutinizes its features and investigates its sourceWhen this is done the thought quiets down and eventually disappearsFor an unwholesome thought is like a thief it only creates trouble when its operation is concealed but put under observation it becomes tameThe fifth method to be used only as a last resort is suppression  vigorously restraining the unwholesome thought with the power of the will in the way a strong man might throw a weaker man to the ground and keep him pinned there with his weightBy applying these five methods with skill and discretion the Buddha says one becomes a master of all the pathways of thoughtOne is no longer the subject of the mind but its masterWhatever thought one wants to think that one will thinkWhatever thought one does not want to think that one will not thinkEven if unwholesome thoughts occasionally arise one can dispel them immediately just as quickly as a redhot pan will turn to steam a few chance drops of waterTo arouse unarisen wholesome statesHerein the disciple rouses his will to arouse wholesome states that have not yet arisen and he makes effort stirs up his energy exerts his mind and strivesSimultaneously with the removal of defilements right effort also imposes the task of cultivating wholesome states of mindThis involves two divisions the arousing of wholesome states not yet arisen and the maturation of wholesome states already arisenThe first of the two divisions is also known as the endeavor to developThough the wholesome states to be developed can be grouped in various ways  serenity and insight the four foundations of mindfulness the eight factors of the path etc the Buddha lays special stress on a set called the seven factors of enlightenment mindfulness investigation of phenomena energy rapture tranquillity concentration and equanimityThus he develops the factors of enlightenment based on solitude on detachment on cessation and ending in deliverance namely the enlightenment factors of mindfulness investigation of phenomena energy rapture tranquillity concentration and equanimityThe seven states are grouped together as enlightenment factors both because they lead to enlightenment and because they constitute enlightenmentIn the preliminary stages of the path they prepare the way for the great realization in the end they remain as its componentsThe experience of enlightenment perfect and complete understanding is just these seven components working in unison to break all shackles and bring final release from sorrowThe way to enlightenment starts with mindfulnessMindfulness clears the ground for insight into the nature of things by bringing to light phenomena in the now the present moment stripped of all subjective commentary interpretations and projectionsThen when mindfulness has brought the bare phenomena into focus the factor of investigation steps in to search out their characteristics conditions and consequencesWhereas mindfulness is basically receptive investigation is an active factor which unflinchingly probes analyzes and dissects phenomena to uncover their fundamental structuresThe work of investigation requires energy the third factor of enlightenment which mounts in three stagesThe first inceptive energy shakes off lethargy and arouses initial enthusiasmAs the work of contemplation advances energy gathers momentum and enters the second stage perseverance wherein it propels the practice without slackeningFinally at the peak energy reaches the third stage invincibility where it drives contemplation forward leaving the hindrances powerless to stop itAs energy increases the fourth factor of enlightenment is quickenedThis is rapture a pleasurable interest in the objectRapture gradually builds up ascending to ecstatic heights waves of bliss run through the body the mind glows with joy fervor and confidence intensifyBut these experiences as encouraging as they are still contain a flaw they create an excitation verging on restlessnessWith further practice however rapture subsides and a tone of quietness sets in signalling the rise of the fifth factor tranquillityRapture remains present but it is now subdued and the work of contemplation proceeds with selfpossessed serenityTranquillity brings to ripeness concentration the sixth factor onepointed unification of mindThen with the deepening of concentration the last enlightenment factor comes into dominanceThis is equanimity inward poise and balance free from the two defects of excitement and inertiaWhen inertia prevails energy must be aroused when excitement prevails it is necessary to exercise restraintBut when both defects have been vanquished the practice can unfold evenly without need for concernThe mind of equanimity is compared to the driver of a chariot when the horses are moving at a steady pace he neither has to urge them forward nor to hold them back but can just sit comfortably and watch the scenery go byEquanimity has the same onlooking qualityWhen the other factors are balanced the mind remains poised watching the play of phenomenaTo maintain arisen wholesome statesHerein the disciple rouses his will to maintain the wholesome things that have already arisen and not to allow them to disappear but to bring them to growth to maturity and to the full perfection of development and he makes effort stirs up his energy exerts his mind and strivesThis last of the four right efforts aims at maintaining the arisen wholesome factors and bringing them to maturityCalled the endeavor to maintain it is explained as the effort to keep firmly in the mind a favorable object of concentration that has arisen The work of guarding the object causes the seven enlightenment factors to gain stability and gradually increase in strength until they issue in the liberating realizationThis marks the culmination of right effort the goal in which the countless individual acts of exertion finally reach fulfillmentThe Buddha says that the Dhamma the ultimate truth of things is directly visible timeless calling out to be approached and seenHe says further that it is always available to us and that the place where it is to be realized is within oneselfThe ultimate truth the Dhamma is not something mysterious and remote but the truth of our own experienceIt can be reached only by understanding our experience by penetrating it right through to its foundationsThis truth in order to become liberating truth has to be known directlyIt is not enough merely to accept it on faith to believe it on the authority of books or a teacher or to think it out through deductions and inferencesIt has to be known by insight grasped and absorbed by a kind of knowing which is also an immediate seeingWhat brings the field of experience into focus and makes it accessible to insight is a mental faculty called in Pali sati usually translated as mindfulness Mindfulness is presence of mind attentiveness or awarenessYet the kind of awareness involved in mindfulness differs profoundly from the kind of awareness at work in our usual mode of consciousnessAll consciousness involves awareness in the sense of a knowing or experiencing of an objectBut with the practice of mindfulness awareness is applied at a special pitchThe mind is deliberately kept at the level of bare attention a detached observation of what is happening within us and around us in the present momentIn the practice of right mindfulness the mind is trained to remain in the present open quiet and alert contemplating the present eventAll judgments and interpretations have to be suspended or if they occur just registered and droppedThe task is simply to note whatever comes up just as it is occurring riding the changes of events in the way a surfer rides the waves on the seaThe whole process is a way of coming back into the present of standing in the here and now without slipping away without getting swept away by the tides of distracting thoughtsIt might be assumed that we are always aware of the present but this is a mirageOnly seldom do we become aware of the present in the precise way required by the practice of mindfulnessIn ordinary consciousness the mind begins a cognitive process with some impression given in the present but it does not stay with itInstead it uses the immediate impression as a springboard for building blocks of mental constructs which remove it from the sheer facticity of the datumThe cognitive process is generally interpretativeThe mind perceives its object free from conceptualization only brieflyThen immediately after grasping the initial impression it launches on a course of ideation by which it seeks to interpret the object to itself to make it intelligible in terms of its own categories and assumptionsTo bring this about the mind posits concepts joins the concepts into constructs  sets of mutually corroborative concepts  then weaves the constructs together into complex interpretative schemesIn the end the original direct experience has been overrun by ideation and the presented object appears only dimly through dense layers of ideas and views like the moon through a layer of cloudsThe Buddha calls this process of mental construction papañca elaboration embellishment or conceptual proliferation The elaborations block out the presentational immediacy of phenomena they let us know the object only at a distance not as it really isBut the elaborations do not only screen cognition they also serve as a basis for projectionsThe deluded mind cloaked in ignorance projects its own internal constructs outwardly ascribing them to the object as if they really belonged to itAs a result what we know as the final object of cognition what we use as the basis for our values plans and actions is a patchwork product not the original articleTo be sure the product is not wholly illusion not sheer fantasyIt takes whatis given in immediate experience as its groundwork and raw material but along with this it includes something else the embellishments fabricated by the mindThe springs for this process of fabrication hidden from view are the latent defilementsThe defilements create the embellishments project them outwardly and use them as hooks for coming to the surface where they cause further distortionTo correct the erroneous notions is the task of wisdom but for wisdom to discharge its work effectively it needs direct access to the object as it is in itself uncluttered by the conceptual elaborationsThe task of right mindfulness is to clear up the cognitive fieldMindfulness brings to light experience in its pure immediacyIt reveals the object as it is before it has been plastered over with conceptual paint overlaid with interpretationsTo practice mindfulness is thus a matter not so much of doing but of undoing not thinking not judging not associating not planning not imagining not wishingAll these doings of ours are modes of interference ways the mind manipulates experience and tries to establish its dominanceMindfulness undoes the knots and tangles of these doings by simply notingIt does nothing but note watching each occasion of experience as it arises stands and passes awayIn the watching there is no room for clinging no compulsion to saddle things with our desiresThere is only a sustained contemplation of experience in its bare immediacy carefully and precisely and persistentlyMindfulness exercises a powerful grounding functionIt anchors the mind securely in the present so it does not float away into the past and future with their memories regrets fears and hopesThe mind without mindfulness is sometimes compared to a pumpkin the mind established in mindfulness to a stoneA pumpkin placed on the surface of a pond soon floats away and always remains on the waters surfaceBut a stone does not float away it stays where it is put and at once sinks into the water until it reaches bottomSimilarly when mindfulness is strong the mind stays with its object and penetrates its characteristics deeplyIt does not wander and merely skim the surface as the mind destitute of mindfulness doesMindfulness facilitates the achievement of both serenity and insightIt can lead to either deep concentration or wisdom depending on the mode in which it is appliedMerely a slight shift in the mode of application can spell the difference between the course the contemplative process takes whether it descends to deeper levels of inner calm culminating in the stages of absorption the jhanas or whether instead it strips away the veils of delusion to arrive at penetrating insightTo lead to the stages of serenity the primary chore of mindfulness is to keep the mind on the object free from strayingMindfulness serves as the guard charged with the responsibility of making sure that the mind does not slip away from the object to lose itself in random undirected thoughtsIt also keeps watch over the factors stirring in the mind catching the hindrances beneath their camouflages and expelling them before they can cause harmTo lead to insight and the realizations of wisdom mindfulness is exercised in a more differentiated mannerIts task in this phase of practice is to observe to note to discern phenomena with utmost precision until their fundamental characteristics are brought to lightRight mindfulness is cultivated through a practice called the four foundations of mindfulness the mindful contemplation of four objective spheres the body feelings states of mind and phenomenaAs the Buddha explainsAnd what monks is right mindfulnessHerein a monk dwells contemplating the body in the body ardent clearly comprehending and mindful having put away covetousness and grief concerning the worldHe dwells contemplating feelings in feelings states of mind in states of mind phenomena in phenomena ardent clearly comprehending and mindful having put away covetousness and grief concerning the worldThe Buddha says that the four foundations of mindfulness form the only way that leads to the attainment of purity to the overcoming of sorrow and lamentation to the end of pain and grief to the entering upon the right path and the realization of Nibbana They are called the only way not for the purpose of setting forth a narrow dogmatism but to indicate that the attainment of liberation can only issue from the penetrating contemplation of the field of experience undertaken in the practice of right mindfulnessOf the four applications of mindfulness the contemplation of the body is concerned with the material side of existence the other three are concerned principally with the mental sideThe completion of the practice requires all four contemplationsThough no fixed order is laid down in which they are to be taken up the body is generally taken first as the basic sphere of contemplation the others come into view later when mindfulness has gained in strength and clarityLimitations of space do not allow for a complete explanation of all four foundationsHere we have to settle for a brief synopsisThe Buddha begins his exposition of the body with contemplation of the mindfulness of breathingThough not required as a starting point for meditation in actual practice mindfulness of breathing usually serves as the root meditation subject the foundation for the entire course of contemplationIt would be a mistake however to consider this subject merely an exercise for neophytesBy itself mindfulness of breathing can lead to all the stages of the path culminating in full awakeningIn fact it was this meditation subject that the Buddha used on the night of his own enlightenmentHe also reverted to it throughout the years during his solitary retreats and constantly recommended it to the monks praising it as peaceful and sublime an unadulterated blissful abiding which banishes at once and stills evil unwholesome thoughts as soon as they ariseMindfulness of breathing can function so effectively as a subject of meditation because it works with a process that is always available to us the process of respirationWhat it does to turn this process into a basis for meditation is simply to bring it into the range of awareness by making the breath an object of observationThe meditation requires no special intellectual sophistication only awareness of the breathOne merely breathes naturally through the nostrils keeping the breath in mind at the contact point around the nostrils or upper lip where the sensation of breath can be felt as the air moves in and outThere should be no attempt to control the breath or to force it into predetermined rhythms only a mindful contemplation of the natural process of breathing in and outThe awareness of breath cuts through the complexities of discursive thinking rescues us from pointless wandering in the labyrinth of vain imaginings and grounds us solidly in the presentFor whenever we become aware of breathing really aware of it we can be aware of it only in the present never in the past or the futureThe Buddhas exposition of mindfulness of breathing involves four basic stepsThe first two require that a long inhalation or exhalation be noted as it occurs and that a short inhalation or exhalation be noted as it occursOne simply observes the breath moving in and out observing it as closely as possible noting whether the breath is long or shortAs mindfulness grows sharper the breath can be followed through the entire course of its movement from the beginning of an inhalation through its intermediary stages to its end then from the beginning of an exhalation through its intermediary stages to its endThis third step is called clearly perceiving the entire body The fourth step calming the bodily function involves a progressive quieting down of the breath and its associated bodily functions until they become extremely fine and subtleBeyond these four basic steps lie more advanced practices which direct mindfulness of breathing towards deep concentration and insightAnother practice in the contemplation of the body which extends meditation outwards from the confines of a single fixed position is mindfulness of the posturesThe body can assume four basic postures  walking standing sitting and lying down  and a variety of other positions marking the change from one posture to anotherMindfulness of the postures focuses full attention on the body in whatever position it assumes when walking one is aware of walking when standing one is aware of standing when sitting one is aware of sitting when lying down one is aware of lying down when changing postures one is aware of changing posturesThe contemplation of the postures illuminates the impersonal nature of the bodyIt reveals that the body is not a self or the belonging of a self but merely a configuration of living matter subject to the directing influence of volitionThe next exercise carries the extension of mindfulness a step furtherThis exercise called mindfulness and clear comprehension adds to the bare awareness an element of understandingWhen performing any action one performs it with full awareness or clear comprehensionGoing and coming looking ahead and looking aside bending and stretching dressing eating drinking urinating defecating falling asleep waking up speaking remaining silent  all become occasions for the progress of meditation when done with clear comprehensionIn the commentaries clear comprehension is explained as fourfold understanding the purpose of the action ie recognizing its aim and determining whether that aim accords with the Dhamma understanding suitability ie knowing the most efficient means to achieve ones aim understanding the range of meditation ie keeping the mind constantly in a meditative frame even when engaged in action and understanding without delusion ie seeing the action as an impersonal process devoid of a controlling egoentityThis last aspect will be explored more thoroughly in the last chapter on the development of wisdomThe next two sections on mindfulness of the body present analytical contemplations intended to expose the bodys real natureOne of these is the meditation on the bodys unattractiveness already touched on in connection with right effort the other the analysis of the body into the four primary elementsThe first the meditation on unattractiveness is designed to counter infatuation with the body especially in its form of sexual desireThe Buddha teaches that the sexual drive is a manifestation of craving thus a cause of dukkha that has to be reduced and extricated as a precondition for bringing dukkha to an endThe meditation aims at weakening sexual desire by depriving the sexual urge of its cognitive underpinning the perception of the body as sensually alluringSensual desire rises and falls together with this perceptionIt springs up because we view the body as attractive it declines when this perception of beauty is removedThe perception of bodily attractiveness in turn lasts only so long as the body is looked at superficially grasped in terms of selected impressionsTo counter that perception we have to refuse to stop with these impressions but proceed to inspect the body at a deeper level with a probing scrutiny grounded in dispassionPrecisely this is what is undertaken in the meditation on unattractiveness which turns back the tide of sensuality by pulling away its perceptual propThe meditation takes ones own body as object since for a neophyte to start off with the body of another especially a member of the opposite sex might fail to accomplish the desired resultUsing visualization as an aid one mentally dissects the body into its components and investigates them one by one bringing their repulsive nature to lightThe texts mention thirtytwo parts headhairs bodyhairs nails teeth skin flesh sinews bones marrow kidneys heart liver diaphragm spleen lungs large intestines small intestines stomach contents excrement brain bile phlegm pus blood sweat fat tears grease snot spittle sinovial fluid and urineThe repulsiveness of the parts implies the same for the whole the body seen closeup is truly unattractive its beautiful appearance a mirageBut the aim of this meditation must not be misapprehendedThe aim is not to produce aversion and disgust but detachment to extinguish the fire of lust by removing its fuelThe other analytical contemplation deals with the body in a different wayThis meditation called the analysis into elements sets out to counter our innate tendency to identify with the body by exposing the bodys essentially impersonal natureThe means it employs as its name indicates is the mental dissection of the body into the four primary elements referred to by the archaic names earth water fire and air but actually signifying the four principal behavioral modes of matter solidity fluidity heat and oscillationThe solid element is seen most clearly in the bodys solid parts  the organs tissues and bones the fluid element in the bodily fluids the heat element in the bodys temperature the oscillation element in the respiratory processThe break with the identification of the body as I or my self is effected by a widening of perspective after the elements have come into viewHaving analyzed the body into the elements one then considers that all four elements the chief aspects of bodily existence are essentially identical with the chief aspects of external matter with which the body is in constant interchangeWhen one vividly realizes this through prolonged meditation one ceases to identify with the body ceases to cling to itOne sees that the body is nothing more than a particular configuration of changing material processes which support a stream of changing mental processesThere is nothing here that can be considered a truly existent self nothing that can provide a substantial basis for the sense of personal identityThe last exercise in mindfulness of the body is a series of cemetery meditations contemplations of the bodys disintegration after death which may be performed either imaginatively with the aid of pictures or through direct confrontation with a corpseBy any of these means one obtains a clear mental image of a decomposing body then applies the process to ones own body considering This body now so full of life has the same nature and is subject to the same fateIt cannot escape death cannot escape disintegration but must eventually die and decompose Again the purpose of this meditation should not be misunderstoodThe aim is not to indulge in a morbid fascination with death and corpses but to sunder our egoistic clinging to existence with a contemplation sufficiently powerful to break its holdThe clinging to existence subsists through the implicit assumption of permanenceIn the sight of a corpse we meet the teacher who proclaims unambiguously Everything formed is impermanentThe next foundation of mindfulness is feelingThe word feeling is used here not in the sense of emotion but in the narrower sense of the affective tone or hedonic quality of experienceThis may be of three kinds yielding three principal types of feeling pleasant feeling painful feeling and neutral feelingThe Buddha teaches that feeling is an inseparable concomitant of consciousness since every act of knowing is colored by some affective toneThus feeling is present at every moment of experience it may be strong or weak clear or indistinct but some feeling must accompany the cognitionFeeling arises in dependence on a mental event called contactContact marks the coming together of consciousness with the object via a sense faculty it is the factor by virtue of which consciousness touches the object presenting itself to the mind through the sense organThus there are six kinds of contact distinguished by the six sense faculties  eyecontact earcontact nosecontact tonguecontact bodycontact and mindcontact  and six kinds of feeling distinguished by the contact from which they springFeeling acquires special importance as an object of contemplation because it is feeling that usually triggers the latent defilements into activityThe feelings may not be clearly registered but in subtle ways they nourish and sustain the dispositions to unwholesome statesThus when a pleasant feeling arises we fall under the influence of the defilement greed and cling to itWhen a painful feeling occurs we respond with displeasure hate and fear which are aspects of aversionAnd when a neutral feeling occurs we generally do not notice it or let it lull us into a false sense of security  states of mind governed by delusionFrom this it can be seen that each of the root defilements is conditioned by a particular kind of feeling greed by pleasant feeling aversion by painful feeling delusion by neutral feelingBut the link between feelings and the defilements is not a necessary onePleasure does not always have to lead to greed pain to aversion neutral feeling to delusionThe tie between them can be snapped and one essential means for snapping it is mindfulnessFeeling will stir up a defilement only when it is not noticed when it is indulged rather than observedBy turning it into an object of observation mindfulness defuses the feeling so that it cannot provoke an unwholesome responseThen instead of relating to the feeling by way of habit through attachment repulsion or apathy we relate by way of contemplation using the feeling as a springboard for understanding the nature of experienceIn the early stages the contemplation of feeling involves attending to the arisen feelings noting their distinctive qualities pleasant painful neutralThe feeling is noted without identifying with it without taking it to be I or mine or something happening to me Awareness is kept at the level of bare attention one watches each feeling that arises seeing it as merely a feeling a bare mental event shorn of all subjective references all pointers to an egoThe task is simply to note the feelings quality its tone of pleasure pain or neutralityBut as practice advances as one goes on noting each feeling letting it go and noting the next the focus of attention shifts from the qualities of feelings to the process of feeling itselfThe process reveals a ceaseless flux of feelings arising and dissolving succeeding one another without a haltWithin the process there is nothing lastingFeeling itself is only a stream of events occasions of feeling flashing into being moment by moment dissolving as soon as they ariseThus begins the insight into impermanence which as it evolves overturns the three unwholesome rootsThere is no greed for pleasant feelings no aversion for painful feelings no delusion over neutral feelingsAll are seen as merely fleeting and substanceless events devoid of any true enjoyment or basis for involvementWith this foundation of mindfulness we turn from a particular mental factor feeling to the general state of mind to which that factor belongsTo understand what is entailed by this contemplation it is helpful to look at the Buddhist conception of the mindUsually we think of the mind as an enduring faculty remaining identical with itself through the succession of experiencesThough experience changes the mind which undergoes the changing experience seems to remain the same perhaps modified in certain ways but still retaining its identityHowever in the Buddhas teaching the notion of a permanent mental organ is rejectedThe mind is regarded not as a lasting subject of thought feeling and volition but as a sequence of momentary mental acts each distinct and discrete their connections with one another causal rather than substantialA single act of consciousness is called a citta which we shall render a state of mind Each citta consists of many components the chief of which is consciousness itself the basic experiencing of the object consciousness is also called citta the name for the whole being given to its principal partAlong with consciousness every citta contains a set of concomitants called cetasikas mental factorsThese include feeling perception volition the emotions etc in short all the mental functions except the primary knowing of the object which is citta or consciousnessSince consciousness in itself is just a bare experiencing of an object it cannot be differentiated through its own nature but only by way of its associated factors the cetasikasThe cetasikas color the citta and give it its distinctive character thus when we want to pinpoint the citta as an object of contemplation we have to do so by using the cetasikas as indicatorsIn his exposition of the contemplation of the state of mind the Buddha mentions by reference to cetasikas sixteen kinds of citta to be noted the mind with lust the mind without lust the mind with aversion the mind without aversion the mind with delusion the mind without delusion the cramped mind the scattered mind the developed mind the undeveloped mind the surpassable mind the unsurpassable mind the concentrated mind the unconcentrated mind the freed mind the unfreed mindFor practical purposes it is sufficient at the start to focus solely on the first six states noting whether the mind is associated with any of the unwholesome roots or free from themWhen a particular citta is present it is contemplated merely as a citta a state of mindIt is not identified with as I or mine not taken as a self or as something belonging to a selfWhether it is a pure state of mind or a defiled state a lofty state or a low one there should be no elation or dejection only a clear recognition of the stateThe state is simply noted then allowed to pass without clinging to the desired ones or resenting the undesired onesAs contemplation deepens the contents of the mind become increasingly rarefiedIrrelevant flights of thought imagination and emotion subside mindfulness becomes clearer the mind remains intently aware watching its own process of becomingAt times there might appear to be a persisting observer behind the process but with continued practice even this apparent observer disappearsThe mind itself  the seemingly solid stable mind  dissolves into a stream of cittas flashing in and out of being moment by moment coming from nowhere and going nowhere yet continuing in sequence without pauseIn the context of the fourth foundation of mindfulness the multivalent word dhamma has two interconnected meanings as the account in the sutta showsOne meaning is cetasikas the mental factors which are now attended to in their own right apart from their role as coloring the state of mind as was done in the previous contemplationThe other meaning is the elements of actuality the ultimate constituents of experience as structured in the Buddhas teachingTo convey both senses we render dhamma as phenomena for lack of a better alternativeBut when we do so this should not be taken to imply the existence of some noumenon or substance behind the phenomenaThe point of the Buddhas teaching of anatta egolessness is that the basic constituents of actuality are bare phenomena occurring without any noumenal supportThe sutta section on the contemplation of phenomena is divided into five subsections each devoted to a different set of phenomena the five hindrances the five aggregates the six inner and outer sense bases the seven factors of enlightenment and the Four Noble TruthsAmong these the five hindrances and the seven enlightenment factors are dhamma in the narrower sense of mental factors the others are dhamma in the broader sense of constituents of actualityIn the present chapter we shall deal briefly only with the two groups that may be regarded as dhamma in the sense of mental factorsWe already touched on both of these in relation to right effort now we shall consider them in specific connection with the practice of right mindfulnessWe shall discuss the other types of dhamma  the five aggregates and the six senses  in the final chapter in relation to the development of wisdomThe five hindrances and seven factors of enlightenment require special attention because they are the principal impediments and aids to liberationThe hindrances  sensual desire ill will dullness and drowsiness restlessness and worry and doubt  generally become manifest in an early stage of practice soon after the initial expectations and gross disturbances subside and the subtle tendencies find the opportunity to surfaceWhenever one of the hindrances crops up its presence should be noted then when it fades away a note should be made of its disappearanceTo ensure that the hindrances are kept under control an element of comprehension is needed we have to understand how the hindrances arise how they can be removed and how they can be prevented from arising in the futureA similar mode of contemplation is to be applied to the seven factors of enlightenment mindfulness investigation energy rapture tranquillity concentration and equanimityWhen any one of these factors arises its presence should be notedThen after noting its presence one has to investigate to discover how it arises and how it can be maturedWhen they first spring up the enlightenment factors are weak but with consistent cultivation they accumulate strengthMindfulness initiates the contemplative processWhen it becomes wellestablished it arouses investigation the probing quality of intelligenceInvestigation in turn calls forth energy energy gives rise to rapture rapture leads to tranquillity tranquillity to onepointed concentration and concentration to equanimityThus the whole evolving course of practice leading to enlightenment begins with mindfulness which remains throughout as the regulating power ensuring that the mind is clear cognizant and balancedThe eighth factor of the path is right concentration in Pali samma samadhiConcentration represents an intensification of a mental factor present in every state of consciousnessThis factor onepointedness of mind has the function of unifying the other mental factors in the task of cognitionIt is the factor responsible for the individuating aspect of consciousness ensuring that every citta or act of mind remains centered on its objectAt any given moment the mind must be cognizant of something  a sight a sound a smell a taste a touch or a mental objectThe factor of onepointedness unifies the mind and its other concomitants in the task of cognizing the object while it simultaneously exercises the function of centering all the constituents of the cognitive act on the objectOnepointedness of mind explains the fact that in any act of consciousness there is a central point of focus towards which the entire objective datum points from its outer peripheries to its inner nucleusHowever samadhi is only a particular kind of onepointedness it is not equivalent to onepointedness in its entiretyA gourmet sitting down to a meal an assassin about to slay his victim a soldier on the battlefield  these all act with a concentrated mind but their concentration cannot be characterized as samadhiSamadhi is exclusively wholesome onepointedness the concentration in a wholesome state of mindEven then its range is still narrower it does not signify every form of wholesome concentration but only the intensified concentration that results from a deliberate attempt to raise the mind to a higher more purified level of awarenessThe commentaries define samadhi as the centering of the mind and mental factors rightly and evenly on an objectSamadhi as wholesome concentration collects together the ordinarily dispersed and dissipated stream of mental states to induce an inner unificationThe two salient features of a concentrated mind are unbroken attentiveness to an object and the consequent tranquillity of the mental functions qualities which distinguish it from the unconcentrated mindThe mind untrained in concentration moves in a scattered manner which the Buddha compares to the flapping about of a fish taken from the water and thrown onto dry landIt cannot stay fixed but rushes from idea to idea from thought to thought without inner controlSuch a distracted mind is also a deluded mindOverwhelmed by worries and concerns a constant prey to the defilements it sees things only in fragments distorted by the ripples of random thoughtsBut the mind that has been trained in concentration in contrast can remain focused on its object without distractionThis freedom from distraction further induces a softness and serenity which make the mind an effective instrument for penetrationLike a lake unruffled by any breeze the concentrated mind is a faithful reflector that mirrors whatever is placed before it exactly as it isConcentration can be developed through either of two methods  either as the goal of a system of practice directed expressly towards the attainment of deep concentration at the level of absorption or as the incidental accompaniment of the path intended to generate insightThe former method is called the development of serenity the second the development of insightBoth paths share certain preliminary requirementsFor both moral discipline must be purified the various impediments must be severed the meditator must seek out suitable instruction and must resort to a dwelling conducive to practiceOnce these preliminaries have been dispensed with the meditator on the path of serenity has to obtain an object of meditation something to be used as a focal point for developing concentrationIf the meditator has a qualified teacher the teacher will probably assign him an object judged to be appropriate for his temperamentIf he doesnt have a teacher he will have to select an object himself perhaps after some experimentationThe meditation manuals collect the subjects of serenity meditation into a set of forty called places of work since they are the places where the meditator does the work of practiceThe forty may be listed as followsThe kasinas are devices representing certain primordial qualitiesFour represent the primary elements  the earth water fire and air kasinas four represent colors  the blue yellow red and white kasinas the other two are the light and the space kasinasEach kasina is a concrete object representative of the universal quality it signifiesThus an earth kasina would be a circular disk filled with clayTo develop concentration on the earth kasina the meditator sets the disk in front of him fixes his gaze on it and contemplates earth earth A similar method is used for the other kasinas with appropriate changes to fit the caseThe ten unattractive objects are corpses in different stages of decompositionThis subject appears similar to the contemplation of bodily decay in the mindfulness of the body and in fact in olden times the cremation ground was recommended as the most appropriate place for bothBut the two meditations differ in emphasisIn the mindfulness exercise stress falls on the application of reflective thought the sight of the decaying corpse serving as a stimulus for consideration of ones own eventual death and disintegrationIn this exercise the use of reflective thought is discouragedThe stress instead falls on onepointed mental fixation on the object the less thought the betterThe ten recollections form a miscellaneous collectionThe first three are devotional meditations on the qualities of the Triple Gem  the Buddha the Dhamma and the Sangha they use as their basis standard formulas that have come down in the SuttasThe next three recollections also rely on ancient formulas the meditations on morality generosity and the potential for divinelike qualities in oneselfThen come mindfulness of death the contemplation of the unattractive nature of the body mindfulness of breathing and lastly the recollection of peace a discursive meditation on NibbanaThe four sublime states or divine abodes are the outwardly directed social attitudes  lovingkindness compassion sympathetic joy and equanimity  developed into universal radiations which are gradually extended in range until they encompass all living beingsThe four immaterial states are the objective bases for certain deep levels of absorption the base of infinite space the base of infinite consciousness the base of nothingness and the base of neitherperceptionnornonperceptionThese become accessible as objects only to those who are already adept in concentrationThe one perception is the perception of the repulsiveness of food a discursive topic intended to reduce attachment to the pleasures of the palateThe one analysis is the contemplation of the body in terms of the four primary elements already discussed in the chapter on right mindfulnessWhen such a variety of meditation subjects is presented the aspiring meditator without a teacher might be perplexed as to which to chooseThe manuals divide the forty subjects according to their suitability for different personality typesThus the unattractive objects and the contemplation of the parts of the body are judged to be most suitable for a lustful type the meditation on lovingkindness to be best for a hating type the meditation on the qualities of the Triple Gem to be most effective for a devotional type etcBut for practical purposes the beginner in meditation can generally be advised to start with a simple subject that helps reduce discursive thinkingMental distraction caused by restlessness and scattered thoughts is a common problem faced by persons of all different character types thus a meditator of any temperament can benefit from a subject which promotes a slowing down and stilling of the thought processThe subject generally recommended for its effectiveness in clearing the mind of stray thoughts is mindfulness of breathing which can therefore be suggested as the subject most suitable for beginners as well as veterans seeking a direct approach to deep concentrationOnce the mind settles down and ones thought patterns become easier to notice one might then make use of other subjects to deal with special problems that arise the meditation on lovingkindness may be used to counteract anger and ill will mindfulness of the bodily parts to weaken sensual lust the recollection of the Buddha to inspire faith and devotion the meditation on death to arouse a sense of urgencyThe ability to select the subject appropriate to the situation requires skill but this skill evolves through practice often through simple trialanderror experimentationConcentration is not attained all at once but develops in stagesTo enable our exposition to cover all the stages of concentration we will consider the case of a meditator who follows the entire path of serenity meditation from start to finish and who will make much faster progress than the typical meditator is likely to makeAfter receiving his meditation subject from a teacher or selecting it on his own the meditator retires to a quiet placeThere he assumes the correct meditation posture  the legs crossed comfortably the upper part of the body held straight and erect hands placed one above the other on the lap the head kept steady the mouth and eyes closed the breath flowing naturally and regularly through the nostrilsHe then focuses his mind on the object and tries to keep it there fixed and alertIf the mind strays he notices this quickly catches it and brings it back gently but firmly to the object doing this over and over as often as is necessaryThis initial stage is called preliminary concentration and the object the preliminary signOnce the initial excitement subsides and the mind begins to settle into the practice the five hindrances are likely to arise bubbling up from the depthsSometimes they appear as thoughts sometimes as images sometimes as obsessive emotions surges of desire anger and resentment heaviness of mind agitation doubtsThe hindrances pose a formidable barrier but with patience and sustained effort they can be overcomeTo conquer them the meditator will have to be adroitAt times when a particular hindrance becomes strong he may have to lay aside his primary subject of meditation and take up another subject expressly opposed to the hindranceAt other times he will have to persist with his primary subject despite the bumps along the road bringing his mind back to it again and againAs he goes on striving along the path of concentration his exertion activates five mental factors which come to his aidThese factors are intermittently present in ordinary undirected consciousness but there they lack a unifying bond and thus do not play any special roleHowever when activated by the work of meditation these five factors pick up power link up with one another and steer the mind towards samadhi which they will govern as the jhana factors the factors of absorptionStated in their usual order the five are initial application of mind sustained application of mind rapture happiness and onepointednessInitial application of mind does the work of directing the mind to the objectIt takes the mind lifts it up and drives it into the object the way one drives a nail through a block of woodThis done sustained application of mind anchors the mind on the object keeping it there through its function of examinationTo clarify the difference between these two factors initial application is compared to the striking of a bell sustained application to the bells reverberationsRapture the third factor is the delight and joy that accompany a favorable interest in the object while happiness the fourth factor is the pleasant feeling that accompanies successful concentrationSince rapture and happiness share similar qualities they tend to be confused with each other but the two are not identicalThe difference between them is illustrated by comparing rapture to the joy of a weary desertfarer who sees an oasis in the distance happiness to his pleasure when drinking from the pond and resting in the shadeThe fifth and final factor of absorption is onepointedness which has the pivotal function of unifying the mind on the objectWhen concentration is developed these five factors spring up and counteract the five hindrancesEach absorption factor opposes a particular hindranceInitial application of mind through its work of lifting the mind up to the object counters dullness and drowsinessSustained application by anchoring the mind on the object drives away doubtRapture shuts out ill will happiness excludes restlessness and worry and onepointedness counters sensual desire the most alluring inducement to distractionThus with the strengthening of the absorption factors the hindrances fade out and subsideThey are not yet eradicated  eradication can only be effected by wisdom the third division of the path  but they have been reduced to a state of quiescence where they cannot disrupt the forward movement of concentrationAt the same time that the hindrances are being overpowered by the jhana factors inwardly on the side of the object too certain changes are taking placeThe original object of concentration the preliminary sign is a gross physical object in the case of a kasina it is a disk representing the chosen element or color in the case of mindfulness of breathing the touch sensation of the breath etcBut with the strengthening of concentration the original object gives rise to another object called the learning signFor a kasina this will be a mental image of the disk seen as clearly in the mind as the original object was with the eyes for the breath it will be a reflex image arisen from the touch sensation of the air currents moving around the nostrilsWhen the learning sign appears the meditator leaves off the preliminary sign and fixes his attention on the new objectIn due time still another object will emerge out of the learning signThis object called the counterpart sign is a purified mental image many times brighter and clearer than the learning signThe learning sign is compared to the moon seen behind a cloud the counterpart sign to the moon freed from the cloudSimultaneously with the appearance of the counterpart sign the five absorption factors suppress the five hindrances and the mind enters the stage of concentration called upacarasamadhi access concentration Here in access concentration the mind is drawing close to absorptionIt has entered the neighbourhood of absorption but more work is still needed for it to become fully immersed in the object the defining mark of absorptionWith further practice the factors of concentration gain in strength and bring the mind to absorptionLike access concentration absorption takes the counterpart sign as objectThe two stages of concentration are differentiated neither by the absence of the hindrances nor by the counterpart sign as object these are common to bothWhat differentiates them is the strength of the jhana factorsIn access concentration the jhana factors are present but they lack strength and steadinessThus the mind in this stage is compared to a child who has just learned to walk he takes a few steps falls down gets up walks some more and again falls downBut the mind in absorption is like a man who wants to walk he just gets up and walks straight ahead without hesitationConcentration in the stage of absorption is divided into eight levels each marked by greater depth purity and subtlety than its predecessorThe first four form a set called the four jhanas a word best left untranslated for lack of a suitable equivalent though it can be loosely rendered meditative absorption The second four also form a set the four immaterial statesThe eight have to be attained in progressive order the achievement of any later level being dependent on the mastery of the immediately preceding levelThe four jhanas make up the usual textual definition of right concentrationThus the Buddha saysAnd what monks is right concentrationHerein secluded from sense pleasures secluded from unwholesome states a monk enters and dwells in the first jhana which is accompanied by initial and sustained application of mind and filled with rapture and happiness born of seclusionThen with the subsiding of initial and sustained application of mind by gaining inner confidence and mental unification he enters and dwells in the second jhana which is free from initial and sustained application but is filled with rapture and happiness born of concentrationWith the fading out of rapture he dwells in equanimity mindful and clearly comprehending and he experiences in his own person that bliss of which the noble ones say Happily lives he who is equanimous and mindful  thus he enters and dwells in the third jhanaWith the abandoning of pleasure and pain and with the previous disappearance of joy and grief he enters and dwells in the fourth jhana which has neitherpleasurenorpain and purity of mindfulness due to equanimityThis monks is right concentrationThe jhanas are distinguished by way of their component factorsThe first jhana is constituted by the original set of five absorption factors initial application sustained application rapture happiness and onepointednessAfter attaining the first jhana the meditator is advised to master itOn the one hand he should not fall into complacency over his achievement and neglect sustained practice on the other he should not become overconfident and rush ahead to attain the next jhanaTo master the jhana he should enter it repeatedly and perfect his skill in it until he can attain it remain in it emerge from it and review it without any trouble or difficultyAfter mastering the first jhana the meditator then considers that his attainment has certain defectsThough the jhana is certainly far superior to ordinary sense consciousness more peaceful and blissful it still stands close to sense consciousness and is not far removed from the hindrancesMoreover two of its factors initial application and sustained application appear in time to be rather coarse not as refined as the other factorsThen the meditator renews his practice of concentration intent on overcoming initial and sustained applicationWhen his faculties mature these two factors subside and he enters the second jhanaThis jhana contains only three component factors rapture happiness and onepointednessIt also contains a multiplicity of other constituents the most prominent of which is confidence of mindIn the second jhana the mind becomes more tranquil and more thoroughly unified but when mastered even this state seems gross as it includes rapture an exhilarating factor that inclines to excitationSo the meditator sets out again on his course of training this time resolved on overcoming raptureWhen rapture fades out he enters the third jhanaHere there are only two absorption factors happiness and onepointedness while some other auxiliary states come into ascendency most notably mindfulness clear comprehension and equanimityBut still the meditator sees this attainment is defective in that it contains the feeling of happiness which is gross compared to neutral feeling feeling that is neither pleasant not painfulThus he strives to get beyond even the sublime happiness of the third jhanaWhen he succeeds he enters the fourth jhana which is defined by two factors  onepointedness and neutral feeling  and has a special purity of mindfulness due to the high level of equanimityBeyond the four jhanas lie the four immaterial states levels of absorption in which the mind transcends even the subtlest perception of visualized images still sometimes persisting in the jhanasThe immaterial states are attained not by refining mental factors as are the jhanas but by refining objects by replacing a relatively gross object with a subtler oneThe four attainments are named after their respective objects the base of infinite space the base of infinite consciousness the base of nothingness and the base of neitherperceptionnornonperceptionThese states represent levels of concentration so subtle and remote as to elude clear verbal explanationThe last of the four stands at the apex of mental concentration it is the absolute maximum degree of unification possible for consciousnessBut even so these absorptions reached by the path of serenity meditation as exalted as they are still lack the wisdom of insight and so are not yet sufficient for gaining deliveranceThe kinds of concentration discussed so far arise by fixing the mind upon a single object to the exclusion of other objectsBut apart from these there is another kind of concentration which does not depend upon restricting the range of awarenessThis is called momentary concentrationTo develop momentary concentration the meditator does not deliberately attempt to exclude the multiplicity of phenomena from his field of attentionInstead he simply directs mindfulness to the changing states of mind and body noting any phenomenon that presents itself the task is to maintain a continuous awareness of whatever enters the range of perception clinging to nothingAs he goes on with his noting concentration becomes stronger moment after moment until it becomes established onepointedly on the constantly changing stream of eventsDespite the change in the object the mental unification remains steady and in time acquires a force capable of suppressing the hindrances to a degree equal to that of access concentrationThis fluid mobile concentration is developed by the practice of the four foundations of mindfulness taken up along the path of insight when sufficiently strong it issues in the breakthrough to the last stage of the path the arising of wisdomThough right concentration claims the last place among the factors of the Noble Eightfold Path concentration itself does not mark the paths culminationThe attainment of concentration makes the mind still and steady unifies its concomitants opens vast vistas of bliss serenity and powerBut by itself it does not suffice to reach the highest accomplishment release from the bonds of sufferingTo reach the end of suffering demands that the Eightfold Path be turned into an instrument of discovery that it be used to generate the insights unveiling the ultimate truth of thingsThis requires the combined contributions of all eight factors and thus a new mobilization of right view and right intentionUp to the present point these first two path factors have performed only a preliminary functionNow they have to be taken up again and raised to a higher levelRight view is to become a direct seeing into the real nature of phenomena previously grasped only conceptually right intention to become a true renunciation of defilements born out of deep understandingBefore we turn to the development of wisdom it will be helpful to inquire why concentration is not adequate to the attainment of liberationConcentration does not suffice to bring liberation because it fails to touch the defilements at their fundamental levelThe Buddha teaches that the defilements are stratified into three layers the stage of latent tendency the stage of manifestation and the stage of transgressionThe most deeply grounded is the level of latent tendency where a defilement merely lies dormant without displaying any activityThe second level is the stage of manifestation where a defilement through the impact of some stimulus surges up in the form of unwholesome thoughts emotions and volitionsThen at the third level the defilement passes beyond a purely mental manifestation to motivate some unwholesome action of body or speechHence this level is called the stage of transgressionThe three divisions of the Noble Eightfold Path provide the check against this threefold layering of the defilementsThe first the training in moral discipline restrains unwholesome bodily and verbal activity and thus prevents defilements from reaching the stage of transgressionThe training in concentration provides the safeguard against the stage of manifestationIt removes already manifest defilements and protects the mind from their continued influxBut even though concentration may be pursued to the depths of full absorption it cannot touch the basic source of affliction  the latent tendencies lying dormant in the mental continuumAgainst these concentration is powerless since to root them out calls for more than mental calmWhat it calls for beyond the composure and serenity of the unified mind is wisdom a penetrating vision of phenomena in their fundamental mode of beingWisdom alone can cut off the latent tendencies at their root because the most fundamental member of the set the one which nurtures the others and holds them in place is ignorance and wisdom is the remedy for ignoranceThough verbally a negative unknowing ignorance is not a factual negative a mere privation of right knowledgeIt is rather an insidious and volatile mental factor incessantly at work inserting itself into every compartment of our inner lifeIt distorts cognition dominates volition and determines the entire tone of our existenceAs the Buddha says The element of ignorance is indeed a powerful elementAt the cognitive level which is its most basic sphere of operation ignorance infiltrates our perceptions thoughts and views so that we come to misconstrue our experience overlaying it with multiple strata of delusionsThe most important of these delusions are three the delusions of seeing permanence in the impermanent of seeing satisfaction in the unsatisfactory and of seeing a self in the selflessThus we take ourselves and our world to be solid stable enduring entities despite the ubiquitous reminders that everything is subject to change and destructionWe assume we have an innate right to pleasure and direct our efforts to increasing and intensifying our enjoyment with an anticipatory fervor undaunted by repeated encounters with pain disappointment and frustrationAnd we perceive ourselves as selfcontained egos clinging to the various ideas and images we form of ourselves as the irrefragable truth of our identityWhereas ignorance obscures the true nature of things wisdom removes the veils of distortion enabling us to see phenomena in their fundamental mode of being with the vivacity of direct perceptionThe training in wisdom centers on the development of insight a deep and comprehensive seeing into the nature of existence which fathoms the truth of our being in the only sphere where it is directly accessible to us namely in our own experienceNormally we are immersed in our experience identified with it so completely that we do not comprehend itWe live it but fail to understand its natureDue to this blindness experience comes to be misconstrued worked upon by the delusions of permanence pleasure and selfOf these cognitive distortions the most deeply grounded and resistant is the delusion of self the idea that at the core of our being there exists a truly established I with which we are essentially identifiedThis notion of self the Buddha teaches is an error a mere presupposition lacking a real referentYet though a mere presupposition the idea of self is not inconsequentialTo the contrary it entails consequences that can be calamitousBecause we make the view of self the lookout point from which we survey the world our minds divide everything up into the dualities of I and not I what is mine and what is not mine Then trapped in these dichotomies we fall victim to the defilements they breed the urges to grasp and destroy and finally to the suffering that inevitably followsTo free ourselves from all defilements and suffering the illusion of selfhood that sustains them has to be dispelled exploded by the realization of selflessnessPrecisely this is the task set for the development of wisdomThe first step along the path of development is an analytical oneIn order to uproot the view of self the field of experience has to be laid out in certain sets of factors which are then methodically investigated to ascertain that none of them singly or in combination can be taken as a selfThis analytical treatment of experience so characteristic of the higher reaches of Buddhist philosophical psychology is not intended to suggest that experience like a watch or car can be reduced to an accidental conglomeration of separable partsExperience does have an irreducible unity but this unity is functional rather than substantial it does not require the postulate of a unifying self separate from the factors retaining its identity as a constant amidst the ceaseless fluxThe method of analysis applied most often is that of the five aggregates of clinging material form feeling perception mental formations and consciousnessMaterial form constitutes the material side of existence the bodily organism with its sense faculties and the outer objects of cognitionThe other four aggregates constitute the mental sideFeeling provides the affective tone perception the factor of noting and identifying the mental formations the volitional and emotive elements and consciousness the basic awareness essential to the whole occasion of experienceThe analysis by way of the five aggregates paves the way for an attempt to see experience solely in terms of its constituting factors without slipping in implicit references to an unfindable selfTo gain this perspective requires the development of intensive mindfulness now applied to the fourth foundation the contemplation of the factors of existenceThe disciple will dwell contemplating the five aggregates their arising and passingThe disciple dwells in contemplation of phenomena namely of the five aggregates of clingingHe knows what material form is how it arises how it passes away knows what feeling is how it arises how it passes away knows what perception is how it arises how it passes away knows what mental formations are how they arise how they pass away knows what consciousness is how it arises how it passes awayOr the disciple may instead base his contemplation on the six internal and external spheres of sense experience that is the six sense faculties and their corresponding objects also taking note of the fetters or defilements that arise from such sensory contactsThe disciple dwells in contemplation of phenomena namely of the six internal and external sense basesHe knows the eye and forms the ear and sounds the nose and odors the tongue and tastes the body and tangibles the mind and mental objects and he knows as well the fetter that arises in dependence on themHe understands how the unarisen fetter arises how the arisen fetter is abandoned and how the abandoned fetter does not arise again in the futureThe view of self is further attenuated by examining the factors of existence not analytically but in terms of their relational structureInspection reveals that the aggregates exist solely in dependence on conditionsNothing in the set enjoys the absolute selfsufficiency of being attributed to the assumed I Whatever factors in the bodymind complex be looked at they are found to be dependently arisen tied to the vast net of events extending beyond themselves temporally and spatiallyThe body for example has arisen through the union of sperm and egg and subsists in dependence on food water and airFeeling perception and mental formations occur in dependence on the body with its sense facultiesThey require an object the corresponding consciousness and the contact of the object with the consciousness through the media of the sense facultiesConsciousness in its turn depends on the sentient organism and the entire assemblage of coarisen mental factorsThis whole process of becoming moreover has arisen from the previous lives in this particular chain of existences and inherit all the accumulated kamma of the earlier existencesThus nothing possesses a selfsufficient mode of beingAll conditioned phenomena exist relationally contingent and dependent on other thingsThe above two steps  the factorial analysis and the discernment of relations  help cut away the intellectual adherence to the idea of self but they lack sufficient power to destroy the ingrained clinging to the ego sustained by erroneous perceptionTo uproot this subtle form of egoclinging requires a counteractive perception direct insight into the empty coreless nature of phenomenaSuch an insight is generated by contemplating the factors of existence in terms of their three universal marks  impermanence unsatisfactoriness and selflessnessGenerally the first of the three marks to be discerned is impermanence which at the level of insight does not mean merely that everything eventually comes to an endAt this level it means something deeper and more pervasive namely that conditioned phenomena are in constant process happenings which break up and perish almost as soon as they ariseThe stable objects appearing to the senses reveal themselves to be strings of momentary formations the person posited by common sense dissolves into a current made up of two intertwining streams  a stream of material events the aggregate of material form and a stream of mental events the other four aggregatesWhen impermanence is seen insight into the other two marks closely followsSince the aggregates are constantly breaking up we cannot pin our hopes on them for any lasting satisfactionWhatever expectations we lay on them are bound to be dashed to pieces by their inevitable changeThus when seen with insight they are dukkha suffering in the deepest senseThen as the aggregates are impermanent and unsatisfactory they cannot be taken as selfIf they were self or the belongings of a self we would be able to control them and bend them to our will to make them everlasting sources of blissBut far from being able to exercise such mastery we find them to be grounds of pain and disappointmentSince they cannot be subjected to control these very factors of our being are anatta not a self not the belongings of a self just empty ownerless phenomena occurring in dependence on conditionsWhen the course of insight practice is entered the eight path factors become charged with an intensity previously unknownThey gain in force and fuse together into the unity of a single cohesive path heading towards the goalIn the practice of insight all eight factors and three trainings coexist each is there supporting all the others each makes its own unique contribution to the workThe factors of moral discipline hold the tendencies to transgression in check with such care that even the thought of unethical conduct does not ariseThe factors of the concentration group keep the mind firmly fixed upon the stream of phenomena contemplating whatever arises with impeccable precision free from forgetfulness and distractionRight view as the wisdom of insight grows continually sharper and deeper right intention shows itself in a detachment and steadiness of purpose bringing an unruffled poise to the entire process of contemplationInsight meditation takes as its objective sphere the conditioned formations comprised in the five aggregatesIts task is to uncover their essential characteristics the three marks of impermanence unsatisfactoriness and selflessnessBecause it still deals with the world of conditioned events the Eightfold Path in the stage of insight is called the mundane pathThis designation in no way implies that the path of insight is concerned with mundane goals with achievements falling in the range of samsaraIt aspires to transcendence it leads to liberation but its objective domain of contemplation still lies within the conditioned worldHowever this mundane contemplation of the conditioned serves as the vehicle for reaching the unconditioned for attaining the supramundaneWhen insight meditation reaches its climax when it fully comprehends the impermanence unsatisfactoriness and selflessness of everything formed the mind breaks through the conditioned and realizes the unconditioned NibbanaIt sees Nibbana with direct vision makes it an object of immediate realizationThe breakthrough to the unconditioned is achieved by a type of consciousness or mental event called the supramundane pathThe supramundane path occurs in four stages four supramundane paths each marking a deeper level of realization and issuing in a fuller degree of liberation the fourth and last in complete liberationThe four paths can be achieved in close proximity to one another  for those with extraordinarily sharp faculties even in the same sitting  or they can be spread out over time even over several lifetimesThe supramundane paths share in common the penetration of the Four Noble TruthsThey understand them not conceptually but intuitivelyThey grasp them through vision seeing them with selfvalidating certainty to be the invariable truths of existenceThe vision of the truths which they present is complete at one momentThe four truths are not understood sequentially as in the stage of reflection when thought is the instrument of understandingThey are seen simultaneously to see one truth with the path is to see them allAs the path penetrates the four truths the mind exercises four simultaneous functions one regarding each truthIt fully comprehends the truth of suffering seeing all conditioned existence as stamped with the mark of unsatisfactorinessAt the same time it abandons craving cuts through the mass of egotism and desire that repeatedly gives birth to sufferingAgain the mind realizes cessation the deathless element Nibbana now directly present to the inner eyeAnd fourthly the mind develops the Noble Eightfold Path whose eight factors spring up endowed with tremendous power attained to supramundane stature right view as the direct seeing of Nibbana right intention as the minds application to Nibbana the triad of ethical factors as the checks on moral transgression right effort as the energy in the pathconsciousness right mindfulness as the factor of awareness and right concentration as the minds onepointed focusThis ability of the mind to perform four functions at the same moment is compared to a candles ability to simultaneously burn the wick consume the wax dispel darkness and give lightThe supramundane paths have the special task of eradicating the defilementsPrior to the attainment of the paths in the stages of concentration and even insight meditation the defilements were not cut off but were only debilitated checked and suppressed by the training of the higher mental facultiesBeneath the surface they continued to linger in the form of latent tendenciesBut when the supramundane paths are reached the work of eradication beginsInsofar as they bind us to the round of becoming the defilements are classified into a set of ten fetters as follows personality view doubt clinging to rules and rituals sensual desire aversion desire for finematerial existence desire for immaterial existence conceit restlessness and ignoranceThe four supramundane paths each eliminate a certain layer of defilementsThe first the path of streamentry cuts off the first three fetters the coarsest of the set eliminates them so they can never arise againPersonality view the view of a truly existent self in the five aggregates is cut off since one sees the selfless nature of all phenomenaDoubt is eliminated because one has grasped the truth proclaimed by the Buddha seen it for oneself and so can never again hang back due to uncertaintyAnd clinging to rules and rites is removed since one knows that deliverance can be won only through the practice of the Eightfold Path not through rigid moralism or ceremonial observancesThe path is followed immediately by another state of supramundane consciousness known as the fruit which results from the paths work of cutting off defilementsEach path is followed by its own fruit wherein for a few moments the mind enjoys the blissful peace of Nibbana before descending again to the level of mundane consciousnessThe first fruit is the fruit of streamentry and a person who has gone through the experience of this fruit becomes a streamentererHe has entered the stream of the Dhamma carrying him to final deliveranceHe is bound for liberation and can no longer fall back into the ways of an unenlightened worldlingHe still has certain defilements remaining in his mental makeup and it may take him as long as seven more lives to arrive at the final goal but he has acquired the essential realization needed to reach it and there is no way he can fall awayAn enthusiastic practitioner with sharp faculties after reaching streamentry does not relax his striving but puts forth energy to complete the entire path as swiftly as possibleHe resumes his practice of insight contemplation passes through the ascending stages of insightknowledge and in time reaches the second path the path of the oncereturnerThis supramundane path does not totally eradicate any of the fetters but it attenuates the roots of greed aversion and delusionFollowing the path the meditator experiences its fruit then emerges as a oncereturner who will return to this world at most only one more time before attaining full liberationBut our practitioner again takes up the task of contemplationAt the next stage of supramundane realization he attains the third path the path of the nonreturner with which he cuts off the two fetters of sensual desire and ill willFrom that point on he can never again fall into the grip of any desire for sense pleasure and can never be aroused to anger aversion or discontentAs a nonreturner he will not return to the human state of existence in any future lifeIf he does not reach the last path in this very life then after death he will be reborn in a higher sphere in the finematerial world and there reach deliveranceBut our meditator again puts forth effort develops insight and at its climax enters the fourth path the path of arahatshipWith this path he cuts off the five remaining fetters  desire for finematerial existence and desire for immaterial existence conceit restlessness and ignoranceThe first is the desire for rebirth into the celestial planes made accessible by the four jhanas the planes commonly subsumed under the name the Brahmaworld The second is the desire for rebirth into the four immaterial planes made accessible by the achievement of the four immaterial attainmentsConceit is not the coarse type of pride to which we become disposed through an overestimation of our virtues and talents but the subtle residue of the notion of an ego which subsists even after conceptually explicit views of self have been eradicatedThe texts refer to this type of conceit as the conceit I amRestlessness is the subtle excitement which persists in any mind not yet completely enlightened and ignorance is the fundamental cognitive obscuration which prevents full understanding of the Four Noble TruthsAlthough the grosser grades of ignorance have been scoured from the mind by the wisdom faculty in the first three paths a thin veil of ignorance overlays the truths even in the nonreturnerThe path of arahatship strips away this last veil of ignorance and with it all the residual mental defilementsThis path issues in perfect comprehension of the Four Noble TruthsIt fully fathoms the truth of suffering eradicates the craving from which suffering springs realizes with complete clarity the unconditioned element Nibbana as the cessation of suffering and consummates the development of the eight factors of the Noble Eightfold PathWith the attainment of the fourth path and fruit the disciple emerges as an arahant one who in this very life has been liberated from all bondsThe arahant has walked the Noble Eightfold Path to its end and lives in the assurance stated so often in the formula from the Pali canon Destroyed is birth the holy life has been lived what had to be done has been done there is no coming back to any state of being The arahant is no longer a practitioner of the path but its living embodimentHaving developed the eight factors of the path to their consummation the Liberated One lives in the enjoyment of their fruits enlightenment and final deliveranceThis completes our survey of the Noble Eightfold Path the way to deliverance from suffering taught by the BuddhaThe higher reaches of the path may seem remote from us in our present position the demands of practice may appear difficult to fulfillBut even if the heights of realization are now distant all that we need to reach them lies just beneath our feetThe eight factors of the path are always accessible to us they are mental components which can be established in the mind simply through determination and effortWe have to begin by straightening out our views and clarifying our intentionsThen we have to purify our conduct  our speech action and livelihoodTaking these measures as our foundation we have to apply ourselves with energy and mindfulness to the cultivation of concentration and insightThe rest is a matter of gradual practice and gradual progress without expecting quick resultsFor some progress may be rapid for others it may be slow but the rate at which progress occurs should not cause elation or discouragementLiberation is the inevitable fruit of the path and is bound to blossom forth when there is steady and persistent practiceThe only requirements for reaching the final goal are two to start and to continueIf these requirements are met there is no doubt the goal will be attainedThis is the Dhamma the undeviating lawSamma ditthiRight viewdukkhasamudaye ñanaunderstanding its origindukkhanirodhe ñanaunderstanding its cessationdukkhanirodhagaminipatipadaya

SocietyBhikkhu Bodhi is a Buddhist monk of American nationality born in New York City inAfter completing a doctorate in philosophy at the Claremont Graduate School he came to Sri Lanka for the purpose of entering the SanghaHe received novice ordination in and higher ordination in both under the eminent scholarmonk VenBalangoda Ananda Maitreya with whom he studied Pali and DhammaHe is the author of several works on Theravada Buddhism including four translations of major Pali suttas along with their commentariesSince he has been the Editor for the Buddhist Publication Society and since its PresidentThe Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creedsFounded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topicsIts publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddhas discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practiceThese works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first aroseTranslators note Chao Khun Nararatana prior to his ordination was a member of King Rama VIs personal staff and was so trusted by the king that he was given the rank of chao phraya  the highest Thai rank of conferred nobility  when he was onlyAfter the kings death in he ordained at Wat Thepsirin in Bangkok and remained a monk until passing away from cancer inFrom the year until his death he never left the wat compoundEven though the wat was one of the most lavishly endowed temples in Bangkok Chao Khun Nararatana lived a life of exemplary austerity and was well known for his meditative powersHe left no personal students however and very few writingsThe following piece is a synopsis of some very basic teachings he would give to lay visitorsThese teachings are especially suitable for young peopleEnglish phrases given here in parentheses were in English in the originalTo receive the sympathy and compassion of others depends on a combination of our own good qualities such as energy industry perseverance strength resilience together with a heart of sympathy and compassion toward others without conceit or prideThis is what will cause those around us to feel sympathy compassion and love toward us and to want to give us helpPeople with gentle manners  polite and kind  are bound to attract the love of those who meet them along with their cooperation and helpThis is personal magnetismFor this reason we should try to maintain the qualities mentioned aboveThey will become a means of helping us attain all of our objectives both now and in the futureDont fearKeep yourself pure and nothing will be able to harm youRemember If you want the sympathy of others send thoughts of sympathy in their direction and you will receive their sympathy in return  this is a law of mental dynamics  and all the success you wish for will without a doubt come your wayDiscouraged is a word we shouldnt use and a thing we shouldnt allow in our heartsLet it go and get it outIf you see it arising let it goDont take it inIf you are careless and let it sneak into the heart then as soon as you are aware that discouragement has snuck in you must immediately get it outDont let it feed on the heartOtherwise it will become a habit and you will become weak and debilitated upset over every trifling mistakeDiscouragement is an enemy an obstacleIt makes the mind restless and the nerves disorderedThis in turn causes the body to become disordered  diseased and restless  as wellThe brain becomes dull and murkyDiscouragement is a bad habit a block to clear intelligence and discernmentWe must practice putting the mind back into shapeBefore we do anything while were doing it and after its done we have to practice keeping the mind cheerful and bright with a constant sense of wellbeingThis will help us to gain strength of body and strength of mind and to enjoy livingThe mind will blossom and whatever we have to learn we will understand and remember with ease just as a blossoming flower opens itself to welcome drops of dew and fresh airThe Lord Buddha taught Natthi santi param sukham No other pleasure is greater than peaceWhat this means is that there are other pleasures such as the pleasure of watching a play or a movie mixing with society having a spouse the pleasure of gaining wealth status and praiseThese things are actual pleasures  but they all contain hidden stress they all require continual contriving adjustment and repair  which is where they differ from the pleasure that comes from peace a pleasure that is cool and tranquil without any hidden pain without any need for a great deal of contriving  a pleasure that is easily attained right here in our own body and mindWe can give rise to it while sitting alone in a quiet place or while surrounded by society as long as we have a sense of how to make a separation inclining the heart toward the pleasure of peace so that while the body may be involved in turmoil the turmoil doesnt reach into the heartEven when we are seriously ill with pain racking the entire body if we have a sense of how to put the mind in the pleasure of peace the pain wont be able to disturb the mindAnd once the mind is calm  it can calm the body and cure its pain at the same time experiencing the pleasure of peace  and there is no greater pleasureThe Lord Buddha taught us to practice in three waysWhen we see these truths the mind becomes strong resilient stable and resolute unaffected by events  because we have seen the truth with our own discernment that such things are undependable and unstable that they have to change deteriorate and disband that they dont lie under our powerDont waste your strength of mind trying to force themKeep the mind free and stable at all times unaffected by events  and this will keep the mind firmly established in the pleasure of peaceThe mind will be free and gain power  mind power  which we can use to make all our duties and affairs succeed in accordance with our goalsIt takes a peaceful mind to support a peaceful body and a peaceful body to support a peaceful mind and both a peaceful mind and a peaceful body to attain all the success that you wishOur mistakes are our best teachersWe should be grateful to ourselves for our mistakes and take cheer in the fact that we have met with a special counselor our mistakes in line with the saying Once burned is twice forewarned We have to act on our own and make our own mistakesThese are our best teachers and our best lessons so that we will remember and be careful not to repeat themWe can make a fresh start mindful and uncomplacentOur past mistakes are a thing of the past but our special counselors are still with us ready to whisper their warnings at every instant Be carefulDont be complacentDont repeat that error againThink carefully and youll notice that all scientific researchers as well as all outstanding teachers of the Dhamma have without exception overcome the obstacle of their own mistakes countless timesIn avoiding mistakes the important point is composureIf we have composure guarding our thoughts words and deeds at every moment we wont make any mistakes at allThe mistakes we make are due to lack of composureWere forgetful absentminded heedless complacent exuberant or deluded  and thus we make mistakesRemember the maxim Keep your composure as a protective shield and youll do bravely in the fieldEvery form of life  human animal even plant life  survives through struggle in line with the saying Life is struggle At whatever moment we can no longer keep up the struggle we have to dieSo as long as we keep our composure then even when death comes only the body dies  just as with the life of the Lord Buddha and the arahants They had full composure with every mental moment so that they never made mistakesThat was how they reached deathlessness the state of immortalityThus their death was called parinibbana the disbanding and extinguishing of nothing more than the physical and mental phenomena termed the five aggregates body feeling perception mental processes and consciousnessThus we should develop composure and selfawarenessOnce we are done we should use mindfulness to check back and consider if anything is defective or if everything is in proper orderIf anything is defective then immediately make corrections so as to be perfect the next time aroundIf everything is already in order keep trying to have things in even better order until reaching the ultimateIts through the efficacy of the Triple Training  virtue concentration and discernment  that the enemy  defilement in its gross intermediate and subtle forms  can be overcomeThe gross forms of defilement that transgress in the area of word and deed can be overcome through virtueThe intermediate forms of defilement that arise in the heart  liking and disliking deluded love and deluded hatred  can be overcome through concentrationThe subtle forms of defilement  misunderstandings misperceptions and misconceptions concerning the true nature of natural processes  can be overcome through discernmentA person who studies and practices fully and completely in line with the Triple Training  virtue concentration and discernment  is sure to gain release from all suffering and stress without a doubtThus we should be interested earnest and intent on studying and practicing in line with the Triple Training at all timesThe jasmine is agreed to be the most fragrant of all flowers and the purest whiteThe life of human beings is like a playTry to be the hero or heroine with the best reputation just like the jasmineDont be the villainAnd remember that the jasmine blooms fully only for two or three days and then withers awaySo make yourself your bestMake your life as long as it lasts the most fragrant like the jasmine just beginning to bloomChoose to do only the goodChoose to do only the goodA warning to prepare yourself for the future conduct of your life is the best substitute for a blessing and the most reasonableIf you do good then even if you dont receive blessings youll have to do wellIf you do evil then no matter what blessings can be contrived they cant make you do wellTo do evil is like tossing a rock in the water It will have to sink immediatelyNo one no matter how charismatic can come and charm or plead with the rock to float back up to the surfaceIf you do evil you will have to sink spoiling your dignity your character and your reputation like a heavy rock sunk down into the mudTo do good is like light oil When you pour it on water it is bound to float as an iridescence over the surfaceTo do good adds to your dignity and to your reputationPeople will be sure to praise and respect you to exalt you like the oil that floats over waterEven if you should have enemies intent on hating you reviling you to make you sink they wont have any effect and will simply fall victim to their own effortsSo make up your mind to be courageous in doing only the good without fear or apprehension for any obstacle whatsoeverThe person who trusts in the Triple Gem the person with true happiness the person who prospers achieving his or her desired goals is the person who does only the goodAjaan Khamdee was born into a farming family in Khon Kaen province in northeastern ThailandAt the age of he ordained at the local temple in line with Thai custom but was dissatisfied with the type of practice customary at village templesAs a result in he reordained in the Dhammayut sect and in the following year became a student of Ajaan Singh Khantiyagamo a senior disciple of Ajaan MunTaking up the life of a wandering monk he sought out quiet places in various parts of northeastern Thailand until coming to Tham Phaa Puu in Loei province near the Laotian border inFinding it an ideal place to practice he stayed there for most of the remainder of his life moving down to the foot of the hill below the cave when he became too old to negotiate the climbWellknown as a teacher of strong character and gentle temperament he attracted a large following of students both lay and ordainedBy the time of his death a sizable monastery had grown up around him at the foot of Grandfather CliffThe following passages have been excerpted from talks printed in a book distributed at his funeral inThere are three sorts of Dhamma the Dhamma of theory the Dhamma of practice and the Dhamma of attainmentThe Dhamma of theory refers to the teachings of the Buddha the discourses the discipline the Abhidhamma all sections of the Pali canonThis sort of Dhamma is everyones common propertyAs for practice and attainment theyre the individual property of those who do themFor example VenMoggallanas practice was his own practiceHis attainment of the paths and fruitions leading to nibbana was his own attainmentThe same holds true for VenSariputta and each of the noble disciples all the way down to all of us practicing hereThe practice and attainments of each person are that persons very ownIts like your own land and fieldsThey belong to you theyre not common propertyThe Buddha set out the Dhamma of theory for each of us to practiceWhen we practice it it becomes our ownIf we follow the precepts they become our own precepts our own virtuesIf we practice concentration it becomes our own concentrationIf we attain jhana or any of the paths and fruitions leading to nibbana they become our own attainmentsSo understand this point and practice in line with itKnowledge comes from the practice  from listening intently pondering what weve heard and then making the effort to let go of our evil behavior and do only whats right and goodThese things are called the sources of discernmentIf we dont give rise to the sources of discernment within us well have to be forever foolishIn practicing the Dhamma there have to be causesIf there are no causes there are no resultsIf the causes are good the results will be goodIf the causes are bad the results will be badThis is like things outsideTake fruit for exampleFruit has to come from a tree or a plantIf theres no tree or plant theres no fruitWhen orchard owners are interested in the flowers or fruit of their trees they focus on tending to the roots and trunks of the trees watering them fertilizing them cutting away weeds and protecting them from anything that will pose a danger to themWhen they take good care of the trees in this way the flowers and fruits will come of their own accordIts the same in practicing the DhammaThe Buddha taught us to take good care of what we think say and doIf our thoughts words and deeds are good then whatever we receive in life will have to be goodIf our thoughts words and deeds are bad then whatever we get will all be badIf we get a husband hell be a bad husbandIf we get a wife shell be a bad wifeIf we get children theyll be bad childrenIf we get wealth itll be bad wealthOur problem is that we like good results but dont like creating good causesThere are three things that people generally want in the world beauty of the various parts of the body along with a beautiful complexion intelligence thats quick and sharpFor these three things to come as results they have to depend on causes Beauty comes from observing the precepts and keeping control over your angerEven when anger arises in the mind you dont let it come out in your wordsPeople who have laid this sort of groundwork are reborn with wellproportioned bodies and beautiful complexions Intelligence comes from practicing meditation and associating with wise teachersPeople who have laid this sort of groundwork are reborn discerning and smartTo summarize If we take good care of our thoughts words and deeds well meet with good things in lifeIf we take poor care of our thoughts words and deeds well meet with miserable things to the day we dieThe affairs of the Dhamma arent all that different from the affairs of the worldTake wealth for exampleExternal wealth  your possessions your wealth your status  tends to get lost because of external dangersInternal wealth  your inner goodness and skillful attitudes  tends to get lost because of internal dangersExternal wealth is subject to three kinds of danger danger from flooding danger from fire and danger from thievesIf there werent these three kinds of danger we wouldnt have to spend so much time looking after our external wealthWe could leave our belongings lying around anywhere at allOnce we have wealth and we hold to it as our own we have to look after it and put it in safe keepingThose with a lot of wealth have to deposit it in banks simply to keep it safe because they cant look after it all on their ownThe same holds true with the crops we plant in our fields and orchardsWe have to look after them because theyre subject to dangersFloods can damage them people can steal them animals can break in and eat themIf we dont look after them our wealth and belongings will be lostIn the same way we have to look after our internal wealth our inner goodness and skillful attitudesIf we dont keep looking after these qualities once weve developed them they can disappear through the power of our greed anger and delusionThese three things are our enemiesThey have a great deal of power and influence over all people born into this worldWhether were farmers merchants government officials or whatever we all lie under the power of greed anger and delusionThese three qualities can put knowledgeable people in the dark and can turn smart people into fools so that they act in ways that are mistaken and wrongThis is why the Buddha taught us to be careful to restrain ourselves from these evil influences so that they dont destroy our inner goodness and skillful attitudes so that they dont destroy our knowledge and intelligenceHe taught us to look after our minds so that we can be on the lookout for greed and anger which arise out of delusionHe taught us to be very wary of these thingsYou cant trust that whatever comes into the mind is always you or yoursThis is why we have to train the mind to make up for whatever good qualities it lacks the same as when people study traditional medicine learning about the component parts of the body and all its elements so that when illness arises from a lack or an imbalance in the elements they can find the right medicine to make up the lackSo you have to ponder the wealth of your heart to see what it lacksIs it lacking in convictionPersistenceIs mindfulness weakIs it lacking in concentration so that its distracted and obsessed with its preoccupationsIs it lacking in discernment of whats right and wrongThen make up the lackTo strengthen our conviction our teachers advise us to trust in the principle of action and the results of our actionsTheyve taught us about actions that are skillful and unskillful so that well recognize whats right and wrong and our minds will be inclined to trust our good actionsActually right and wrong lawful and unlawful are easy to seeWeve got the eyes to see and the ears to hearEven though we havent studied the law we can observe whats right and wrong and keep ourselves from breaking the law  because there are people who have provided us with examples of what happens when they do wrongThis way we can choose which way is the good way and which way is notIf we choose the good way its called associating with wise peopleIf we choose a way thats not good thats called associating with evil people and foolsTo develop our conviction in the principle of kamma we have to observe causes and their resultsPeople who have done good things experience ease in body and mind as a resultPeople who have done evil have no peace of mindEven when they lie down they cant rest easilyThieves for example have to hide out in the jungle in order to avoid the authoritiesSo we can see that those who act in good ways can live comfortably with an easy consciencePeople who act in shoddy ways meet with sufferingWhen we reflect in this way we can observe which people or groups we can take as examples for our own behaviorEveryone has to learn from exampleBoxers for instance have to have trainersEven evil people have people theyve taken as their examplesThere are examples for everything good or badSo watch observe and reflect for yourselfGreed anger and delusion are more savage than anything else in the world more savage than ferocious spirits fierce tigers or vicious snakesTheres nothing at all more savage than greed anger and delusionTheyre savage in that greed can make you do savage things to yourself anger can make you hurt yourself delusion can make you harm yourselfYou can get into all kinds of trouble because of delusionIve spent my life  from my youth to my old age  wandering as an ascetic climbing mountains and hills entering forests and jungles and yet I still have yet to see a tiger eat anyone aliveIve heard reports but Ive never seen it with my own eyesI have yet to see a snake kill anyone or a fierce spirit possess anyone and cause that person to dieWhat I have seen is that the people of this world are suffering not from being eaten by tigers or bitten by snakes or killed by elephants but from their own greed anger and delusionWhatever may be making them suffer greed anger and delusion are the things that destroy themThis is why the Buddha taught that fools destroy themselves as they would destroy othersThey destroy themselves by acting in evil and corrupt ways as we see all around usTheyre born as human beings just like everyone else but their behavior isnt like that of other human beingsSo we have to be extremely careful about greed anger and delusionThey can take clearseeing people and put them in the darkTheir influence you know lies over and above everyone in the world  except for arahants and the other seven stages of noble disciplesEven among the other noble disciples those who are just streamwinners or oncereturners are still involved with these things still fooled by these thingsThe fact that theyve attained the Dhamma eye simply means that theyve come at least somewhat to recognize these things for what they areIf you really want to be at your ease you have to become a nonreturner or an arahantThe pleasure that comes from sensual objects has both its uses and its drawbacksFeelings perceptions thoughtfabrications and consciousness also have their usesThe only exception is anger it has no use at allIts hot and fieryNobody likes itWhen other people are angry at us we dont like itWhen were angry at other people they dont like it eitherAnd yet we still let ourselves get deluded into being attached to our anger  which shows that were still runofthemill peopleSensual defilements  such as greed anger and delusion  are like fireSensual objects  sights sounds smells tastes tactile sensations  are trash and kindling that provide fuel for fireNormally if theres no fuel fire wont flare upIf theres only a little fuel the fire flares up only a littleIf theres a lot of fuel the fire flares up in a big way  and the heat of the fire has to be great tooWhen were sitting near a fire and suffering from its heat can we blame the heat on the fuelActually the heat is the heat of the fireThe nature of the fuel on its own isnt hot at all isnt harmful at allThe harm comes from the fire  because the nature of fire is that its hotThe same point holds true for sensual defilements and sensual objectsCan we blame our sufferings on sights sounds smells tastes and tactile sensations on the things that we wantThe Buddha teaches us that the heart is what turns these things into suffering in the same way that fire turns fuel into something hotSo we should look for the source of our suffering inside ourselvesThis is why the noble disciples can see sights hear sounds etc without experiencing any suffering because theyve put out their own fires of passion aversion and delusionThese inner fires are the things that burn us with their heat that make us sufferIts not the case that sights sounds smells tastes and tactile sensations burn us and make us sufferWe ourselves are the fires that are constantly burning ourselvesActually our own mind is what creates suffering and stressYou can see this by observing arahants when they have knowledge and discernment taking good care of their minds they experience no suffering  because they dont pin their hopes on anything at allWhen we meet up with sights tastes smells whatever we suffer because our hearts have craving desires thirsts likes and dislikes for those thingsThis is why the noble disciples are disenchanted with the worldNormally runofthemill people want to find happiness whats good in life through greed anger and delusionFrom this we can see that the attitudes of noble disciples and the attitudes of runofthemill people are far far apartIf you practice generosity and observe the precepts but dont practice concentration youre like a person who has food for his journey whos strong ablebodied  but blind he wont be able to journey all the way to nibbanaHair of the head hair of the body nails teeth skin these are called the five meditation themesThey were taught by the Buddha himself theres no reason to doubt thisWe should contemplate these themesIf other meditation themes were better than these why didnt the Buddha tell preceptors to teach them  instead of these five  to newly ordained monksPreceptors have to teach newly ordained monks these five themes before they teach them any other themesSo we should contemplate these themesWe cant neglect themTo begin with you can use them as a verbal repetitionBut when your mindfulness and alertness are good you can contemplate them even as you walk around and do other thingsYou dont have to repeat the words in your mindWhen you start out with the mental repetition you can say the Pali word kesa or simply think hair of the head The same holds true for loma hair of the body nakha nails danta teeth and taco skinBut dont say all five at onceChoose whichever one you likeOr you can try them one by one for seven days eachWhen you notice which one fits with your propensities you can continue focusing on that one indefinitelyIts as if you have five medicines to choose fromYou can try each of them to see which one is right for your particular diseaseWhen you think about the Buddhas reasons for formulating these five meditation themes you can see that its because these five things are where people are most deludedWhen we contemplate them as meditation themes its a direct technique for curing delusionOnce we see these five things for what they truly are our delusions will loosen their gripWhen we fall in love with other people or start hating them its because these five things appear to usIf we were to strip away these five things there would be nothing to love or to hateWhat would be left would simply horrify usThese five themes are a direct means for curing delusionWhen we fall for each other its because we fall for the hair the nails the teeth the skinWe fall for these things because we havent contemplated them in a precise or detailed wayIf we were to contemplate them down to their very roots wed see that theres nothing worth falling for at allWhen the mind gathers to a subtle level where its still then even though there may be some thoughts arising focus on staying perfectly stillThe words perfectly still here can be compared to a hunter waiting to trap an animalThe hunter sits still without moving at all but his eyes have to be on the lookout for the animals hes trying to trapThe same holds true for the way mindfulness has to be focused on the mindConcerning visions whether or not they appear is not really important because our purpose in developing concentration is simply to give rise to stillness within the mindIf you can make your mind still in a single preoccupation thats enough right thereEven if no visions arise theres nothing to worry aboutSome people when they meditate want to see images of heaven hell devas etc but theres nothing special about seeing things like thatWe say that theres nothing special because even when you do see things like that your defilements are still the same as they always were  and with some people their defilements get even worseThey think that theyre somebody special because they can see various things and so they arent willing to bow down or show respect to anyone elseThis attitude is an obstacle to heaven an obstacle to the path closing off the paths and fruitions leading to nibbanaIts a view that deviates from the principles of the Buddhas teachingsWere taught to meditate solely for the purpose of subduing our defilementsWhat you want to see is your own greed anger and delusionYou want to see your own passion craving and conceitThere are two kinds of release from the defilements absolute release and release through suppressingWhen we meditate and the mind settles down firmly in concentration weve suppressed the defilementsThis is called release through suppressingEven though this isnt as good as absolute release its still good that were able to keep these things in line to some extent  better than letting them force us aroundAt the very least we should put up a fight against themOnce the mind has settled down then when the time comes for you to leave concentration dont come right outReflect first on how you were able to get into concentrationHow were you able to let go of outside worries and concernsHow did you focus your mindWhat object did you focus onReflect on how you were able to get the mind to settle down so well so that the next time you meditate youll know how to focus your awarenessIf you dont reflect in this way then the next time you meditate youll be lostMindfulness and discernment are the factors that govern the heartFor this reason those of us who have authority over other people who have the duty of governing other people first have to train ourselves to govern ourselvesOnly then can we govern othersFor example if were going to be teachers we first need to be able to govern ourselves if we want to be able to govern our studentsWe thus have to train our hearts and minds so that mindfulness and discernment can govern them so that mindfulness and discernment can act as our justices of the peaceIn other words the heart is like a courtroom where we can judge our own guilt or innocenceFor us to do this properly depends on our own mindfulness and discernmentWe first have to work on virtue and concentration as our foundationOnly when our virtue and concentration are ready will the heart and mind have the discernment to train itself to wash away its defilements in line with our individual strengthThe defilements come on three levels coarse intermediate and refinedThe refined defilements are the anusaya the tendencies that lie latent in our characterWe have to use our discernment to cure themThe intermediate defilements are the nivarana the five hindrancesThese can be overcome when the mind is in jhanaThe coarse defilements are those that lose their power through our observing the preceptsThe five hindrances are as followsThese five qualities are called hindrances because they act as obstacles preventing the mind from attaining goodnessThey come under the three basic defilements ie passion aversion and delusionSensual desire comes under the defilement of passionIll will comes under the defilement of aversionSleepiness restlessness and uncertainty come under the defilement of delusionThe hindrances are really no different from these basic defilements for both sets are obstacles to the mind preventing it from doing good from attaining the DhammaWhen they take over the mind we find no pleasure in doing good no pleasure in being generous observing the precepts or meditatingBut when our concentration reaches the level of fixed penetration or jhana these intermediate defilements along with the coarse defilements are out of the wayThe only defilements still remaining are the refined onesAs long as our jhana doesnt deteriorate were in a state of releaseRelease here means freedom from suffering freedom from the coarse and intermediate defilementsThis is something we should all try to do in order to benefit our heartsBut people for the most part no matter what country theyre born in are more interested in the affairs of the bodyTheyre not all that interested in tending to the heart and mindThey dont look after the heart and mindWhen the heart is suffering they dont look into why its sufferingTheyre more wrapped up in looking after the bodyWhen the bodys in the slightest pain they run to the doctor to the hospitalBut when they suffer in their hearts and minds they arent all that interested in finding out whyPeople who have trained their minds though investigate into the reasons and causesWhen the heart is suffering and theyve investigated down to the real causes theyll know how to release the heart from that sufferingYou could say that they act as their own doctorsThe Buddha was a master doctor a doctor specializing in the diseases of the heart and mindAs he once said The diseases of the body are few far fewer than the diseases of the heart and mind Its possible to find people who have lived to the age of or without having suffered from diseases of the body but as for diseases of the heart and mind they constantly disturb ordinary people everywhereThe diseases of the heart and mind are so many that theyre innumerable all the many diseases that come out of passion aversion and delusionThats why were taught to train our mindsWhen we listen to the Dhamma and put it into practice were said to be studying medicine for the heart and mindOnce weve learned the Dhamma we train ourselves in line with itOnce the mind attains concentration well have strategies and techniques for looking after our own hearts and mindsWhen suffering arises in the heart and mind well be able to contemplate it for ourselves and treat it by ourselvesThis is why the Buddha says that there are great benefits great results for those who practice generosity virtue and meditationPeople who do this are called sagesThe word sage here can apply to women or menIt applies to anyone who knows  who knows the affairs of the heart and mindBut these affairs are hard to knowMost people abandon their own minds throw them awayThis is why so many people in the world lose out in life  because they abandon the mind that can act as such a wonderful refugeSo the mind is a crucial thing to trainAnd as Ive said we train it through generosity virtue and meditationNo matter how good your concentration  no matter how much bliss you experience or how much supranormal knowledge you gain  if insight into the three common characteristics of inconstancy stress and notself hasnt yet arisen youre still in wrong concentrationWere told that nothing is really oursThink about the things that you hold to as your own external wealth the possessions with and without consciousness that are said to be yoursCan you really take them with you when you goIll let you consider on your ownYour land your home your furnishings all the things that the mind holds on to can you really claim them to be your ownCan the mind take them along as its own belongings when it goes to be rebornIll leave this with you to consider for yourselves but if you ask me Id say that it cantWhen you have no more breath to breathe you have no more rights to these thingsYou cant continue to hold onto them as my children my husband my wife my grandchildren my home my millions and thousands in the bank As the Buddha taughtNone of the worlds wealth belongs to usAnd we dont belong to itTheres nothing but gaminiyam theres nothing but leaving and dyingWhen parents die their wealth falls to their childrenThe children use that wealth until they die when it falls to the grandchildrenIn other words you cant really hold to these things as your ownYou have rights over them only for this lifeWhat the Buddha said about this is it trueTrue or false I leave it to you to decideAny of the things that you hold to as your own  here Im talking to your mind  can you take it along with youYour external wealth when you get reborn in heaven can you take these things along with youIf you get reborn in hell or as a hungry ghost can you take them alongIf you get reborn as a common animal  a cow a water buffalo a vulture a crow a dog a pig  can you take your external wealth alongThink carefully about thisI say that you cantTheres nothing you hold to inside or out that you can take along with youYou cant take any of the five aggregates  form feeling perception thoughtfabrications or sensory consciousness  alongThe body for instance the parts composed of earth water fire and wind the mind holds onto it as yourself but is it really yourselfIt may be yours as long as youre breathing but when theres no more breath can the mind stay in charge of itCan it hold onto itCan it take it along as its selfCan you say When I stop breathing dont cremate meLeave me there in the bedroom so that we can sleep and wake up together Can you say thatThink about itAsk your mind can you really take the body along with youThe same holds true with feelings  the feelings of pleasure pain and neither pleasure nor pain that depend on contact as when forms make contact with the eye or flavors make contact with the tongue so that you can know sweet and sour or when heat and cold soft and hard make contact with the bodyContact happens when the mind wakes up and starts working thats when feelings of pleasure and pain can arise when perceptions and mental labels can arise when the act of thought fabrication arisesFeelings of pleasure arise from contact as when forms strike the eye sounds strike the ear aromas strike the nose flavors strike the tongue and tactile sensations strike the bodyWhen ideas strike the mind they stir it up into a reactionAll three of these mental phenomena  feelings perceptions and thought fabrications  arise from contactWhen the mind awakens from sleep and gets to work there are feelings of pleasure and pain mental labels perceive and thought fabrications thinkNow can the mind hold onto feelings of pleasure and pain as itselfWhen theres a feeling of pleasure can the mind prevent pain from arisingCan it keep that pleasure going continuously without deterioratingCan it exert control over these thingsWhen you use perception to study and memorize things can you exert control so that you dont forget or confuse the things youve memorizedCan you control the fabrication of good and bad thoughtsCan you order your thoughts to stopCan you force them to think only good thingsThe same holds true with consciousness at the eyes ears nose tongue body and mind that arises in dependence on physical and mental phenomenaWhen we wake up if there are no physical or mental phenomena then consciousness doesnt have a place to stand has no place to workThe body is like a factory the mind is like a head office waiting to receive contactCan you hold onto any of these things as your ownAs the Buddha said Form arises in dependence on conditions that are inconstant stressful and notselfSo how could form be constant pleasant and selfFeelings perceptions thoughtfabrications and consciousness arise in dependence on conditions that are inconstant stressful and notselfSo how could they be constant pleasant and selfAll the things that the mind holds to the Buddha boiled down to physical and mental phenomena the five aggregates and to all of these things he applied the three characteristicsAll fabricated things are inconstant he said all fabricated things are stressful all things are notselfWhatever things whatever kinds of knowledge arise you have to use the three characteristics as your standard of judgmentPhysical and mental phenomena depend on three conditions consciousness fabrication and avijjaThe word avijja means unawareness being unaware of stress its cause its cessation and the path to its cessationThats what they say in the textsActual unawareness is aware but theres one thing its not aware of itselfIts like the eyeThe eye can see everything except for itselfIf we didnt have inventions like mirrors youd have no hope of ever seeing your own eyes your own faceThe reason we can see our face is because of mirrorsThe same holds true with the awareness of the mindThe essence of the Buddhas teaching is the fruit of arahantship  irreversible releaseHeedlessness is the way to deathThe word death here doesnt refer to the death of the bodyIt refers to the death of the mind when the mind dies away from the paths and fruitions leading to nibbanaHeedfulness is the way to the deathlessIn other words when we arent heedless of goodness  when we arent negligent in developing virtue concentration and discernment  were sure to have the chance to go to heaven the Brahma worlds or to the paths and fruitions leading to nibbana quickly or slowly depending on the strength of our own effortsTo be heedful means to keep mindfulness focused on the body and mindWhether were sitting standing walking or lying down none of our movements can cause mindfulness to lapseOnly then can we say that were heedfulUnderstandTo be heedless means to be lacking in mindfulness and alertness letting the mind wander among things apart from your own body and mind  wandering in line with the preoccupations of the world sights sounds smells flavors tactile sensations and thoughtsIf thats the sort of person you are the Buddha says youre heedlessEven though your body may still be alive youre like a person whos dead Tibetan Great Yogi Milarepa Anguttara Nikaya iip Psalms of the BrethrenThe Book of Protection which is an anthology of selected discourses of the Buddha compiled by the teachers of old was originally meant as a handbook for the newly ordained noviceThe idea was that those novices who are not capable of studying large portions of the Discourse Collection should at least be conversant with the Book of ProtectionEven today it is soThe twenty four discourses are selected from the five Nikayas or the original Collections in Pali containing the Buddhas discoursesThe fact that the book was meant for the novice is clear from the prefatory paragraphs that precede the discoursesThe precepts are ten and not five which are the basic principles of the lay followerThe novice is expected to observe the ten preceptsThis is followed by the Questions to be Answered by a Novice and the Thirty Two Parts of the Body which is really a type of meditation on the constituent parts of ones bodyThen comes the Fourfold reflection of a Monk and finally the Ten Essentials  to be reflected upon by one who has gone forth to live the holy lifeThe discourses come nextIf one patiently and painstakingly studies these discourses he could gather a good knowledge of the essentials and fundamental teachings of the BuddhaThe Mahasamaya sutta and the Atanatiya sutta ending the book may appear to some as pointless but a careful reader will no doubt appreciate their relevanceIn the essay on the Value of Paritta an attempt is made to show what paritta means to a BuddhistI have endeavored to keep as close as possible to the original wording of the text without making it too literal a translation on the one hand and a word for word translation on the other and have avoided translating the Pali stanzas into verse in order to give a very faithful easy and readable renderingI have preserved the synonymous words and repetitions found in the suttas since they are the ipsissima verba of the Buddha handed down to us through oral traditionIn all the suttas the word Bhagava the Blessed One an epithet of the Buddha is frequently usedTo avoid using the same word too often in the translation I have at times used the word the Buddha for Bhagava or a personal pronoun to denote himThe Pali words and names included in this work are lacking in diacritical marksIn some places however the smaller type with such marks are usedBut students of Pali may not find any difficulty in pronouncing themThe reader may refer to the Khandhavatta Jataka when studying the Khandha ParittaThe Angulimala Paritta is a short discourse that does not appear in the Book of Protection but as it is a paritta made use of by expectant mothers in Buddhist lands I have included it in the AppendixOther Pali stanzas used by the Buddhists when reciting the Parittas are also included in the Appendix with their English renderingsI am indebted beyond measure to MrVFGunaratna retired public trustee of Sri Lanka for his painstaking reading of the script his careful and valuable suggestions and for writing the ForewordThe VenKheminda Maha Thera assisted me in finding the references the VenSiridhamma Thera in reading the proofs and MrKGAbeysinghe in typing the scriptI am grateful to themTo Miss KJayawardana of Union printing Works and her staff who took a keen interest in the printing of this work I am thankfulLast but far from least my thanks are due to Messrs DMunidase and UPde Zoysa for all the help they have given meby VFGunaratnaThe world of English Buddhist literature has been enriched by the publication of this book entitled The Book of Protection This is a translation by the VenPiyadassi Maha Thera of what is well known to every Sinhala Buddhist home as the Pirit Potha which means the book of protectionIt contains a collection of suttas or discourses taken from the teaching of the Buddha and are meant to be recited in temples and homes for the purpose of obtaining protection from all harmThis is achieved by recalling with saddha or confidence the virtues of the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha referred to in these discoursesThere are many who listen to the recitation of these discourses but who hardly understand the import of these discourses and therefore any benefit they may gain must be necessarily slightThis translation therefore supplies a longfelt need as it will help such persons to listen with understanding when pirith is being recitedThe venerable translator is therefore to be congratulated as being the first to translate a book of this natureTo translate a book is not so easy as to write a bookThe work of translation calls for precision and concentrated thoughtA translation that keeps too close to the original is apt to suffer from a failure to convey the spirit underlying the original textAt the same time a translation that is too free runs the risk of expressing more than the author of the original composition had intended and thereby misrepresents himThe venerable translator has certainly done well by steering clear between these two extremes and therefore deserves special praiseFurther more he has by the manner of his translation made it evident that he has been at pains to facilitate the purpose for which pirith is recitedBy means of explanations in parenthesis and helpful foot notes he has striven to elucidate the meaning of words and phrases where their full significance appears to be obscureIf a further clarification is needed the reader is invited to refer to VenPiyadassi Maha Theras book The Buddhas Ancient Path which deals with quite a number of points concerning the BuddhadhammaThere can be no doubt that this translation of the Pirith Potha by one such as the VenPiyadassi Maha Thera  a reputed author of several Buddhist books and a preacher whose sermons have gained great acceptance both in the East and the West  will be hailed with delight by those who desire to obtain a full understanding of the pirith that is recited in temples and homes  sometimes with marvelous effect Samyutta Nikaya ipiiiRecent research in medicine in experimental psychology and what is still called parapsychology has thrown some light on the nature of mind and its position in the worldDuring the last forty years the conviction has steadily grown among medical men that very many causes of diseases organic as well as functional are directly caused by mental statesThe body becomes ill because the mind controlling it either secretly wants to make it ill or else because it is in such a state of agitation that it cannot prevent the body from sickeningWhatever its physical nature resistance to disease is unquestionably correlated with the physiological condition of the patientMind not only makes sick it also curesAn optimistic patient has more chance of getting well than a patient who is worried and unhappyThe recorded instances of faith healing includes cases in which even organic diseases were cured almost instantaneouslyIn this connection it is interesting to observe the prevalence in Buddhist lands of listening to the recital of the dhamma or the doctrine of the Buddha in order to avert illness or danger to ward off the influence of malignant beings to obtain protection and deliverance from evil and to promote health prosperity welfare and wellbeingThe selected discourses for recital are known as paritta suttas discourses for protectionBut they are not rakshana mantras or protective incantations found in Brahmanic religion nor are they magical ritesThere is nothing mystical in themParitta in Pali paritrana in Sanskrit and pirit in Sinhala mean principally protectionParitta suttas describe certain suttas or discourses delivered by the Buddha and regarded as affording protectionThis protection is to be obtained by reciting or listening to the paritta suttasThe practice of reciting or listening to the paritta suttas began very early in the history of BuddhismThe word paritta in this context was used by the Buddha for the first time in a discourse known as Khandha Paritta in the Culla Vagga of the Vinaya Pitaka and also in the Anguttara Nikaya under the title Ahi SuttaThis discourse was recommended by the Buddha as guard or protection for the use of the members of the OrderThe Buddha in this discourse exhorts the monks to cultivate metta or lovingkindness towards all beingsIt is certain that paritta recital produces mental wellbeing in those who listen to them with intelligence and have confidence in the truth of the Buddhas wordsSuch mental well being can help those who are ill to recover and can also help not only to induce the mental attitude that brings happiness but also to overcome its oppositeOriginally in India those who listened to paritta sayings of the Buddha understood what was recited and the effect on them was correspondingly greatThe Buddha himself had paritta recited to him and he also requested others to recite paritta for his own disciples when they were illThis practice is still in vogue in Buddhist landsThe Buddha and the arahants can concentrate on the paritta suttas without the aid of anotherHowever when they are ill it is easier for them to listen to what others recite and thus focus their minds on the dhamma that the suttas contain rather than think of the dhamma by themselvesThere are occasions as in the case of illness which weaken the mind when heterosuggestion has been found to be more effective than autosuggestionAccording to the teachings of the Buddha the mind is so closely linked with the body that mental states affect the bodys health and well beingSome doctors even say there is no such thing as purely physical diseaseThat even so grossly physical a complaint as dental caries may be due to mental causes was maintained in a paper read before the American Dental Congress inThe author pointed out that children living on a perfectly satisfactory diet may still suffer dental decayIn such cases investigation generally shows that the childs life at home or at school is in some way unsatisfactoryThe teeth decay because their owner is under mental strain Unless according to the Buddhist doctrine of kamma these bad mental states are caused as a result of ones own acts and are therefore unalterable it is possible so to change these mental states as to cause mental health and physical wellbeing to follow thereafterSeveral factors combine to contribute towards the efficacy of paritta recitalsParitta recital is a form of saccakiriya ie an asseveration of truthProtection results by the power of such asseverationThis means establishing oneself in the power of truth to gain ones endAt the end of the recital of each sutta the reciters bless the listeners with the words etena sacca vajjena sotti te hotu sabbada which means by the power of the truth of these words may you ever be well The saying the power of the dhamma or Truth protects the follower of the dhamma indicates the principle behind these sutta recitalsThe belief in the effective power to heal or protect of the saccakiriya or asseveration of something quite true is but another aspect of the work ascribed to the parittaSeveral discourses of the Book of Protection describe the virtuous lifeThe starting point in Buddhism is silaStanding on the firm ground of sila one should endeavor to achieve a collected mindIf it is true that virtue protects the virtuous then a person who listens to the recital of paritta suttas intelligently in a reflective mood with complete confidence in the Buddhas words uttered by one who has gained complete Enlightenment will acquire so virtuous a state of mind as would enable him to dominate any evil influence and to be protected from all harmThe utterances of the compassionate Buddha are never void of loveHe walked the highways and byways of India enfolding all within the aura of his love and compassion instructing enlightening and gladdening the many by his teachingThe reciters of the paritta are therefore expected to do so with a heart of love and compassion wishing the listeners and others weal and happiness and protection from all harmLove is an active forceEvery act of one who truly loves is done with the pure mind to help to cheer and to make the paths of others more easy more smooth and more adapted to the conquest of sorrow the winning of the Highest BlissAFRhys Davids commenting on amity writes The profession of amity according to Buddhist doctrine was no mere matter of pretty speechIt was to accompany and express a psychic suffusion of the hostile man or beast or spirit with benign fraternal emotion  with mettaFor strong was the conviction from Sutta and Vinaya to Buddhaghosas Visuddhi Magga that thoughts are things that psychical action emotional or intellectual is capable of working like a force among forcesEurope may yet come round further to this Indian attitudeIt is believed that the vibratory sounds produced by the sonorous and mellifluous recital of the paritta suttas in their Pali verses are soothing to the nerves and induce peace and calm of mind they also bring about harmony to the physical systemHow can bad influences springing from evil beings be counteracted by recital of paritta suttasBad influences are the results of evil thinkingThey can therefore be counteracted by wholesome states of mindOne sure way of inducing a wholesome state of mind is by listening and reflecting on paritta recitals with intelligence and confidenceSo great is the power of concentration that by adverting wholeheartedly to the truth contained in the paritta recitals one is able to develop a wholesome state of mindThe recital of paritta suttas can also bring material blessings in its wake through the wholesome states of mind induced by concentration and confidence in listening intelligently to the recitalAccording to the Buddha right effort is a necessary factor in overcoming sufferingListening to these recitals in the proper way can also generate energy for the purpose of securing worldly progress while it also secures spiritual progressThere is no better medicine than truth for the mental and physical ills which are the causes of all suffering and misfortuneSo the recital of paritta suttas in as much as they contain the dhamma may when they are listened to in the proper attitude bring into being wholesome states of mind which conduce to health material progress and spiritual progressThe effect of Pirit can also transcend distance however greatIt is true that the Buddhists consider the parittas as a neverfailing potent and purifying force a supersolventHowever a question may arise whether recitals from the Book of Protection will in every case result in the protection and blessing sought forIn this connection the same reply given by the Venerable Nagasena to King Milindas question why the recital of paritta does not in all cases protect one from death is worth remembering Due to three causes recital of paritta may have no effect kamma hindrances hindrances from defilements lack of faith Kamma means action and not the result of action therefore action can be counteracted by other actionKamma is not something static but is always changing ie always in the making that being so action can be counteracted by other actionHence bad actions on the part of the hearers of the recital may negative the beneficial effects of the recitalIf the mind of the hearer is contaminated with impure thoughts then also the intended beneficial effects of the recital may not materializeBut however impure the mind of the hearer may be if there is great confidence in the efficacy of the recital then this important factor may help to secure for him the beneficial effects of the recitalThis collection of paritta discourses  in Sinhala The Pirit Potha  is the most widely known Pali book in Sri LankaIt is called The Buddhist Bible it is given an important place in the Buddhist home and is even treated with venerationIn most houses where there is a small shrine this book is kept there so that the inmates may refer to it during their devotional hourSome have committed to memory the three well known discourses  Mangala Ratana and Karaniyametta suttasEven children are familiar with these discourses for they learn them from their parents and elders or from the dhamma schoolThe habit of listening to the recital of paritta suttas among the Westerners is growing slowly but steadilyThe present writer while on his missions in the European and American countries has at request of several residents there taperecorded the recital of paritta suttas for their benefit and has airmailed cassettes containing the sutta recitals to those who sent him such cassettesNow what does this book containIt is a collection of twenty four suttas or discourses almost all delivered by the Buddha and found scattered in the five original collections in Pali which form the Sutta Pitaka the Canonical Discourses These discourses are preceded by an enunciation of the Three Refuges the Ten Precepts and the questions asked of a noviceThis collection of discourses popularly known as Pirit Potha or The Book of Protection has a less known title CatubhanavaraA th century Commentary to this written in Pali by a pupil of the Venerable Rajaguru Vanaratana of Sri Lanka is available under the title Catubhanavara Atthakatha or Sarattha SamuccayaWhat is a bhanavaraIt is a collection of sermons or discoursesFour such collections are called CatubhanavaraAs the teachers of old have said a threeword line is made up of eight syllables four such padas make a stanza or a gathaThus stanzas consists of thirtytwo syllablessuch stanzas is called a bhanavara which consists of syllablesThe Catunabhanavara was compiled by the Maha Theras the teachers of yore of Sri Lanka and today it is known among the Buddhists of Sri Lanka as the Pirit Potha The Book of ProtectionIt is customary for Buddhist monks when they are invited to the homes of the laity on occasions of domestic importance such as birth days housewarming illness and similar events to recite the three popular discourses mentioned aboveIn the domestic and social life of the people of Sri Lanka pirit ceremony is of great significanceNo festival or function religious or social is complete without the recital of the parittaOn special occasions monks are invited to recite the paritta suttas not for short periods but right through the night or for three or seven days and at times for weeksOn such occasions a pavilion is constructed for the purpose of accommodating the monks at the recitalBefore the commencement of the recital the laity present at the ceremony makes a formal invitation to the monks by reciting in Pali three stanzas which explain the purpose of the recitalThen the monks generally about twelve or fourteen who have been invited will recite the three popular suttasThereafter a pair of monks will commence reciting the remaining suttas for two hoursThey will then retire and will be followed by another pair for another two hoursTwo monks must be constantly officiatingIn this manner the recital will last till dawnWhile the recital continues there will be found a pot of water placed on a table before the monksOn this table there is also a sacred threadFor an all night pirit ceremony the casket containing a relic of the Buddha and the Pirit Potha or The Book of Protection written on ola leaves are also brought into the pavilionThe relic represents the Buddha the Pirit Potha represents the Dhamma or the teachings of the Buddha and the reciting BhikkhuSangha represent the AriyaSangha the arahant disciples of the BuddhaThe thread is drawn round the interior of the pavilion and its end twisted round the casket the neck of the pot of water and tied to the cord of the olaleaf bookWhile the special discourses are being recited the monks hold the threadThe purpose is to maintain an unbroken communication from the water to the relic to the Pirit Potha and to the officiating monks A ball of thread connected to The Three Jewels and the water is unloosened and passed on to the listeners who hold the thread while the recital goes onWhen the recital in Pali of the entire book is over at dawn the thread sanctified by the recital is divided into pieces and distributed among the devotees to be tied round their wrists or necksAt the same time the sanctified water is sprinkled on all who even drink a little of it and sprinkle it on their headsThese are to be regarded as symbols of the protective power of the paritta that was recitedIt is a service of inducing blessingsIt has its psychological effectsDrBernard Grad of McGill University in Montreal painstakingly proved that if a psychic healer held water in a flask and this water was later poured on barley seeds the plants significantly outgrew untreated seedsBut  and this is the intriguing part  if depressed psychiatric patients held the flasks of water the growth of seeds was retardedDrGrad suggests that there appeared to be some x factor or energy that flows from the human body to affect growth of plants and animalsA persons mood affected this energyThis previously unacknowledged energy has the widest implications for medical science from healing to lab tests Grad saysAs experimentally discovered by DrGrad mind can influence matterIf that be so not much thinking is necessary to draw the logical inference that mind can influence mindFurther if the human mind can influence lower animals then by a parity of reasoning the human mind can influence the minds of beings higher than animalsNamo tassa

gone forthThese monks are the essentials that should be reflected again and again by one who has gone forthSo spoke the Blessed OneThose monks rejoiced at the words of the Blessed OneThus have I heardOn one occasion the Blessed One was living near Savatthi at Jetavana at Anathapindikas monasteryNow when the night was far advanced a certain deity whose surpassing radiance illuminated the whole of Jetavana approached the Blessed One respectfully saluted him and stood beside himStanding thus he addressed the Blessed One in verseMany deities and men longing for happiness have pondered on blessingsPray tell me what the highest blessings areNot to associate with the foolish but to associate with the wise and to honor those worthy of honor  this is the highest blessingTo reside in a suitable locality to have performed meritorious actions in the past and to set oneself in the right direction  this is the highest blessingVast learning skill in handicrafts well grounded in

follows The city of Vesali was afflicted by a famine causing death especially to the poor folkDue to the presence of decaying corpses the evil spirits began to haunt the city this was followed by a pestilencePlagued by these three fears of famine nonhuman beings and pestilence the citizens sought the help of the Buddha who was then living at RajagahaFollowed by a large number of monks including the Venerable Ananda his attendant disciple the Buddha came to the city of VesaliWith the arrival of the Master there were torrential rains which swept away the putrefying corpsesThe atmosphere became purified the city was cleanThereupon the Buddha delivered this Jewel Discourse to the Venerable Ananda and gave him instructions as to how he should tour the city with the Licchavi citizens reciting the discourse as a mark of protection to the people of VesaliThe Venerable Ananda followed the instructions and sprinkled the sanctified water from the Buddhas own alms bowlAs a consequence the evil spirits were exorcised the pestilence subsidedThereafter the Venerable Ananda returned with the citizens of Vesali to the Public hall where the Buddha and his disciples had assembled awaiting his arrivalThere the Buddha recited the same Jewel Discourse to the gathering O beings listen closelyMay you all radiate lovingkindness to those human beings who by day and night bring offerings to youWherefore protect them with diligenceWhatever treasure there be either in the world beyond whatever precious jewel there be in the heavenly worlds there is nought comparable to the TathagataThis

terrestrial or celestial come let us salute the perfect Dhamma honored by gods and menMay there be happinessWhatever beings are assembled here terrestrial or celestial come let us salute the perfect Sangha honored by gods and menMay there be happinessWhile the Buddha was staying at Savatthi a band of monks having received subjects of meditation from the master proceeded to a forest to spend the rainy seasonThe tree deities inhabiting this forest were worried by their arrival as they had to descend from tree abodes and dwell on the groundThey hoped however the monks would leave soon but finding that the monks would stay the vassana period of three months harassed them in diverse ways during the night with the intention of scaring them awayLiving under such conditions being impossible the monks went to the Master and informed him of their difficultiesThereon the Buddha instructed them in the Metta sutta and advised their return equipped with this sutta for their protectionThe monks went back to the forest and practicing the instruction conveyed permeated the whole atmosphere with their radiant thoughts of metta or lovingkindnessThe deities so affected by this power of love henceforth allowed them to meditate in peaceThe discourse gets divided into two partsThe first detailing the standard of moral conduct required by one who wishes to attain Purity and Peace and the second the method of practice of mettaHe who is skilled in well being and who wishes to attain that state of Calm should act thus he should be dexterous upright exceedingly upright obedient gentle and humbleContented easily supportable with but few responsibilities of simple livelihood controlled in the senses prudent courteous and not hanker after association with familiesLet him not perform the slightest wrong for which wise men may rebuke himMay all beings be happy and safeMay they have happy mindsWhatever living beings there may be  feeble or strong long stout or of medium size short small large those seen or those unseen those dwelling far or near those who are born as well as those yet to be born  may all beings have happy mindsLet him not deceive another nor despise anyone anywhereIn anger or ill will let him not wish another illJust as a mother would protect her only child with her life even so let one cultivate a boundless love towards all beingsLet him radiate boundless love towards the entire world  above below and across  unhindered without ill will without enmityStanding walking sitting or reclining as long as he is awake let him develop this mindfulnessThis they say is Noble Living hereNot falling into wrong views  being virtuous endowed with insight lust in the senses discarded  verily never again will he return to conceive in a wombThus have I heardOn one occasion the Blessed One was living near Savatthi at Jetavana at Anathapindikas monasteryAt that time at Savatthi a certain monk had died bitten by a snakeThereupon many monks approached the Buddha and having saluted him sat beside himSo seated those monks spoke thus to the Blessed OneBhante a certain monk at Savatthi had died bitten by a snakeAssuredly monks said the BuddhaThat monk has not suffused with thoughts of lovingkindness the four royal tribes of snakesHad he done so that monk would not have died of snakebiteWhat are the four royal tribes of snakesThe royal tribe of snakes

eg rain god sun god etcThe Buddha was not disposed to comment on these views and so he contented himself with merely expressing the message of the Dhamma through the medium of these viewsThus have I

individually attained enlightenment noble among menI make knownListen to meFor seven weeks immediately following the enlightenment the Buddha spent his time in lonely retreatAt the close of this period he decided to proclaim the doctrine he had realized to those five ascetics who were once struggling with him for enlightenmentKnowing that they were living at Isipatana still steeped in the unmeaning rigours of extreme asceticism the master left Gaya where he attained enlightenment for distant Varanasi Indias holy cityThere at the Deer Park he rejoined themThus have I heardOn one occasion the Blessed One was living in the Deer Park at Isipatana near VaranasiThen he addressed the group of five monksMonks these two extremes ought not to be practiced by one who has gone forth from the household lifeThere is addiction to indulgence of sensepleasures which is low coarse the way of ordinary people unworthy and unprofitable and there is addiction to selfmortification which is painful unworthy and unprofitableAvoiding both these extremes the Tathagata has realized the Middle Path it gives vision gives knowledge and leads to calm to insight to enlightenment and to NibbanaAnd what is that Middle Path realized by the TathagataIt is the Noble Eightfold path and nothing else namely right understanding right thought right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness and right concentrationThis is the Middle Path realized by the Tathagata which gives vision which gives knowledge and leads to calm to insight to enlightenment and to NibbanaThe Noble Truth of Suffering monks is this Birth is suffering aging is suffering sickness is suffering death is suffering association with the unpleasant is suffering dissociation from the pleasant is suffering not to receive what one desires is suffering  in brief the five aggregates subject to grasping are sufferingThe Noble Truth of the Origin of Suffering is this It is this craving which produces

have realized the matchless supreme Enlightenment in this world with its gods with its Maras and Brahmas in this generation with its recluses and brahmanas with its Devas and humansBut when my knowledge of seeing things as they really are was quite clear in these three aspects in these twelve ways concerning the Four Noble Truths then I claimed to have realized the matchless supreme Enlightenment in this world with its gods with its Maras and Brahmas in this generation with its recluses and brahmanas with its Devas and humansAnd a vision of insight arose in me thus Unshakable is the deliverance of my heartThis is the last birthNow there is no more rebecoming This the Blessed One saidThe group of five monks was glad and they rejoiced at the words of the Blessed OneWhen this discourse was thus expounded there arose in the Venerable Kondañña the passionfree stainless vision of Truth dhammacakkhu in other words he attained sotapatti the first stage of sanctity and realized Whatever has the nature of arising has the nature of ceasingNow when the Blessed One set in motion the Wheel of Truth the Bhummattha devas proclaimed The Matchless Wheel of Truth that cannot be set in

at that instant the cry spread as far as Brahma realm the system of ten thousand worlds trembled and quaked and shookA boundless sublime radiance surpassing the effulgence of devas appeared in the worldThen the Blessed One uttered this paeon of joy Verily Kondañña has realized verily Kondañña has realized Thus it was that the Venerable Kondañña received the name Añña Knondañña  Kondañña who realizesWith the proclamation of the Dhamma for the first time and with the conversion of the five ascetics the Deer Park at Isipatana became the birth place of the Buddhas Dispensation and the Sangha

rejoicing with Aryan disciples Thus have I heardOn one occasion the Blessed One was living in the abode of Alavaka the Yakkha at AlaviThen Alavaka approached the Blessed One and said Get out recluse  Very well friend so saying the Blessed One went outCome in recluse  Very well friend so saying the Blessed One enteredGet out recluse said Alavaka to the Blessed One a second time Very well friend so saying the Blessed One went outCome in recluse  Very well friend so saying the Blessed One enteredGet out recluse said Alavaka to the Blessed One a third time Very well friend so saying the Blessed One went outCome in recluse  Very well friend so saying the Blessed One enteredGet out recluse said Alavaka to the Blessed One a fourth time No O friend I will not get outDo what you willI will ask you a question recluseIf you do not answer me I will confound your mind or cleave your heart or take you by your feet and fling you over to the further shore of the oceanWell friend I do not see anyone in the world of Devas Maras Brahmas or among the generation of recluses brahmanas deities and humans who could either confound my mind or cleave my heart or take me by the feet and fling me over to the further shore of the ocean nevertheless friend ask what you willThen Alavaka addressed the Blessed One in verseHaving thus spoken Alavaka said to the Blessed OneMost excellent O Gotama is thy teaching most excellentJust as a man would set upright what is overturned reveal what is concealed point out the way to one gone astray bring an oil lamp into the darkness so that those with eyes could see objects even so the Dhamma has been declared in many a manner by the Venerable GotamaI take refuge in the Venerable Gotama in the Dhamma and in the SanghaMay the Venerable Gotama accept me as a disciple who has taken refuge from this day forth while life lastsThus have I heardOn one occasion the Blessed One was living at Dakkhinagiri in the brahmana village Ekanala in MagadhaNow at that time it being the sowing season five hundred plows of the brahman Kasibharadvaja were put to useThen in the forenoon the Blessed One having dressed himself took bowl and robe and went to the place where brahman Kasibharadvajas work was going onIt was the time of food distribution by the brahman and the Blessed One drew near and stood at one sideBharadvaja seeing the Blessed One standing there for alms said to himRecluse I do plow and do sow and having plowed and sown I eatYou also recluse should plow and sow having plowed and sown you should eatI too brahman plow and sow having plowed and sown I eatWe do not see the Venerable Gotamas yoke or plow or plowshare or goad or oxenNevertheless the Venerable Gotama says I too brahman plow and sow having plowed and sown I eat Thereupon the brahman addressed the Blessed One in a stanzaYou profess to be a plowman yet your plow we do not see asked about your plow and the rest tell us of them that we may knowFaith is my seed austerity the rain wisdom my yoke and plow modesty is the pole mind the strap mindfulness is my plowshare and goadControlled in speech and conduct guarded in deed and speech abstemious in food I make truth my weed cutter arahantship my deliverance completeExertion my team in yoke draws me to Nibbanas security and on it goes without stopping wither gone one does not sufferThuswise is this plowing plowed which bears the fruit of Deathlessness having plowed this plowing one is freed from every illThen brahman Kasibharadvaja filling a golden bowl with milkrice offered it to the Blessed One saying May the Venerable Gotama partake of this milk rice a plowman indeed is Venerable Gotama who plows a plow for the fruit of DeathlessnessWhat I receive by reciting verses O brahman I should not eatIt is not the tradition of those who practice right livelihoodThe Buddhas reject what is received by reciting versesThis brahman is the conduct as long as Dhamma reignsTo those wholly consummate taintless and welldisciplined great sages should thou offer other food and drink sure field is that for meritseeking menTo whom then Venerable Gotama shall I give this milk riceBrahman in the world of Devas Maras and Brahmas or among the generation of recluses brahmanas deities and humans there is no one by whom this milk rice if eaten could be wholly digested except by the Tathagata or the disciple of a TathagataTherefore brahman either cast this milk rice where there is no grass or into water where there are no living creaturesThereupon the brahman flung that milk rice into water where there were no living creatures and the milk rice thrown into the water smoked and steamed making the noise cicchita citicita just like a plowshare heated during the day when thrown into water smokes and steams making the noise cicchita citicitaThen the brahman Kasibharadvaja alarmed with hair standing on end approached and fell with his head at the Blessed Ones feet and said as followsMost excellent O Gotama is thy teaching most excellentJust as a man would set upright what is overturned reveal what is concealed point out the way to one gone astray bring an oil lamp into the darkness so that those with eyes could see objects even so the Dhamma has been declared in many a manner by the Venerable GotamaI take refuge in the Venerable Gotama in the Dhamma and in the SanghaI wish to receive the novices ordination and higher ordinationBrahman Kasibharadvaja duly received both the pabbajja and upasampada from the Blessed OneNot long after his upasampada the Venrable Bharadvaja dwelling alone and aloof diligent strenuous and resolute ere long by his own insight here and now realized and attained the highest perfection the end of the Noble Life  for the sake of which men of good family go forth from home to live the homeless lifeBirth is destroyed lived is the noble life done is what has to be done there is no more of this stateThe Venerable Bharadvaja became one of the arahantsHaving heard the discourse on Blessings which deals with things that tend to mans weal and prosperity the deities thought to themselves The Buddha has told us about the blessings but not about the downfall and decline of man what if we were to approach the Buddha and question him about the things that tend to downfall So the day after the teaching of the Blessings by the Buddha the deities came up to the Master and asked these questionsThus have I heardOn one occasion the Blessed One was living near Savatthi at Jetavana at Anathapindikas monasteryNow when the night was far advanced a certain deity whose surpassing radiance illuminated the whole of Jetavana came to the presence of the Blessed One respectfully saluted him and stood beside himStanding thus he addressed the Blessed One in verseAbout the declining man we question thee GotamaWe have come to ask the Blessed One What is the cause of his downfallEasily known is the progressive one easily known is the declining oneThe lover of the Dhamma prospersThe hater of the Dhamma declinesWe understand this as explained this is the first cause of his downfallTell us the second O Blessed OneWhat is the cause of his downfallThe vicious are dear to himHe likes not the virtuous he approves the teachings of the illnatured  this is the cause of his downfallWe understand this as explained by thee this is the second cause of his downfallTell us the third O Blessed OneWhat is the cause of his downfallThe man who is fond of sleep and company inactive and lazy and manifesting anger this is the cause of his downfallWe understand this as explained by thee this is the third cause of his downfallTell us the fourth O Blessed OneWhat is the cause of his downfallWhoever being affluent does not support his mother and father who are old and past their prime  this is the cause of his downfallWe understand this as explained by thee this is the fourth cause of his downfallTell us the fifth O Blessed OneWhat is the cause of his downfallWhoever by falsehood deceives either a brahmana or a samana or any other mendicant  this is the cause of his downfallWe understand this as explained by thee this is the fifth cause of his downfallTell us the six O Blessed OneWhat is the cause of his downfallThe person who is possessed of much wealth who has gold and who has an abundance of food but enjoys his delicacies all by himself  this is the cause of his downfallWe understand this as explained by thee this is the sixth cause of his downfallTell us the seventh O Blessed OneWhat is the cause of his downfallThe man who proud of his birth of his wealth and of his clan despises his relations  this is the cause of his downfallWe understand this as explained by thee this is the seventh cause of his downfallTell us the eighth O Blessed OneWhat is the cause of his downfallThe man who is addicted to women is a drunkard a gambler and a squanderer of his earnings  this is the cause of his downfallWe understand this as explained by thee this is the eighth cause of his downfallTell us the ninth O Blessed OneWhat is the cause of his downfallNot satisfied with ones own wives he is seen among the whores and the wives of others  this is the cause of his downfallWe understand this as explained by thee this is the ninth cause of his downfallTell us the tenth O Blessed OneWhat is the cause of his downfallA person past his youth takes as wife a girl in her teens and sleeps not being jealous of her  this is the cause of his downfallWe understand this as explained by thee this is the tenth cause of his downfallTell us the eleventh O Blessed OneWhat is the cause of his downfallHe who places in authority a woman given to drink and squandering or a man of similar nature  this is the cause of his downfallWe understand this as explained by thee this is the eleventh cause of his downfallTell us the twelfth O Blessed OneWhat is the cause of his downfallHe who having but little possessions but great ambition is of warrior birth and aspires selfishly to sovereignty  this is the cause of his downfallFully realizing these causes of downfall in the world the sage endowed with ariyan insight shares a realm of securityThus have I heardOn one occasion the Blessed One was living near Savatthi at Jetavana at Anathapindikas monasteryThen in the forenoon the Blessed One having dressed himself took bowl and robe and entered the city of Savatthi for almsNow at that time a fire was burning and an offering was being prepared in the house of the brahman AggikabharadvajaThen the Blessed One while on his alms round came to the brahmans residenceThe brahman seeing the Blessed One some way off said this Stay there you shaveling stay there you wretched monk stay there you outcast When he spoke thus the Blessed One said to the brahman Do you know brahman who an outcast is and what the conditions are that make an outcast No indeed Venerable Gotama I do not know who an outcast is nor the conditions that make an outcastIt is good if Venerable Gotama were to explain the Dhamma to me so that I may know who an outcast is and what the conditions are that make an outcastListen then brahman and pay attention I will speakYes Venerable Sir replied the brahmanWhosoever is angry harbors hatred and is reluctant to speak well of others perverted in views deceitful  know him as an outcastWhosoever in this world kills living beings once born or twice born in whom there is no sympathy for living beings  know him as an outcastWhosoever destroys and besieges villages and hamlets and becomes notorious as an oppressor  know

an arahant a Consummate One pretends to be so is a thief in the whole universe  he is the lowest of outcastsNot by birth is one an outcast not by birth is one a brahmanBy deed one becomes an outcast by deed one becomes a brahmanKnow ye by the example I now citeThere was an outcasts son Sopaka who became known as MatangaThis Matanga attained the highest fame so difficult to gainMany were the warriors and brahmans who went to attend on himMounting the celestial chariot along the passionfree high road reached the Brahma realm having given up sense desiresHis birth did not prevent him from being reborn in the Brahma realmThere are brahmans born in the family of preceptors kinsmen of hymnsThey are often seen committing evil deedsIn this life itself they are despised in the next they are born in an evil state of existenceHigh birth does not prevent them from falling into a woeful state or from censureNot by birth is one an outcast not by birth is one a brahmanBy deed one becomes an outcast by deed one becomes an brahmanWhen the Buddha had thus spoken the Brahman Aggikabharadvaja said to the Blessed One Excellent O Venerable Gotama excellentJust as O Venerable Gotama a man were to set upright what had been overturned or were to reveal what had been hidden or were to point the way to one who had gone astray or were to hold an oil lamp in the dark so that those with eyes may see things even so in many ways has the Venerable Gotama expounded the Dhamma the doctrineI take refuge in the Venerable Gotama the Dhamma and the Sangha the OrderMay the Venerable Gotama accept me as

Isipatana near Varanasi cannot be set in motion by a recluse or brahmana or deva or Brahma or by anyone in the worldThat is to say it was a proclamation of the Four Noble Truths by way of teaching laying down establishing opening up analyzing and elucidating themThis the Venerable Sariputta saidThose monks glad at heart rejoiced at the words of the Venerable SariputtaThus have I heardOn one occasion the Blessed One was living on the Vultures Peak near RajagahaThen four great kings having placed a guard over the four quarters with a large army of Yakkhas of Gandhabbas of Kumbhandas of Nagas having placed troops having placed a barricade of soldiers on four sides came to the presence of the Blessed One when the night was far advanced illuminating the entire Vultures Peak with their surpassing radiance saluted the Blessed One and sat on one sideFrom among the Yakkhas some saluted the Blessed One and sat on one side some exchanged greetings with the Blessed One conversing in a friendly and courteous manner and sat on one side some saluted him with clasped hands and sat on one side some announced their name and lineage and sat on one side some sat on one side in silenceThen the great King Vessavana who was seated on one side said to the Blessed OneVenerable Sir there are eminent Yakkhas who are not pleased with the Blessed One there are also eminent Yakkhas pleased with the Blessed OneThere are Yakkhas of middle rank who are not pleased with the Blessed One and there are those who are pleased with the Blessed OneThere are Yakkhas of inferior rank who are not pleased with the Blessed One and there are those who are pleased with the Blessed OneThe Yakkhas bhante as a rule are not pleased with the Blessed OneWhat is the reason for thisWell the Blessed One teaches the Dhamma to establish abstention from killing from stealing from sexual misconduct from false speech and from liquor that causes intoxication and negligenceTo them such teaching is unpleasant and unpalatableSurely bhante there are disciples of the Blessed OneThey frequent the remote recesses of forest and woodland wilderness where there is no sound no tumult where breezes are void of human contact and suitable for mans seclusion and quiet contemplationThere are eminent Yakkhas who haunt these forests who have no faith in the word of the Blessed OneBhante may the Blessed One learn the Atanata protection so that the displeased Yakkhas may be pleased so that the monks and nuns laymen and laywomen may be at ease guarded protected and unharmedThe Blessed One gave consent by his

revered position satthu kathite imam parittam garu bhavissatiti pi ahaLearn ugganhatha There is nothing for the Buddha to learn afreshAs the Commentary says it was to create an opportunity for the Buddha to listen to the discourse Imam parittam savetum okasam karonto evamhaThe Venerable Angulimala while on his rounds for alms in Savatthi saw a woman in travailAfter his meal he approached the Buddha and told him what he had seenThereupon the master taught him this parittaHe then went to the presence of the suffering sister sat on a seat separated from her by a screen and made this asseveration of the TruthInstantly she gave birth to the child with great easeThe efficacy of the Angulimala paritta persists to this dayThis sutta is not included in the Book of Protection The words uttered by the Buddha by way of protection and learned by the Venerable Angulimala are found in the Angulimala suttaThe very water that washed the seat of him who recited this paritta has put an end to all dangerAt that very moment this paritta effected a safe delivery of the infantNow we shall recite that very efficacious paritta uttered by the Protector of the world which holds good for an aeonSince I was born of Aryan birth O sister I am not aware of having intentionally deprived any living being of his lifeBy this asseveration of Truth may you be wellMay thy unborn child be wellMay

texts are to the editions of the PTSThe Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creedsFounded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topicsIts publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddhas discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practiceThese works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first aroseLooang Boo Sim Buddhacaro was born on the th November in Sakhon Nakhon Province NorthEast ThailandHis parents were farmers and dedicated supporters of the local monasteryAt the age of Looang Boo Sim took novice ordination and shortly afterwards became a disciple of the great Ajahn MunLooang Boo Sim stayed with Ajahn Mun and various of his senior disciples for many years taking full ordination at the age of at Wat Sri Candaravasa Khon KaenIn later years he has been the Abbot of a number of monasteries in various parts of Thailand and was given the ecclesiastical title of Phra Khroo Santivaranana inIn he established a monastery in the remote mountains of Chiang Dao in Chiang Mai province and that has remained his residence until the present dayIn a collection of Dhamma discourses culled from talks that I have given over the years was printed for free distributionIt was entitledThe compiler of that book Upasika Somjy Chayarach has now arranged for the translation and publication of two of the talks that appeared in itI wish to take this opportunity to express my appreciation for this wholesome actThrough the power of merit that has been created may she be freed from all sufferingMay all those who read this short book take its teachings to heart reflect on them and practice accordingly so as to realize true liberation Looang Boo Sim BuddhacaroNow it is time for sitting meditationSit in the crosslegged posture place the right leg on top of the left leg and the right hand on top of the left handClose your eyes and inwardly recite the mantra Buddho in conjunction with the breathConcentrate the mind on BuddhoSitting meditation is an important way of paying homage to the BuddhaThe Buddha called all our former experiences irrespective of their quality thoughts of the pastNow in this moment do not allow such thoughts to preoccupy the mindLet them all goConcentrate the mind on the inner recitation of the mantra and bring the mind to peace in the present in the immediate realityIt is the present moment that is importantFuture matters good and bad all still lie ahead for by definition the future refers to things that have not yet taken placeThe meditator must compose his mind on the present momentIf a thought surfaces in consciousness simply remind yourself that it is just a thought of the past or a thought of the future as the case may beDont add to or encourage such thoughtsPut good thoughts to one side for the time being and the bad ones abandon altogetherSitting here our bodies are in a tranquil postureThe knowing is abiding within the heart and each one of us is awareThis present knowing is our true mindThe conditioned mind of thought and proliferation is almost like a demonThrough its actions external phenomena tend to become preoccupations which then obstruct or destroy meditationBut if the meditator grounds himself in the present moment then he is able to make use of the various meditation techniquesHe may develop inner recitation for example or perhaps focus on parts of the physical body such as head hair body hair nails teeth skin sinews and bonesWhen contemplation of the body ensues in perception of its unattractiveness or of its constituent elements of hardness cohesion temperature and vibration then that is meditationWhen the mind is at peace in the recitation of Buddho then that too is meditationAnd the meditator is the mindThe mind itself has no color shape or form but it has energyIt is our duty to let go of and abandon the conditioned proliferating mindBut the mind of present knowing that which concentrates on Buddha listens to Dhamma and reflects on its meaning having been clearly observed that true mind should be developedIn this case to develop means to give care and attention to establishing it in peacePeace comes by countering the outgoing stream of mentality and penetrating this present knowingThe normal unrestrained mind is absorbed by the thoughtconsciousness seeking distractionGo against the stream by looking at the source of mental activityIt originates from this knowingThe source of the mind lies within usHowever this knowing is nothing substantialIt has no color form or shape in the way that material objects doIt is a formless elementTo speak in terms of the five aggregates there isWhat is it that knows the true mind and what is it that knows the conditioned mindIt is just this one single knowing the same thing that hears the sound of the discourse and meditates on Buddho As there is just this single knowing muster your energies and vow to yourself I will not indulge the thinking mindI will gather the mind into itself Not allowing the mind to wander means that it stays with BuddhoAll you have to do then is to maintain BuddhoBuddho is the name of the Fully Enlightened One and should be reflected onThat we have come into contact with Buddhism with Buddha Dhamma and Sangha and that we have come to practice is due to the BuddhaThe Buddha after realizing supreme enlightenment gave to the world the teachings of DhammaVinaya that we call BuddhismThe great teachers of old and the four assemblies of Buddhists have carried on the study and practice of the teachings right up until the present timeIn Thailand today everywhere we go we see monasteries monks and novices eightprecept laymen and laywomen and householders with faith and inspiration in BuddhismThis is all thanks to the BuddhaIt has been a long time  over years  since the Buddha entered final nibbanaEven so the Dhamma and Vinaya the teachings and the ordinances based on the and precepts still remainWe bring the virtues of the Buddha to mind in order to be able to take him as an example in our practiceWhere did the Buddha come fromHe came from the mind that resolved on Buddhahood and wished to ferry all beings to nibbanaFrom the moment of his initial resolve in whatever realm the Buddhatobe was born into then whenever he performed acts of charity refrained from unvirtuous actions and speech or practiced meditation then Buddhahood was always his motivationWhenever he was born as a human being he accumulated virtueEventually the power of goodness created by his dana sila and bhavana the paramis that he had developed were strong enough for him to become BuddhaNow in recollecting the Buddha we take his virtues as our objectBuddho refers to the Lord Buddha and the one who inwardly recites Buddho is just this mindIt is just this mind that recites Buddho knows Buddho knows the breath and is aware while doing so that one is creating virtueThis mind has always been hereThe knowing has been born into the world countless times but because ignorance and craving have overwhelmed it our dana sila and bhavana have been insufficient to free us from the mass of suffering with which the human organism is fraughtSo we must muster our energy with firm resolve taking meditative calm as our foundationThe principles that will lead us out of this world and the mass of suffering are those of samatha and vipassana meditationThe mind must be firmly onepointed tranquil cool and at ease with samatha before vipassana is feasibleIf the mind is still in movement drifting and infirm still not tranquil and motionless or onepointed it is impossible for understanding of the nature of things to take placeTake as example the founder of our religion the fully selfenlightened BuddhaBefore his enlightenment he practiced calm meditation using the breath as his initial objectOn the day of his enlightenment he practiced this wayOn the inbreath he focussed intently on the inbreathOn the outbreath he focussed intently on the outbreathAll mental agitation and movement ceased leaving only the inbreaths and outbreaths remainingThe Lords mind was focussed intently on the breath until his mind became calm cool and easeful attaining the firmness of khanika upacara and ultimately the unwavering appana samadhiWhen the Buddhatobes mind was thus unwaveringly and undeviatingly singlepointed vipassana took place there was clear knowing of the body and mind as impermanent of all beings and phenomena as transitoryHe saw the suffering inherent in being born with a body and mind and he saw selflessnessHe realized that the perception of an abiding self is based on delusionIn order to clearly know these three characteristics of aniccam dukkham and anatta the mind must be firmThus the effort to bring the mind to a secure and steadfast tranquillity not allowing it to become fascinated by forms sounds odors flavors physical sensations and mental phenomena is the essence of meditation techniques and something we must all developTake care when the eyes see forms not to let the mind waver keep up the inner recitation of BuddhoTake care not to be deluded when hearing sounds beautiful or ugly sounds are all just worldly conditionsMaintain the minds firmnessThe pleasant and offensive odors that contact the nose  know them dont be deceived by themNo matter how delicious the taste of the food on the tongue  remain equanimousBe impassive to the various physical sensations whether hot or cold hard or softThis is the supreme practice in BuddhismSo gather your energies and establish the mind in the present momentIn general meditators minds are not unified and tranquil in the present moment  they are wandering up ahead and back behind taking up external matters concerning other people and dwelling on them finding pleasure and satisfaction in agreeable mental statesThey are caught up entirely in superficialitiesAlthough the mind of simple knowing is already present within us unless we bring it to the fore through meditation we will be unable to perceive the truth of sufferingWhen suffering arises in the body contemplate it so that the mind will accept it for what it isWhen physical illness occurs the grasping mind starts clinging to the idea of being illIn fact it is the earthelement that is unwellIf the meditators mind is stable and clearly sees the three characteristics he will simply regard illness as an affair of the elementsHe knows that the mind is formless and not subject to such painsIt is due to clinging to the idea of self and that the body belongs to self that mental suffering arisesIn fact this body is merely elements and it is the elements that are sickIt is the earth water fire and air elements that are disturbedIf one can separate things in this way then the mind rests at easeWhatever occurs in the physical body there is no clinging to it as belonging to selfIt is seen as simply a matter of elements a matter of aniccam dukkham anatta it is just the nature of thingsThe present knowing clearly truly and constantlyThe mind is cool no longer hot with clingingSuppose someone harshly scolds or maligns usEven if they abuse us right to our faces if we dont cling it ends right thereWhat has arisen passes awayBut if the knowing is misled it grasps at this body and mind as being selfWhen someone speaks to us harshly we get angry Thats nothing to do with me Due to clinging there is me and mine It is just this clinging that is the cause of suffering agitation turmoil and diseaseThe Buddha taught us to let go of all external affairs during meditation whatever physical or mental distress arises is just the suffering of the aggregates dont let the knowing sufferMeditate in order to attenuate the defilements of greed hatred and delusion and ultimately bring them to an endWhen the knowing is still deluded and clings to the idea of self to me and mine then it takes birthPerhaps it becomes an animal a human being a celestial being Indra or a Brahma godBut whatever it becomes it suffers just in being thatAs long as there is still clinging to the elements and aggregates to name and form and there is no awareness of the way to abandon defilements then there is suffering in the worldThe five aggregates are classified as suffering in the world for when one clings to them as me and mine then right there the mass of suffering appearsWe sit right on the pile of suffering in the midst of the fire of craving hatred and delusionThe fire flares up and constantly burns our heartWe are meditating now so as to gather the mind into the knowing in order to put out the fires that are burning our heartsDont harbor the fire of angerAbandon itThere is no need to get angry with anyoneIf you feel any jealousy or illwill towards anyone give it upDont allow the mind to indulge in itThis is cleansing the knowing both day and night whether standing sitting walking or laying downIt is not clinging to me and mine The aggregates do not belong to anyone they are something natural to the worldAs soon as the knowing is born with a name and form it tends to grasp onto that name and form as selfBut can that name and form last indefinitelyIf it could nobody would die nobody would become ill nobody would experience pain or get old because the aggregates would do what they are toldIt is because the aggregates dont do what they are told that the Buddha taught us not to cling to them but to see them clearly with penetrative wisdomIf there is no clear seeing then there is sufferingSo dont be fooled into clinging onto things it is suffering in the worldWhen the knowing no longer clings it is empty it is in meditation it is cool and at easeAll the different kinds of mental turmoil come from delusion the agitated striving mind that wants to possess want to get wants to be in other words the mind of cravingGet rid of craving and clinging from the mindTry to prevent anything from accumulating in this knowingMake the present knowing radiant and pureMeditateFirmly ground the mindGather the knowing onto itself and abandon the cognition of externalsLet the knowing dwell in the heartWhatever the posture of the body let the knowing know itself at all timesIf an evil thought arises abandon itIf goodness occurs develop it and here the goodness we resolve to develop is exemplified by the mantra Buddho We develop it or concentrate on it internally so as to make the mind cool and happyWe prevent agitation and distress with the elements and aggregates with the bodies and minds of other peopleWe dont allow them insideWhen the mind is thus cool and at ease it is said that Buddho is dwelling in the heartIn other words the knowing lies withinTo produce this firm and enduring tranquillity you must go against the stream and enter withinThen you will understand the practice of Dhamma with the mindfulness and wisdom that are present in the heartIf there is no countering the stream and no entry within the search for virtue externally is an endless oneTruth and virtue do not lie beneath the land or sea or in the sky or in spaceThey lie in volitions the mind that makes effort to give up evil and do goodWhen the mind converges right here it becomes spacious cool and easeful it is established in Dhamma practiceSitting there is meditation in the sitting posture standing there is meditation in the standing posture walking there is meditation while walking and lying down there is meditation until one falls asleepAs soon as we wake we continue the inner recitation of Buddho making Buddho our constant concernWherever the mind goes we dont follow itWe give up all the going and settle for dwellingThe knowing lies right here within us everything else is merely a passing affairThe truth lies with the knowingClearly observe that since our birth into this world the knowing has dwelt in the bodyWherever we go the body goes tooThe knowing cannot escape from the body and mindIt drags the body with it here and thereWhen we sit it is the body that sits and when we lay down it is the body that lays down and so the knowing is deceived into attaching to that name and form the provisional realities of the worldNot comprehending the way to withdraw from them and put them down the defilements of greed hatred and delusion steadily accumulateSo in studying Buddhism whether its the Dhamma or the Discipline whatever method it is being taught by having studied we must put those teachings into practiceWe must compose this knowing firmly on itselfKeep the mind within dont allow it to wander about and become fascinated with sentient beings and the material world through delusion and unclear seeingResolve to put forth effortAspire to rid yourself of defilementsGreed hatred and delusion all lie here within the mind so put effort into abandoning them just hereBe vigilant and care for the mind right hereRecite Buddho right hereCompose the knowingWhen we have established the knowing in this way then in whatever posture we are in there is constant meditationSitting here we can inwardly recite Buddho undistracted and undeceived by external mattersWe have been deluded by the external world for countless lifetimesLet us not be deluded by it any moreNow it is time for meditationSit in the crosslegged posturePlace your right leg on your left and your right hand on your left oneSit up straightThe time of sitting meditation is a time to stopClose your eyes right now there is nothing to do and nowhere to go you have no need for themOnce your eyes are closed recollect that the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha all lie within our mindsDont conceive of them as existing outside ourselvesIt is just this mind that inwardly recites Buddho on every inhalation and exhalationIt is just this mind that is the foundation of the Buddha Dhamma and SanghaIt is here that the practice takes placeThe DhammaVinaya all the vast number of teachings that the Buddha gave all share the single purpose of bringing our minds to peace the attenuation and abandonment of greed hatred and delusionThe teachings of the Buddha were given over a period of fortyfive years from the time of his enlightenment until the day of his deathIn the Buddhist scriptures there is a grouping of the teachings into three sections the Discourses the Monastic Regulations and the AbhidhammaIn all it is said there are teachingsConsidered according to the principles of Dhamma our bodies are like the carved wooden cupboard in which the scriptures are keptThe Discourses the Monastic Regulations and the Abhidhamma are each persons action speech and mindWe can make this comparison for the reason that every single teaching was given in order to be actualized by the disciple who received itSo in our practice let us keep the precepts  or according to our situationLet us practice samadhi and cultivate wisdomSpiritual practice was summarized by the Buddha as the threefold training of sila samadhi and paññaIf sila is pure and samadhi is firm enough to give rise to pañña then the path to liberation from defilements is manifestIn sitting meditation do not be deceived by the thoughtdemonThose people who only sit a little or dont sit at all are the ones who believe in the thoughtdemonFor instance we decide to sit before dawn and the thoughtdemon tells us it is too early why not sit later onIf we believe it then our morning session is lost we dont sitLater on in the morning and perhaps we forget altogether but if we do remember just as we are about to rouse ourselves and do some sitting meditation the thoughtdemon pipes up againYou dont want to sit yetYouve just had your breakfast your stomach is still fullHave a rest firstYou can always do some sitting in the afternoon If we believe it thats delusionBefore dawn it says meditate later on in the morningLater on in the morning it says meditate in the afternoonIf you digest your food first you will feel much more comfortable If we believe it we dont sitIn the afternoon it starts againWe end up just believing the thoughtdemon all day and all night and so get nothing from meditationBefore the Buddhas enlightenment it was this belief in the thoughtdemon that obstructed himHe just kept continually procrastinatingIt took six years from the time of leaving home until he finally came to his senses and stopped believing the thoughtdemonJust picture it nowOn the day of his enlightenment the Buddhatobe sat down with his back to the bodhi tree facing slightly north of eastThen he made a solemn vow an absolutely firm resolution that his sitting that night would be a lifeordeath affair under no circumstances would he rise from his seat until he was enlightenedHe would die firstThe Buddhatobe had seen through the thoughtdemons tricksHe had realized that it was because of falling for the constant lies and deceptions of the thoughtdemon that he was still unenlightenedOn that Visakha Puja night the Lord did not move from his seat he just satEven so it says in the scriptures that the daughters of Mara all the hosts of temptation attacked him stronglyBut the Buddha did not give inThey urged him to get up but he would notThe Buddha focussed his attention on his breathingIf he did get up he knew that all that awaited him was death at most he might postpone it for eighty or a hundred years and so he just looked intently at his breathingHe reflected that if after inhalation some obstruction or other prevented the exhalation then he would dieIf after exhalation some blockage in the lungs prevented inhalation then also he would dieThe Buddha just stayed with the breath seeing death in every inhalation and exhalationThere was still no Buddha Dhamma or SanghaThe Buddha was not yet the Buddha his mind had been pushed around for so long by the thoughtdemonSo he took up the subject of death to teach his mind with every inhalation and exhalation until a strong conviction and clarity of mind arose in him that death is indeed certain that with the cutting off of the breath death is inevitableThe Buddha looked intently to see the inevitability of death with every breathHe reflected There is no one born into this world that does not dieIf people do not die as children then they die as youthsIf they do not die in their youth they die in their old ageIf they die then I must dieI must completely abandon the defilements of greed hatred and delusion before deathI must realize enlightenment The Buddhatobe made a firm and unwavering resolveHe brought to mind all the virtues that he had developed to perfection those of giving morality renunciation wisdom endurance truthfulness resolution kindness and equanimity and he allowed them to converge in the mind as it was aware of the breathingThe Lords mind was as solid as the earth more so perhaps because the earth is still subject to tremorsAs for the mind of the Buddhatobe as he recollected the charity morality and meditation that he had practiced and concentrated them in this firm mind more solid than Mother Earth absolutely immoveable then he felt ready even to sacrifice his lifeIf death had come to him at that moment he would have felt no fearThe teachers of old described that moment with an imageThey say the earth goddess squeezed waters from the bun of her hair that swept away the hosts of Mara into the jaws of a fabulous crocodileThis is putting it figurativelyThe earth goddess is the earthWhen our minds are firm and stable like the earth we can vanquish the thoughtdemon the defilementdemon overcome all the myriad forms of craving and clingingConsider the nature of the earthThe rain falls in the monsoon season and the earth is unaffectedThe sun blazes in the hot season hot enough to cause fires and in the winter the weather is so cold that frost forms on the grasstips and yet the earth remains unmovedMankind appears and divides the world up into countriesIt digs and mines and burns the earth does all sorts of things even drops atom bombs on itBut the earth remains impassiveIf the mind of an ordained or unordained person has a true and clear conviction in the Buddhas teachings then it will not waver in any wayFor such a person tiredness and exhaustion is merely an affair of the aggregatesWherever the body or form aggregate exists there is going to be hunger weariness and exhaustion as a matter of courseThe body has to eat it has to sleep it needs all kinds of thingsThat is a matter of aggregates a matter of elementsWe should not let the mind waver in the fact of those conditionsWhen you set out to do something sitting meditation for example dont let the demons of thought and defilement fool youOr if as a monk you make a resolution to keep the ascetic practice of not laying down then make your resolution firmDont start worrying about the effects it might have on your healthNo illness transcends deathDeath is the worst that can happenIf you miss your sleep even if you really suffer youll just die thats allLet the thoughtdemon know that you are ready to battle with death and it wont come to deceive you againSit and cultivate Buddho with every inhalation and exhalationIf meditators minds are firmly established in this way they will feel a lightness in body and mind and a brightness and clarity as if a powerful force has arisen within themSuch a mind is brave and courageous without fear of death or fear of tiredness not frail and timidWhen you have spare time rush to meditateHurry its urgentIf you dont wish to do it urgently you wont do it at allYou will believe the thoughtdemon or believe people not interested in meditation and they will discourage youThe Buddha said turitturitam singhasingham  Rush hurry its urgentMeditate on every inhalation and exhalationDetermine to practice right at this momentIf we dont then the demons of thought and defilement will lead us away into old age and deathEven on the day of death we still wont have the timeThe people who have no time to practice are the people who believe in the thoughtdemonAll of you who are practicing Dhamma dont believe the thoughtdemonTeach it at every breath This is the breathIt may cease at any moment The Buddha himself used the breathing process as the subject of calm meditation and the foundation of insight meditationIt was the ground of his Dhamma practiceAll of us too are inhaling and exhaling we too all have body and mindAs the Buddha did if we overcome the defilements in our hearts we will clearly perceive NibbanaThis is certainWhy bother doubting about itIndecision unwillingness to commit oneself to Dhamma practice or to put forth effort at this very moment its just that sort of mental state that the Buddha called doubtGet rid of your doubtsThe Buddha taught us not to reach out towards the past or futureIf we do we get stuckWe dont get anywhere at allBut if we ground the mind in the present we can testify to the inner knowing that lies within us allIf that knowing didnt exist then how could we talk how could we come and listen to DhammaIt exists and it is right in that knowing that lie virtue and accumulated purityWe meditate in order to gather the energies of the mind into this inner knowingWe put down thoughts and senseconsciousness the defiled mind that goes out in search of distractionsWe give up thinking of friends and families forests and streams everything that lies outside of the present momentIts all false and wrongWhat is right what is straight is that which the Buddha called tattha or in that place In that place refers to the knowing that lies within our mindWhen the energy of the mind is pacified unified and grounded on the knowing a firm faith and confidence in that knowing arisesThere is sila  and it is the knowing that keeps sila that cares for actions and speechThere is samadhi  and it is the knowing that is firmThere is pañña  and it is the knowing that has direct knowledge of the mass of physical and mental conditionsThere is nothing that lies beyond the mindThis mind can both know truly and know deludedlyWhen we justly allow it to blindly follow forms sounds odors flavors tangible objects and ideas it is deceived day and night from birth until old age from old age until deathIt can be fascinated by those things for innumerable lifetimesWhen we come to meditate we put effort into burning up the defilements in our hearts so that they diminish and finally come to an endThus our effort is concentrated on this mindWe keep reminding ourselves that apart from this knowing that is established in the present moment everything  be it past or present good or bad  is all impermanentThere is nothing lasting to be found in the worldEverything outside of this knowing is unsatisfactory and impersonalEven the knowing itself is still not sure if the masses of defilement cram and encompass itWe must put effort into burning up the defilements right hereWe must develop generosity morality and meditation right here here in the mind of present knowingBe wary of the forms that come into our line of vision and the sounds that enter the ears  dont follow themOdors that enter at the nose flavors that pass by the tongue sensations hot and cold hard and soft  dont be deluded by themDont be misled by discursive thoughtDont be fooled by conditionsWhy did the Buddha not want us to be deludedBecause he wanted us to knowBy now all of us in the course of time have come to know all sorts of thingsBut what have we got from itAll we have got is old age and deathDeath and then birth and then death and then birth over and over againCan you see thisAll human beings are born and then they die just like a sound that having arisen disappears or a form once created comes to an endWherever there is arising there must be passing awayThe Buddha taught us to know this truthIt is the knowledge taught by the Buddha and all his noble disciplesThey all instruct us to know our minds to be aware of ourselves not to be intoxicated by mental states thinking or cravingThe Buddha described three kinds of craving the craving for sensepleasures the craving to become and the craving not to become  ie coarse middling and subtle cravingAll of its forms lie within the mind and their abandonment is dependent on effort and close attention burning up the cravings rather than being swept along by themThus practice implies not following the cravings desires and wishes that ariseWhen craving starts to cause distress and turmoil in the mind we pacify it know it clearly withinThe Buddha taught us to clearly see into this mind and also to see the things outside of itHe wanted us to see that there is nothing permanent or substantial anywhere at all and there is nothing that can provide us with lasting happinessAll there is is unsatisfactoriness or dukkhaWe sit and there is dukkha in the sitting postureWe lay down and there is dukkha in the layingWe stand up and there is dukkha in the standingWe walk and there is dukkha in the walkingEven when we talk or give a Dhammadiscourse dukkha is presentThere is no real happinessAll those things which we assume to be happiness are all falseIf they were true happiness why is death followed by birthThere is no real happinessWhat people call happiness is just a delusion of the worldlyThe enlightened ones say that its all just stories of dukkha and unknowingThus the Buddha and his disciples enlightened and unenlightened practice calm and insight meditation in every postureThey put energy into their meditation at all times continually accelerating their effortsThey go without sleepIf in the inner struggle with defilements we just indulge in rest and sleep the defilements will trample all over us we will be unable to overcome themIf we get up and sit in meditation contemplate unattractiveness or the elements so as to see the unsatisfactoriness inherent in the body and mind point out and reveal these things to our intoxicated indulgent mind then we will be able to put forth effort to burn up the defilements of ignorance and delusionWhenever we are deluded or intoxicated with something then we lose our selfawareness and then there is pitchblack darknessThere is no path that will take us into such utter darkness as that of delusion not knowing the nature of the mind and body not perceiving the three characteristics not seeing clearly in the present momentThe deluded mind puts no effort into eradicating defilements in the present momentIt is engrossed in the pleasures derived from forms sounds odors flavors physical sensations and mental states taking them to be happinessBut that happiness is bound up with materiality it is not true happinessThe Buddha said that true happiness is the happiness of nibbanaThe happiness of nibbana is a nonclinging happinessIt does not depend on obtaining or rejecting anythingIt is the complete annihilation of desire hatred and delusion both internally and externallyIt is because there is not a single remnant of defilement that it is called happinessIt is a true unchanging happiness not fickle and deceitfulAs for happiness in the world however intense it may be it is still deceitfulEven millionaires multimillionaires kings and emperors must all still suffer through the power of defilementsThe Buddha called the defilements fires Fires are hot and wherever the fire of desire occurs then that place is hotWhenever the fire of aversion and delusion occur then those places are hotWhere do they occurIn the mind that does not know and see clearly the mind that does not let go the mind that does not abandon and releaseThe mind tends to cling to the idea of selfIt clings to the body as being self but after death the body lies rotting on the ground and is crematedHave you ever seen thatIf you havent yet realized that the same fate awaits you then look at other peopleParents and grandparents where have they all goneThey are deadAfter they died where did their bodies goThey went to earthIn the end this body that we cling to as being me and mine will turn to earth and theres nothing we can do to prevent itWe cant forbid old age sickness and deathThe Buddha said that what we can do is to prevent the mind from being deluded by it allCreate clear knowing in the mindApart from this knowing mind everything is aniccam impermanentDont be deceived by it all at any costApart from this knowing mind everything is dukkham its all unsatisfactory and unstableApart from this knowing mind there is no atta no independent entitySelf and others is a convention of the worldIn truth none of it is self there is nothing that is really me or mine Experiment with separating out hair of the head hair of the body nails teeth skin flesh and bonesDivide things up into the elements of earth water fire and airHave a look at what is whatThere is nothing substantial there just agreed conventionsDont be misled by those conditionsGo against the outflowing stream of the mindEnter samadhi and pacify the mindEstablish yourself in the practice of Dhamma and keep burning up the defilements of desire aversion and delusionAs long as they still remain keep trying to gradually eliminate themThis is called not backslidingViriyena dukkhamacenti said the Buddha Dukkha is transcended through effort When there is effort in our minds we can free ourselves of sufferingIf those who practice Dhamma believe this saying with all their hearts dont slacken but firmly resolve to practice calm and insight meditation to the best of their abilities when their spiritual faculties and accumulated purity are fully mature then they will realize enlightenmentOf this there is no doubtSo having listened to these skillful means that I have outlined and clearly appreciated the truth of them in your hearts then impress them in your memory and take them away and practice them accordingly for your welfare and happinessIn our day and age the practice of going into the forest to meditate and follow the ascetic dhutanga practices began with Phra Ajaan Sao Kantasilo the teacher of Phra Ajaan Mun and by extension Phra Ajaan Singh and Phra Ajaan LeePhra Ajaan Sao was inclined to be not a preacher or a speaker but a doerWhen he taught his students he said very littleAnd those who studied directly under him are now elders who speak very little who rarely preach having picked up the habit from their teacherThus as Phra Ajaan Sao was not a preacher I would like to tell you a little of the way in which he taught meditationHow did Phra Ajaan Sao teachIf it so happened that someone came to him saying Ajaan sir I want to practice meditationHow should I go about it he would answer Meditate on the word Buddho If the person asked What does Buddho mean Ajaan Sao would answer Dont askWhat will happen after Ive meditated on BuddhoDont askYour only duty is simply to repeat the word Buddho over and over in your mindThats how he taught no long drawnout explanationsNow if the student was sincere in putting the Ajaans instructions into practice and was persistent in practicing the repetition if his mind then became calm and bright from entering into concentration he would come and ask Ajaan Sao When meditating on Buddho my state of mind becomes suchandsuchWhat should I do now If it was right Ajaan Sao would say Keep on meditating If not he would say You have to do suchandsuchWhat youre doing isnt rightFor example once when I was his attendant novice a senior monk of the Mahanikaya sect came and placed himself under his direction as a beginning student in meditationAjaan Sao taught him to meditate on Buddho Now when the monk settled down on Buddho his mind became calm and once it was calm brightAnd then he stopped repeating Buddho At this point his mind was simply blankAfterwards he sent his attention out following the brightness and a number of visions began to arise spirits of the dead hungry ghosts divine beings people animals mountains forests Sometimes it seemed as if he or rather his mind left his body and went wandering through the forest and wilderness seeing the various things mentioned aboveAfterwards he went and told Ajaan Sao When I meditated down to the point were the mind became calm and bright it then went out following the bright lightVisions of ghosts divine beings people and animals appearedSometimes it seemed as if I went out following the visionsAs soon as Ajaan Sao heard this he said This isnt rightFor the mind to go knowing and seeing outside isnt rightYou have to make it know insideThe monk then asked How should I go about making it know insidePhra Ajaan Sao answered When the mind is in a bright state like that when it has forgotten or abandoned its repetition and is simply sitting empty and still look for the breathIf the sensation of the breath appears in your awareness focus on the breath as your object and then simply keep track of it following it inward until the mind becomes even calmer and brighterAnd so the monk followed the Ajaans instructions until finally the mind settled down in threshold concentration following which the breath became more and more refined ultimately to the point where it disappearedHis sensation of having a body also disappeared leaving just the state in which the mind was sitting absolutely still a state of awareness itself standing out clear with no sense of going forward or back no sense of where the mind was because at that moment there was just the mind all on its ownAt this point the monk came again to ask After my mind has become calm and bright and I fix my attention on the breath and follow the breath inward until it reaches a state of being absolutely quiet and still  so still that nothing is left the breath doesnt appear the sense of having a body vanishes only the mind stands out brilliant and still When its like this is it right or wrongWhether its right or wrong the Ajaan answered take that as your standardMake an effort to be able to do this as often as possible and only when youre skilled at it should you come and see me againSo the monk followed the Ajaans instructions and later was able to make his mind still to the point that there was no sense of having a body and the breath disappeared more and more oftenHe became more and more skilled and his mind became more and more firmEventually after he had been making his mind still very frequently  because as a rule theres the principle that virtue develops concentration concentration develops discernment discernment develops the mind  when his concentration became powerful and strong it gave rise to abhiñña  heightened knowledge and true insightKnowledge of whatKnowledge of the true nature of the mind that is knowing the states of the mind as they occur in the presentOr so he saidAfter he had left this level of concentration and came to see Ajaan Sao he was told This level of concentration is fixed penetrationYou can rest assured that in this level of concentration there is no insight or knowledge of anything at allTheres only the brightness and the stillnessIf the mind is forever in that state it will be stuck simply on that level of stillnessSo once youve made the mind still like this watch for the interval where it begins to stir out of its concentrationAs soon as the mind has a sense that its beginning to take up an object  no matter what object may appear first  focus on the act of taking up an objectThats what you should examineThe monk followed the Ajaans instructions and afterwards he was able to make fair progress in the level of his mindThis is one instance of how Phra Ajaan Sao taught his pupils  teaching just a little at a time giving only the very heart of the practice almost as if he would say Do this and this and this with no explanations at allSometimes I would wonder about his way of teachingThat is I would compare it with books I had read or with the Dhammatalks I heard given by other teachersFor example Phra Ajaan Singh wrote a small handbook for the practice of meditation entitled Taking the Triple Refuge and the Techniques of Meditation and in it he said that in practicing meditation you must before all else sit with your body straight and establish mindfulness directly in front of youThats how he put it but not how Ajaan Sao would put itStill the principles they taught were one and the same the only difference being that Ajaan Sao was not a preacher and so didnt make use of a lot of rhetoricAs he explained to me When we make up our mind to repeat Buddho the act of making up the mind is in itself the act of establishing mindfulnessWhen we keep thinking Buddho and are not willing to let the mind slip away from Buddho our mindfulness and alertness are already healthy and strong always watching over the mind to keep it with Buddho As soon as our attention slips away so that we forget to think Buddho and go thinking of something else its a sign that theres a lapse in our mindfulnessBut if we can keep our mindfulness under control and can think Buddho Buddho continuously with no gaps our mindfulness is already strong so theres no need to go establishing mindfulness anywhereTo think of an object so that it is coupled with the mind is in and of itself the act of getting mindfulness established That was how he explained it to meThis was one instance of how I saw and heard Phra Ajaan Sao teaching meditation and should be enough to serve us all as food for thoughtIts not difficult to learn a little Pali through selfstudy using a textbook or two as a guideMany people find it helpful to study with others either in a formal classroom setting or in a more relaxed Pali study groupFor many of us the goal is not to become expert scholars and translators of the language but simply to become acquainted with enough of the basics of the language to

the basicsIncluded in the book A Heart ReleasedIncluded in the book A Heart ReleasedIncluded in the book A Heart ReleasedThroughout its history Buddhism has worked as a civilizing forceIts teachings on karma for instance  the principle that all intentional actions have consequences  have taught morality and compassion to many societiesBut on a deeper level Buddhism has always straddled the line between civilization and wildernessThe Buddha himself gained Awakening in a forest gave his first sermon in a forest and passed away in a forestThe qualities of mind he needed in order to survive physically and mentally as he went unarmed into the wilds were key to his discovery of the DhammaThey included resilience resolve and alertness selfhonesty and circumspection steadfastness in the face of loneliness courage and ingenuity in the face of external dangers compassion and respect for the other inhabitants of the forestThese qualities formed the home culture of the DhammaPeriodically as Buddhism spread and adapted to different societies some practitioners felt that the original message of the Dhamma had become dilutedSo they returned to the wilderness in order to revive its home cultureMany wilderness traditions are still alive today especially in the Theravada countries of Sri Lanka and Southeast AsiaThere mendicant ascetic monks continue to wander through the remaining rainforests in search of Awakening in the same environment where the Buddha found Awakening himselfAmong these wilderness traditions the one that has attracted the largest number of Western students and is beginning to take root in the West is the Kammatthana Forest tradition of ThailandThe Kammatthana tradition was founded by Ajaan Mun Bhuridatto in the early decades of this centuryAjaan Muns mode of practice was solitary and strictHe followed the Vinaya faithfully and also observed many of what are known as the thirteen classic dhutanga practices such as living off almsfood wearing robes made of castoff rags dwelling in the forest eating only one meal a daySearching out secluded places in the wilds of Thailand and Laos he avoided the responsibilities of settled monastic life and spent long hours of the day and night in meditationIn spite of his reclusive nature he attracted a large following of students willing to put up with the hardships of forest life in order to study with himHe also had his detractors who accused him of not following traditional Thai Buddhist customsHe usually responded by saying that he wasnt interested in bending to the customs of any particular society  as they were by definition the customs of people with greed anger and delusion in their mindsHe was more interested in finding and following the Dhammas home culture or what he called the customs of the noble ones the practices that had enabled the Buddha and his disciples to achieve Awakening in the first placeThis phrase  the customs of the noble ones  comes from an incident in the Buddhas life not long after his Awakening he returned to his home town in order to teach the Dhamma to the family he had left six years earlierAfter spending the night in a forest he went for alms in town at daybreakHis father the king learned of this and immediately went to upbraid himThis is shameful the king saidNo one in the lineage of our family has ever gone beggingIts against our family customsYour majesty the Buddha replied I now belong not to the lineage of my family but to the lineage of the noble onesTheirs are the customs I followAjaan Mun devoted many years of his life to tracking those customs downBorn in the son of rice farmers in the northeastern province of Ubon he was ordained as a monk in the provincial capital inAt the time of his ordination there were two broad types of Buddhism available in ThailandThe first can be called Customary Buddhism  the mores and rites handed down over the centuries from teacher to teacher with little if any reference to the Pali canonFor the most part these customs taught monks to live a sedentary life in the village monastery serving the local villagers as doctors or fortune tellersMonastic discipline tended to be looseOccasionally monks would go on a pilgrimage they called dhutanga which bore little resemblance to the classic dhutanga practicesInstead it was more an undisciplined escape valve for the pressures of sedentary lifeMoreover monks and lay people practiced forms of meditation that deviated from the path of tranquillity and insight outlined in the Pali canonTheir practices called vichaa aakhom or incantation knowledge involved initiations and invocations used for shamanistic purposes such as protective charms and magical powersThey rarely mentioned nirvana except as an entity to be invoked for shamanic ritesThe second type of Buddhism available at the time was Reform Buddhism based on the Pali canon and begun in the s by Prince Mongkut who later became King Rama IVPrince Mongkut was ordained as a monk for twentyseven years before ascending the throneAfter studying the canon during his early years as a monk he grew discouraged by the level of practice he saw around him in Thai monasteriesSo he reordained among the Mons  an ethnic group that straddled the ThaiBurmese border and occupied a few villages across the river from Bangkok  and studied Vinaya and the classic dhutanga practices under the guidance of a Mon teacherLater his brother King Rama III complained that it was disgraceful for member of the royal family to join an ethnic minority and so built a monastery for the PrinceMonk on the Bangkok side of the riverThere Mongkut attracted a small but strong following of likeminded monks and lay supporters and in this way the Dhammayut movement was bornIn its early years the Dhammayut movement was an informal grouping devoted to Pali studies focusing on Vinaya the classic dhutanga practices a rationalist interpretation of the Dhamma and the revival of meditation techniques taught in the Pali canon such as recollection of the Buddha and mindfulness of the bodyNone of the movements members however could prove that the teachings of the Pali canon actually led to enlightenmentMongkut himself was convinced that the path to nirvana was no longer open but he felt that a great deal of merit could be made by reviving at least the outward forms of the earliest Buddhist traditionsFormally taking a bodhisattva vow he dedicated the merit of his efforts to future BuddhahoodMany of his students also took vows hoping to become disciples of that future BuddhaUpon disrobing and ascending the throne after his brothers death in Rama IV was in a position to impose his reforms on the rest of the Thai Sangha but chose not toInstead he quietly sponsored the building of new Dhammayut centers in the capital and the provinces which was how  by the time of Ajaan Mun  there came to be a handful of Dhammayut monasteries in UbonAjaan Mun felt that Customary Buddhism had little to offer and so he joined the Dhammayut order taking a student of Prince Mongkut as his preceptorUnlike many who joined the order at the time he wasnt interested in the social advancement that would come with academic study and ecclesiastical appointmentsInstead his life on the farm had impressed on him the sufferings inherent in the cycle of life and death and his single aim was to find a way out of the cycleAs a result he soon left the scholarly environment of his preceptors temple and went to live with a teacher named Ajaan Sao Kantasilo in a small meditation monastery on the outskirts of townAjaan Sao was unusual in the Dhammayut order in that he had no scholarly interests but was devoted to the practice of meditationHe trained Ajaan Mun in strict discipline and canonical meditation practices set in the context of the dangers and solitude of the wildernessHe could not guarantee that this practice would lead to the noble attainments but he believed that it headed in the right directionAfter wandering for several years with Ajaan Sao Ajaan Mun set off on his own in search of a teacher who could show him for sure the way to the noble attainmentsHis search took nearly two decades and involved countless hardships as he trekked through the jungles of Laos central Thailand and Burma but he never found the teacher he soughtGradually he realized that he would have to follow the Buddhas example and take the wilderness itself as his teacher not simply to conform to the ways of nature  for nature is samsara itself  but to break through to truths transcending them entirelyIf he wanted to find the way beyond aging illness and death he would have to learn the lessons of an environment where aging illness and death are thrown into sharp reliefAt the same time his encounters with other monks in the forest convinced him that learning the lessons of the wilderness involved more than just mastering the skills of physical survivalHe would also have to develop the acuity not to be misled by deadend sidetracks in his meditationSo with a strong sense of the immensity of his task he returned to a mountainous region in central Thailand and settled alone in a caveIn the long course of his wilderness training Ajaan Mun learned that  contrary to Reform and Customary beliefs  the path to nirvana was not closedThe true Dhamma was to be found not in old customs or texts but in the welltrained heart and mindThe texts were pointers for training nothing more or lessThe rules of the Vinaya instead of simply being external customs played an important role in physical and mental survivalAs for the Dhamma texts practice was not just a matter of confirming what they saidReading and thinking about the texts could not give an adequate understanding of what they meant  and did not count as showing them true respectTrue respect for the texts meant taking them as a challenge putting their teachings seriously to the test to see if in fact they are trueIn the course of testing the teachings the mind would come to many unexpected realizations that were not contained in the textsThese in turn had to be put to the test as well so that one learned gradually by trial and error to the point of an actual noble attainmentOnly then Ajaan Mun would say did one understand the DhammaThis attitude toward the Dhamma parallels what ancient cultures called warrior knowledge  the knowledge that comes from developing skills in difficult situations  as opposed to the scribe knowledge that people sitting in relative security and ease can write down in wordsOf course warriors need to use words in their training but they view a text as authoritative only if its teachings are borne out in practiceThe Canon itself encourages this attitude when it quotes the Buddha as teaching his aunt As for the teachings of which you may know These teachings lead to dispassion not to passion to being unfettered not to being fettered to divesting not to accumulating to modesty not to selfaggrandizement to contentment not to discontent to seclusion not to entanglement to aroused persistence not to laziness to being unburdensome not to being burdensome You may definitely hold This is the Dhamma this is the Vinaya this is the Teachers instruction Thus the ultimate authority in judging a teaching is not whether the teaching can be found in a textIt lies in each persons relentless honesty in putting the Dhamma to the test and carefully monitoring the resultsWhen Ajaan Mun had reached the point where he could guarantee that the path to the noble attainments was still open he returned to the northeast to inform Ajaan Sao and then to continue wanderingGradually he began to attract a grassroots followingPeople who met him were impressed by his demeanor and teachings which were unlike those of any other monks they had knownThey believed that he embodied the Dhamma and Vinaya in everything he did and saidAs a teacher he took a warriors approach to training his studentsInstead of simply imparting verbal knowledge he put them into situations where they would have to develop the qualities of mind and character needed in surviving the battle with their own defilementsInstead of teaching a single meditation technique he taught them a full panoply of skills  as one student said Everything from washing spittoons on up  and then sent them into the wildsIt was after Ajaan Muns return to the northeast that a third type of Buddhism emanating from Bangkok  State Buddhism  began to impinge on his lifeIn an effort to present a united front in the face of imperialist threats from Britain and France Rama V wanted to move the country from a loose feudal system to a centralized nationstateAs part of his program he and his brothers  one of whom was ordained as a monk  enacted religious reforms to prevent the encroachment of Christian missionariesHaving received their education from British tutors they created a new monastic curriculum that subjected the Dhamma and Vinaya to Victorian notions of reason and utilityTheir new version of the Vinaya for instance was a compromise between Customary and Reform Buddhism designed to counter Christian attacks that monks were unreliable and lazyMonks were instructed to give up their wanderings settle in established monasteries and accept the new state curriculumBecause the Dhammayut monks were the best educated in Thailand at the time  and had the closest connections to the royal family  they were enlisted to do advance work for the government in outlying regionsIn a Dhammayut authority unsympathetic to meditation and forest wanderers took charge of religious affairs in the northeastTrying to domesticate Ajaan Muns following he ordered them to establish monasteries and help propagate the governments programAjaan Mun and a handful of his students left for the north where they were still free to roamIn the early s Ajaan Mun was appointed the abbot of an important monastery in the city of Chieng Mai but fled the place before dawn of the following dayHe returned to settle in the northeast only in the very last years of his life after the local ecclesiastical authorities had grown more favorably disposed to his way of practiceHe maintained many of his dhutanga practices up to his death inIt wasnt until the s that the movement he founded gained acceptance in Bangkok and only in the s did it come into prominence on a nationwide levelThis coincided with a widespread loss of confidence in state monks many of whom were little more than bureaucrats in robesAs a result Kammatthana monks came to represent in the eyes of many monastics and lay people a solid and reliable expression of the Dhamma in a world of fast and furious modernizationBuddhist history has shown that wilderness traditions go through a very quick life cycleAs one loses its momentum another often grows up in its placeBut with the wholesale destruction of Thailands forests in the last few decades the Kammatthana tradition may be the last great forest tradition that Thailand will produceFortunately we in the West have learned of it in time to gather lessons that will be help in cultivating the customs of the noble ones on Western soil and establishing authentic wilderness traditions of our ownPerhaps the most important of those lessons concerns the role that the wilderness plays in testing and correcting trends that develop among Buddhists in cities and townsThe story of the Kammatthana tradition gives lie to the facile notion that Buddhism has survived simply by adapting to its host cultureThe survival of Buddhism and the survival of the Dhamma are two different thingsPeople like Ajaan Mun  willing to make whatever sacrifices are needed to discover and practice the Dhamma on its own terms  are the ones who have kept the Dhamma aliveOf course people have always been free to engage in Buddhist traditions in whatever way they like but those who have benefited most from that engagement are those who instead of reshaping Buddhism to fit their preferences reshape themselves to fit in with the customs and traditions of the noble onesTo find these customs isnt easy given the bewildering variety of traditions that Buddhists have spawned over the centuriesTo test them each individual is thrown back on his or her own powers of relentless honesty integrity and discernmentThere are no easy guaranteesAnd perhaps this fact in itself is a measure of the Dhammas true worthOnly people of real integrity can truly comprehend itAs Ajaan Lee one of Ajaan Muns students once said If a person isnt true to the Buddhas teachings the Buddhas teachings wont be true to that person  and that person wont be able to know what the Buddhas true teachings areMany of Ajaan Maha Boowas books are also available free of charge in both print and electronic form from Wat Pah Baan Taad his forest monastery in ThailandThe selections listed below are available in the anthology An Unentangled Knowing Teachings of a Thai Buddhist Lay Woman which is available free of charge from Metta Forest Monastery in various eBook formats and in printNote A comprehensive anthology of Upasika Kees talks also entitled Pure and Simple was published in by Wisdom PublicationsThis volume contains the most extensive collection of Kee Nanayons teachings currently available in EnglishIt includes an introductory essay that indicates her place within the history of Theravadin Buddhist practiceIncluded in the book Purity of HeartNote An extensive collection of books and transcribed talks by Ajaan Chah is available from Abhayagiri MonasteryIncluded in the book Still Flowing WaterIncluded in the book Still Flowing WaterIncluded in the book Still Flowing WaterIncluded in the book Still Flowing WaterThis third edition of Bodhinyana is an adaptation of the second edition printed by the World Fellowship of Buddhists as The Practice of Buddhism For this new edition we have retained only Ajahn Chahs teachings thus this is essentially a compilation of the original Bodhinyana and a pamphlet called Fragments of a Teaching and Notes from a Session of Questions and Answers This pamphlet was first printed many years ago and has proved to be a very popular and helpful guide for many meditatorsThus by compiling this new edition we hope our efforts will be of increased benefitAs regards the translations we have tried to be as exact as possible with the content of the Teachings but have omitted much of the repetition inevitably arising in oral instructionPali words absorbed into the Thai language have in the course of time acquired additional meanings eg the Thai arome refers to the Pali Arammana  sense object or mental impression but its common meaning is mood or emotion The Venerable Ajahn uses these words in both ways and we have translated accordinglyFinding the middle way between a dull overliteral approach and a more flowing but less precise rendering hasnt always been easyEach of the various translators has compromised in different waysHopefully we have managed to bring out both the clear simplicity the directness and the humor of these talks on the one hand and at the same time the profundity that underlies and inspires themThe translators would like to apologize for any passages which remain unclear or for clumsiness of styleWe trust that this material will provide nourishing contemplation for the growing number of meditatorsMay all beings be free from SufferingAjahn Chah was born into a large and comfortable family in a rural village in Northeast ThailandHe ordained as a novice in early youth and on reaching the age of twenty took higher ordination as a monkAs a young monk he studied some basic Dhamma Discipline and scripturesLater he practiced meditation under the guidance of several of the local Meditation Masters in the Ascetic Forest TraditionHe wandered for a number of years in the style of an ascetic monk sleeping in forests caves and cremation grounds and spent a short but enlightening period with Ajahn Mun one of the most famous and respected Thai Meditation Masters of this centuryAfter many years of travel and practice he was invited to settle in a thick forest grove near the village of his birthThis grove was uninhabited known as a place of cobras tigers and ghosts thus being as he said the perfect location for a forest monkAround Ajahn Chah a large monastery formed as more and more monks nuns and laypeople came to hear his teachings and stay on to practice with himNow there are disciples teaching more than forty mountain and forest branch temples throughout Thailand and in EnglandOn entering Wat Pah Pong one is likely to encounter monks drawing water from a well and a sign on the path that says You there be quietWere trying to meditate Although there is group meditation twice a day and sometimes a talk by Ajahn Chah the heart of the meditation is the way of lifeMonks do manual work dye and sew their own robes make most of their own requisites and keep the monastery buildings and grounds in immaculate shapeMonks here live extremely simply following the ascetic precepts of eating once a day from the almsbowl and limiting their possessions and robesScattered throughout the forest are individual huts where monks live and meditate in solitude and where they practice walking meditation on cleared paths under the treesDiscipline is extremely strict enabling one to lead a simple and pure life in a harmoniously regulated community where virtue meditation and understanding may be skillfully and continuously cultivatedAjahn Chahs simple yet profound style of teaching has a special appeal to Westerners and many have come to study and practice with him quite a few for many yearsIn Wat Pa Nanachat was established near Wat Pah Pong as a special training monastery for the growing numbers of Westerners interested in undertaking monastic trainingSince then Ajahn Chahs large following of senior Western disciples has begun the work of spreading the Dhamma to the WestAjahn Chah has himself traveled twice to Europe and North America and has established a thriving branch monastery in Sussex EnglandWisdom is a way of living and being and Ajahn Chah has endeavored to preserve the simple lifestyle of the monks order that people may study and practice the Dhamma in the present dayAjahn Chahs wonderfully simple style of teaching can be deceptiveIt is often only after we have heard something many times that suddenly our minds are ripe and somehow the Teaching takes on a much deeper meaningHis skillful means in tailoring his explanations of Dhamma to time and place and to the understanding and sensitivity of his audience is marvelous to seeSometimes on paper though it can make him seem inconsistent or even selfcontradictoryAt such times the reader should remember that these words are a record of a living experienceSimilarly if the Teachings may seem to vary at times from tradition it should be borne in mind that the Venerable Ajahn speaks always from the heart from the depths of his own meditative experienceNamo Tassa Bhagavato Arahato SammaSambuddhassaAll of you have believed in Buddhism for many years now through hearing about the Buddhist Teachings from many sources  especially from various monks and teachersIn some cases Dhamma is taught in very broad and vague terms to the point where it is difficult to know how to put it into practice in daily lifeIn other instances Dhamma is taught in high language or special jargon to the point where most people find it difficult to understand especially if the teaching is done too literally from scriptureLastly there is Dhamma taught in a balanced way neither too vague nor too profound neither too broad nor too esoteric  just right for the listener to understand and practice to personally benefit from the TeachingsToday I would like share with you Teachings of the sort I have often used to instruct my disciples in the past Teachings which I hope may possibly be of personal benefit to those of you here listening todayOne who wishes to reach the BuddhaDhamma must firstly be one who has faith or confidence as a foundationHe must understand the meaning of BuddhaDhamma as followsDhamma the characteristics of purity radiance and peace which arise from morality concentration and wisdomTherefore one who is to reach the BuddhaDhamma is one who cultivates and develops morality concentration and wisdom within himselfNaturally people who wish to reach their home are not those who merely sit and think of travelingThey must actually undertake the process of traveling step by step and in the right direction as well in order to finally reach homeIf they take the wrong path they may eventually run into difficulties such as swamps or other obstacles which are hard to get aroundOr they may run into dangerous situations in this wrong direction thereby possibly never reaching homeThose who reach home can relax and sleep comfortably  home is a place of comfort for body and mindNow they have really reached homeBut if the traveler only passed by the front of his home or only walked around it he would not receive any benefit from having traveled all the way homeIn the same way walking the path to reach the BuddhaDhamma is something each one of us must do individually ourselves for no one can do it for usAnd we must travel along the proper path of morality concentration and wisdom until we find the blessings of purity radiance and peacefulness of mind that are the fruits of traveling the pathHowever if one only has knowledge of books and scriptures sermons and sutras that is only knowledge of the map or plans for the journey even in hundreds of lives one will never know purity radiance and peacefulness of mindInstead one will just waste time and never get to the real benefits of practiceTeachers are those who only point out the direction of the PathAfter listening to the teachers whether or not we walk the Path by practicing ourselves and thereby reap the fruits of practice is strictly up to each one of usAnother way to look at it is to compare practice to a bottle of medicine a doctor leaves for his patientOn the bottle is written detailed instructions on how to take the medicine but no matter how many hundred times the patient reads the directions he is bound to die if that is all he doesHe will gain no benefit from the medicineAnd before he dies he may complain bitterly that the doctor wasnt any good that the medicine didnt cure himHe will think that the doctor was a fake or that the medicine was worthless yet he has only spent his time examining the bottle and reading the instructionsHe hasnt followed the advice of the doctor and taken the medicineHowever if the patient actually follows the doctors advice and takes the medicine regularly as prescribed he will recoverAnd if he is very ill it will be necessary to take a lot of medicine whereas if he is only mildly ill only a little medicine will be needed to finally cure himThe fact that we must use a lot of medicine is a result of the severity of our illnessIts only natural and you can see it for yourself with careful considerationDoctors prescribe medicine to eliminate disease from the bodyThe Teachings of the Buddha are prescribed to cure disease of the mind to bring it back to its natural healthy stateSo the Buddha can be considered to be a doctor who prescribes cures for the ills of the mindHe is in fact the greatest doctor in the worldMental ills are found in each one of us without exceptionWhen you see these mental ills does it not make sense to look to the Dhamma as support as medicine to cure your illsTraveling the path of the BuddhaDhamma is not done with the bodyYou must travel with the mind to reach the benefitsWe can divide these travelers into three groupsFirst Level this is comprised of those who understand that they must practice themselves and know how to do soThey take the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha as their refuge and have resolved to practice diligently according to the TeachingsThese persons have discarded merely following customs and traditions and instead use reason to examine for themselves the nature of the worldThese are the group of Buddhist believersMiddle Level This group is comprised of those who have practiced until they have an unshakable faith in the Teachings of the Buddha the Dhamma and the SanghaThey also have penetrated to the understanding of the true nature of all compounded formationsThese persons gradually reduce clinging and attachmentThey do not hold onto things and their minds reach deep understanding of the DhammaDepending upon the degree of nonattachment and wisdom they are progressively known as streamenterers oncereturners and nonreturners or simply Noble OnesHighest Level This is the group of those whose practice has led them to the body speech and mind of the BuddhaThey are above the world free of the world and free of all attachment and clingingThey are known as Arahats or Free Ones the highest level of the Noble OnesMorality is restraint and discipline of body and speechOn the formal level this is divided into classes of precepts for lay people and for monks and nunsHowever to speak in general terms there is one basic characteristic  that is INTENTIONWhen we are mindful or selfrecollected we have right intentionPracticing selfrecollection and mindfulness will generate good moralityIt is only natural that when we put on dirty clothes and our bodies are dirty that out minds too will feel uncomfortable and depressedHowever if we keep our bodies clean and wear clean neat clothes it makes our minds light and cheerfulSo too when morality is not kept our bodily actions and speech are dirty and this is a cause for making the mind unhappy distressed and heavyWe are separated from right practice and this prevents us from penetrating in the essence of the Dhamma in our mindsThe wholesome bodily actions and speech themselves depend on mind properly trained since mind orders body and speechTherefore we must continue practice by training our mindsThe training in concentration is practiced to make the mind firm and steadyThis brings about peacefulness of mindUsually our untrained minds are moving and restless hard to control and manageMind follows sense distractions wildly just like water flowing this way and that seeking the lowest levelAgriculturists and engineers though know how to control water so that it is of greater use to mankindMen are clever they know how to dam water make large reservoirs and canals  all of this merely to channel water and make it more useableIn addition the water stored becomes a source of electrical power and light further benefits from controlling its flow so that it doesnt run wild and eventually settle into a few low spots its usefulness wastedSo too the mind which is dammed and controlled trained constantly will be of immeasurable benefitThe Buddha Himself taught The mind that has been controlled brings true happiness so train you minds well for the highest of benefits Similarly the animals we see around us  elephants horses cattle buffalo etc must be trained before they can be useful for workOnly after they have been trained is their strength of benefit to usIn the same way the mind that has been trained will bring many times the blessings of that of an untrained mindThe Buddha and His Noble Disciples all started out in the same way as us  with untrained minds but afterwards look how they became the subjects of reverence for us all and see how much benefit we can gain through their teachingIndeed see what benefit has come to the entire world from these men who have gone through the training of the mind to reach the freedom beyondThe mind controlled and trained is better equipped to help us in all professions in all situationsThe disciplined mind will keep our lives balanced make work easier and develop and nurture reason to govern our actionsIn the end our happiness will increase accordingly as we follow the proper mind trainingThe training of the mind can be done in many way with many different methodsThe method which is most useful and which can be practiced by all types of people is known as mindfulness of breathing It is the developing of mindfulness on the inbreath and the outbreathIn this monastery we concentrate our attention on the tip of the nose and develop awareness of the in and outbreaths with the mantra word BUDDHO If the meditator wishes to use another word or simply be mindful of the air moving in and out this is also fineAdjust the practice to suit yourselfThe essential factor in the meditation is that the noting or awareness of the breath be kept up in the present moment so that one is mindful of each inbreath and each outbreath just as it occursWhile doing walking meditation we try to be constantly mindful of the sensation of the feet touching the groundThis practice of meditation must be pursued as continuously as possible in order for it to bear fruitDont meditate for a short time one day and then in one or two weeks or even a month meditate againThis will not bring resultsThe Buddha taught us to practice often to practice diligently that is to be as continuous as we can in the practice of mental trainingTo practice meditation we should also find a suitably quiet place free from distractionsIn gardens or under shady trees in our back yards or in places where we can be alone are suitable environmentsIf we are a monk or nun we should find a suitable hut a quiet forest or caveThe mountains offer exceptionally suitable places for practiceIn any case wherever we are we must make an effort to be continuously mindful of breathing in and breathing outIf the attention wanders to other things try to pull it back to the object of concentrationTry to put away all other thoughts and caresDont think about anything  just watch the breathIf we are mindful of thoughts as soon as they arise and keep diligently returning to the meditation subject the mind will become quieter and quieterWhen the mind is peaceful and concentrated release it from the breath as the object of concentrationNow begin to examine the body and mind comprised of the five khandas material form feelings perceptions mental formations and consciousnessExamine these five khandas as they come and goYou will see clearly that they are impermanent that this impermanence makes them unsatisfactory and undesirable and that they come and go of their own  there is no self running thingsThere is to be found only nature moving according to cause and effectAll things in the world fall under the characteristics of instability unsatisfactoriness and being without a permanent ego or soulSeeing the whole of existence in this light attachment and clinging to the khandas will gradually be reducedThis is because we see the true characteristics of the worldWe call this the arising of wisdomWisdom is to see the truth of the various manifestations of body and mindWhen we use our trained and concentrated minds to examine the five khandas we will see clearly that both body and mind are impermanent unsatisfactory and soullessIn seeing all compounded things with wisdom we do not cling or graspWhatever we receive we receive mindfullyWe are not excessively happyWhen things of ours break up or disappear we are not unhappy and do not suffer painful feelings  for we see clearly the impermanent nature of all thingsWhen we encounter illness and pain of any sort we have equanimity because our minds have been well trainedThe true refuge is the trained mindAll of this is known as wisdom which knows the true characteristics of things as they ariseWisdom arises from mindfulness and concentrationConcentration arises from a base of morality or virtueAll of these things morality concentration and wisdom are so interrelated that it is not really possible to separate themIn practice it can be looked at in this way first there is the disciplining of the mind to be attentive to breathingThis is the arising of moralityWhen mindfulness of breathing is practiced continuously until the mind is quiet this is the arising of concentrationThen examination showing the breath as impermanent unsatisfactory and notself and the subsequent nonattachment is the arising of wisdomThus the practice of mindfulness of breathing can be said to be a course for the development of morality concentration and wisdomThey all come togetherWhen morality concentration and wisdom are all developed we call this practicing the Eightfold Path which the Buddha taught as our only way out of sufferingThe Eightfold Path is above all others because if properly practiced it leads directly to Nibbana to peaceWe can say that this practice reaches the BuddhaDhamma truly and preciselyWhen we have practiced meditation as explained above the fruits of practice will arise in the following three stagesFirst for those practitioners who are at the level of Buddhist be faith there will arise increasing faith in the Buddha Dhamma and SanghaThis faith will become the real inner support of each personAlso they will understand the causeandeffect nature of all things that wholesome action brings wholesome result and that unwholesome action brings unwholesome resultSo for such a person there will be a great increase in happiness and mental peaceSecond those who have reached the noble attainments of streamwinner oncereturner or nonreturner have unshakable faith in the Buddha Dhamma and SanghaThey are joyful and are pulled towards NibbanaThird for those Arahats or Perfected Ones there will be the happiness free from all sufferingThese are the Buddhas free from the world complete in the Faring of the Holy WayWe all have had the good fortune to be born as human beings and to hear the Teachings of the BuddhaThis is an opportunity that millions of other beings do not haveTherefore do not be careless or heedlessHurry and develop merits do good and follow the path of practice in the beginning in the middle and in the highest levelsDont let time roll by unused and without purposeTry to reach the truth of the Buddhas Teachings even todayLet me close with a Lao folksaying Many rounds of merriment and pleasure past soon it will be eveningDrunk with tears now rest and see soon it will be too late to finish the journeyI am happy that you have taken this opportunity to come and visit Wat Pah Pong and to see your son who is a monk here however Im sorry I have no gift to offer youFrance already has so many material things but of Dhamma theres very littleHaving been there and seen for myself there isnt really any Dhamma there which could lead to peace and tranquillityThere are only things which continually make ones mind confused and troubledFrance is already materially prosperous it has so many things to offer which are sensually enticing  sights sounds smells tastes and texturesHowever people ignorant of Dhamma only become confused by themSo today I will offer you some Dhamma to take back to France as a gift from Wat Pah Pong and Wat Pah NanachatWhat is DhammaDhamma is that which can cut through the problems and difficulties of mankind gradually reducing them to nothingThats what is called Dhamma and thats what should be studied throughout our daily lives so that when some mental impression arises in us well be able to deal with it and go beyond itProblems are common to us all whether living here in Thailand or in other countriesIf we dont know how to solve them well always be subject to suffering and distressThat which solves problems is wisdom and to have wisdom we must develop and train the mindThe subject of practice isnt far away at all its right here in our body and mindWesterners and Thais are the same they both have a body and mindA confused body and mind means a confused person and a peaceful body and mind a peaceful personActually the mind like rain water is pure in its natural stateIf we were to drop green coloring into clear rain water however it would turn greenIf yellow coloring it would turn yellowThe mind reacts similarlyWhen a comfortable mental impression drops into the mind the mind is comfortableWhen the mental impression is uncomfortable the mind is uncomfortableThe mind becomes cloudy just like the colored waterWhen clear water contacts yellow it turns yellowWhen it contacts green it turns greenIt will change color every timeActually that water which is green or yellow is naturally clean and clearThis is also the natural state of the mind clean and pure and unconfusedIt becomes confused only because it pursues mental impressions it gets lost in its moodsLet me explain more clearlyRight now we are sitting in a peaceful forestHere if theres no wind a leaf remains stillWhen a wind blows it flaps and fluttersThe mind is similar to that leafWhen it contacts a mental impression it too flaps and flutters according to the nature of that mental impressionAnd the less we know of Dhamma the more the mind will continually pursue mental impressionsFeeling happy it succumbs to happinessFeeling suffering it succumbs to sufferingIts constant confusionIn the end people become neuroticWhyBecause they dont knowThey just follow their moods and dont know how to look after their own mindsWhen the mind has no one to look after it its like a child without a mother or father to take care of himAn orphan has no refuge and without a refuge hes very insecureLikewise if the mind is not looked after if there is no training or maturation of character with right understanding its really troublesomeThe method of training the mind which I will give you today is KammatthanaKamma means action and thana means base In Buddhism it is the method of making the mind peaceful and tranquilIts for you to use in training the mind and with the trained mind investigate the bodyOur being is composed of two parts one is the body the other the mindThere are only these two partsWhat is called the body is that which can be seen with our physical eyesThe mind on the other hand has no physical aspectThe mind can only be seen with the internal eye or the eye of the mind These two things body and mind are in a constant state of turmoilWhat is the mindThe mind isnt really any thing Conventionally speaking its that which feels or sensesThat which senses receives and experiences all mental impressions is called mind Right at this moment there is mindAs I am speaking to you the mind acknowledges what I am sayingSounds enter through the ear and you know what is being saidThat which experiences this is called mindThis mind doesnt have any self or substanceIt doesnt have any formIt just experiences mental activities thats allIf we teach this mind to have right view this mind wont have any problemsIt will be at easeThe mind is mindMental objects are mental objectsMental objects are not the mind the mind is not mental objectsIn order to clearly understand our minds and the mental objects in our minds we say that the mind is that which receives the mental objects which pop into itWhen these two things mind and its object come into contact with each other they give rise to feelingsSome are good some bad some cold some hot all kindsWithout wisdom to deal with these feelings however the mind will be troubledMeditation is the way of developing the mind so that it may be a base for the arising of wisdomHere the breath is a physical foundationWe call it Anapanasati or mindfulness of breathing Here we make breathing our mental objectWe take this object of meditation because its the simplest and because it has been the heart of meditation since ancient timesWhen a good occasion arises to do sitting meditation sit crosslegged right leg on top of the left leg right hand on top of the left handKeep your back straight and erectSay to yourself Now I will let go of all my burdens and concerns You dont want anything that will cause you worryLet go of all concerns for the time beingNow fix your attention on the breathThen breathe in and breathe outIn developing awareness of breathing dont intentionally make the breath long or shortNeither make it strong or weakJust let it flow normally and naturallyMindfulness and selfawareness arising from the mind will know the inbreath and the outbreathBe at easeDont think about anythingNo need to think of this or thatThe only thing you have to do is fix your attention on the breathing in and breathing outYou have nothing else to do but thatKeep your mindfulness fixed on the inand outbreaths as they occurBe aware of the beginning middle and end of each breathOn inhalation the beginning of the breath is at the nose tip the middle at the heart and the end in the abdomenOn exhalation its just the reverse the beginning of the breath is in the abdomen the middle at the heart and the end at the nose tipDevelop the awareness of the breath at the nose tip at the heart in the abdomenThen in reverse in the abdomen at the heart and at the nose tipFocusing the attention on these three points will relieve all worriesJust dont think of anything elseKeep your attention on the breathPerhaps other thoughts will enter the mindIt will take up other themes and distract youDont be concernedJust take up the breathing again as your object of attentionThe mind may get caught up in judging and investigating your moods but continue to practice being constantly aware of the beginning middle and the end of each breathEventually the mind will be aware of the breath at these three points all the timeWhen you do this practice for some time the mind and body will get accustomed to the workFatigue will disappearThe body will feel lighter and the breath will become more and more refinedMindfulness and selfawareness will protect the mind and watch over itWe practice like this until the mind is peaceful and calm until it is oneOne means that the mind will be completely absorbed in the breathing that it doesnt separate from the breathThe mind will be unconfused and at easeIt will know the beginning middle and end of the breath and remain steadily fixed on itThen when the mind is peaceful we fix our attention on the inbreath and outbreath at the nose tip onlyWe dont have to follow it up and down to the abdomen and backJust concentrate on the tip of the nose where the breath comes in and goes outThis is called calming the mind making it relaxed and peacefulWhen tranquillity arises the mind stops it stops with its single object the breathThis is whats known as making the mind peaceful so that wisdom may ariseThis is the beginning the foundation of our practiceYou should try to practice this every single day wherever you may beWhether at home in a car lying or sitting down you should be mindfully aware and watch over the mind constantlyThis is called mental training which should be practiced in all the four posturesNot just sitting but standing walking and lying as wellThe point is that we should know what the state of the mind is at each moment and to be able to do this we must be constantly mindful and awareIs the mind happy or sufferingIs it confusedIs it peacefulGetting to know the mind in this manner allows it to become tranquil and when it does become tranquil wisdom will ariseWith the tranquil mind investigate the meditation subject which is the body from the top of the head to the soles of the feet then back to the headDo this over and over againLook at and see the hair of the head hair of the body the nails teeth and skinIn this meditation we will see that this whole body is composed of four elements earth water fire and windThe hard and solid parts of our body make up the earth element the liquid and flowing parts the water elementWinds that pass up and down our body make up the wind element and the heat in our body the fire elementTaken together they compose what we call a human being However when the body is broken down into its component parts only these four elements remainThe Buddha taught that there is no being per se no human no Thai no Westerner no person but that ultimately there are only these four elements  thats allWe assume that there is a person or a being but in reality there isnt anything of the sortWhether taken separately as earth water fire and wind or taken together labelling what they form a human being theyre all impermanent subject to suffering and notselfThey are all unstable uncertain and in a state of constant change  not stable for a single momentOur body is unstable altering and changing constantlyHair changes nails change teeth change skin changes  everything changes completelyOur mind too is always changingIt isnt a self or substanceIt isnt really us not really them although it may think soMaybe it will think about killing itselfMaybe it will think of happiness or of suffering  all sorts of thingsIts unstableIf we dont have wisdom and we believe this mind of ours itll lie to us continuallyAnd we alternately suffer and be happyThis mind is an uncertain thingThis body is uncertainTogether they are impermanentTogether they are a source of sufferingTogether they are devoid of selfThese the Buddha pointed out are neither a being nor a person nor a self nor a soul nor us nor theyThey are merely elements earth water fire and windElements onlyWhen the mind sees this it will rid itself of attachment which holds that I am beautiful I am good I am evil I am suffering I have I this or I thatYou will experience a state of unity for youll have seen that all of mankind is basically the sameThere is no I There are only elementsWhen you contemplate and see impermanence suffering and notself there will no longer be clinging to a self a being I or he or sheThe mind which sees this will give rise to Nibbida worldweariness and dispassionIt will see all things as only impermanent suffering and notselfThe mind then stopsThe mind is DhammaGreed hatred and delusion will then diminish and recede little by little until finally there is only mind  just the pure mindThis is called practicing meditationThus I ask you to receive this gift of Dhamma which I offer you to study and contemplate in your daily livesPlease accept this Dhamma Teaching from Wat Pah Pong and Wat Pah Nanachat as an inheritance handed down to youAll of the monks here including your son and all the Teachers make you an offering of this Dhamma to take back to France with youIt will show you the way to peace of mind it will render your mind calm and unconfusedYour body may be in turmoil but your mind will notThose in the world may be confused but you will notEven though there is confusion in your country you will not be confused because the mind will have seen the mind is DhammaThis is the right path the proper wayMay you remember this Teaching in the futureMay you be well and happySometimes when a fruit tree is in bloom a breeze stirs and scatters blossoms to the groundSome buds remain and grow into a small green fruitA wind blows and some of them too fallStill others may become fruit or nearly ripe or some even fully ripe before they fallAnd so it is with peopleLike flowers and fruit in the wind they too fall in different stages of lifeSome people die while still in the womb others within only a few days after birthSome people live for a few years then die never having reached maturityMen and women die in their youthStill others reach a ripe old age before they dieWhen reflecting upon people consider the nature of fruit in the wind both are very uncertainThis uncertain nature of things can also be seen in the monastic lifeSome people come to the monastery intending to ordain but change their minds and leave some with heads already shavedOthers are already novices then they decide to leaveSome ordain for only one Rains Retreat then disrobeJust like fruit in the wind  all very uncertainOur minds are also similarA mental impression arises draws and pulls at the mind then the mind falls  just like fruitThe Buddha understood this uncertain nature of thingsHe observed the phenomenon of fruit in the wind and reflected upon the monks and novices who were his disciplesHe found that they too were essentially of the same nature  uncertainHow could it be otherwiseThis is just the way of all thingsThus for one who is practicing with awareness it isnt necessary to have someone to advise and teach all that much to be able to see and understandAn example is the case of the Buddha who in a previous life was King ChanokomunHe didnt need to study very muchAll he had to do was observe a mango treeOne day while visiting a park with his retinue of ministers from atop his elephant he spied some mango trees heavily laden with ripe fruitNot being able to stop at that time he determined in his mind to return later to partake of someLittle did he know however that his ministers coming along behind would greedily gather them all up that they would use poles to knock them down beating and breaking the branches and tearing and scattering the leavesReturning in the evening to the mango grove the king already imagining in his mind the delicious taste of the mangoes suddenly discovered that they were all gone completely finishedAnd not only that but the branches and leaves had been thoroughly thrashed and scatteredThe king quite disappointed and upset then noticed another mango tree nearby with its leaves and branches still intactHe wondered whyHe then realized it was because that tree had no fruitIf a tree has no fruit nobody disturbs it and so its leaves and branches are not damagedThis lesson kept him absorbed in thought all the way back to the palace It is unpleasant troublesome and difficult to be a kingIt requires constant concern for all his subjectsWhat if there are attempts to attack plunder and seize parts of his kingdom He could not rest peacefully even in his sleep he was disturbed by dreamsHe saw in his mind once again the mango tree without fruit and its undamaged leaves and branchesIf we become similar to that mango tree he thought our leaves and branches too would not be damagedIn his chamber he sat and meditatedFinally he decided to ordain as a monk having been inspired by this lesson of the mango treeHe compared himself to that mango tree and concluded that if one didnt become involved in the ways of the world one would be truly independent free from worries or difficultiesThe mind would be untroubledReflecting thus he ordainedFrom then on wherever he went when asked who his teacher was he would answer A mango tree He didnt need to receive teaching all that muchA mango tree was the cause of his Awakening to the OpanayikoDhamma the teaching leading inwardsAnd with this Awakening he became a monk one who has few concerns is content with little and who delights in solitudeHis royal status given up his mind was finally at peaceIn this story the Buddha was a Bodhisatta who developed his practice in this way continuouslyLike the Buddha as King Chanokomun we too should look around us and be observant because everything in the world is ready to teach usWith even a little intuitive wisdom we will then be able to see clearly through the ways of the worldWe will come to understand that everything in the world is a teacherTrees and vines for example can all reveal the true nature of realityWith wisdom there is no need to question anyone no need to studyWe can learn from Nature enough to be enlightened as in the story of King Chanokomun because everything follows the way of TruthIt does not diverge from TruthAssociated with wisdom are selfcomposure and restraint which in turn can lead to further insight into the ways of NatureIn this way we will come to know the ultimate truth of everything being AniccaDukkhaAnatta Take trees for example all trees upon the earth are equal are One when seen through the reality of AniccaDukkhaAnatta First they come into being then grow and mature constantly changing until they die finally die as every tree mustIn the same way people and animals are born grow and change during their lifetimes until they eventually dieThe multitudinous changes which occur during this transition from birth to death show the Way of DhammaThat is to say all things are impermanent having decay and dissolution as their natural conditionIf we have awareness and understanding if we study with wisdom and mindfulness we will see Dhamma as realityThus we sill see people as constantly being born changing and finally passing awayEveryone is subject to the cycle of birth and death and because of this everyone in the universe is as One beingThus seeing one person clearly and distinctly is the same as seeing every person in the worldIn the same way everything is DhammaNot only the things we see with our physical eye but also the things we see in our mindsA thought arises then changes and passes awayIt is Nama Dhamma simply a mental impression that arises and passes awayThis is the real nature of the mindAltogether this is the Noble Truth of DhammaIf one doesnt look and observe in this way one doesnt really seeIf one does see one will have the wisdom to listen to the Dhamma as proclaimed by the BuddhaThe Buddha the Dhamma and the Sangha exist in our minds but we have to see it clearlySome people just pick this up casually saying OhThe Buddha the Dhamma and the Sangha exist in my mind Yet their own practice is not suitable or appropriateIt is thus not befitting that the Buddha the Dhamma and the Sangha should be found in their minds namely because the mind must first be that mind which knows the DhammaBringing everything back to this point of Dhamma we will come to know that in the world Truth does exist and thus it is possible for us to practice to realize itFor instance Nama Dhamma feelings thoughts imagination etc are all uncertainWhen anger arises it grows and changes and finally disappearsHappiness too arises grows and changes and finally disappearsThey are emptyThey are not any thing This is always the way of all things both mentally and materiallyInternally there are this body and mindExternally there are trees vines and all manner of things which display this universal law of uncertaintyWhether a tree a mountain or an animal its all Dhamma everything is DhammaWhere is this DhammaSpeaking simply that which is not Dhamma doesnt existDhamma is NatureThis is called the SaccaDhamma the True DhammaIf one sees Nature one sees Dhamma if one sees Dhamma one sees NatureSeeing Nature one know the DhammaAnd so what is the use of a lot of study when the ultimate reality of life in its every moment in its every act is just an endless cycle of births and deathsIf we are mindful and clearly aware when in all postures then selfknowledge is ready to be born that is knowing the truth of Dhamma already in existence right here and nowAt present the Buddha the real Buddha is still living for He is the Dhamma itself the SaccaDhamma And SaccaDhamma that which enables one to become Buddha still existsIt hasnt fled anywhereIt gives rise to two Buddhas one in body and the other in mindThe real Dhamma the Buddha told Ananda can only be realized through practice Whoever sees the Buddha sees the DhammaAnd how is thisPreviously no Buddha existed it was only when Siddhartha Gotama realized the Dhamma that he became the BuddhaIf we explain it in this way then He is the same as usIf we realize the Dhamma then we will likewise be the BuddhaThis is called the Buddha in mind or NamaDhammaWe must be mindful of everything we do for we become the inheritors of our own good or evil actionsIn doing good we reap goodIn doing evil we reap evilAll you have to do is look into your everyday lives to know that this is soSiddhartha Gotama was enlightened to the realization of this Truth and this gave rise to the appearance of a Buddha in the worldLikewise if each and every person practices to attain to this Truth then they too will change to be BuddhaThus the Buddha still existsSome people are very happy saying If the Buddha still exists then I can practice Dhamma That is how you should see itThe Dhamma that the Buddha realized is the Dhamma which exists permanently in the worldIt can be compared to ground water which permanently exists in the groundWhen a person wishes to dig a well he must dig down deep enough to reach the ground waterThe ground water is already thereHe does not create the water he just discovers itSimilarly the Buddha did not invent the Dhamma did not decree the DhammaHe merely revealed what was already thereThrough contemplation the Buddha saw the DhammaTherefore it is said that the Buddha was Enlightened for Enlightenment is knowing the DhammaThe Dhamma is the Truth of this worldSeeing this Siddhartha Gotama is called The Buddha And the Dhamma is that which allows other people to become a Buddha Onewhoknows one who knows DhammaIf beings have good conduct and are loyal to the BuddhaDhamma then those beings will never be short of virtue and goodnessWith understanding we will see that we are really not far from the Buddha but sitting face to face with HimWhen we understand the Dhamma then at that moment we will see the BuddhaIf one really practices one will hear the BuddhaDhamma whether sitting at the root of a tree lying down or in whatever postureThis is not something to merely think aboutIt arises from the pure mindJust remembering these words is not enough because this depends upon seeing the Dhamma itself nothing other than thisThus we must be determined to practice to be able to see this and then our practice will really be completeWherever we sit stand walk or lie we will hear the Buddhas DhammaIn order to practice His Teaching the Buddha taught us to live in a quiet place so that we can learn to collect and restrain the senses of the eye ear nose tongue body and mindThis is the foundation for our practice since these are the places where all things arise and only in these placesThus we collect and restrain these six senses in order to know the conditions that arise thereAll good and evil arise through these six sensesThey are the predominant faculties in the bodyThe eye is predominant in seeing the ear in hearing the nose in smelling the tongue in tasting the body in contacting hot cold hard and soft and the mind in the arising of mental impressionsAll that remains for us to do is to build our practice around these pointsThe practice is easy because all that is necessary has already been set down by the BuddhaThis is comparable to the Buddha planting an orchard and inviting us to partake of its fruitWe ourselves do not need to plant oneWhether concerning morality meditation or wisdom there is no need to create decree or speculate because all that we need to do is follow the things which already exist in the Buddhas TeachingTherefore we are beings who have much merit and good fortune in having heard the Teachings of the BuddhaThe orchard already exists the fruit is already ripeEverything is already complete and perfectAll that is lacking is someone to partake of the fruit someone with faith enough to practiceWe should consider that our merit and good fortune are very valuableAll we need to do is look around to see how much other creatures are possessed of illfortune take dogs pigs snakes and other creatures for instanceThey have no chance to study Dhamma no chance to know Dhamma no chance to practice DhammaThese are beings possessed of illfortune who are receiving karmic retributionWhen one has no chance to study to know to practice Dhamma then one has no chance to be free from SufferingAs human beings we should not allow ourselves to become victims of illfortune deprived of proper manners and disciplineDo not become a victim of illfortuneThat is to say one without hope of attaining the Path of Freedom to Nibbana without hope of developing virtueDo not think that we are already without hopeBy thinking in that way we would then become possessed of illfortune the same as other creaturesWe are beings who have come within the sphere of influence of the BuddhaThus we human beings are already of sufficient merit and resourcesIf we correct and develop our understanding opinions and knowledge in the present then it will lead us to behave and practice in such a way as to see and know Dhamma in this present life as human beingsWe are thus different from other creatures beings that should be enlightened to the DhammaThe Buddha taught that at this present moment the Dhamma exists here in front of usThe Buddha sits facing us right here and nowAt what other time or place are you going to lookIf we dont think rightly if we dont practice rightly we will fall back to being animals or creatures in Hell or hungry ghosts or demonsHow is thisJust look in your mindWhen anger arises what is itThere it is just lookWhen delusion arises what is itThats it right thereWhen greed arises what is itLook at it right thereBy not recognizing and clearly understanding these mental states the mind changes from being that of a human beingAll conditions are in the state of becomingBecoming gives rise to birth or existence as determined by the present conditionsThus we become and exist as our minds condition usIn our lives we have two possibilities indulging in the world or going beyond the worldThe Buddha was someone who was able to free Himself from the world and thus realized spiritual LiberationIn the same way there are two types of knowledge  knowledge of the worldly realm and knowledge of the spiritual or true wisdomIf we have not yet practiced and trained ourselves no matter how much knowledge we have it is still worldly and thus cannot liberate usThink and really look closelyThe Buddha said that things of the world spin the world aroundFollowing the world the mind is entangled in the world it defiles itself whether coming or going never remaining contentWorldly people are those who are always looking for something  who can never find enoughWorldly knowledge is really ignorance it isnt knowledge with clear understanding therefore there is never an end to itIt revolves around the worldly goals of accumulating things gaining status seeking praise and pleasure its a mass of delusion which has us stuck fastOnce we get something there is jealousy worry and selfishnessAnd when we feel threatened and cant ward it off physically we use our minds to invent all sorts of devices right up to weapons and even nuclear bombs only to blow each other upWhy all this trouble and difficultyThis is the way of the worldThe Buddha said that if one follows it around there is no reaching an endCome to practice for liberationIt isnt easy to live in accordance with true wisdom but whoever earnestly seeks the Path and Fruit and aspires to Nibbana will be able to persevere and endureEndure being contented and satisfied with little eating little sleeping little speaking little and living in moderationBy doing this we can put an end to worldlinessIf the seed of worldliness has not yet been uprooted then we are continually troubled and confused in a neverending cycleEven when you come to ordain it continues to pull you awayIt creates your views your opinions it colors and embellishes all your thoughts  thats the way it isPeople dont realizeThey say that they will get things done in the worldIts always their hope to complete everythingJust like a new government minister who is eager to get started with his new administrationHe thinks that he has all the answers so he carts away everything of the old administration saying Look outIll do it all myself Thats all they do cart things in and cart things out never getting anything doneThey try but never reach any real completionYou can never do something which will please everyone  one person likes a little another likes a lot one like short and one likes long some like salty and some like spicyTo get everyone together and in agreement just cannot be doneAll of us want to accomplish something in our lives but the world with all of its complexities makes it almost impossible to bring about any real completionEven the Buddha born with all the opportunities of a noble prince found no completion in the worldly lifeThe Buddha talked about desire and the six things by which desire is gratified sights sounds smells tastes touch and mindobjectsDesire and lust for happiness for suffering for good for evil and so on pervade everythingSights there isnt any sight thats quite the same as that of a womanIsnt that soDoesnt a really attractive woman make you want to lookOne with a really attractive figure comes walking along sak sek sak sek sak sek  you cant help but stareHow about soundsTheres no sound that grips you more than that of a womanIt pierces your heartSmell is the same a womans fragrance is the most alluring of allTheres no other smell thats quite the sameTaste  even the taste of the most delicious food cannot compare with that of a womanTouch is similar when you caress a woman you are stunned intoxicated and sent spinning all aroundThere was once a famous master of magical spells from Taxila in ancient IndiaHe taught his disciple all his knowledge of charms and incantationsWhen the disciple was wellversed and ready to fare on his own he left with this final instruction from his teacher I have taught you all that I know of spells incantations and protective versesCreatures with sharp teeth antlers or horns and even big tusks you have no need to fearYou will be guarded from all of these I can guarantee thatHowever there is only one thing that I cannot ensure protection against and that is the charms of a womanI can not help you hereTheres no spell for protection against this one youll have to look after yourselfMental objects arise in the mindThey are born out of desire desire for valuable possessions desire to be rich and just restless seeking after things in generalThis type of greed isnt all that deep or strong it isnt enough to make you faint or lose controlHowever when sexual desire arises youre thrown off balance and lose your controlYou would even forget those raised and brought you up  your own parentsThe Buddha taught that the objects of our senses are a trap  a trap of MarasMara should be understood as something which harms usThe trap is something which binds us the same as a snareIts a trap of Maras a hunters snare and the hunter is MaraIf animals are caught in the hunters trap its a sorrowful predicamentThey are caught fast and held waiting for the owner of the trapHave you ever snared birdsThe snare springs and boop  caught by the neckA good strong string now holds it fastWherever the bird flies it cannot escapeIt flies here and flies there but its held tight waiting for the owner of the snareWhen the hunter comes along thats it  the bird is struck with fear theres no escapeThe trap of sights sounds smells tastes touch and mindobjects is the sameThey catch us and bind us fastIf you attach to the senses youre the same as a fish caught on a hookWhen the fisherman comes struggle all you want but you cant get looseActually youre not caught like a fish its more like a frog  a frog gulps down the whole hook right to its guts a fish just gets caught in its mouthAnyone attached to the senses is the sameLike a drunk whose liver is not yet destroyed  he doesnt know when he has had enoughHe continues to indulge and drink carelesslyHes caught and later suffers illness and painA man comes walking along a roadHe is very thirsty from his journey and is craving for a drink of waterThe owner of the water says you can drink this water if you like the color is good the smell is good the taste is good but if you drink it you will become illI must tell you this beforehand itll make you sick enough to die or nearly die The thirsty man does not listenHes as thirsty as a person after an operation who has been denied water for seven days  hes crying for waterIts the same with a person thirsting after the sensesThe Buddha taught that they are poisonous  sights sounds smells tastes touch and mindobjects are poison they are a dangerous trapBut this man is thirsty and doesnt listen because of his thirst he is in tears crying Give me water no matter how painful the consequences let me drink So he dips out a bit and swallows it down finding it very tastyHe drinks his fill and gets so sick that he almost diesHe didnt listen because of his overpowering desireThis is how it is for a person caught in the pleasures of the sensesHe drinks in sights sounds smells tastes touch and mindobjects  they are all very deliciousSo he drinks without stopping and there he remains stuck fast until the day he diesSome people die some people almost die  thats how it is to be stuck in the way of the worldWorldly wisdom seeks after the senses and their objectsHowever wise it is its only wise in a worldly senseNo matter how appealing it is its only appealing in a worldly senseHowever much happiness it is its only happiness in a worldly senseIt isnt the happiness of liberation it wont free you from the worldWe have come to practice as monks in order to penetrate true wisdom to rid ourselves of attachmentPractice to be free of attachmentInvestigate the body investigate everything around you until you become weary and fed up with it all and then dispassion will set inDispassion will not arise easily however because you still dont see clearlyWe come and ordain  we study we read we practice we meditateWe determine to make our minds resolute but its hard to doWe resolve to do a certain practice we say that well practice in this way  only a day or two goes by maybe just a few hours pass and we forget all about itThen we remember and try to make our minds firm again thinking This time Ill do it right Shortly after that we are pulled away by one of our senses and it all falls apart again so we have to start all over againThis is how it isLike a poorly built dam our practice is weakWe are still unable to see and follow true practiceAnd it goes on like this until we arrive at true wisdomOnce we penetrate to the Truth we are freed from everythingOnly peace remainsOur minds arent peaceful because of our old habitsWe inherit these because of our past actions and thus they follow us around and constantly plague usWe struggle and search for a way out but were bound by them and they pull us backThese habits dont forget their old groundsThey grab onto all the old familiar things to use to admire and to consume  thats how we liveThe sexes of man and woman  woman cause problems for men men cause problems for womenThats the way it is they are oppositesIf men live together with men then theres no troubleIf women live together with women then theres no troubleWhen a man sees a woman his heart pounds like a rice pounder deung dung deung dung deung dung What is thisWhat are those forcesIt pulls and sucks you in  no one realizes that theres a price to payIts the same in everythingNo matter how hard you try to free yourself until you see the value of freedom and the pain in bondage you wont be able to let goPeople usually just practice enduring hardships keeping the discipline following the form blindly and not in order to attain freedom or liberationYou must see the value in letting go of your desires before you can really practice only then is true practice possibleEverything that you do must be done with clarity and awarenessWhen you see clearly there will no longer be any need for enduring or forcing yourselfYou have difficulties and are burdened because you miss this pointPeace comes from doing things completely with your whole body and mindWhatever is left undone leaves you with a feeling of discontentThese things bind you with worry wherever you goYou want to complete everything but its impossible to get it all doneTake the case of the merchants who regularly come here to see meThey say Oh when my debts are all paid and property in order Ill come to ordain They talk like that but will they ever finish and get it all in orderTheres no end to itThey pay up their debts with another loan they pay off that one and do it all againA merchant thinks that if he frees himself from debt he will be happy but theres no end to paying things offThats the way worldliness fools us  we go around and around like this never realizing our predicamentIn our practice we just look directly at the mindWhenever our practice begins to slacken off we see it and make it firm  then shortly after it goes againThats the way it pulls you aroundBut the person with good mindfulness takes a firm hold and constantly reestablishes himself pulling himself back training practicing and developing himself in this wayThe person with poor mindfulness just lets it all fall apart he strays off and gets sidetracked again and againHes not strong and firmly rooted in practiceThus hes continuously pulled away by his worldly desires  something pulls him here something pulls him thereHe lives following his whims and desires never putting an end to this worldly cycleComing to ordain is not so easyYou must determine to make your mind firmYou should be confident in the practice confident enough to continue practicing until you become fed up with both your like and dislikes and see in accordance with TruthUsually you are dissatisfied with only your dislike if you like something then you arent ready to give it upYou have to become fed up with both your dislike and your likes your suffering and your happinessYou dont see that this is the very essence of the DhammaThe Dhamma of the Buddha is profound and refinedIt isnt easy to comprehendIf true wisdom has not yet arisen then you cant see itYou dont look forward and you dont look backWhen you experience happiness you think that there will only be happinessWhenever there is suffering you think that there will only be sufferingYou dont see that wherever there is big there is small wherever there is small there is bigYou dont see it that wayYou see only one side and thus its neverendingThere are two sides to everything you must see both sidesThen when happiness arises you dont get lost when suffering arises you dont get lostWhen happiness arises you dont forget the suffering because you see that they are interdependentIn a similar way food is beneficial to all beings for the maintenance of the bodyBut actually food can also be harmful for example when it causes various stomach upsetsWhen you see the advantages of something you must perceive the disadvantages also and vice versaWhen you feel hatred and aversion you should contemplate love and understandingIn this way you become more balanced and your mind becomes more settledI once read a book about ZenIn Zen you know they dont teach with a lot of explanationFor instance if a monk is falling asleep during meditation they come with a stick and whack they give him a hit on the backWhen the erring disciple is hit he shows his gratitude by thanking the attendantIn Zen practice one is taught to be thankful for all the feelings which give one the opportunity to developOne day there was an assembly of monks gathered for a meetingOutside the hall a flag was blowing in the windThere arose a dispute between two monks as to how the flag was actually blowing in the windOne of the monks claimed that it was because of the wind while the other argued that it was because of the flagThus they quarreled because of their narrow views and couldnt come to any kind of agreementThey would have argued like this until the day they diedHowever their Teacher intervened and said Neither of you is rightThe correct understanding is that there is no flag and there is no windThis is the practice not to have anything not to have the flag and not to have the windIf there is a flag then there is a wind if there is a wind then there is a flagYou should contemplate and reflect on this thoroughly until you see in accordance with TruthIf considered well then there will remain nothingIts empty  void empty of the flag and empty of the windIn the great Void there is no flag and there is no windThere is no birth no old age no sickness or deathOur conventional understanding of flag and wind is only a conceptIn reality there is nothingThats allThere is nothing more than empty labelsIf we practice in this way we will come to see completeness and all of our problems will come to an endIn the great Void the King of Death will never find youThere is nothing for old age sickness and death to followWhen we see and understand in accordance with Truth that is with Right Understanding then there is only this great emptinessIts here that there is no more we no they no self at allThe world with its neverending ways goes on and onIf we try to understand it all it leads us only to chaos and confusionHowever if we contemplate the world clearly then true wisdom will ariseThe Buddha Himself was one who was wellversed in the ways of the worldHe had great ability to influence and lead because of His abundance of worldly knowledgeThrough the transformation of his worldly mundane wisdom He penetrated and attained to supermundane wisdom making Him a truly superior beingSo if we work with this Teaching turning it inwards for contemplation we will attain to an understanding on an entirely new levelWhen we see an object there is no objectWhen we hear a sound the is no soundIn smelling we can say that there is no smellAll of the senses are manifest but they are void of anything stableThey are just sensations that arise and then pass awayIf we understand according to this reality then the senses cease to be substantialThey are just sensations which come and goIn Truth there isnt any thing If there isnt any thing then there is no we and no they If there is no we as a person then there is nothing belonging to us Its in this way that suffering is extinguishedThere isnt anybody to acquire suffering so who is it who suffersWhen suffering arises we attach to the suffering and thereby must really sufferIn the same way when happiness arises we attach to the happiness and consequently experience pleasureAttachment to these feelings gives rise to the concept of self or ego and thoughts of we and they continually manifestNahHere is where it all begins and then carries us around in its neverending cycleSo we come to practice meditation and live according to the DhammaWe leave our homes to come and live in the forest and absorb the peace of mind it gives usWe have fled in order to contend with ourselves and not through fear or escapismBut people who come and live in the forest become attached to living in it just as people who live in the city become attached to the cityThey lose their way in the forest and they lose their way in the cityThe Buddha praised living in the forest because the physical and mental solitude that it gives us is conducive to the practice for liberationHowever He didnt want us to become dependent upon living in the forest or get stuck in its peace and tranquillityWe come to practice in order for wisdom to ariseHere in the forest we can sow and cultivate the seeds of wisdomLiving amongst chaos and turmoil these seeds have difficulty in growing but once we have learned to live in the forest we can return and contend with the city and all the stimulation of the senses that it brings usLearning to live in the forest means to allow wisdom to grow and developWe can then apply this wisdom no matter where we goWhen our senses are stimulated we become agitated and the senses become our antagonistsThey antagonize us because we are still foolish and dont have the wisdom to deal with themIn reality they are our teachers but because of our ignorance we dont see it that wayWhen we lived in the city we never thought that our senses could teach us anythingAs long as true wisdom has not yet manifested we continue to see the senses and their objects as enemiesOnce true wisdom arises they are no longer our enemies but become the doorway to insight and clear understandingA good example is the wild chickens here in the forestWe all know how much they are afraid of humansHowever since I have lived here in the forest I have been able to teach them and learn from them as wellAt one time I began throwing out rice for them to eatAt first they were very frightened and wouldnt go near the riceHowever after a long time they got used to it and even began to expect itYou see there is something to be learned here  they originally thought that there was danger in the rice that the rice was an enemyIn truth there was no danger in the rice but they didnt know that the rice was food and so were afraidWhen they finally saw for themselves that there was nothing to fear they could come and eat without any dangerThe chickens learn naturally in this wayLiving here in the forest we learn in a similar wayFormerly we thought that our senses were a problem and because of our ignorance in the proper use of them they caused us a lot troubleHowever by experience in practice we learn to see them in accordance with TruthWe learn to make use of them just as the chickens could use the riceThen they are no longer opposed to us and problems disappearAs long as we think investigate and understand wrongly these things will oppose usBut as soon as we begin to investigate properly that which we experience will bring us to wisdom and clear understanding just as the chickens came to their understandingIn this way we can say that they practiced Vipassana They know in accordance with Truth its their insightIn our practice we have our senses as tools which when rightly used enable us to become enlightened to the DhammaThis is something which all meditator should contemplateWhen we dont see this clearly we remain in perpetual conflictSo as we live in the quietude of the forest we continue to develop subtle feelings and prepare the ground for cultivating wisdomDont think that when you have gained some peace of mind living here in the quiet forest that thats enoughDont settle for just thatRemember that we have to cultivate and grow the seeds of wisdomAs wisdom matures and we begin to understand in accordance with the Truth we will no longer be dragged up and downUsually if we have a pleasant mood we behave one way and if we have an unpleasant mood we are another wayWe like something and we are up we dislike something and we are downIn this way we are still in conflict with enemiesWhen these things no longer oppose us they become stabilized and balance outThere are no longer ups and downs or highs and lowsWe understand these things of the world and know that thats just the way it isIts just worldly dhammaWorldly dhamma changes to become the PathWorldly dhamma has eight ways the Path has eight waysWherever worldly dhamma exists the Path is to be found alsoWhen we live with clarity all of our worldly experience becomes the practicing of the Eightfold Path Without clarity worldly dhamma predominates and we are turned away from the Path When Right Understanding arises liberation from suffering lies right here before usYou will not find liberation by running around looking elsewhereSo dont be in a hurry and try to push or rush your practiceDo your meditation gently and gradually step by stepIn regard to peacefulness if you want to become peaceful then accept it if you dont become peaceful then accept that alsoThats the nature of the mindWe must find our own practice and persistently keep at itPerhaps wisdom does not ariseI used to think about my practice that when there is no wisdom I could force myself to have itBut it didnt work things remained the sameThen after careful consideration I saw that to contemplate things that we dont have cannot be doneSo whats the best thing to doIts better just to practice with equanimityIf there is nothing to cause us concern then theres nothing to remedyIf theres no problem then we dont have to try to solve itWhen there is a problem thats when you must solve it right thereTheres no need to go searching for anything special just live normallyBut know what your mind isLive mindfully and clearly comprehendingLet wisdom be your guide dont live indulging in your moodsBe heedful and alertIf there is nothing thats fine when something arises then investigate and contemplate itTry watching a spiderA spider spins its web in any convenient niche and then sits in the center staying still and silentLater a fly comes along and lands on the webAs soon as it touches and shakes the web boop  the spider pounces and winds it up in threadIt stores the insect away and then returns again to collect itself silently in the center of the webWatching a spider like this can give rise to wisdomOur six senses have mind at the center surrounded by eye ear nose tongue and bodyWhen one of the senses is stimulated for instance form contacting the eye it shakes and reaches the mindThe mind is that which knows that which knows formJust this much is enough for wisdom to ariseIts that simpleLike a spider in its web we should live keeping to ourselvesAs soon as the spider feels an insect contact the web it quickly grabs it ties it up and once again returns to the centerThis is not at all different from our own mindsComing to the center means living mindfully with clear comprehension being always alert and doing everything with exactness and precision  this is our centerTheres really not a lot for us to do we just carefully live in this wayBut that doesnt mean that we live heedlessly thinking There is no need to do siting or walking meditation and so forget all about our practiceWe cant be carelessWe must remain alert just as the spider waits to snatch up insects for its foodThis is all that we have to know  sitting and contemplating that spiderJust this much and wisdom can arise spontaneouslyOur mind is comparable to the spider our moods and mental impressions are comparable to the various insectsThats all there is to itThe senses envelop and constantly stimulate the mind when any of them contact something it immediately reaches the mindThe mind then investigates and examines it thoroughly after which it returns to the centerThis is how we abide  alert acting with precision and always mindfully comprehending with wisdomJust this much and our practice is completeThis point is very importantIt isnt that we have to do sitting practice throughout the day and night or that we have to do walking meditation all day and all night longIf this is our view of practice then we really make it difficult for ourselvesWe should do what we can according to our strength and energy using our physical capabilities in the proper amountIts very important to know the mind and the other senses wellKnow how they come and how they go how they arise and how they pass awayUnderstand this thoroughlyIn the language of Dhamma we can also say that just as the spider traps the various insects the mind binds up the senses with AniccaDukkhaAnattaWhere can they goWe keep them for food these things are stored away as our nourishmentThats enough theres no more to do just this muchThis is the nourishment for our minds nourishment for one who is aware and understandingIf you know that these things are impermanent bound up with suffering and that none of it is you then you would be crazy to go after themIf you dont see clearly in this way then you must sufferWhen you take a good look and see these things as really impermanent even though they may seem worth going after really they are notWhy do you want them when their nature is pain and sufferingIts not ours there is no self there is nothing belonging to usSo why are you seeking after themAll problems are ended right hereWhere else will you end themJust take a good look at the spider and turn it inwards turn it back unto yourselfYou will see that its all the sameWhen the mind has seen AniccaDukkha Anatta it lets go and releases itselfIt no longer attaches to suffering or to happinessThis is the nourishment for the mind of one who practices and really trains himselfThats all its that simpleYou dont have to go searching anywhereSo no matter what you are doing you are there no need for a lot of fuss and botherIn this way the momentum and energy of your practice will continuously grow and matureThis momentum of practice leads us towards freedom from the cycle of birth and deathWe havent escaped from that cycle because we still insist on craving and desiringWe dont commit unwholesome or immoral acts but doing this only means that we are living in accordance with the Dhamma of morality for instance the chanting when people ask that all beings not be separated from the things that they love and are fond ofIf you think about it this is very childishIts the way of people who still cant let goThis is the nature of human desire  desire for things to be other than the way that they are wishing for longevity hoping that there is no death or sicknessThis is how people hope and desire then when you tell them that whatever desires they have which are not fulfilled cause suffering it clobbers them right over the headWhat can they sayNothing because its the TruthYoure pointing right at their desiresWhen we talk about desires we know that everyone has them and wants them fulfilled but nobody is willing to stop nobody really wants to escapeTherefore our practice must be patiently refined downThose who practice steadfastly without deviation or slackness and have a gentle and restrained manner always persevering with constancy those are the ones who will knowNo matter what arises they will remain firm and unshakableIn the time of Ajahn Mun and Ajahn Sao life was a lot simpler a lot less complicated than it is todayIn those days monks had few duties and ceremonies to performThey lived in the forests without permanent resting placesThere they could devote themselves entirely to the practice of meditationIn those times one rarely encountered the luxuries that are so commonplace today there simply werent anyOne had to make drinking cups and spittoons out of bamboo and laypeople seldom came to visitOne didnt want or expect much and was content with what one hadOne could live and breathe meditationThe monks suffered many privations living like thisIf someone caught malaria and went to ask for medicine the Teacher would say You dont need medicineKeep practicing Besides there simply werent all the drugs that are available nowAll one had were the herbs and roots that grew in the forestThe environment was such that monks had to have a great deal of patience and endurance they didnt bother over minor ailmentsNowadays you get a bit of an ache and youre off to the hospitalSometimes one had to walk ten to twelve kilometers on almsroundYou would leave as soon as it was light and maybe return around ten or eleven oclockOne didnt get very much either perhaps some glutinous rice salt or a few chilisWhether you got anything to eat with the rice or not didnt matterThats the way it wasNo one dared complain of hunger or fatigue they were just not inclined to complain but learned to take care of themselvesThey practiced in the forest with patience and endurance alongside the many dangers that lurked in the surroundingsThere were many wild and fierce animals living in the jungles and there were many hardships for body and mind in the ascetic practice of the Dhutanga or ForestDwelling monkIndeed the patience and endurance of the monks in those days was excellent because the circumstances compelled them to be soIn the present day circumstances compel us in the opposite directionIn ancient times one had to travel by foot then came the oxcart and then the automobileAspiration and ambition increased so that now if the car is not airconditioned one will not even sit in it impossible to go if there is no airconditioningThe virtues of patience and endurance are becoming weaker and weakerThe standards for meditation and practice are lax and getting laxer until we find that meditators these days like to follow their own opinions and desiresWhen the old folks talk about the old days its like listening to a myth or a legendYou just listen indifferently but you dont understandIt just doesnt reach youAs far as we should be concerned about the ancient monks tradition a monk should spend at least five years with his TeacherSome days you should avoid speaking to anyoneDont allow yourself to speak or talk very muchDont read booksRead your own heart insteadTake Wat Pah Pong for exampleThese days many university graduates are coming to ordainI try to stop them from spending their time reading books about Dhamma because these people are always reading booksThey have so many opportunities for reading books but opportunities for reading their own hearts are rareSo when they come to ordain for three months following the Thai custom we try to get them to close their books and manualsWhile they are ordained they have this splendid opportunity to read their own heartsListening to your own heart is really very interestingThis untrained heart races around following its own untrained habitsIt jumps about excitedly randomly because it has never been trainedTherefore train your heartBuddhist meditation is about the heart to develop the heart or mind to develop your own heartThis is very very importantThis training of the heart is the main emphasisBuddhism is the religion of the heartOnly thisOne who practices to develop the heart is one who practices BuddhismThis heart of ours lives in a cage and whats more theres a raging tiger in that cageIf this maverick heart of ours doesnt get what it wants it makes troubleYou must discipline it with meditation with SamadhiThis is called Training the Heart At the very beginning the foundation of practice is the establishment of moral disciplineSila is the training of the body and speechFrom this arises conflict and confusionWhen you dont let yourself do what you want to do there is conflictEat littleSleep littleSpeak littleWhatever it may be of worldly habit lessen them go against their powerDont just do as you like dont indulge in your thoughtStop this slavish followingYou must constantly go against the stream of ignoranceThis is called Discipline When you discipline your heart it becomes very dissatisfied and begins to struggleIt becomes restricted and oppressedWhen the heart is prevented from doing what it wants to do it starts wandering and strugglingSuffering becomes apparent to usThis Dukkha this suffering is the first of the Four Noble TruthsMost people want to get away from itThey dont want to have any kind of suffering at allActually this suffering is what brings us wisdom it makes us contemplate DukkhaHappiness tends to make us close our eyes and earsIt never allows us to develop patienceComfort and happiness make us carelessOf these two defilements Dukkha is the easiest to seeTherefore we must bring up suffering in order to put an end to our sufferingWe must first know what Dukkha is before we can know how to practice meditationIn the beginning you have to train your heart like thisYou may not understand what is happening or what the point of it is but when the Teacher tells you to do something then you must do itYou will develop the virtues of patience and enduranceWhatever happens you endure because that is the way it isFor example when you begin to practice Samadhi you want peace and tranquillityBut you dont get anyYou dont get any because you have never practiced this wayYour heart says Ill sit until I attain tranquillity But when tranquillity doesnt arise you sufferAnd when there is suffering you get up and run awayTo practice like this can not be called developing the heart Its called desertionInstead of indulging in your moods you train yourself with the Dhamma of the BuddhaLazy or diligent you just keep on practicingDont you think that this is a better wayThe other way the way of following your moods will never reach the DhammaIf you practice the Dhamma then whatever the mood may be you keep on practicing constantly practicingThe other way of selfindulgence is not the way of the BuddhaWhen we follow our own views on practice our own opinions about the Dhamma we can never see clearly what is right and what is wrongWe dont know our own heartWe dont know ourselvesTherefore to practice following your own teachings is the slowest wayTo practice following the Dhamma is the direct wayLazy you practice diligent you practiceYou are aware of time and placeThis is called developing the heartIf you indulge in following your own views and try to practice accordingly then you will start thinking and doubting a lotYou think to yourself I dont have very much meritI dont have any luckIve been practicing meditation for years now and Im still unenlightenedI still havent seen the Dhamma To practice with this kind of attitude can not be called developing the heart It is called developing disasterIf at this time you are like this if you are a meditator who still doesnt know who doesnt see if you havent renewed yourself yet its because youve been practicing wronglyYou havent been following the Teachings of the BuddhaThe Buddha taught like this Ananda practice a lotDevelop your practice constantlyThen all your doubts all your uncertainties will vanish These doubts will never vanish through thinking nor through theorizing nor through speculation nor through discussionNor will doubts disappear by not doing anythingAll defilements will vanish through developing the heart through right practice onlyThe way of developing the heart as taught by the Buddha is the exact opposite of the way of the world because his Teachings come from a pure heartA pure heart unattached to defilements is the Way of the Buddha and His DisciplesIf you practice the Dhamma you must bow your heart to the DhammaYou must not make the Dhamma bow to youWhen you practice this waysuffering arisesThere isnt a single person who can escape this sufferingSo when you commence your practice suffering is right thereThe duties of meditators are mindfulness collectedness and contentmentThese things stop usThey stop the habits of the hearts of those who have never trainedAnd why should we bother to do thisIf you dont bother to train your heart then it remains wild following the ways of natureIts possible to train that nature so that it can be used to advantageThis is comparable to the example of treesIf we just left trees in their natural state then we would never be able to build a house with themWe couldnt make planks or anything of use in building a houseHowever if a carpenter came along wanting to build a house he would go looking for trees such as theseHe would take this raw material and use it to advantageIn a short time he could have a house builtMeditation and developing the heart are similar to thisYou must take this untrained heart the same as you would take a tree in its natural state in the forest and train this natural heart so that it is more refined so that its more aware of itself and is more sensitiveEverything is in its natural stateWhen we understand nature then we can change it we can detach from it we can let go of itThen we wont suffer anymoreThe nature of our heart is such that whenever it clings and grasps there is agitation and confusionFirst it might wander over there then it might wander over hereWhen we come to observe this agitation we might think that its impossible to train the heart and so we suffer accordinglyWe dont understand that this is the way the heart isThere will be thought and feelings moving about like this even though we are practicing trying to attain peaceThats the way it isWhen we have contemplated many times the nature of the heart then we will come to understand that this heart is just as it is and cant be otherwiseWe will know that the hearts ways are just as they areThats its natureIf we see this clearly then we can detach from thoughts and feelingsAnd we dont have to add on anything more by constantly having to tell ourselves that thats just the way it is When the heart truly understands it lets go of everythingThinking and feeling will still be there but that very thinking and feeling will be deprived of powerThis is similar to a child who likes to play and frolic in ways that annoy us to the extent that we scold or spank himWe should understand that its natural for a child to act that wayThen we could let go and leave him to play in his own waySo our troubles are overHow are they overBecause we accept the ways of childrenOur outlook changes and we accept the true nature of thingsWe let go and our heart becomes more peacefulWe have Right UnderstandingIf we have wrong understanding then even living in a deep dark cave would be chaos or living high up in the air would be chaosThe heart can only be at peace when there is Right Understanding Then there are no more riddles to solve and no more problems to ariseThis is the way it isYou detachYou let goWhenever there is any feeling of clinging we detach from it because we know that that very feeling is just as it isIt didnt come along especially to annoy usWe might think that it did but in truth it is just that wayIf we start to think and consider it further that too is just as it isIf we let go then form is merely form sound is merely sound odor is merely odor taste is merely taste touch is merely touch and the heart is merely the heartIts similar to oil and waterIf you put the two together in a bottle they wont mix because of the difference in their natureOil and water are different in the same way that a wise man and an ignorant man are differentThe Buddha lived with form sound odor taste touch and thoughtHe was an arahant so He turned away from rather than toward these thingsHe turned away and detached little by little since He understood that the heart is just the heart and thought is just thoughtHe didnt confuse and mix them togetherThe heart is just the heart thoughts and feelings are just thoughts and feelingsLet things be just as they areLet form be just form let sound be just sound let thought be just thoughtWhy should we bother to attach to themIf we think and feel in this way then there is detachment and separatenessOur thoughts and feelings will be on one side and our heart will be on the otherJust like oil and water  they are in the same bottle but they are separateThe Buddha and His Enlightened Disciples lived with ordinary unenlightened peopleThey not only lived with these people but they taught these ordinary unenlightened ignorant ones how to be Noble Enlightened Wise OnesThey could do this because they knew how to practiceThey knew that its a matter of the heart just as I have explainedSo as far as your practice of meditation goes dont bother to doubt itIf we run away from home to ordain its not running away to get lost in delusionNor out of cowardice or fearIts running away in order to train ourselves in order to master ourselvesIf we have understanding like this then we can follow the DhammaThe Dhamma will become clearer and clearerThe one who understands the Dhamma understands himself and the one who understands himself understands the DhammaNowadays only the sterile remains of the Dhamma have become the accepted orderIn reality the Dhamma is everywhereThere is no need to escape to somewhere elseInstead escape through wisdomEscape through intelligenceEscape through skilldont escape through ignoranceIf you want peace then let it be the peace of wisdomThats enoughWhenever we see the Dhamma then there is the right way the right pathDefilements are just defilements the heart is just the heartWhenever we detach and separate so that there are just these things as they really are then they are merely objects to usWhen we are on the right path then we are impeccableWhen we are impeccable there is openness and freedom all the timeThe Buddha said Listen to me MonksYou must not cling to any dhammas What are these dhammasThey are everything there isnt anything which is not dhammaLove and hate are dhammas happiness and suffering are dhammas like and dislike are dhammas all of these things no matter how insignificant are dhammasWhen we practice the Dhamma when we understand then we can let goAnd thus we can comply with the Buddhas Teaching of not clinging to any dhammasAll conditions that are born in our heart all conditions of our mind all conditions of our body are always in a state of changeThe Buddha taught not to cling to any of themHe taught His Disciples to practice in order to detach from all conditions and not to practice in order to attain to any moreIf we follow the Teachings of the Buddha then we are rightWe are right but it is also troublesomeIts not that the Teachings are troublesome but its our defilements which are troublesomeThe defilements wrongly comprehended obstruct us and cause us troubleThere isnt really anything troublesome with following the Buddhas TeachingIn fact we can say that clinging to the Path of the Buddha doesnt bring suffering because the Path is simply let go of every single dhammaFor the ultimate in the practice of Buddhist Meditation the Buddha taught the practice of letting go dont carry anything aroundDetachIf you see goodness let it goIf you see rightness let it goThese words let go do not mean that we dont have to practiceIt means that we have to practice following the method of letting go itselfThe Buddha taught us to contemplate all dhammas to develop the Path through contemplating our own body and heartThe Dhamma isnt anywhere elseIts right hereNot someplace far awayIts right here in this very body and heart of oursTherefore a meditator must practice with energyMake the heart grander and brighterMake it free and independentHaving done a good deed dont carry it around in your heart let it goHaving refrained from doing an evil deed let it goThe Buddha taught us to live in the immediacy of the present in the here and nowDont lose yourself in the past or the futureThe Teaching that people least understand and which conflicts the most with their own opinions is this Teaching of letting go or working with an empty mind This way of talking is called Dhamma language When we conceive this in worldly terms we become confused and think that we can do anything we wantIt can be interpreted this way but its real meaning is closer to this Its as if we are carrying a heavy rockAfter a while we begin to feel its weight but we dont know how to let it goSo we endure this heavy burden all the timeIf someone tells us to throw it away we say If I throw it away I wont have anything left If told of all the benefits to be gained from throwing it away we wouldnt believe them but would keep thinking If I throw it away I will have nothing So we keep on carrying this heavy rock until we become so weak and exhausted that we can no longer endure then we drop itHaving dropped it we suddenly experience the benefits of letting goWe immediately feel better and lighter and we know for ourselves how much of a burden carrying a rock can beBefore we let go of the rock we couldnt possibly know the benefits of letting goSo if someone tells us to let go an unenlightened man wouldnt see the purpose of itHe would just blindly clutch at the rock and refuse to let go until it became so unbearably heavy that he just had to let goThen he can feel for himself the lightness and relief and thus know for himself the benefits of letting goLater on we may start carrying burdens again but now we know what the results will be so we can now let go more easilyThis understanding that its useless to carry burdens around and that letting go brings ease and lightness is an example of knowing ourselvesOur pride our sense of self that we depend on is the same as that heavy rockLike that rock if we think about letting go of selfconceit we are afraid that without it there would be nothing leftBut when we can finally let it go we realize for ourselves the ease and comfort of not clingingIn the training of the heart you mustnt cling to either praise or blameTo just want praise and not to want blame is the way of the worldThe Way of the Buddha is to accept praise when it is appropriate and to accept blame when it is appropriateFor example in raising a child its very good not to just scold all the timeSome people scold too muchA wise person knows the proper time to scold and the proper time to praiseOur heart is the sameUse intelligence to know the heartUse skill in taking care of your heartThen you will be one who is clever in the training of the heartAnd when the heart is skilled it can rid us of our sufferingSuffering exists right here in our heartsIts always complicating things creating and making the heart heavyIts born hereIt also dies hereThe way of the heart is like thisSometimes there are good thoughts sometimes there are bad thoughtsThe heart is deceitfulDont trust itInstead look straight at the conditions of the heart itselfAccept them as they areTheyre just as they areWhether its good or evil or whatever thats the way it isIf you dont grab hold of these conditions then they dont become anything more or less than what they already areIf we grab hold well get bitten and will then sufferWith Right View theres only peaceSamadhi is born and wisdom takes overWherever you may sit or lie down there is peaceThere is peace everywhere no matter where you may goSo today you have brought your disciples here to listen to the DhammaYou may understand some of it some of it you may notIn order for you to understand more easily Ive talked about the practice of meditationWhether you think it is right or not you should take and contemplate itAs a Teacher myself Ive been in a similar predicamentI too have longed to listen to Dhamma talks because wherever I went I was giving talks to others but never had a chance to listenSo at this time you really appreciate listening to a talk from a TeacherTime passes by so quickly when youre sitting and listening quietlyYoure hungry for Dhamma so you really want to listenAt first giving talks to others is a pleasure but after awhile the pleasure is goneYou feel bored and tiredThen you want to listenSo when you listen to a talk from a Teacher you feel much inspiration and you understand easilyWhen you are getting old and theres hunger for Dhamma its flavor is especially deliciousBeing a Teacher of others you are an example to them youre a model for other bhikkhusYoure an example to your disciplesYoure an example to everybody so dont forget yourselfBut dont think about yourself eitherIf such thoughts do arise get rid of themIf you do this then you will be one who knows himselfThere are a million ways to practice DhammaTheres no end to the things that can be said about meditationThere are so many things that can make us doubtJust keep sweeping them out then theres no more doubtWhen we have right understanding like this no matter where we sit or walk there is peace and easeWherever we may meditate thats the place you bring your awarenessDont hold that one only meditates while sitting or walkingEverything and everywhere is our practiceTheres awareness all the timeThere is mindfulness all the timeWe can see birth and death of mind and body all the time and we dont let it clutter our heartsLet it go constantlyIf love comes let it go back to its homeIf greed comes let it go homeIf anger comes let it go homeFollow themWhere do they liveThen escort them thereDont keep anythingIf you practice like this then you are like an empty houseOr explained another way this is an empty heart a heart empty and free of all evilWe call it an empty heart but it isnt empty as if there was nothing its empty of evil but filled with wisdomThen whatever you do youll do with wisdomYoull think with wisdomYoull eat with wisdomThere will only be wisdomThis is the Teaching for today and I offer it to youIve recorded it on tapeIf listening to Dhamma makes your heart at peace thats good enoughYou dont need to remember anythingSome may not believe thisIf we make our heart peaceful and just listen letting it pass by but contemplating continuously like this then were like a tape recorderAfter some time when we turn on everything is thereHave no fear that there wont be anythingAs soon as you turn on your tape recorder everything is thereI wish to offer this to every bhikkhu and to everyoneSome of you probably know only a little Thai but that doesnt matterMay you learn the language of the DhammaThats good enoughThis short talk is for the benefit of a new disciple who will soon be returning to LondonMay it serve to help you understand the Teaching that you have studied here at Wat Pah PongMost simply this is the practice to be free of suffering in the cycle of birth and deathIn order to do this practice remember to regard all the various activities of mind all those you like and all those you dislike in the same way as you would regard a cobraThe cobra is an extremely poisonous snake poisonous enough to cause death if it should bite usAnd so also it is with our moods the moods that we like are poisonous the moods that we dislike are also poisonousThey prevent our minds from being free and hinder our understanding of the Truth as it was taught by the BuddhaThus is it necessary to try to maintain our mindfulness throughout the day and nightWhatever you may be doing be it standing sitting lying down speaking or whatever you should do with mindfulnessWhen you are able to establish this mindfulness youll find that there will arise clear comprehension associated with it and these two conditions will bring about wisdomThus mindfulness clear comprehension and wisdom will work together and youll be like one who is awake both day and nightThese Teachings left us by the Buddha are not Teachings to be just listened to or simply absorbed on an intellectual levelThey are Teachings that through practice can be made to arise and known in our heartsWherever we go whatever we do we should have these TeachingsAnd what we mean by to have these Teachings or to have the Truth is that whatever we do or say we do and say with wisdomWhen we think and contemplate we do so with wisdomWe say that one who has mindfulness and clear comprehension combined in this way with wisdom is one who is close to the BuddhaWhen you leave here you should practice bringing everything back to your own mindLook at your mind with this mindfulness and clear comprehension and develop this wisdomWith these three conditions there will arise a letting go Youll know the constant arising and passing away of all phenomenaYou should know that that which is arising and passing away is only the activity of mindWhen something arises it passes away and is followed by further arising and passing awayIn the Way of Dhamma we call this arising and passing away birth and death and this is everything  this is all there isWhen suffering has arisen it passes away and when it has passed away suffering arises againTheres just suffering arising and passing awayWhen you see this much youll be able to know constantly this arising and passing away and when your knowing is constant youll see that this is really all there isEverything is just birth and deathIts not as if there is anything which carries onTheres just this arising and passing away as it is  thats allThis kind of seeing will give rise to a tranquil feeling of dispassion towards the worldSuch a feeling arises when we see that actually there is nothing worth wanting there is only arising and passing away a being born followed by a dyingThis is when the mind arrives at letting go letting everything go according to its own natureThings arise and pass away in our mind and we knowWhen happiness arises we know when dissatisfaction arises we knowAnd this knowing happiness means that we dont identify with it as being oursAnd likewise with dissatisfaction and unhappiness we dont identify with them as being oursWhen we no longer identify with and cling to happiness and suffering we are simply left with the natural way of thingsSo we say that mental activity is like the deadly poisonous cobraIf we dont interfere with a cobra it simply goes its own wayEven though it may be extremely poisonous we are not affected by it we dont go near it or take hold of it and it doesnt bite usThe cobra does what is natural for a cobra to doThats the way it isIf you are clever youll leave it aloneAnd so you let be that which is goodYou also let be that which is not good  let it be according to its own natureLet be your liking and your disliking the same way as you dont interfere with the cobraSo one who is intelligent will have this kind of attitude towards the various moods that arise in the mindWhen goodness arises we let it be good but we know alsoWe understand its natureAnd too we let be the notgood we let it be according to its natureWe dont take hold of it because we dont want anythingWe dont want evil neither do we want goodWe want neither heaviness nor lightness happiness nor sufferingWhen in this way our wanting is at an end peace is firmly establishedWhen we have this kind of peace established in our minds we can depend on itThis peace we say has arisen out of confusionConfusion has endedThe Buddha called the attainment of final Enlightenment an extinguishing in the same way that fire is extinguishedWe extinguish fire at the place at which it appearsWherever it is hot thats where we can make it coolAnd so it is with EnlightenmentNibbana is found in SamsaraEnlightenment and delusion exist in the same place just as do hot and coldIts hot where it was cold and cold where it was hotWhen heat arises the coolness disappears and when there is coolness theres no more heatIn this way Nibbana and Samsara are the sameWe are told to put an end to Samsara which means to stop the everturning cycle of confusionThis putting an end to confusion is extinguishing the fireWhen external fire is extinguished there is coolnessWhen the internal fires of sensual craving aversion and delusion are put out then this is coolness alsoThis is the nature of Enlightenment its the extinguishing of fire the cooling of that which was hotThis is peaceThis is the end of Samsara the cycle of birth and deathWhen you arrive at Enlightenment this is how it isIts an ending of the everturning and everchanging an ending of greed aversion and delusion in our mindsWe talk about it in terms of happiness because this is how worldly people understand the ideal to be but in reality it has gone beyondIt is beyond both happiness and sufferingIts perfect peaceSo as you go you should take this Teaching which I have given you and contemplate it carefullyYour stay here hasnt been easy and I have had little opportunity to give you instruction but in this time you have been able to study the real meaning of our practiceMay this practice lead you to happiness may it help you grow in TruthMay you be freed from the suffering of birth and deathOur way of practice is looking closely at things and making them clearWere persistent and constant yet not rushed or hurriedNeither are we too slowIts a matter of gradually feeling our way and bringing it togetherHowever all of this bringing it together is working towards something there is a point to our practiceFor most of us when we first start to practice its nothing other than desireWe start to practice because of wantingAt this stage our wanting is wanting in the wrong wayThat is its deludedIts wanting mixed with wrong understandingIf wanting is not mixed with wrong understanding like this we say that its wanting with wisdomIts not deluded  its wanting with right understandingIn a case like this we say that its due to a persons Parami or past accumulationsHowever this isnt the case with everyoneSome people dont want to have desire or they want not to have desires because they think that our practice is directed at not wantingHowever if there is no desire then theres no way of practiceWe can see this for ourselvesThe Buddha and all His Disciples practiced to put an end to defilementsWe must want to practice and must want to put an end to defilementsWe must want to have peace of mind and want not to have confusionHowever if this wanting is mixed with wrong understanding then it will only amount to more difficulties for usIf we are honest about it we really know nothing at allOr what we do know is of no consequence since we are unable to use it properlyEverybody including the Buddha started out like this with the desire to practice  wanting to have peace of mind and wanting not to have confusion and sufferingThese two kinds of desire have exactly the same valueIf not understood then both wanting to be free from confusion and not wanting to have suffering are defilementsTheyre a foolish way of wanting  desire without wisdomIn our practice we see this desire as either sensual indulgence or selfmortificationIts in this very conflict that our Teacher the Buddha was caught up just this dilemmaHe followed many ways of practice which merely ended up in these two extremesAnd these days we are exactly the sameWe are still afflicted by this duality and because of it we keep falling from the WayHowever this is how we must start outWe start out as worldly beings as beings with defilements with wanting devoid of wisdom desire without right understandingIf we lack proper understanding then both kinds of desire work against usWhether its wanting or not wanting its still cravingIf we dont understand these two things then we wont know how to deal with them when they ariseWe will feel that to go forward is wrong and to go backwards is wrong and yet we cant stopWhatever we do we just find more wantingThis is because of the lack of wisdom and because of cravingIts right here with this wanting and not wanting that we can understand the DhammaThe Dhamma which we are looking for exists right here but we dont see itRather we persist in our efforts to stop wantingWe want things to be a certain way and not any other wayOr we want them not to be a certain way but to be another wayReally these two things are the sameThey are part of the same dualityPerhaps we may not realize that the Buddha and all of His Disciples had this kind of wantingHowever the Buddha understood regarding wanting and not wantingHe understood that they are simply the activity of mind that such things merely appear in a flash and then disappearThese kinds of desires are going on all the timeWhen there is wisdom we dont identify with them  we are free from clingingWhether its wanting or not wanting we simply see it as suchIn reality its merely the activity of the natural mindWhen we take a close look we see clearly that this is how it isSo its here that our practice of contemplation will lead us to understandingLet us take an example the example of a fisherman pulling in his net with a big fish in itHow do you think he feels about pulling it inIf hes afraid that the fish will escape hell be rushed and start to struggle with the net grabbing and tugging at itBefore he knows it the big fish has escaped  he was trying too hardIn the olden days they would talk like thisThey taught that we should do it gradually carefully gathering it in without losing itThis is how it is in our practice we gradually feel our way with it carefully gathering it in without losing itSometimes it happens that we dont feel like doing itMaybe we dont want to look or maybe we dont want to know but we keep on with itWe continue feeling for itThis is practice if we feel like doing it we do it and if we dont feel like doing it we do it just the sameWe just keep doing itIf we are enthusiastic about our practice the power of our faith will give energy to what we are doingBut at this stage we are still without wisdomEven though we are very energetic we will not derive much benefit from our practiceWe may continue with it for a long time and a feeling will arise that arent going to find the WayWe may feel that we cannot find peace and tranquillity or that we arent sufficiently equipped to do the practiceOr maybe we feel that this Way just isnt possible anymoreSo we give upAt this point we must be very very carefulWe must use great patience and enduranceIts just like pulling in the big fish  we gradually feel our way with itWe carefully pull it inThe struggle wont be too difficult so without stopping we continue pulling it inEventually after some time the fish becomes tired and stops fighting and were able to catch it easilyUsually this is how it happens we practice gradually gathering it togetherIts in this manner that we do our contemplationIf we dont have any particular knowledge or learning in the theoretical aspects of the Teachings we contemplate according to our everyday experienceWe use the knowledge which we already have the knowledge derived from our everyday experienceThis kind of knowledge is natural to the mindActually whether we study about it or not we have the reality of the mind right here alreadyThe mind is the mind whether we have learned about it or notThis is why we say that whether the Buddha is born in the world or not everything is the way it isEverything already exists according to its own natureThis natural condition doesnt change nor does it go anywhereIt just is that wayThis is called the Sacca DhammaHowever if we dont understand about this Sacca Dhamma we wont be able to recognize itSo we practice contemplation in this wayIf we arent particularly skilled in scripture we take the mind itself to study and readContinually we contemplate and understanding regarding the nature of the mind will gradually ariseWe dont have to force anythingUntil we are able to stop our mind until we reach tranquillity the mind will just continue as beforeIts for this reason that the Teacher says Just keep on doing it keep on with the practice Maybe we think If I dont yet understand how can I do it Until we are able to practice properly wisdom doesnt ariseSo we say just keep on with itIf we practice without stopping well begin to think about what we are doingWell start to consider our practiceNothing happens immediately so in the beginning we cant see any results from our practiceThis is like the example I have often given you of the man who tries to make fire by rubbing two sticks of wood togetherHe says to himself They say theres fire here and he begins rubbing energeticallyHes very impetuousHe rubs on and on but his impatience doesnt endHe wants to have that fireHe keeps wanting to have that fire but the fire doesnt comeSo he gets discouraged and stops to rest for awhileHe starts again but the going is slow so he rests againBy then the heat has disappeared he didnt keep at it long enoughHe rubs and rubs until he tires and then he stops altogetherNot only is he tired but he becomes more and more discouraged until he gives up completelyTheres no fire here Actually he was doing the work but there wasnt enough heat to start a fireThe fire was there all the time but he didnt carry on to the endThis sort of experience causes the meditator to get discouraged in his practice and so he restlessly changes from one practice to anotherAnd this sort of experience is also similar to our own practiceIts the same for everybodyWhyBecause we are still grounded in defilementsThe Buddha had defilements also but He had a lot of wisdom in this respectWhile still worldlings the Buddha and the arahants were just the same as usIf we are still worldlings then we dont think rightlyThus when wanting arises we dont see it and when not wanting arises we dont see itSometimes we feel stirred up and sometimes we feel contentedWhen we have not wanting we have a kind of contentment but we also have a kind of confusionWhen we have wanting this can be contentment and confusion of another kindIts all intermixed in this wayThe Buddha taught us to contemplate our body for example hair of the head hair of the body nails teeth skin its all bodyTake a lookWe are told to investigate right hereIf we dont see these things clearly as they are in ourselves we wont understand regarding other peopleWe wont see others clearly nor will we see ourselvesHowever if we do understand and see clearly the nature of our own bodies our doubts and wonderings regarding others will disappearThis is because body and mind are the same for everybodyIt isnt necessary to go and examine all the bodies in the world since we know that they are the same as us  we are the same as themIf we have this kind of understanding then our burden becomes lighterWithout this kind of understanding all we do is develop a heavier burdenIn order to know about others we would have to go and examine everybody in the entire worldThat would be very difficultWe would soon become discouragedOur Vinaya is similar to thisWhen we look at our Vinaya we feel that its very difficultWe must keep every rule study every rule review our practice with every ruleIf we just think about it Oh its impossible We read the literal meaning of all the numerous rules and if we merely follow our thinking about them we could well decide that its beyond our ability to keep them allAnyone who has had this kind of attitude towards the Vinaya has the same feeling about it  there are a lot of rulesThe scriptures tell us that we must examine ourselves regarding each and every rule and keep them all strictlyWe must know them all and observe them perfectlyThis is the same as saying that to understand about others we must go and examine absolutely everybodyThis is a very heavy attitudeAnd its like this because we take what is said literallyIf we follow the textbooks this is the way we must goSome Teachers teach in this manner  strict adherence to what the textbooks sayIt just cant work that wayActually if we study theory like this our practice wont develop at allIn fact our faith will disappear our faith in the Way will be destroyedThis is because we havent yet understoodWhen there is wisdom we will understand that all the people in the entire world really amount to just this one personThey are the same as this very beingSo we study and contemplate our own body and mindWith seeing and understanding the nature of our own body and mind comes understanding the bodies and minds of everyoneAnd so in this way the weight of our practice becomes lighterThe Buddha said to teach and instruct ourselves  nobody else can do it for usWhen we study and understand the nature of our own existence we will understand the nature of all existenceEveryone is really the sameWe are all the same make and come from the same company  there are only different shades thats allJust like Borthai and Tumjai They are both painkillers and do the same thing but one type is called Borthai and the other Tumjai Really they arent differentYou will find that this way of seeing things gets easier and easier as you gradually bring it all togetherWe call this feeling our way and this is how we begin to practiceWell become skilled at doing itWe keep on with it until we arrive at understanding and when this understanding arises we will see reality clearlySo we continue this practice until we have a feeling for itAfter a time depending on our own particular tendencies and abilities a new kind of understanding arisesThis we call Investigation of Dhamma and this is how the Seven Factors of Enlightenment arise in the mindInvestigation of Dhamma is one of themThe others are Mindfulness Energy Rapture Tranquillity concentration and EquanimityIf we have studied about the Seven Factors of Enlightenment then well know what the books say but we wont have seen the real Factors of EnlightenmentThe real Factors of Enlightenment arise in the mindThus the Buddha came to give us all the various TeachingsAll the Enlightened Ones have taught the way out of suffering and Their recorded Teachings we call the theoretical TeachingsThis theory originally came from the practice but it has become merely book learning or wordsThe real Factors of Enlightenment have disappeared because we dont know them within ourselves we dont see them within our own mindsIf they arise they arise out of practiceIf they arise out of practice then they are factors leading to Enlightenment of the Dhamma and we can use their arising as an indication that our practice is correctIf we are not practicing rightly such things will not appearIf we practice in the right way then we can see DhammaSo we say to keep on practicing feeling your way gradually and continually investigatingDont think that what you are looking for can be found anywhere other than right hereOne of my senior disciples had been learning Pali at a study Temple before he came hereHe hadnt been very successful with his studies so he thought that since monks who practice meditation are able to see and understand everything just by sitting he would come and try this wayHe came here to Wat Pah Pong with the intention of sitting in meditation so that he would be able to translate Pali scripturesHe had this kind of understanding about practiceSo I explained to him about our wayHe had misunderstood completelyHe had thought it an easy matter just to sit and make everything clearIf we talk about understanding Dhamma then both study monks and practice monks use the same wordsBut the actual understanding which comes from studying theory and that which comes from practicing Dhamma is not quite the sameIt may seem to be the same but one is more profoundOne is deeper than the otherThe kind of understanding which comes from practice leads to surrender to giving upUntil there is complete surrender we persevere  we persist in our contemplationIf desires or anger and dislike arise in our mind we arent indifferent to themWe dont just leave them but rather take them and investigate to see how and from where they ariseIf such moods are already in our mind then we contemplate and see how they work against usWe see them clearly and understand the difficulties which we cause ourselves by believing and following themThis kind of understanding is not found anywhere other than in our own pure mindIts because of this that those who study theory and those who practice meditation misunderstand each otherUsually those who emphasize study say things like this Monks who only practice meditation just follow their own opinionsThey have no basis in their Teaching Actually in one sense these two ways of study and practice are exactly the same thingIt can help us to understand if we think of it like the front and back of our handIf we put our hand out it seems as if the back of the hand has disappearedActually the back of our hand hasnt disappeared anywhere its just hidden underneathWhen we say that we cant see it it doesnt mean that it has disappeared completely it just means that its hidden underneathWhen we turn our hand over the same thing happens to the palm of the handIt doesnt go anywhere its merely hidden underneathWe should keep this in mind when we consider practiceIf we think that it has disappeared well go off to study hoping to get resultsBut it doesnt matter how much you study about Dhamma youll never understand because you wont know in accordance with TruthIf we do understand the real nature of Dhamma then it becomes letting goThis is surrender  removing attachment not clinging anymore or if there still is clinging it becomes less and lessThere is this kind of difference between the two ways of study and practiceWhen we talk about study we can understand it like this our eye is a subject of study our ear is a subject of study  everything is a subject of studyWe can know that form is like this and like that but we attach to form and dont know the way outWe can distinguish sounds but then we attach to themForms sounds smells tastes bodily feelings and mental impressions are all like a snare to entrap all beingsTo investigate these things is our way of practicing DhammaWhen some feeling arises we turn to our understanding to appreciate itIf we are knowledgeable regarding theory we will immediately turn to that and see how such and such a thing happens like this and then becomes that and so onIf we havent learned theory in this way then we have just the natural state of our mind to work withThis is our DhammaIf we have wisdom then well be able to examine this natural mind of ours and use this as our subject of studyIts exactly the same thingOur natural mind is theoryThe Buddha said to take whatever thoughts and feelings arise and investigate themUse the reality of our natural mind as our theoryWe rely on this realityIf you have faith it doesnt matter whether you have studied theory or notIf our believing mind leads us to develop practice if it leads us to constantly develop energy and patience then study doesnt matterWe have mindfulness as a foundation for our practiceWe are mindful in all bodily postures whether sitting standing walking or lyingAnd if there is mindfulness there will be clear comprehension to accompany itMindfulness and clear comprehension will arise togetherThey may arise so rapidly however that we cant tell them apartBut when there is mindfulness there will also be clear comprehensionWhen our mind is firm and stable mindfulness will arise quickly and easily and this is also where we have wisdomSometimes though wisdom is insufficient or doesnt arise at the right timeThere may be mindfulness and clear comprehension but these alone are not enough to control the situationGenerally if mindfulness and clear comprehension are a foundation of mind then wisdom will be there to assistHowever we must constantly develop this wisdom through the practice of Insight MeditationThis means that whatever arises in the mind can be the object of mindfulness and clear comprehensionBut we must see according to Anicca Dukkha AnattaImpermanence is the basisDukkha refers to the quality of unsatisfactoriness and Anatta says that it is without individual entityWe see that its simply a sensation that has arisen that it has no self no entity and that it disappears of its own accordJust thatSomeone who is deluded someone who doesnt have wisdom will miss this occasion he wont be able to use these things to advantageIf wisdom is present then mindfulness and clear comprehension will be right there with itHowever at this initial stage the wisdom may not be perfectly clearThus mindfulness and clear comprehension arent able to catch every object but wisdom comes to helpIt can see what quality of mindfulness there is and what kind of sensation has arisenOr in its most general aspect whatever mindfulness there is or whatever sensation there is its all DhammaThe Buddha took the practice of Insight Meditation as His foundationHe saw that this mindfulness and clear comprehension were both uncertain and unstableAnything thats unstable and which we want to have stable causes us to sufferWe want things to be according to our own desires but we must suffer because things just arent that wayThis is the influence of an unclean mind the influence of a mind which is lacking wisdomWhen we practice we tend to become caught up in wanting it easy wanting it to be the way we like itWe dont have to go very far to understand such an attitudeMerely look at this bodyIs it ever really the way we want itOne minute we like it to be one way and the next minute we like it to be another wayHave we ever really had it the way we likedThe nature of our bodies and minds is exactly the same in this regardIt simply is the way it isThis point in our practice can be easily missedUsually whatever we feel doesnt agree with us we throw out whatever doesnt please us we throw outWe dont stop to think whether the way we like and dislike things is really the correct way or notWe merely think that the things we find disagreeable must be wrong and those which we find agreeable must be rightThis is where craving comes fromWhen we receive stimuli by way of eye ear nose tongue body or mind a feeling of liking or disliking arisesThis shows that the mind is full of attachmentSo the Buddha gave us this Teaching of ImpermanenceHe gave us a way to contemplate thingsIf we cling to something which isnt permanent then well experience sufferingTheres no reason why we should want to have these things in accordance with our likes and dislikesIt isnt possible for us to make things be that wayWe dont have that kind of authority or powerRegardless of however we may like things to be everything is already the way it isWanting like this is not the way out of sufferingHere we can see how the mind which is deluded understands in one way and the mind which is not deluded understands in another wayWhen the mind with wisdom receives some sensation for example it sees it as something not to be clung to or identified withThis is what indicates wisdomIf there isnt any wisdom then we merely follow our stupidityThis stupidity is not seeing impermanence unsatisfactoriness and notselfThat which we like we see as good and rightThat which we dont like we see as not goodWe cant arrive at Dhamma this way  wisdom cannot ariseIf we can see this then wisdom arisesThe Buddha firmly established the practice of Insight Meditation in His mind and used it to investigate all the various mental impressionsWhatever arose in His mind He investigated like this even though we like it its uncertainIts suffering because these things which are constantly rising and falling dont follow the influence of our mindsAll these things are not a being or a self they dont belong to usThe Buddha taught us to see them just as they areIt is this principle on which we stand in practiceWe understand then that we arent able to just bring about various moods as we wishBoth good moods and bad moods are going to come upSome of them are helpful and some of them are notIf we dont understand rightly regarding these things then we wont be able to judge correctlyRather we will go running after craving  running off following our desireSometimes we feel happy and sometimes we feel sad but this is naturalSometimes well feel pleased and at other times disappointedWhat we like we hold as good and what we dont like we hold as badIn this way we separate ourselves further and further and further from DhammaWhen this happens we arent able to understand or recognize Dhamma and thus we are confusedDesires increase because our minds have nothing but delusionThis is how we talk about the mindIt isnt necessary to go far away from ourselves to find understandingWe simply see that these states of mind arent permanentWe see that they are unsatisfactory and that they arent a permanent selfIf we continue to develop our practice in this way we call it the practice of Vipassana or Insight MeditationWe say that it is recognizing the contents of our mind and in this way we develop wisdomOur practice of Samatha is like this We establish the practice of mindfulness on the inand outbreath for example as a foundation or means of controlling the mindBy having the mind follow the flow of the breath it becomes steadfast calm and stillThis practice of calming the mind is called Samatha MeditationIts necessary to do a lot of this kind of practice because the mind is full of many disturbancesIts very confusedWe cant say how many years or how many lives its been this wayIf we sit and contemplate well see that theres a lot that doesnt conduce to peace and calm and a lot that leads to confusionFor this reason the Buddha taught that we must find a meditation subject which is suitable to our particular tendencies a way of practice which is right for our characterFor example going over and over the parts of the body hair of the head hair of the body nails teeth and skin can be very calmingThe mind can become very peaceful from this practiceIf contemplating these five things leads to calm its because they are appropriate objects for contemplation according to our tendenciesWhatever we find to be appropriate in this way we can consider to be our practice and use it to subdue the defilementsAnother example is recollection of deathFor those who still have strong greed aversion and delusion and find them difficult to contain its useful to take this subject of personal death as a meditationWell come to see that everybody has to die whether rich or poorWell see both good and evil people dieEverybody must dieDeveloping this practice we find that an attitude of dispassion arisesThe more we practice the easier our sitting produces calmThis is because its a suitable and appropriate practice for usIf this practice of Calm Meditation is not agreeable to our particular tendencies it wont produce this attitude of dispassionIf the object is truly suited to us then well find it arising regularly without great difficulty and well find ourselves thinking about it oftenRegarding this we can see an example in our everyday livesWhen laypeople bring trays of many different types of food to offer the monks we taste them all to see which we likeWhen we have tried each one we can tell which is most agreeable to usThis is just an exampleThat which we find agreeable to our taste well eat we find most suitableWe wont bother about the other various dishesThe practice of concentrating our attention on the inand outbreath is an example of a type of meditation which is suitable for us allIt seems that when we go around doing various different practices we dont feel so goodBut as soon as we sit and observe our breath we have a good feeling we can see it clearlyTheres no need to go looking far away we can use what is close to us and this will be better for usJust watch the breathIt goes out and comes in out and in  we watch it like thisFor a long time we keep watching our breathing in and out and slowly our mind settlesOther activity will arise but we feel like it is distant from usJust like when we live apart from each other and dont feel so close anymoreWe dont have the same strong contact anymore or perhaps no contact at allWhen we have a feeling for this practice of mindfulness of breathing it becomes easierIf we keep on with this practice we gain experience and become skilled at knowing the nature of the breathWell know what its like when its long and what its like when its shortLooking at it one way we can talk about the food of the breathWhile sitting or walking we breathe while sleeping we breathe while awake we breatheIf we dont breathe then we dieIf we think about it we see that we exist only with the help of foodIf we dont eat ordinary food for ten minutes an hour or even a day it doesnt matterThis is a course kind of foodHowever if we dont breathe for even a short time well dieIf we dont breathe for five or ten minutes we would be deadTry itOne who is practicing mindfulness of breathing should have this kind of understandingThe knowledge that comes from this practice is indeed wonderfulIf we dont contemplate then we wont see the breath as food but actually we are eating air all the time in out in out all the timeAlso youll find that the more you contemplate in this way the greater the benefits derived from the practice and the more delicate the breath becomesIt may even happen that the breath stopsIt appears as if we arent breathing at allActually the breath is passing through the pores of the skinThis is called the delicate breath When our mind is perfectly calm normal breathing can cease in this wayWe need not be at all startled or afraidIf theres no breathing what should we doJust know itKnow that there is no breathing thats allThis is the right practice hereHere we are talking about the way of Samatha practice the practice of developing calmIf the object which we are using is right and appropriate for us it will lead to this kind of experienceThis is the beginning but there is enough in this practice to take us all the way or at least to where we can see clearly and continue in strong faithIf we keep on with contemplation in this manner energy will come to usThis is similar to the water in an urnWe put in water and keep it topped upWe keep on filling the urn with water and thereby the insects which live in the water dont dieMaking effort and doing our everyday practice is just like thisIt all comes back to practiceWe feel very good and peacefulThis peacefulness comes from our onepointed state of mindThis onepointed state of mind however can be very troublesome since we dont want other mental states to disturb usActually other mental states do come and if we think about it that in itself can be the onepointed state of mindIts like when we see various men and women but we dont have the same feeling about them as we do about our mother and fatherIn reality all men are male just like our father and all women are female just like our mother but we dont have the same feeling about themWe feel that our parents are more importantThey hold greater value for usThis is how it should be with our onepointed state of mindWe should have the same attitude towards it as we would have towards our own mother and fatherAll other activity which arises we appreciate in the same way as we feel towards men and women in generalWe dont stop seeing them we simply acknowledge their presence and dont ascribe to them the same value as our parentsWhen our practice of Samatha arrives at calm the mind will be clear and brightThe activity of mind will become less and lessThe various mental impressions which arise will be fewerWhen this happens great peace and happiness will arise but we may attach to that happinessWe should contemplate that happiness as uncertainWe should also contemplate unhappiness as uncertain and impermanentWell understand that all the various feelings are not lasting and not to be clung toWe see things in this way because theres wisdomWell understand that things are this way according to their natureIf we have this kind of understanding its like taking hold of one strand of a rope which makes up a knotIf we pull it in the right direction the knot will loosen and begin to untangleItll no longer be so tight or so tenseThis is similar to understanding that it doesnt always have to be this wayBefore we felt that things would always be the way they were and in so doing we pulled the knot tighter and tighterThis tightness is sufferingLiving that way is very tenseSo we loosen the knot a little and relaxWhy do we loosen itBecause its tightIf we dont cling to it then we can loosen itIts not a permanent condition that must always be that wayWe use the Teaching of Impermanence as our basisWe see that both happiness and unhappiness are not permanentWe see them as not dependableThere is absolutely nothing thats permanentWith this kind of understanding we gradually stop believing in the various moods and feelings which come up in the mindWrong understanding will decrease to the same degree that we stop believing in itThis is what is meant by undoing the knotIt continues to become looserAttachment will be gradually unrootedWhen we come to see impermanence unsatisfactoriness and notself in ourselves in this body and mind in this world then well find that a kind of boredom will ariseThis isnt the everyday boredom that makes us feel like not wanting to know or see or say anything or not wanting to have anything to do with anybody at allThat isnt real boredom it still has attachment we still dont understandWe still have feelings of envy and resentment and are still clinging to the things which cause us sufferingThe kind of boredom which the Buddha talked about is a condition without anger or lustIt arises out of seeing everything as impermanentWhen pleasant feeling arises in our mind we see that it isnt lastingThis is the kind of boredom we haveWe call it Nibbida or disenchantmentThat means that its far from sensual craving and passionWe see nothing as being worthy of desireWhether or not things accord with our likes and dislikes it doesnt matter to us we dont identify with themWe dont give them any special valuePracticing like this we dont give things reason to cause us difficultyWe have seen suffering and have seen that identifying with moods can not give rise to any real happinessIt causes clinging to happiness and unhappiness and clinging to liking and disliking which is in itself the cause of sufferingWhen we are still clinging like this we dont have an evenminded attitude towards thingsSome states of mind we like and others we dislikeIf we are still liking and disliking then both happiness and unhappiness are sufferingIts this kind of attachment which causes sufferingThe Buddha taught that whatever causes us suffering is in itself unsatisfactoryHence we understand that the Buddhas Teaching is to know suffering and to know what causes it to ariseAnd further we should know freedom from suffering and the way of practice which leads to freedomHe taught us to know just these four thingsWhen we understand these four things well be able to recognize suffering when it arises and will know that it has a causeWell know that it didnt just drift inWhen we wish to be free from this suffering well be able to eliminate its causeWhy do we have this feeling of suffering this feeling of unsatisfactorinessWell see that its because we are clinging to our various likes and dislikesWe come to know that we are suffering because of our own actionsWe suffer because we ascribe value to thingsSo we say know suffering know the cause of suffering know freedom from suffering and know the Way to this freedomWhen we know about suffering we keep untangling the knotBut we must be sure to untangle it by pulling in the right directionThat is to say we must know that this is how things areAttachment will be torn outThis is the practice which puts an end to our sufferingKnow suffering know the cause of suffering know freedom from suffering and know the Path which leads out of sufferingThis is MaggaIt goes like this Right View Right Thought Right Speech Right Action Right Livelihood Right Effort Right Mindfulness Right ConcentrationWhen we have the right understanding regarding these things then we have the PathThese things can put an end to sufferingThey lead us to morality concentration and wisdomWe must clearly understand these four thingsWe must want to understandWe must want to see these things in terms of realityWhen we see these four things we call this Sacca DhammaWhether we look inside or in front or to the right or left all we see is Sacca DhammaWe simply see that everything is the way it isFor someone who has arrived at Dhamma someone who really understands Dhamma wherever he goes everything will be DhammaBreathe in breathe out just like thatEven if others are standing on their heads thats their businessDont bother your head over itJust concentrate on breathing in and out just know your breath thats enoughNothing elseJust know when the air comes in and goes out or you can say to yourself BUD on the inbreath DHO on the outbreathTake this as your subject of awarenessJust do it like that for nowWhen the air comes in you know it when it goes out you know itThen your mind will be peaceful not disturbed not restlessJust the air going in and out continuouslyIn the beginning keep it this simple nothing fancyHowever long you may sit if youre sabai or peaceful youll know within yourselfIf you keep at it the breath becomes refined and softer the body becomes soft the mind becomes soft  thats worth havingGo ahead let it happen naturallySitting sabai firm in meditation not in a daze not drowsy or nodding off everything becomes effortlessNow youre peacefulThen as youre getting up Wow what was that You cant stop thinking of that peaceThen we follow through by keeping constant clear mindfulness knowing ourselvesWhatever we say whatever we do going here going there going on almsround washing our bowls or eating we know what it is we are doingWe have mindfulness staying steadyJust keep on doing it like thisWhatever its time to do do it with constant mindfulnessAnd walking meditation take a straight path between two trees about seven or eight full armspansWalkings the same as sitting SamadhiCollect yourself resolve that now youre going to get into this meditation and calm down your mind so that clear mindfulness will be strong enough to ariseAs to methods some will start by spreading Metta to all living creatures for protectionGo ahead the chickenhearted need various approachesBegin with your right foot firstTake a good step and walk saying to yourself BUDDHO BUDDHO with your footstepsKeep your attention right there with your feet the whole timeIf you feel restless stop till peaceful then step againKnowing the beginning middle and end of the path and know when youre walking backKnow where you are continuouslySo thats the methodYou can do walking meditationSome people will say Walking back and forth like that is looney But theres a lot of wisdom in walking meditation you knowWalk back and forthIf youre tired stopTurn your attention inwards and bring your mind to rest by calmly being aware of your breathThen become aware of one more thing your alternating posturesStanding walking sitting lying down we keep changing positionsWe cant only stand only sit or only lie downWe live using all these postures thus we must develop awareness in each and every position and make them usefulGo ahead and do itIts not easyBut to put it simply Its as if you take this glass and put it here for two minutes then put it there for two minutesMove it from here to there every two minutesJust an example but do it like this with concentrationIn watching your breath its the same you do it until you doubt and suffer and thats when wisdom can ariseSome people will say WhatMoving a glass back and forth like that is nutty not usefulAre you crazy Never mind just do itAnd dont forget two minutes not five minutesConcentrateIts all in the doingSame with watching your breathSit up balanced in the crosslegged posture right leg resting on the leftBreathe in till it reaches here breathe out till all the air is out of your lungsBreathe in until full then let it goNow dont try to regulate itHowever long or short it is its okay good enoughSit and watch your breath go in and out naturallyDont let it slip awayIf it does stopWhere has it goneFind it and bring it backSooner or later youll meet up with something goodJust keep at itDont think you cant do itJust like sowing rice in the earth as if youre throwing it away but soon a sprout is born then it becomes a sheaf and soon you husk it and can eat khao mowIts like that you knowThats its natureThis is the same  just sittingSometimes you think What am I sitting here looking at my breath for anywayItll go in and out by itself without me gawking at it Thats just our opinionated mind always fleapickingIgnore itJust try to do it till peaceful because when calm the breath becomes fine body becomes relaxed mind is relaxed alls just rightContinuing on till perhaps youre just sitting there without your breath going in or out but still aliveDont be scaredDont run away thinking youve stopped breathingThis is already a peaceful stateYou dont have to do anything just sit in itSometimes its like youre not even breathing but you areMany things like this can happen but its okayJust be aware of it all without being fooled by any of itJust keep doing it and oftenRight after you eat hang up your robe and just start walking BUDDHO BUDDHO Keep at it till your path becomes a kneedeep trench just keep walkingWhen tired go and sitDo a lotDo it so that you know so that you have it so that its born so that you understand what its all aboutNot just walking a bit chung chok chung chok thinking of this and that then up to lie down in your hut soon snoring awayYoull never see anything that wayIf youre lazy when will it ever be finishedIf youre tired or lazy how far will you getJust get it together work through and get beyond your lazinessNot saying Peaceful peaceful peaceful then sit and arent peaceful right away then quit because it isnt thereIts easy to say but hard to doHuhLike saying Oh its not hard to plant rice to plant and eat rice is better than this But go out and do it and you dont know the oxen from the buffalo from the plowActually doing it is a lot different from talking about itThats how it is you knowAll of you wanting to find peacefulness  its thereBut you still dont know anything yetWhoever you ask you wont knowJust get to know your own breath going in and out BUDDHO BUDDHO Thats enoughJust do thatYou dont have to think of muchAt this time know this learn this for nowI do it and I dont see anything Doesnt matter just do itWhatever comes up okay just do it like this so youll know what its aboutDo it and seeIf you just sit like this and know whats happening its really all okayWhen your mind becomes peaceful it knowsYou can sit all night till dawn and you wont feel youre even sitting you enjoy itYou cant explain it its like enjoymentWhen it gets like this you might want to give profound sermons but beware of getting verbal diarrhea expounding the Dhamma constantly driving folks nutty with your nonstop teachingLike old Novice SangOne night just at dusk walking meditation time I heard someone in the bamboo grove nearby carrying on Yo yo yo yo I sat and listened thinking Whos teaching who over thereWhos carrying on He didnt stop just kept babbling onSo I took my flashlight and walked over to seeSure enough it was Novice Sang sitting under his bamboo clump lantern lit crosslegged bellowing at full blast expounding the Dhamma to the nightSang have you flipped your lid Oh I just cant hold it in he saidWhen sitting I gotta teach when walking I gotta teach dont know where itll end A real nutOh well thats how it is it can happen you knowBut keep at itDont just follow your moodsWhen lazy keep at itWhen energetic keep at itDo the sitting and walking and even when lying down watch your breathBefore sleeping teach your mind I wont indulge in the pleasure of sleep When you awaken continue meditatingAnd when eating we remind ourselves I wont eat this food with greed but only as medicine to sustain my life for this day and night in order to have strength enough to carry on meditating Before sleeping we teach ourselves before eating we teach ourselves like that continuallyIf standing be aware if sitting be aware if lying down be awareEverything do it that wayWhen you lie down lie on your right side focusing on your breath BUDDHO BUDDHO until you fall asleepAnd as soon as you awaken continue BUDDHO BUDDHO as if you hadnt skipped a breathThen peacefulness will arise be continuously mindfulDont look at anothers practice you cant do thatRegarding sitting meditation sit balanced and erectDont have your head tilted back or hanging downKeep it balancedLike the Buddha statue  now hes sitting tight and brightIf you want to change posture endure the pain to the utmost limit before changingWhat you say I cant handle that But wait before movingEndure the pain to its limit then take moreHowever much it hurts go ahead and endure itAnd if its too painful to keep BUDDHO in mind then take the pain as your object of awareness Pain pain pain PAIN on and on instead of BUDDHO Stay with it till the pain reaches its end and see what comes upThe Buddha said that pain arises by itself and itll stop by itselfLet it just die dont give upMaybe youll break out in a sweat  drops as big as corn kernels rolling down your backBut if you can get past the feeling once then youll know what its aboutBut that comes gradually dont push yourself too farJust slowly keep at itAnd know about eating chew swallow and where does it end upFood thats right or wrong for your body youll know itKnow where it reachesRefine the art of eating eat and estimate when youll be full after five more mouthfuls then stopTake enough water and thats itTry and see if you can do itMost people dont do it like thatInstead they eat till full then top up with five more mouthfulsBut thats not the way understandThe Buddha said just keep eating attentively and know youre not yet full but you will be in five more mouthfuls then stopTake enough water till fullThen whether walking or sitting youll not feel heavy and your meditation will become automatically betterBut people dont want to do it like thatIf you dont really want to train yourself then you cant do itOtherwise you eat till youre too full topping up with another five mouthfulsThats how it is the nature of our greed and defilements and the things the Buddha taught go in different directionWe have to watch ourselvesAnd sleeping being aware its up to your knowhowSometimes you wont get to sleep on time sleep early sleep late never mindThats what I doGet to sleep late or not late doesnt matter when I first awaken I get right updont make a fuss over itCut it right thereIf you awaken and are still sleepy just get right upGet up and go wash your face and start walking meditation go right ahead and walkThats how we must train ourselves do itSo these are the things to doBut you wont know about them from just listening to what others tell youYou can only know from actually doing the practiceSo go ahead and do itThese are the first steps in training the mindWhen meditating focus on only one thingSitting the mind only watches the breath going in and out continually watching slowly becoming peacefulIf the mind is scattered as soon as you sit youre off missing home mind reaching way over there thinking youd like to eat some noodlesYou want to eat want to drink hungry wanting missing everythingTill youre crazyBut if you go crazy then be crazy till you can work through itBut do itHave you ever done walking meditationHow is itMind wanders Then stop till it comes backIf it really wanders then dont breathe until you cant stand it  your mind will come backIf you sit and your mind goes running everywhere hold your breath dont let it out and when you cant stand it itll come backMake the mind strongTraining the mind is not the same as training animals you know its something thats really difficult to trainDont be easily discouragedAt times holding your breath till your chest is about to burst is the only thing thatll catch your mind  itll come running backTry it and seeDuring this rains retreat get to know what its aboutIn the daytime do it at night do it whenever youre fee go ahead and do itDo walking meditation night and day even if you dont talkTurn your attention right back to your meditation make it continuousIts the same as the water in this drinking bottleIf we tilt it a bit it starts to drip drip drip we tilt it more and drippity drippity drippity Thats like our mindfulnessAnd if we really pour it out it becomes a steady stream of water like out of a tap not just drippingMeaning that whether we stand walk sit lie down or whatever if we are always aware then our mindfulness is the same as a steady stream of waterIf we really pour it out its a steady streamSo if our mind wanders thinks of this and that then our mindfulness is only like dripping waterSo training our mind is just like thisWhether we think of this or that are restless arent together doesnt matterJust keep practicing continually and youll develop awareness until its a constant flowWhether standing sitting lying down or whatever that awareness will be right there with youDo it and seeJust sitting around its not going to happen by itself you knowBut if you try too hard you cant do it eitherdont try at all  still cant do itKeep that in mindSometimes you dont even intend to sit in meditation but your works finished and you sit down empty your mind and pap youre peaceful right awayEasy because youre right thereTake this then  thats enough for nowQuestion Im trying very hard in my practice but dont seem to be getting anywhereAnswer This is very importantDont try to get anywhere in the practiceThe very desire to be free or to be enlightened will be the desire that prevents your freedomYou can try as hard as you wish practice ardently night and day but if it is still with the desire to achieve in mind you will never find peaceThe energy from this desire will be a cause for doubt and restlessnessNo matter how long or how hard you practice wisdom will not arise from desireSo simply let goWatch the mind and body mindfully but dont try to achieve anythingDont cling even to the practice of enlightenmentQ What about sleepHow much should I sleepA dont ask me I cant tell youA good average for some is four hours a nightWhat is important though is that you watch and know yourselfIf you try to go with too little sleep the body will feel uncomfortable and mindfulness will be difficult to sustainToo much sleep leads to a dull or a restless mindFind the natural balance for yourselfCarefully watch the mind and body and keep track of sleep needs until you find the optimumIf you wake up and then roll over for a snooze this is defilementEstablish mindfulness as soon as your eyes openQ How about eatingHow much should I eatA Eating is the same as sleepingYou must know yourselfFood must be consumed to meet bodily needsLook at your food as medicineAre you eating so much that you only feel sleepy after the meal and are you getting fatter every dayStopExamine your own body and mindThere is no need to fastInstead experiment with the amount of food you takeFind the natural balance for your bodyPut all your food together in your bowl following the ascetic practiceThen you can easily judge the amount you takeWatch yourself carefully as you eatKnow yourselfThe essence of our practice is just thisThere is nothing special you must doOnly watchExamine yourselfWatch the mindThen you will know what is the natural balance for your own practiceQ Are minds of Asians and Westerners differentA Basically there is no differenceOuter customs and language may appear different but the human mind has natural characteristics which are the same for all peopleGreed and hatred are the same in an Eastern or a Western mindSuffering and the cessation of suffering are the same for all peopleQ Is it advisable to read a lot or study the scriptures as a part of practiceA The Dhamma of the Buddha is not found in booksIf you want to really see for yourself what the Buddha was talking about you dont need to bother with booksWatch your own mindExamine to see how feelings come and go how thoughts come and godont be attached to anythingJust be mindful of whatever there is to seeThis is the way to the truths of the BuddhaBe naturalEverything you do in your life here is a chance to practiceIt is all DhammaWhen you do your chores try to be mindfulIf you are emptying a spittoon or cleaning a toilet dont feel you are doing it as a favor for anyone elseThere is Dhamma in emptying spittoonsDont feel you are practicing only when sitting still crossleggedSome of you have complained that there is not enough time to meditateIs there enough time to breatheThis is your meditation mindfulness naturalness in whatever you doQ Why dont we have daily interviews with the teacherA If you have any questions you are welcome to come and ask them anytimeBut we dont need daily interviews hereIf I answer your every little question you will never understand the process of doubt in your own mindIt is essential that you learn to examine yourself to interview yourselfListen carefully to the lecture every few days then use this teaching to compare with your own practiceIs it still the sameIs it differentWhy do you have doubtsWho is it that doubtsOnly through selfexamination can you understandQ Sometimes I worry about the monks disciplineIf I kill insects accidentally is this badA Sila or discipline and morality are essential to our practice but you must not cling to the rules blindlyIn killing animals or in breaking other rules the important thing is intentionKnow your own mindYou should not be excessively concerned about the monks disciplineIf it is used properly it supports the practice but some monks are so worried about the petty rules that they cant sleep wellDiscipline is not to be carried as a burdenIn our practice here the foundation is discipline good discipline plus the ascetic rules and practicesBeing mindful and careful of even the many supporting rules as well as the basic precepts has great benefitIt makes life very simpleThere need be no wondering about how to act so you can avoid thinking and instead just be simply mindfulThe discipline enables us to live together harmoniously the community runs smoothlyOutwardly everyone looks and acts the sameDiscipline and morality are the stepping stones for further concentration and wisdomBy proper use of the monks discipline and the ascetic precepts we are forced to live simply to limit our possessionsSo here we have the complete practice of the Buddha refrain from evil and do good live simply keeping to basic needs purify the mindThat is be watchful of our mind and body in all postures sitting standing walking or lying know yourselfQ What can I do about doubtsSome days Im plagued with doubts about the practice or my own progress or the teacherA Doubting is naturalEveryone starts out with doubtsYou can learn a great deal from themWhat is important is that you dont identify with your doubts that is dont get caught up in themThis will spin your mind in endless circlesInstead watch the whole process of doubting of wonderingSee who it is that doubtsSee how doubts come and goThen you will no longer be victimized by your doubtsYou will step outside of them and your mind will be quietYou can see how all things come and goJust let go of what you are attached toLet go of your doubts and simply watchThis is how to end doubtingQ What about other methods of practiceThese days there seem to be so many teachers and so many different systems of meditation that it is confusingA It is like going into townOne can approach from the north from the southeast from many roadsOften these systems just differ outwardlyWhether you walk one way or another fast or slow if you are mindful it is all the sameThere is one essential point that all good practice must eventually come to  not clingingIn the end all meditation systems must be let go ofNeither can one cling to the teacherIf a system leads to relinquishment to not clinging then it is correct practiceYou may wish to travel to visit other teachers and try other systemsSome of you have already done soThis is a natural desireYou will find out that a thousand questions asked and knowledge of many systems will not bring you to the truthEventually you will get boredYou will see that only by stopping and examining your own mind can you find out what the Buddha talked aboutNo need to go searching outside yourselfEventually you must return to face your own true natureHere is where you can understand the DhammaQ A lot of times it seems that many monks here are not practicingThey look sloppy or unmindfulThis disturbs meA It is not proper to watch other peopleThis will not help your practiceIf you are annoyed watch the annoyance in your own mindIf others discipline is bad or they are not good monks this is not for you to judgeYou will not discover wisdom watching othersMonks discipline is a tool to use for your own meditationIt is not a weapon to use to criticize or find faultNo one can do your practice for you nor can you do practice for anyone elseJust be mindful of your own doingsThis is the way to practiceQ I have been extremely careful to practice sense restraintI always keep my eyes lowered and am mindful of every little action I doWhen eating for example I take a long time and try to see each touch chewing tasting swallowing etcI take each step very deliberately and carefullyAm I practicing properlyA Sense restraint is proper practiceWe should be mindful of it throughout the dayBut dont overdo itWalk and eat and act naturallyAnd then develop natural mindfulness of what is going on within yourselfDont force your meditation nor force yourself into awkward patternsThis is another form of cravingBe patientPatience and endurance are necessaryIf you act naturally and are mindful wisdom will come naturally tooQ Is it necessary to sit for very long stretchesA No sitting for hours on end is not necessarySome people think that the longer you can sit the wiser you must beI have seen chickens sit on their nests for days on endWisdom comes from being mindful in all posturesYour practice should begin as you awaken in the morningIt should continue until you fall asleepDont be concerned about how long you can sitWhat is important is only that you keep watchful whether you are working or sitting or going to the bathroomEach person has his own natural paceSome of you will die at age fifty some at age sixtyfive and some at age ninetySo too your practice will not be all identicalDont think or worry about thisTry to be mindful and let things take their natural courseThen your mind will become quieter and quieter in any surroundingsIt will become still like a clear forest poolThen all kinds of wonderful and rare animals will come to drink at the poolYou will see clearly the nature of all things in the worldYou will see many wonderful and strange things come and goBut you will be stillProblems will arise and you will see through them immediatelyThis is the happiness of the BuddhaQ I still have very many thoughtsMy mind wanders a lot even though I am trying to be mindfulA Dont worry about thisTry to keep your mind in the presentWhatever there is that arises in the mind just watch itLet go of itDont even wish to be rid of thoughtsThen the mind will reach its natural stateNo discriminating between good and bad hot and cold fast and slowNo me and no you no self at allJust what there isWhen you walk on almsround no need to do anything specialSimply walk and see what there isNo need to cling to isolation or seclusionWherever you are know yourself by being natural and watchingIf doubts arise watch them come and goIts very simpleHold on to nothingIt is as though you are walking down a roadPeriodically you will run into obstaclesWhen you meet defilements just see them and just overcome them by letting go of themdont think about the obstacles you have passed alreadyDont worry about those you have not yet seenStick to the presentDont be concerned about the length of the road or about the destinationEverything is changingWhatever you pass do not cling to itEventually the mind will reach its natural balance where practice is automaticAll things will come and go of themselvesQ Have you ever looked at the Altar Sutra of the th Patriarch Hui NengA Hui Nengs wisdom is very keenIt is very profound teaching not easy for beginners to understandBut if you practice with our discipline and with patience if you practice notclinging you will eventually understandOnce I had a disciple who stayed in a grassroofed hutIt rained often that rainy season and one day a strong wind blew off half the roofHe did not bother to fix it just let it rain inSeveral days passed and I asked him about his hutHe said he was practicing notclingingThis is notclinging without wisdomIt is about the same as the equanimity of a water buffaloIf you live a good life and live simply if you are patient and unselfish you will understand the wisdom of Hui NengQ You have said that samatha and vipassana or concentration and insight are the sameCould you explain this furtherA It is quite simpleConcentration and wisdom work togetherFirst the mind becomes still by holding on to a meditation objectIt is quiet only while you are sitting with your eyes closedThis is samatha and eventually this samadhibase is the cause for wisdom or vipassana to ariseThen the mind is still whether you sit with your eyes closed or walk around in a busy cityIts like thisOnce you were a childNow you are an adultAre the child and the adult the same personYou can say that they are or looking at it another way you can say that they are differentIn this way samatha and vipassana could also be looked at as separateOr it is like food and fecesFood and feces could be called the same and they can be called differentDont just believe what I say do your practice and see for yourselfNothing special is neededIf you examine how concentration and wisdom arise you will know the truth for yourselfThese days many people cling to the wordsThey call their practice vipassanaSamatha is looked down onOr they call their practice samathaIt is essential to do samatha before vipassana they sayAll this is sillyDont bother to think about it in this waySimply do the practice and youll see for yourselfQ Is it necessary to be able to enter absorption in our practiceA No absorption is not necessaryYou must establish a modicum of tranquillity and onepointedness of mindThen you use this to examine yourselfNothing special is neededIf absorption comes in your practice this is OK tooJust dont hold on to itSome people get hung up with absorptionIt can be great fun to play withYou must know proper limitsIf you are wise then you will know the uses and limitations of absorption just as you know the limitations of children verses grown menQ Why do we follow the ascetic rules such as only eating out of our bowlsA The ascetic precepts are to help us cut defilementBy following the ones such as eating out of our bowls we can be more mindful of our food as medicineIf we have no defilements then it does not matter how we eatBut here we use the form to make our practice simpleThe Buddha did not make the ascetic precepts necessary for all monks but he allowed them for those who wished to practice strictlyThey add to our outward discipline and thereby help increase our mental resolve and strengthThese rules are to be kept for yourselfDont watch how others practiceWatch your own mind and see what is beneficial for youThe rule that we must take whatever meditation cottage assigned to us is a similarly helpful disciplineIt keeps monks from being attached to their dwelling placeIf they go away and return they must take a new dwellingThis is our practice  not to cling to anythingQ If putting everything together in our bowls is important why dont you as a teacher do it yourselfDont you feel it is important for the teacher to set an exampleA Yes it is true a teacher should set an example for his disciplesI dont mind that you criticize meAsk whatever you wishBut it is important that you do not cling to the teacherIf I were absolutely perfect in outward form it would be terribleYou would all be too attached to meEven the Buddha would sometimes tell his disciples to do one thing and then do another himselfYour doubts in your teacher can help youYou should watch your own reactionsDo you think it is possible that I keep some food out of my bowl in dishes to feed the laymen who work around the templeWisdom is for yourself to watch and developTake from the teacher what is goodBe aware of your own practiceIf I am resting while you must all sit up does this make you angryIf I call the color blue red or say that male is female dont follow me blindlyOne of my teachers ate very fastHe made noises as he ateYet he told us to eat slowly and mindfullyI used to watch him and get very upsetI suffered but he didntI watched the outsideLater I learnedSome people drive very fast but carefullyOthers drive slowly and have many accidentsDont cling to rules to outer formIf you watch others at most ten percent of the time and watch yourself ninety percent this is the proper practiceAt first I used to watch my teacher Ajahn Tong Raht and had many doubtsPeople even thought he was madHe would do strange things or get very fierce with his disciplesOutside he was angry but inside there was nothingNobody thereHe was remarkableHe stayed clear and mindful until the moment he diedLooking outside the self is comparing discriminatingYou will not find happiness that wayNor will you find peace if you spend your time looking for the perfect man or the perfect teacherThe Buddha taught us to look at the Dhamma the truth not to look at other peopleQ How can we overcome lust in our practiceSometimes I feel as if I am a slave to my sexual desireA Lust should be balanced by contemplation of loathsomenessAttachment to bodily form is one extreme and one should keep in mind the oppositeExamine the body as a corpse and see the process of decay or think of the parts of the body such as the lungs spleen fat feces and so forthRemember these and visualize this loathsome aspect of the body when lust arisesThis will free you from lustQ How about angerWhat should I do when I feel anger arisingA You must use lovingkindnessWhen angry states of mind arise in meditation balance them by developing feelings of lovingkindnessIf someone does something bad or gets angry dont get angry yourselfIf you do you are being more ignorant than theyBe wiseKeep in mind compassion for that person is sufferingFill your mind with lovingkindness as if he were a dear brotherConcentrate on the feeling of lovingkindness as a meditation subjectSpread it to all beings in the worldOnly through lovingkindness is hatred overcomeSometimes you may see other monks behaving badlyYou may get annoyedThis is suffering unnecessarilyIt is not yet our DhammaYou may think like this He is not as strict as I amThey are not serious meditators like usThose monks are not good monks This is a great defilement on your partDo not make comparisonsDo not discriminateLet go of your opinion as watch your opinions and watch yourselfThis is our DhammaYou cant possibly make everyone act as you wish or be like youThis wish will only make you sufferIt is a common mistake for meditators to make but watching other people wont develop wisdomSimply examine yourself your feelingsThis is how you will understandQ I feel sleepy a great dealIt makes it hard to meditateA There are many ways to overcome sleepinessIf you are sitting in the dark move to a lighted placeOpen your eyesGet up and wash your face or take a bathIf you are sleepy change posturesWalk a lotWalk backwardsThe fear of running into things will keep you awakeIf this fails stand still clear the mind and imagine it is full daylightOr sit on the edge of a high cliff or deep wellYou wont dare sleepIf nothing works then just go to sleepLay down carefully and try to be aware until the moment you fall asleepThen as you awaken get right upDont look at the clock or roll overStart mindfulness from the moment you awakenIf you find yourself sleepy everyday try to eat lessExamine yourselfAs soon as five more spoonfuls will make you full stopThen take water until just properly fullGo and sitWatch your sleepiness and hungerYou must learn to balance your eatingAs your practice goes on you will feel naturally more energetic and eat lessBut you must adjust yourselfQ Why must we do so much prostrating hereA Prostrating is very importantIt is an outward form that is part of practiceThis form should be done correctlyBring the forehead all the way to the floorHave the elbows near the knees and the palms of the hands on the floor about three inches apartProstrate slowly be mindful of your bodyIt is a good remedy for our conceitWe should prostrate oftenWhen you prostrate three times you can keep in mind the qualities of the Buddha the Dhamma and the Sangha that is the qualities of mind of purity radiance and peaceSo we use the outward form to train ourselvesBody and mind become harmoniousDont make the mistake of watching how others prostrateIf young novices are sloppy or the aged monks appear unmindful this is not for you to judgePeople can be difficult to trainSome learn fast but others learn slowlyJudging others will only increase your prideWatch yourself insteadProstrate often get rid of your prideThose who have really become harmonious with the Dhamma get far beyond the outward formEverything they do is a way of prostratingWalking they prostrate eating they prostrate defecating they prostrateThis is because they have got beyond selfishnessQ What is the biggest problem of your new disciplesA OpinionsViews and ideas about all thingsAbout themselves about practice about the teachings of the BuddhaMany of those who come here have a high rank in the communityThere are wealthy merchants or college graduates teachers and government officialsTheir minds are filled with opinions about thingsThey are too clever to listen to othersIt is like water in a cupIf a cup is filled with dirty stale water it is uselessOnly after the old water is thrown out can the cup become usefulYou must empty your minds of opinions then you will seeOur practice goes beyond cleverness and beyond stupidityIf you think I am clever I am wealthy I am important I understand all about Buddhism You cover up the truth of anatta or noselfAll you will see is self I mineBut Buddhism is letting go of selfVoidness Emptiness NibbanaQ Are defilements such as greed or anger merely illusory or are they realA They are bothThe defilements we call lust or greed or anger or delusion these are just outward names appearancesJust as we call a bowl large small pretty or whateverThis is not realityIt is the concept we create from cravingIf we want a big bowl we call this one smallCraving causes us to discriminateThe truth though is merely what isLook at it this wayAre you a manYou can say yes This is the appearance of thingsBut really you are only a combination of elements or a group of changing aggregatesIf the mind is free it does not discriminateNo big and small no you and meThere is nothing Anatta we say or nonselfReally in the end there is neither atta nor anattaQ Could you explain a little more about karmaA Karma is actionKarma is clingingBody speech and mind all make karma when we clingWe make habitsThese can make us suffer in the futureThis is the fruit of our clinging of our past defilementAll attachment leads to making karmaSuppose you were a thief before you became a monkYou stole made others unhappy made your parents unhappyNow you are a monk but when you remember how you made others unhappy you feel bad and suffer yourself even todayRemember not only body but speech and mental action can make conditions for future resultsIf you did some act of kindness in the past and remember it today you will be happyThis happy state of mind is the result of past karmaAll things are conditioned by cause  both long term and when examined moment to momentBut you need not bother to think about past or present or futureMerely watch the body and mindYou must figure karma out for yourselfWatch your mindPractice and you will see clearlyMake sure however that you leave the karma of others to themDont cling to and dont watch othersIf I take a poison I sufferNo need for you to share it with meTake what is good that your teacher offersThen you can become peaceful your mind will become like that of your teacherIf you will examine it you will seeEven if now you dont understand when you practice it will become clearYou will know by yourselfThis is called practicing the DhammaWhen we were young our parents used to discipline us and get angryReally they wanted to help usYou must see it over the long termParents and teachers criticize us and we get upsetLater on we see whyAfter long practice you will knowThose who are too clever leave after a short timeThey never learnYou must get rid of your clevernessIf you think yourself better than others you will only sufferWhat a pityNo need to get upsetJust watchQ Sometimes it seems that since becoming a monk I have increased my hardships and sufferingA I know that some of you have had a background of material comfort and outward freedomBy comparison now you live an austere existenceThen in the practice I often make you sit and wait for long hoursFood and climate are different from your homeBut everyone must go through some of thisThis is the suffering that leads to the end of sufferingThis is how you learnWhen you get angry and feel sorry for yourself it is a great opportunity to understand the mindThe Buddha called defilements our teachersAll my disciples are like my childrenI have only loving kindness and their welfare in mindIf I appear to make you suffer it is for your own goodI know some of you are welleducated and very knowledgeablePeople with little education and worldly knowledge can practice easilyBut it is as if you Westerners have a very large house to cleanWhen you have cleaned the house you will have a big living spaceYou can use the kitchen the library the living roomYou must be patientPatience and endurance are essential to our practiceWhen I was a young monk I did not have it as hard as youI knew the language and was eating my native foodEven so some days I despairedI wanted to disrobe or even commit suicideThis kind of suffering comes from wrong viewsWhen you have seen the truth though you are free from views and opinionsEverything becomes peacefulQ I have been developing very peaceful states of mind from meditationWhat should I do nowA This is goodMake the mind peaceful concentratedUse this concentration to examine the mind and bodyWhen the mind is not peaceful you should also watchThen you will know true peaceWhyBecause you will see impermanenceEven peace must be seen as impermanentIf you are attached to peaceful states of mind you will suffer when you do not have themGive up everything even peaceQ Did I hear you say that you are afraid of very diligent disciplesA Yes thats rightI am afraidI am afraid that they are too seriousThey try too hard but without wisdomThey push themselves into unnecessary sufferingSome of you are determined to become enlightenedYou grit your teeth and struggle all the timeThis is trying too hardPeople are all the sameThey dont know the nature of thingsAll formations mind and body are impermanentSimply watch and dont clingOthers think they knowThey criticize they watch they judgeThats OKLeave their opinions to themThis discrimination is dangerousIt is like a road with a very sharp curveIf we think others are worse or better or the same as us we go off the curveIf we discriminate we will only sufferQ I have been meditating many years nowMy mind is open and peaceful in almost all circumstancesNow I would like to try to backtrack and practice high states of concentration or mind absorptionA This is fineIt is beneficial mental exerciseIf you have wisdom you will not get hung up on concentrated states of mindIt is the same as wanting to sit for long periodsThis is fine for training but really practice is separate from any postureIt is a matter of directly looking at the mindThis is wisdomWhen you have examined and understood the mind then you have the wisdom to know the limitations of concentration or of booksIf you have practiced and understand notclinging you can then return to the booksThey will be like a sweet dessertThey can help you to teach othersOr you can go back to practice absorptionYou have the wisdom to know not to hold on to anythingQ Would you review some of the main points of our discussionA You must examine yourselfKnow who you areKnow your body and mind by simply watchingIn sitting in sleeping in eating know your limitsUse wisdomThe practice is not to try to achieve anythingJust be mindful of what isOur whole meditation is looking directly at the mindYou will see suffering its cause and its endBut you must have patience much patience and enduranceGradually you will learnThe Buddha taught his disciples to stay with their teachers for at least five yearsYou must learn the values of giving of patience and of devotionDont practice too strictlyDont get caught up with outward formWatching others is bad practiceSimply be natural and watch thatOur monks discipline and monastic rules are very importantThey create a simple and harmonious environmentUse them wellBut remember the essence of the monks discipline is watching intention examining the mindYou must have wisdomDont discriminateWould you get upset at a small tree in the forest for not being tall and straight like some of the othersThis is sillyDont judge other peopleThere are all varietiesNo need to carry the burden of wishing to change them allSo be patientPractice moralityLive simply and be naturalWatch the mindThis is our practiceIt will lead you to unselfishnessTo peaceIn the centuries immediately following the Buddhas death and the First Buddhist Council arahants and scholarmonks began recording their own commentaries to the teachings of the TipitakaAt first these commentaries explanations amplifications meditation notes and historical recollections were passed down orally within the monastic sangha but like the Tipitaka itself many began to be recorded in writing around the turn of the Common EraMost of these early texts  primarily written in Sinhala  remained for centuries tucked away in forest monasteries and temples in Sri Lanka accessible only to a few Sinhala scholarsIt wasnt until these scattered fragments were translated into Pali and collated into coherent texts  that they became available to the wider Theravadan worldSince then these texts  variously labeled noncanonical extracanonical or postcanonical  have come to be regarded as essential supplements to the teachings of the Pali canon itselfSo treasured for example is the Milindapañha that it has even been subsumed in the Burmese edition of the Tipitaka and in some parts of the Theravadan world Buddhaghosas monumental Visuddhimagga is regarded as a more definitive guide to Buddhist meditation practice than even the Tipitaka itselfTaken together the Tipitaka and much of this noncanonical Pali literature constitute the complete body of classical Theravada textsFor a more detailed overview see Beyond the Tipitaka A Field Guide to Postcanonical Pali LiteratureAccess to Insight offers only a handful of translations of noncanonical Pali textsThe Itivuttaka a collection of short discourses takes its name from the statement at the beginning of each of its discourses this was said by the Blessed OneThe collection as a whole is attributed to a laywoman named Khujjuttara who worked in the palace of King Udena of Kosambi as a servant to one of his queens SamavatiBecause the Queen could not leave the palace to hear the Buddhas discourses Khujjuttara went in her place memorized what the Buddha said and then returned to the palace to teach the Queen and her ladiesinwaitingFor her efforts the Buddha cited Khujjuttara as the foremost of his laywomen disciples in terms of her learningShe was also an effective teacher when the inner apartments of the palace later burned down killing the Queen and her entourage the Buddha commented that all of the women had reached at least the first stage of AwakeningThe name of the Itivuttaka is included in the standard early list of the nine divisions of the Buddhas teachings  a list that predates the organization of the Pali canon as we now know itIts impossible to determine though the extent to which the extant Pali Itivuttaka corresponds to the Itivuttaka mentioned in that listThe Chinese canon contains a translation of an Itivuttaka attributed to Hsantsang that strongly resembles the text of the Pali Itivuttaka the major difference being that parts of the Group of Threes and all of the Group of Fours in the Pali are missing in Hsantsangs translationEither these parts were later additions to the text that found their way into the Pali but not into the Sanskrit version translated by Hsantsang or the Sanskrit text was incomplete or Hsantsangs translation was left unfinishedThe early history of the Itivuttaka is made even more complex by the fact that it was originally an oral tradition first written down several centuries after the Buddhas passing awayFor a discussion of this issue see the Historical Notes appended to Dhammapada A TranslationWhatever the history of the text though it has long been one of the favorite collections in the Pali canon for it covers a wide range of the Buddhas teachings  from the simplest to the most profound  in a form that is accessible appealing and to the pointHowever although the discourses in the Itivuttaka cover many topics they all relate to a common theme the consequences of ones actions or kammaBecause this theme is so central to these discourses and because it is so commonly misunderstood I would like briefly to explain it hereThe Buddhas teachings on action or kamma and his accompanying teachings on rebirth are often dismissed as unessential to his teaching something he simply picked up from his Indian environmentActually they are central to his teaching and form one of his most original insightsAlthough many people assume that the Buddha derived his teachings on kamma from a view of the cosmos as a whole the line of experiential proof was actually the other way aroundAfter directly observing and analyzing the role of action in shaping his experience of time he then followed the implications of his observations to confirm his vision of the process of rebirth and the structure of the cosmos that lies under the sway of timeIn the course of his Awakening the Buddha discovered that the experience of the present moment consists of three factors results from past actions present actions and the results of present actionsThis means that kamma acts in feedback loops with the present moment being shaped both by past and by present actions while present actions shape not only the present but also the futureThis constant opening for present input into the causal processes shaping ones life makes free will possibleIn fact will  or intention  forms the essence of actionFurthermore the quality of the intention determines the quality of the act and of its resultsOn the mundane level there are three types of intentions skillful leading to pleasant results unskillful leading to painful results and mixed leading to mixed results all these results being experienced within the realm of space and timeHowever the fact that the experience of space and time requires not only the results of past actions but also the input of present actions means that it is possible to unravel the experience of space and time by bringing the mind to a point of equilibrium where it contributes no intentions or actions to the present momentThe intentions that converge at this equilibrium are thus a fourth type of intention  transcendent skillful intentions  which lead to release from the results of mundane intentions and ultimately to the ending of all actionThe Buddhas direct perception of the power of intention confirmed for him the process of rebirth if experience of the present moment requires the influence of past intentions then there is no way to account for experience at the beginning of life other than through the intentions of a previous lifetimeAt the same time the power of the quality of intention provided the framework for Buddhas vision of the cosmos in which the process of rebirth takes place there are pleasant levels of rebirth  the worlds of the Brahmas and the higher devas unpleasant levels  hell the realms of the hungry shades common animals and the angry demons and mixed levels  the human realm and some of the lower deva realmsEven in the pleasant levels of rebirth however the pleasure is unstable and impermanent giving no sure release from suffering and painThe only secure release comes through transcendent skillful intentions leading to the experience of nibbana totally beyond the process of rebirth and the constraints of space and timeNibbana itself is totally unconditioned and so cannot be analyzed apart from a distinction in how it is experienced before and after deathHowever the path of practice leading to nibbana can be analyzedIt has eight factors  right view right resolve right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness and right concentration  and goes through four levels of AwakeningThe early texts say very little about the content of these Awakening experiences but are very specific about how these experiences function in effecting lasting changes in the mindStreamentry  in which one enters the stream to nibbana gaining ones first glimpse of the deathless and cutting through the mental fetters of selfidentity views uncertainty and grasping at precepts and practices  ensures that one will be reborn at most only seven more timesOncereturning ensures that one will be reborn only once more on the human levelNonreturning  which cuts through the mental fetters of sensual passion and resistance  ensures that one will never be reborn on the human levelIf one goes no further in this life one will be reborn in one of the five Brahma realms called the Pure Abodes and attain full Awakening thereArahantship  which cuts through the mental fetters of passion for form passion for formlessness restlessness conceit and ignorance  frees one entirely from the suffering caused by craving and from the cycle of rebirth as a wholeThis then is the picture of the cosmos that derives from the Buddhas insight into the power of intentionAnd what shapes skillful intentionTwo connected qualities appropriate attention and right viewAppropriate attention focuses on questions that help foster skillfulness in ones actions and avoids questions that get in the way of developing that skillOn the mundane level right view provides a proper understanding of action and its potential for producing mundane pleasure and painOn the transcendent level it reduces experience simply to cause and effect skillful and unskillful  expressed in terms of the four noble truths  without focusing on whether there is anyone performing the action or experiencing the resultThis untangles the mind from issues of space and time and allows it to act in a way that opens to transcendent releaseSimply put appropriate attention asks the right questions right view provides the right answersThe interplay between these two mental qualities explains the questionandanswer format used in many of the discourses in the ItivuttakaAnd given the role of right view in skillful action the fact that all of the discourses deal with right view means that they are all aimed  directly or indirectly  at helping the reader reach true happiness by using those views to foster skillful intentions in his or her own lifeIn addition to the titles listed below Thanissaro Bhikkhu has also translated into English many books by masters of the Thai forest traditions

Four Frames of Reference the Four Right Exertions the Four Bases of Power the Five Faculties the Five Strengths the Seven Factors for Awakening and the Noble Eightfold PathToward the end of his life the Buddha stated several times that as long as the teachings in this list were remembered and put into practice his message would endureThe Buddha himself described the Wings to Awakening as being what was most worth mastering and passing along to othersThe material gathered in this anthology consists of more than newly translated passages from the suttas along with extensive commentary to help the reader grasp their full meaning and their relation to the practice of meditationThis volume is thus both a treasurehouse of important passages from the Canon covering the key points of the Buddhas teachings as well as a practical manual to help the serious meditation student navigate through some of the most fundamental and profound points of DhammaThe Jataka one of the books in the Khuddaka Nikaya contains stories the Buddha told of his previous lifetimes as an aspiring BodhisattaThe Jataka stories are classic Buddhist morality tales often witty and filled with a host of colorful characters clever monkeys wise elephants brave princes wicked ogres and the occasional benign tree spiritAlthough they have sometimes been compared to the Wests Grimms fairy tales they are not simply amusing diversions from serious Dhamma literatureUnlike Grimms whose moral lessons are often ambiguous and occasionally even downright sinister the Jataka tales are replete with important lessons woven from the unmistakable threads of heightened virtue and liberating wisdom twin hallmarks of the Buddhas legacy of transcendent freedomIn this series the authors have breathed new life into Cowells classic compilation of th ctranslations of the Jataka by adapting them into lively English for a contemporary audienceThe clarity of the retellings coupled with the authors selection of the stories themselves makes this series a valuable introduction to this important body of Theravada canonical literatureThese retellings will appeal not only to experienced students of Buddhism but also to parents looking for engaging stories of upright morality to share with an inquisitive young childThe Sri Lanka Tripitaka Project is a public domain electronic version of the Pali CanonIt is

the original SLTP files to improve compatibility with the rest of the websiteIn the notes that follow first   means the first occurrence of page number was changed to The four noble truths are the most basic expression of the Buddhas teachingAs VenSariputta once said they encompass the entire teaching just as the footprint of an elephant can encompass the footprints of all other footed beings on earthThese four truths are best understood not as beliefs but as categories of experienceThey offer an alternative to the ordinary way we categorize what we can know and describe in terms of menot me and beingnot beingThese ordinary categories create trouble for the attempt to maintain full being for ones sense of me is a stressful effort doomed to failure in that all of the components of that me are inconstant stressful and thus not worthy of identifying as me or mineTo counter this problem the four noble truths drop ideas of menot me and beingnot being and replace them with two sets of variables cause and effect skillful and unskillfulIn other words there is the truth of stress and suffering the truth of the origination of stress the truth of the cessation of stress and the truth of the path to the cessation of stressEach of these truths entails a duty stress is to be comprehended the origination of stress abandoned the cessation of stress realized and the path to the cessation of stress developedWhen all of these duties have been fully performed the mind gains total releaseMany people have charged Buddhism with being pessimistic because the four truths start out with stress and suffering but this charge misses the fact that the first truth is part of a strategy of diagnosis and therapy focusing on the basic problem in life so as to offer a solution to itThus the Buddha was like a doctor focusing on the disease he wanted to cureCharging him with pessimism is like charging a doctor with pessimism when he asks Where does it hurt The total cure the Buddha promised as a result of his course of therapy shows that in actuality he was much less pessimistic than the vast majority of the world for whom wisdom means accepting the bad things in life with the good assuming that there is no chance in this life for unalloyed happinessThe Buddha was an extremely demanding person unwilling to bend to this supposed wisdom or to rest with anything less than absolute happinessHis course of therapy points to the fact that such a happiness is possible and can be attained through our own effortsAnother charge often leveled at Buddhism is that its focus is narrow aiming only at the issue of stress and pain and ignoring the larger or more uplifting issues of spiritual lifeThis again misses the thrust of the Buddhas cure for the ills of the heart and mindOne of the most important insights leading up to the Buddhas Awakening was his realization that the act of comprehending pain lay at the essence of the spiritual questIn trying to comprehend pain one begins to delve into the nonverbal subconscious levels of the mind bringing to light many illformed and hidden processes of which one was previously unawareIn this sense pain is like a watering hole where all the animals in the forest  all the minds subconscious tendencies  will eventually come to drinkJust as a naturalist who wants to make a survey of the wildlife in a particular area can simply station himself near a watering hole in the same way a meditator who wants to understand the mind can simply keep watch right at pain in order to see what subconscious reactions will appearThus the act of trying to comprehend pain leads not only to an improved understanding of pain itself but also to an increased awareness of the most basic processes at work in the mindAs one fully comprehends pain one gains a full comprehension of other spiritual issues as well realizing which questions were worth asking and which ones werent at the same time gaining answers to the first set of questions and learning how to put the second set asideThus the study of the four noble truths is aimed first at understanding these four categories and then at applying them to experience so that one may act properly toward each of the categories and thus attain the highest most total happiness possibleThe material in this study guide starts with a basic exercise in categorizing ones actions in terms of the variables at the heart of the four noble truths cause and effect and skillful and unskillfulIt then builds on this understanding by discussing the role of the four noble truths in the course of the practice and then analyzing in detail each of the truths together with the duty appropriate to eachFurther related readings can be found in the book The Wings to AwakeningThe Buddha What do you think Rahula What is a mirror forRahula For reflection sirThe Buddha In the same way Rahula bodily acts verbal acts  mental acts are to be done with repeated reflectionWhenever you want to perform a bodily act you should reflect on it This bodily act I want to perform  would it lead to selfaffliction to the affliction of others or to bothIs it an unskillful bodily act with painful consequences painful results If on reflection you know that it would lead to selfaffliction to the affliction of others or to both it would be an unskillful bodily act with painful consequences painful results then any bodily act of that sort is absolutely unfit for you to doBut if on reflection you know that it would not cause affliction it would be a skillful bodily act with happy consequences happy results then any bodily act of that sort is fit for you to doWhile you are performing a bodily act you should reflect on it This bodily act I am doing  is it leading to selfaffliction to the affliction of others or to bothIs it an unskillful bodily act with painful consequences painful results If on reflection you know that it is leading to selfaffliction to affliction of others or both you should give it upBut if on reflection you know that it is not you may continue with itHaving performed a bodily act you should reflect on it If on reflection you know that it led to selfaffliction to the affliction of others or to both it was an unskillful bodily act with painful consequences painful results then you should confess it reveal it lay it open to the Teacher or to a knowledgeable companion in the holy lifeHaving confessed it you should exercise restraint in the futureBut if on reflection you know that it did not lead to affliction it was a skillful bodily act with happy consequences happy results then you should stay mentally refreshed  joyful training day  night in skillful mental qualitiesHaving performed a mental act you should reflect on it If on reflection you know that it led to selfaffliction to the affliction of others or to both it was an unskillful mental act with painful consequences painful results then you should feel horrified humiliated  disgusted with itFeeling horrified you should exercise restraint in the futureBut if on reflection you know that it did not lead to affliction it was a skillful mental act with happy consequences happy results then you should stay mentally refreshed  joyful training day  night in skillful mental qualitiesRahula all the brahmans  contemplatives in the course of the past who purified their bodily acts verbal acts  mental acts did it through repeated reflection on their bodily acts verbal acts  mental acts in just this wayAll the brahmans  contemplatives in the course of the future All the brahmans  contemplatives at present who purify their bodily acts verbal acts  mental acts do it through repeated reflection on their bodily acts verbal acts  mental acts in just this wayAnd so Rahula you should train yourself I will purify my bodily acts through repeated reflectionI will purify my verbal acts through repeated reflectionI will purify my mental acts through repeated reflection Thats how you should train yourselfThat is what the Blessed One saidGratified VenRahula delighted in the Blessed Ones wordsOnce the Blessed One was staying at Kosambi in the Simsapa tree groveThen picking up a few Simsapa leaves with his hand he asked the monks What do you think monks Which are more numerous the few Simsapa leaves in my hand or those overhead in the Simsapa groveThe leaves in the hand of the Blessed One are few in number lordThose overhead in the grove are far more numerousIn the same way monks those things that I have known with direct knowledge but have not taught are far more numerous than the things I have taughtAnd why havent I taught themBecause they are not connected with the goal do not relate to the rudiments of the holy life and do not lead to disenchantment to dispassion to cessation to calm to direct knowledge to selfawakening to UnbindingThat is why I have not taught themAnd what have I taughtThis is stress This is the origination of stress This is the cessation of stress This is the path of practice leading to the cessation of stress This is what I have taughtAnd why have I taught these thingsBecause they are connected with the goal relate to the rudiments of the holy life and lead to disenchantment to dispassion to cessation to calm to direct knowledge to selfawakening to UnbindingThis is why I have taught themTherefore your duty is the contemplation This is stress This is the origination of stress This is the cessation of stress This is the path of practice leading to the cessation of stressStress should be knownThe cause by which stress comes into play should be knownThe diversity in stress should be knownThe result of stress should be knownThe cessation of stress should be knownThe path of practice for the cessation of stress should be known Thus it has been saidWhy was it saidBirth is stressful aging is stressful death is stressful sorrow lamentation pain distress  despair are stressful association with what is not loved is stressful separation from what is loved is stressful not getting what is wanted is stressfulIn short the five clingingaggregates are stressfulAnd what is the cause by which stress comes into playCraving is the cause by which stress comes into playAnd what is the diversity in stressThere is major stress  minor slowly fading  quickly fadingThis is called the diversity in stressAnd what is the result of stressThere are some cases in which a person overcome with pain his mind exhausted grieves mourns laments beats his breast  becomes bewilderedOr one overcome with pain his mind exhausted comes to search outside Who knows a way or two to stop this pain I tell you monks that stress results either in bewilderment or in searchAnd what is the cessation of stressThe cessation of craving is the cessation of stress and just this noble eightfold path is the path of practice leading to the cessation of stress right view right resolve right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness right concentrationNow when a disciple of the noble ones discerns stress in this way the cause by which stress comes into play in this way the diversity of stress in this way the result of stress in this way the cessation of stress in this way  the path of practice leading to the cessation of stress in this way then he discerns this penetrative holy life as the cessation of stressStress should be knownThe cause by which stress comes into play The variations in stress The result of stress The cessation of stress The path of practice for the cessation of stress should be experienced Thus it has been said and this is why it was saidVision arose clear knowing arose discernment arose knowledge arose illumination arose within me with regard to things never heard before This is the noble truth of stress This noble truth of stress is to be comprehended This noble truth of stress has been comprehended This is the noble truth of the origination of stress This noble truth of the origination of stress is to be abandoned This noble truth of the origination of stress has been abandoned This is the noble truth of the cessation of stress This noble truth of the cessation of stress is to be realized This noble truth of the cessation of stress has been realized This is the noble truth of the path of practice leading to the cessation of stress This noble truth of the path of practice leading to the cessation of stress is to be developed This noble truth of the path of practice leading to the cessation of stress has been developedAnd monks as long as this knowledge  vision of mine  with its three rounds  twelve permutations concerning these four noble truths as they actually are  was not pure I did not claim to have directly awakened to the unexcelled right selfawakening But as soon as this knowledge  vision of mine  with its three rounds  twelve permutations concerning these four noble truths as they actually are  was truly pure only then did I claim to have directly awakened to the unexcelled right selfawakening The knowledge  vision arose in me Unprovoked is my releaseThis is the last birthThere is now no further becomingSariputta There are these

form watered with delight it would exhibit growth increase  developmentShould consciousness when standing stand attached to feeling to perception to fabrications it would exhibit growth increase  developmentWere someone to say I will describe a coming a going a passing away an arising a growth an increase or a development of consciousness apart from form from feeling from perception from fabrications that would be impossibleIf a monk abandons passion for the property of form feeling perception fabrications consciousness then owing to the abandoning of passion the support is cut off and consciousness is unestablishedConsciousness thus unestablished undeveloped not performing any function is releasedOwing to its release it stays firmOwing to its staying firm it is contentedOwing to its contentment it is not agitatedNot agitated he is totally unbound right within himselfHe discerns that Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task doneThere is nothing further for this worldThere are these four nutriments for the establishing of beings or for the support of those in search of a place to be bornWhat fourPhysical food gross or refined contact as the second consciousness the third and intellectual intention the fourthThese are the four nutriments for the establishing of beings or for the support of those in search of a place to be bornWhere there is passion delight  craving for the nutriment of physical food consciousness lands there and growsWhere consciousness lands and grows name  form alightWhere name  form alight there is the growth of fabricationsWhere there is the growth of fabrications there is the production of renewed becoming in the futureWhere there is the production of renewed becoming in the future there is future birth aging  death together I tell you with sorrow affliction  despairJust as  when there is dye lac yellow orpiment indigo or crimson  a dyer or painter would paint the picture of a woman or a man complete in all its parts on a wellpolished panel or wall or on a piece of cloth in the same way where there is passion delight  craving for the nutriment of physical food consciousness lands there  grows together I tell you with sorrow affliction  despairWhere there is no passion for physical nutriment where there is no delight no craving consciousness does not land there or grow Name  form do not alight There is no growth of fabrications There is no production of renewed becoming in the futureWhere there is no production of renewed becoming in the future there is no future birth aging  deathThat I tell you has no sorrow affliction or despairJust as if there were a roofed house or a roofed hall having windows on the north the south or the eastWhen the sun rises and a ray has entered by way of the window where does it landOn the western wall lordAnd if there is no western wallOn the ground lordAnd if there is no groundOn the water lordAnd if there is no waterIt does not land lordIn the same way where there is no passion for physical nutriment consciousness does not land or grow That I tell you has no sorrow affliction or despairConsciousness without feature without end luminous all around Here water earth fire  wind have no footingHere long  short coarse  fine fair  foul name  form without remnant are brought to an endWith the cessation of consciousness each is here brought to an endThere is that dimension where there is neither earth nor water nor fire nor wind neither dimension of the infinitude of space nor dimension of the infinitude of consciousness nor dimension of nothingness nor dimension of neither perception nor nonperception neither this world nor the next world nor sun nor moonAnd there I say there is neither coming nor going nor staying neither passing away nor arising unestablished unevolving without supportThis just this is the end of stressThere is monks an unborn  unbecome  unmade  unfabricatedIf there were not that unborn  unbecome  unmade  unfabricated there would not be the case that emancipation from the born  become  made  fabricated would be discernedBut precisely because there is an unborn  unbecome  unmade  unfabricated emancipation from the born  become  made  fabricated is discernedOne who is dependent has waveringOne who is independent has no waveringThere being no wavering there is calmThere being calm there is no desireThere being no desire there is no coming or goingThere being no coming or going there is no passing away or arisingThere being no passing away or arising there is neither a here

having bowed down to the Blessed One sat to one sideAs he was sitting there VenAnanda said to the Blessed One This is half of the holy life lord having admirable people as friends companions  colleaguesDont say that AnandaDont say thatHaving admirable people as friends companions  colleagues is actually the whole of the holy lifeWhen a monk has admirable people as friends companions  colleagues he can be expected to develop  pursue the noble eightfold pathAnd how does a monk who has admirable people as friends companions  colleagues develop  pursue the noble eightfold pathThere is the case where a monk develops right view dependent on seclusion dependent on dispassion dependent on cessation resulting in relinquishmentHe develops right resolve right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness right concentration dependent on seclusion dependent on dispassion dependent on cessation resulting in relinquishmentThis is how a monk who has admirable people as friends companions  colleagues develops  pursues the noble eightfold pathAnd through this line of reasoning one may know how having admirable people as friends companions  colleagues is actually the whole of the holy life It is in dependence on me as an admirable friend that beings subject to birth have gained release from birth that beings subject to aging have gained release from aging that beings subject to death have gained release from death that beings subject to sorrow lamentation pain distress  despair have gained release from sorrow lamentation pain distress  despairIt is through this line of reasoning that one may know how having admirable people as friends companions  colleagues is actually the whole of the holy lifeMore on Right ViewAnd how is right view the forerunnerOne discerns wrong view as wrong viewOne discerns right view as right viewThis is ones right viewAnd what is wrong viewThere is nothing given nothing offered nothing sacrificedThere is no fruit or result of good or bad actionsThere is no this world no next world no mother no father no spontaneously reborn beings no brahmans or contemplatives who faring rightly  practicing rightly proclaim this world  the next after having directly known  realized it for themselves This is wrong viewAnd what is right viewRight view I tell you is of two sorts There is right view with fermentations siding with merit resulting in the paraphernalia and there is noble right view free from fermentations transcendent a factor of the pathAnd what is the right view that has fermentations sides with merit  results in paraphernaliaThere is what is given what is offered what is sacrificedThere are fruits  results of good  bad actionsThere is this world  the next worldThere is mother  fatherThere are spontaneously reborn beings there are brahmans  contemplatives who faring rightly  practicing rightly proclaim this world  the next after having directly known  realized it for themselves This is the right view that has fermentations sides with merit  results in paraphernaliaAnd what is the right view that is free from fermentations transcendent a factor of the pathThe discernment the faculty of discernment the strength of discernment analysis of qualities as a factor for Awakening the path factor of right view in one developing the noble path whose mind is noble whose mind is free from fermentations who is fully possessed of the noble pathThis is the right view that is free from fermentations transcendent a factor of the pathOne tries to abandon wrong view  to enter into right view This is ones right effortOne is mindful to abandon wrong view  to enter  remain in right view This is ones right mindfulnessThus these three qualities  right view right effort  right mindfulness  run  circle around right viewMore on Right Action  Right SpeechHaving thus gone forth following the training  way of life of the monks abandoning the taking of life he abstains from the taking of lifeHe dwells with his rod laid down his knife laid down scrupulous kind compassionate for the welfare of all living beingsAbandoning the taking of what is not given he abstains from taking what is not givenHe takes only what is given accepts only what is given lives not by stealth but by means of a self that has become pureAbandoning uncelibacy he lives a celibate life aloof refraining from the sexual act that is the villagers wayAbandoning false speech he abstains from false speechHe speaks the truth holds to the truth is firm reliable no deceiver of the worldAbandoning divisive speech he abstains from divisive speechWhat he has heard here he does not tell there to break those people apart from the people hereWhat he has heard there he does not tell here to break these people apart from the people thereThus reconciling those who have broken apart or cementing those who are united he loves concord delights in concord enjoys concord speaks things that create concordAbandoning abusive speech he abstains from abusive speechHe speaks words that are soothing to the ear that are affectionate that go to the heart that are polite appealing  pleasing to people at

involved with those who are protected by their mothers their fathers their brothers their sisters their relatives or their Dhamma those with husbands those who entail punishments or even those crowned with flowers by another manAbandoning false speech he abstains from false speechWhen he has been called to a town meeting a group meeting a gathering of his relatives his guild or of the royalty if he is asked as a witness Come  tell good man what you know If he doesnt know he says I dont know If he does know he says I know If he hasnt seen he says I havent seen If he has seen he says I have seen

of sorrow  lamentation for the disappearance of pain  distress for the attainment of the right method  for the realization of Unbinding  in other words the four frames of referenceWhat fourThere is the case where a monk remains focused on the body in  of itself  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the worldHe remains focused on feelings mind mental qualities in  of themselves  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the worldAnd how is does the monk remain focused on the body in  of itselfThere is the case of a monk who having gone to the wilderness to the shade of a tree or to an empty building sits down folding his legs crosswise holding his body erect and setting mindfulness to the foreAlways mindful he breathes in mindful he breathes outBreathing in long he discerns I am breathing in long or breathing out long he discerns I am breathing out long Or breathing in short he discerns I am breathing in short or breathing out short he discerns I am breathing out short He trains himself I will breathe in sensitive to the entire body He trains himself I will breathe out sensitive to the entire body He trains himself I will breathe in calming bodily fabrication He trains himself I will breathe out calming bodily fabrication Just as a skilled turner or his apprentice when making a long turn discerns I am making a long turn or when making a short turn discerns I am making a short turn in the same way the monk when breathing in long discerns I am breathing in long or breathing out long he discerns I am breathing out long He trains himself I will breathe in calming bodily fabrication He trains himself I will breathe out calming bodily fabricationIn this way he remains focused internally on the body in  of itself or externally on the body in  of itself or both internally  externally on the body in  of itselfOr he remains focused on the phenomenon of origination with regard to the body on the phenomenon of passing away with regard to the body or on the phenomenon of origination  passing away with regard to the bodyOr his mindfulness that There is a body is maintained to the extent of knowledge  remembranceAnd he remains unsustained by anything in the worldThis is how a monk remains focused on the body in  of itselfFurthermore when walking the monk discerns I am walking When standing he discerns I am standing When sitting he discerns I am sitting When lying down he discerns I am lying down Or however his body is disposed that is how he discerns itIn this way he remains focused internally on the body in  of itself or focused externally unsustained by anything in the worldThis is how a monk remains focused on the body in  of itselfFurthermore when going forward  returning he makes himself fully alert when looking toward  looking away when bending  extending his limbs when carrying his outer cloak his upper robe  his bowl when eating drinking chewing  savoring

various kinds of grain  wheat rice mung beans kidney beans sesame seeds husked rice  and a man with good eyesight pouring it out were to reflect This is wheatThis is riceThese are mung beansThese are kidney beansThese are sesame seedsThis is husked rice in the same way monks a monk reflects on this very body from the soles of the feet on up from the crown of the head on down surrounded by skin and full of various kinds of unclean things In this body there are head hairs body hairs nails teeth skin flesh tendons bones bone marrow kidneys heart liver pleura spleen lungs large intestines small

cutting it up into pieces the monk contemplates this very body  however it stands however it is disposed  in terms of properties In this body there is the earth property the liquid property the heat property  the wind propertyIn this way he remains focused internally on the body in  of itself or focused externally unsustained by anything in the worldThis is how a monk remains focused on the body in  of itselfFurthermore as if he were to see a corpse cast away in a charnel ground  one day two days three days dead  bloated livid  festering he applies it to this very body This body too Such is

the attainment of the right method  for the realization of Unbinding  in other words the four frames of reference Thus was it said and in reference to this was it saidBreath MeditationAnd how is mindfulness of inout breathing developed  pursued so as to bring the four frames of reference to their culminationOn whatever occasion a monk breathing in long discerns that he is breathing in long or breathing out long discerns that he is breathing out long or breathing in short discerns that he is breathing in short or breathing out short discerns that he is breathing out short trains himself to breathe in  out sensitive to the entire body trains himself to breathe in  out calming bodily fabrications On that occasion monks the monk remains focused on the body in  of itself  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the worldI tell you monks that this  the inout breath  is classed as a body among bodies which is why the monk on that occasion remains focused on the body in  of itself  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the worldOn whatever occasion a monk trains himself to breathe in  out sensitive to rapture trains himself to breathe in  out sensitive to pleasure trains himself to breathe in  out sensitive to mental fabrications trains himself to breathe in  out calming mental fabrications On that occasion the monk remains focused on feelings in  of themselves  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the worldI tell you monks that this  careful attention to inout breaths  is classed as a feeling among feelings which is why the monk on that occasion remains focused on feelings in  of themselves  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the worldOn whatever occasion a monk trains himself to breathe in  out sensitive to the mind trains himself to breathe in  out satisfying the mind trains himself to breathe in  out steadying the mind trains himself to breathe in  out releasing the mind On that occasion the monk remains focused on the mind in  of itself  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the worldI dont say that there is mindfulness of inout breathing in one of confused mindfulness and no presence of mind which is why the monk on that occasion remains focused on the mind in  of itself  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the worldOn whatever occasion a monk trains himself to breathe in  out focusing on inconstancy trains himself to breathe in  out focusing on dispassion trains himself to breathe in  out focusing on cessation trains himself to breathe in  out focusing on relinquishment On that occasion the monk remains focused on mental

with equanimity which is why the monk on that occasion remains focused on mental qualities in  of themselves  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the worldThis is how mindfulness of inout breathing is developed  pursued so as to bring the four frames of reference to their culminationMindfulness  ConcentrationHaving abandoned the five hindrances  imperfections of awareness that weaken discernment  the monk remains focused on the body in  of itself  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the worldHe remains focused on feelings mind mental qualities in  of themselves  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the worldJust as if an elephant trainer were to plant a large post in the ground and were to bind a forest elephant to it by the neck in order to overcome its forest habits overcome its forest memories  resolves overcome its distraction fatigue  fever over leaving the forest to make it delight in the town and to inculcate in it habits congenial to human beingsIn the same way these four frames of reference are bindings for the awareness of the disciple of the noble ones for the sake of overcoming his household habits overcoming his household memories  resolves overcoming his distraction fatigue  fever over leaving the household life for the attainment of the right method and the realization of UnbindingThen the Tathagata trains him further Come monk remain focused on the body in  of itself but do not think any thoughts connected with the bodyRemain focused on feelings in

concentration what qualities are its themes what qualities are its requisites and what is its developmentSister Dhammadinna Singleness of mind is concentration the four frames of reference are its themes the four right exertions are its requisites and any cultivation development  pursuit of these qualities is its developmentThese are the four developments of concentrationWhat fourThere is the development of concentration that when developed  pursued leads to a pleasant abiding in the here  nowThere is the development of concentration that leads to the attainment of knowledge  visionThere is the development of concentration that leads to mindfulness  alertnessThere is the development of concentration that when developed  pursued leads to the ending of the effluentsAnd what is the development of concentration that when developed  pursued leads to a pleasant abiding in the here  nowThere is the case where a monk  quite withdrawn from sensuality withdrawn from unskillful

perception of daytime wellfixed  well in handDay is the same as night night is the same as dayBy means of an awareness open  unhampered he develops a brightened mindThis is the development of concentration that leads to the attainment of knowledge  visionAnd what is the development of concentration that leads to mindfulness  alertnessThere is the case where a monk is conscious of feelings as they arise as they persist as they go totally to their endHe is conscious of perceptions as they arise as they persist as they go totally to their endHe is conscious of thoughts as they arise as they persist as they go totally to their endThis is the development of concentration that leads to mindfulness  alertnessAnd what is the development of concentration that leads to the ending of the effluentsThere is the case where a monk remains focused on arising  falling away with reference to the five clingingaggregates Such is form such its origination such its passing awaySuch is feeling Such is perception Such are fabrications Such is consciousness such its origination such its passing away This is the development of concentration that leads to the ending of the effluentsThese are the four developments of concentrationNow what monks is the fivefactored noble right concentrationThere is the case where a monk  quite withdrawn from sensuality withdrawn from unskillful qualities  enters  remains in the first jhana rapture  pleasure born from withdrawal accompanied by directed thought  evaluationHe permeates  pervades suffuses  fills this very body with the rapture  pleasure

basin and knead it together sprinkling it again  again with water so that his ball of bath powder  saturated moistureladen permeated within  without  would nevertheless not drip even so monks the monk permeates this very body with the rapture  pleasure born of withdrawalThere is nothing of his entire body unpervaded by rapture  pleasure born from withdrawalThis is the first development of the fivefactored noble right concentrationFurthermore with the stilling of directed thoughts  evaluations he enters  remains in the second jhana rapture  pleasure born of composure onepointedness of

body unpervaded by rapture  pleasure born of composureJust like a lake with springwater welling up from within having no inflow from east west north or south and with the skies periodically supplying abundant showers so that the cool fount of water welling up from within the lake would permeate  pervade suffuse  fill it with cool waters there being no part of the lake unpervaded by the cool waters even so monks the monk permeates this very body with the rapture  pleasure born of composureThere is nothing of his entire body unpervaded by rapture  pleasure born of composureThis is the second development of the fivefactored noble right concentrationAnd furthermore with the fading of rapture he remains equanimous mindful  alert and senses pleasure with the bodyHe enters  remains in the third jhana of which the Noble Ones declare Equanimous  mindful he has a pleasant abiding He permeates  pervades suffuses  fills this very body with the pleasure divested of rapture so that there is nothing of his entire body unpervaded with pleasure divested of raptureJust as in a blue white or redlotus pond there may be some of the blue white or red lotuses which born  growing in the water stay immersed in the water and flourish without standing up out of the water so that they are permeated  pervaded suffused  filled with cool water from their roots to their tips and nothing of those blue white or red lotuses would be unpervaded with cool water even so monks the monk permeates this very body with the pleasure divested of raptureThere is nothing of his entire body unpervaded with pleasure divested of raptureThis is the third development of the fivefactored noble right concentrationAnd furthermore with the abandoning of pleasure  stress  as with the earlier disappearance of elation  distress  he enters  remains in the fourth jhana purity of equanimity  mindfulness neitherpleasurenorpainHe sits permeating the body with a pure bright awareness so that there is nothing of his entire body unpervaded by pure bright awarenessJust as if a man were sitting covered from head to foot with a white cloth so that there would be no part of his body to which the white cloth did not extend even so monks the monk sits permeating his body with a pure bright awarenessThere is nothing of his entire body unpervaded by pure bright awarenessThis is the fourth development of the fivefactored noble right concentrationAnd furthermore the monk has his theme of reflection well in hand well attended to wellpondered wellpenetrated by means of discernmentJust as if one person were to reflect on another or a standing person were to reflect on a sitting person or a sitting person were to reflect on a person lying down even so monks the monk has his theme of reflection well in hand well attended to wellpondered wellpenetrated by means of discernmentThis is the fifth development of the fivefactored noble right concentrationWhen a monk has developed  pursued the fivefactored noble right concentration in this way then whichever of the six higher knowledges he turns his mind to know  realize he can witness them for himself whenever there is an openingSuppose that there were a water jar set on a stand brimful of water so that a crow could drink from itIf a strong man were to tip it in any way at all would water spill outYes lordIn the same way when a monk has developed  pursued the fivefactored noble right concentration in this way then whichever of the six higher knowledges he turns his mind to know  realize he can witness them for himself whenever there is an openingSuppose there were a rectangular water tank  set on level round bounded by dykes  brimful of water so that a crow could drink from itIf a strong man were to loosen the dykes anywhere at all would water spill outYes lord Suppose there were a chariot on level ground at four crossroads harnessed to thoroughbreds waiting with whips lying ready so that a skilled driver a trainer of tamable horses might mount and  taking the reins with his left hand and the whip with his right  drive out  back to whatever place and by whichever road he liked in the same way when a monk has developed  pursued the fivefactored noble right concentration in this way then whichever of the six higher knowledges he turns his mind to know  realize he can witness them for himself whenever there is an openingConcentration  DiscernmentSuppose that an archer or archers apprentice were to practice on a straw man or mound of clay so that after a while he would become able to shoot long distances to fire accurate shots in rapid succession  to pierce great massesIn the same way there is the case where a monk enters  remains in the first jhana rapture  pleasure born of withdrawal accompanied by directed thought  evaluationHe regards whatever phenomena there that are connected with form feeling perception fabrications  consciousness as inconstant stressful a disease a cancer an arrow painful an affliction alien a dissolution an emptiness notselfHe turns his mind away from those phenomena and having done so inclines his mind to the quality of deathlessness This is peace this is exquisite  the resolution of all fabrications the relinquishment of all mental acquisitions the passing away of craving dispassion cessation UnbindingHaving attained this point he reaches the ending of the mental fermentationsOr if not then  through passion  delight for this very quality and from the total wasting away of the first five of the Fetters  he is due to be reborn there to be totally unbound never again to return from that world Discernment  ReleaseWith his mind thus concentrated purified  bright the monk directs it to the knowledge of the ending of the mental fermentationsJust as if there were a pool of water in a mountain glen  clear limpid  unsullied  where a man with good eyesight standing on the bank could see shells gravel  pebbles and also shoals of fish swimming about  resting and it would occur to him This pool of water is clear limpid  unsulliedHere are these shells gravel  pebbles and also these shoals of fish swimming about  resting In the same way the monk discerns as it has come to be that This is stress This is the origination of stress This is the cessation of stress This is the way leading to the cessation of stress These are mental fermentations This is the origination of fermentations This is the cessation of fermentations This is the way leading to the cessation of fermentations His heart thus knowing thus seeing is released from the fermentations of sensuality becoming  ignoranceWith release there is the knowledge Released He discerns that Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task doneThere is nothing further for this world This too is a reward of the contemplative life visible here  now more excellent than the previous ones and more sublimeAnd as for another visible fruit of the contemplative life higher  more sublime than this there is noneThe present work offers a translation of the Itivuttaka a collection of short discourses of the Buddha in both prose and verseThe text belongs to the Pali canon of the Theravada school being placed between the Udana and the Sutta NipataIt was previously translated by FWoodward and published together with his translation of the Udana in Minor Anthologies of the Pali Canon VolIIAccording to the commentarial tradition the suttas or discourses of the Itivuttaka were collected by the woman laydisciple Khujjuttara from sermons given by the Buddha while he was staying at KosambiKhujjuttara was a servant of Samavati the consort of King UdenaShe had become a streamenterer after meeting the Buddha and subsequently converted the women of the palace headed by Samavati to the teachingShe used to go regularly to listen to the Buddha and then later repeated what she had heard to the other womenThe collection of these sayings became the ItivuttakaIt is said that the emphatic statements at the beginning and end of each of the suttas reproduced here only in the first and last were made by Khujjuttara to stress that they were the Buddhas words and not her ownWhether or not this story is true the Itivuttaka is the only book in the Pali canon that introduces and concludes its suttas in this fashion and it is from the opening statement that the title is derived This was said by the Lord so I heard  hence Itivuttaka The Sowassaid or SayingsThese Sayings are grouped into four unequal sections arranged like the Anguttara Nikaya according to the number of items they contain from one to fourBesides these four sections  The Ones The Twos The Threes and The Fours  the text is further subdivided into vaggas groups of roughly ten suttasBut to simplify the presentation in this translation these subgroupings have been ignoredOnly the four main sections have been retained and the suttas numbered from to as in the PTS editionA number of the suttas and verses are also found in other parts of the Sutta Pitaka especially the Anguttara Nikaya but many are unique to this collectionIn translating the Itivuttaka I have attempted to follow the text as closely as possible and to produce an exact and literal renditionWith the verses however while remaining faithful to the meaning I occasionally found it necessary to depart from the syntax of the PaliAlthough I did not attempt to produce a metrical translation by transposing lines and words and controlling the number of syllables in the line I aimed at producing a readable and rhythmic English rendering of the original Pali verseI have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Sāvatthī at the Eastern Monastery the palace of Migāras motherAnd on that occasion the Blessed One  it being the observance day  was sitting surrounded by the community of monksThen Vennanda  when the night was far advanced at the end of the first watch  got up from his seat arranged his robe over one shoulder stood facing the Blessed One paying homage with his hands placed palmtopalm over his heart and said to him Lord the night is far advancedThe first watch has endedThe community of monks has been sitting here longMay the Blessed One recite the Pāṭimokkha to them When this was said the Blessed One remained silentThen a second time when the night was far advanced at the end of the middle watch Vennanda got up from his seat arranged his robe over one shoulder stood facing the Blessed One paying homage with his hands placed palmtopalm over his heart and said to him Lord the night is far advancedThe second watch has endedThe community of monks has been sitting here longMay the Blessed One recite the Pāṭimokkha to them When this was said the Blessed One remained silentThen a third time when the night was far advanced at the end of the last watch as dawn was approaching and the face of the night was beaming Vennanda got up from his seat arranged his robe over one shoulder stood facing the Blessed One paying homage with his hands placed palmtopalm over his heart and said to him Lord the night is far advancedThe last watch has endedDawn is approaching and the face of the night is beamingThe community of monks has been sitting here longMay the Blessed One recite the Pāṭimokkha to the community of monksnanda the gathering isnt pureThen the thought occurred to VenMahā Moggallāna In reference to which individual did the Blessed One just now say nanda the gathering isnt pure So he directed his mind encompassing with his awareness the awareness of the entire community of monksHe saw that individual  unprincipled evil unclean and suspect in his undertakings hidden in his actions not a contemplative though claiming to be one not leading the holy life though claiming to do so inwardly rotten oozing with desire filthy by nature  sitting in the midst of the community of monksOn seeing him he got up went over to that individual and on reaching him said Get up friendYou have been seen by the Blessed OneYou have no affiliation with the community of monks Then the individual remained silentA second time A third time VenMahā Moggallāna said Get up friendYou have been seen by the Blessed OneYou have no affiliation with the community of monks And for a third time the individual remained silentThen VenMahā Moggallāna grabbing that individual by the arm having expelled him through the outside door of the porch and locking the bolt approached the Blessed One and on arrival said I have expelled that individual lordThe gathering is now pureLet the Blessed One recite the Pāṭimokkha to the community of monksIsnt it amazing MoggallānaIsnt it astounding how that worthless man waited until he was grabbed by the arm Then the Blessed One addressed the monks From now on I will no longer perform the observance or recite the PāṭimokkhaFrom now on you alone monks will perform the observance and recite the PāṭimokkhaIt is impossible it cannot happen that a Tathāgata would perform the observance or recite the Pāṭimokkha with an impure gatheringMonks there are these eight amazing  astounding qualities of the ocean because of which as they see them

generate Pali diacriticsHere is a review of seven of themPali is a phonetic language with no written alphabet of its ownStudents of the language have therefore relied on their own native alphabets to read and write Pali ever since the st century BCE when Sri Lankan scribes first recorded the Tipitaka in the Sinhala alphabetBut when Europeans began to take an interest in South Asian languages in the th century they quickly discovered that their own roman alphabet was no match for the wide range of phonemes present in South Asian languagesEuropean scholars thus began representing the more problematic Pali phonemes by augmenting the roman alphabet with a system of letterpairs and diacritics including the macron dotover dotunder and tildeUntil well into the midth century Pali typefaces using these characters were used almost exclusively by specialty book publishers a scholars daytoday duties of transcribing translating and editing had to be laboriously carried out with typewriter pen and a steady hand with which to apply the diacriticsUnfortunately the first personal computers failed to address the typographic challenge of diacritics as they were designed around a very limited character set that was only barely able to accommodate the upper and lowercase roman letters ten digits and a modest sprinkling of punctuation marksThe extendedASCII set which soon followed offered a suite of additional special symbols including many required for northern and eastern European alphabetsBut still no macrons or dotundersIn the absence of a universally accepted computer representation of nonASCII characters students of nonEuropean languages were left to invent their own stopgap methodsThese range from giving ordinary punctuation marks doubleduty as standins for diacritics to designing special diacritic fonts and everything in betweenA good written phonetic representation of Pali  indeed of any language  using ones native alphabet as a starting point should aspire to each of the following idealsNo single method simultaneously realizes all of these goals no single method is best Your method of choice therefore depends both on your particular needs and on the typing printing and computing resources at your disposalIn what follows Ive singled out some of the more common strategies that Pali students have used in recent decades running the gamut from ignoring diacritics altogether to using Unicode fontsI evaluate the success of each strategy in achieving the abovementioned goals to help you decide which method best suits your needsThis is certainly the simplest methodBut the cost of that simplicity is heavy the irretrievable loss of crucial pronunciation detailsThis is the method often used here at Access to InsightCapitalized letters represent letters with an accompanying diacriticThe method is simple but it has ambiguities how for example would you distinguish between the palatal and guttural nIn the Velthuis scheme two basic rules are observedOf the plainASCII methods this one is the most precise as it carefully preserves the significance of each special characterTo the uninitiated however the sight of all those doubled vowels and misplaced periods is utterly bewildering perhaps leaving them to wonder if someones keyboard is brokenHTML has access to the extended ASCII character set which includes many accented nonEnglish European vowels some of which can serve as reasonable standins for the long Pali vowelsThe palatal n is straightforward ñWhatever type of accent you adopt use it consistentlyThis method attempts to clear up the stuttering of Method s doubled vowels by using a little HTMLFor highquality print projects nothing beats a welldesigned Pali fontFor an extensive review of available Pali and Sanskrit fonts see Transliteration and Devanagari Fonts for Sanskrit by Ulrich StiehlThe Association for Insight Meditations Pali Font Resources page offers several ANSI and Unicode fonts suitable for working with PaliUnicode has emerged in recent years as the international standard for representing characters from most of the worlds alphabetsAll the special characters we need for Pali transliteration may be found in Unicodes Latin ExtendedA and Latin Extended Additional code chartsThey can therefore be easily generated using HTML provided that your web browser uses a Unicodesavvy fontThere are many Unicode fonts available that contain the characters needed for PaliThe following table lists the HTML Unicode entities required to generate each of the special Pali charactersIf your web browser supports Unicode the characters appearing in the last column of the table should resemble those appearing the shaded columnIf they do not match then you may have to upgrade your web browser install Unicode fonts on your computer or bothFor details about configuring your computer and browser to use Unicode see the Unicode websiteI have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Sāvatthī at Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monasteryAnd on that occasion VenNanda  the Blessed Ones brother son of his maternal aunt  announced to a large number of monks I dont enjoy leading the holy life my friendsI cant keep up the holy lifeGiving up the training I will return to the common lifeThen a certain monk went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one sideAs he was sitting there he told the Blessed One Lord VenNanda  the Blessed Ones brother son of his maternal aunt  has announced to a large number of monks I dont enjoy leading the holy life my friendsI cant keep up the holy lifeGiving up the training I will return to the common life Then the Blessed One told a certain monk Come monkIn my name call Nanda saying The Teacher calls you friend Nanda Responding As you say lord to the Blessed One the monk went to VenNanda on arrival he said The Teacher calls you friend NandaResponding As you say my friend to the monk VenNanda went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one sideAs he was sitting there the Blessed One said to him Is it true Nanda that you have announced to a large number of monks I dont enjoy leading the holy life my friendsI cant keep up the holy lifeGiving up the training I will return to the common lifeYes lordBut why Nanda dont you enjoy leading the holy lifeWhy cant you keep up the holy lifeWhy giving up the training will you return to the common lifeLord as I was leaving home a Sakyan girl  the envy of the countryside  glanced up at me with her hair halfcombed and said Hurry back master Recollecting that I dont enjoy leading the holy lifeI cant keep up the holy lifeGiving up the training I will return to the common lifeThen taking VenNanda by the arm  as a strong man might flex his extended arm or extend his flexed arm  the Blessed One disappeared from Jetas Grove and reappeared among the devas of the heaven of the ThirtythreeNow on that occasion about dovefooted nymphs had come to wait upon Sakka the ruler of the devasThe Blessed One said to VenNanda Nanda do you see these dovefooted nymphsYes lordWhat do you think NandaWhich is lovelier better looking more charming the Sakyan girl the envy of the countryside or these dovefooted nymphsLord compared to these dovefooted nymphs the Sakyan girl the envy of the countryside is like a cauterized monkey with its ears  nose cut offShe doesnt countShes not even a small fractionTheres no comparisonThe dovefooted nymphs are lovelier better looking more charmingThen take joy NandaTake joyI am your guarantor for getting dovefooted nymphsIf the Blessed One is my guarantor for getting dovefooted nymphs I will enjoy leading the holy life under the Blessed OneThen taking VenNanda by the arm  as a strong man might flex his extended arm or extend his flexed arm  the Blessed One disappeared from among the devas of the heaven of the Thirtythree and reappeared at Jetas GroveThe monks heard They say that VenNanda  the Blessed Ones brother son of his maternal aunt  is leading the holy life for the sake of nymphsThey say that the Blessed One is his guarantor for getting dovefooted nymphsThen the monks who were companions of VenNanda went around addressing him as they would a hired hand  a person who had been bought Venerable Nanda they say has been hiredVenerable Nanda they say has been boughtHes leading the holy life for the sake of nymphsThe Blessed One is his guarantor for getting dovefooted nymphsThen VenNanda  humiliated ashamed  disgusted that the monks who were his companions were addressing him as they would a hired hand  a person who had been bought  went to dwell alone secluded heedful ardent  resoluteHe in no long time entered  remained in the supreme goal of the holy life for which clansmen rightly go forth from home into homelessness knowing  realizing it for himself right in the herenowHe knew Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task doneThere is nothing further for the sake of this world And thus VenNanda became another one of the arahantsThen a certain devatā in the far extreme of the night her extreme radiance lighting up the entirety of Jetas Grove approached the Blessed OneOn arrival having bowed down to him she stood to one sideAs she was standing there she said to the Blessed One Lord VenNanda  the Blessed Ones brother son of his maternal aunt  through the ending of the effluents has entered  remains in the effluentfree awarenessrelease  discernmentrelease directly knowing  realizing them for himself right in the herenow And within the Blessed One the knowledge arose Nanda through the ending of the effluents has entered  remains in the effluentfree awarenessrelease  discernmentrelease directly knowing  realizing them for himself right in the herenowThen when the night had passed VenNanda went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one sideAs he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One Lord about the Blessed Ones being my guarantor for getting dovefooted nymphs I hereby release the Blessed One from that promiseNanda having comprehended your awareness with my own awareness I realized that Nanda through the ending of the effluents has entered  remains in the effluentfree awarenessrelease  discernmentrelease directly knowing  realizing them for himself right in the herenow And a devatā informed me that VenNanda through the ending of the effluents has entered  remains in the effluentfree awarenessrelease  discernmentrelease directly knowing  realizing them for himself right in the herenow When your mind through lack of clinging was released from the effluents I was thereby released from that promiseThen on realizing the significance of that the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimedThe doctrine of kamma is one of the Buddhas central teachingsThere is a modern myth that he simply picked up his ideas on kamma from the worldview prevalent in his day and that they arent really integral to his messageNothing could be further from the truthEarly Buddhists often cited the Buddhas teaching on kamma as one of the prime teachings that set him apart from his contemporaries and a study of his teachings on kamma will show that they underlie everything else he taughtThe following readings from the Pali canon are designed to give an overview of the Buddhas teachings on kammaBefore tackling them you might want to read a few introductory articles on the topic including the following ones available on Access to Insight Karma A Refuge in Skillful Action and Samsara Divided by ZeroThe readings here are divided into three main sectionsThe first section provides background for the Buddhist teachings on kamma by showing how the early Buddhists viewed the way other contemporary schools of thought explained kammaThe second section focuses on the Buddhas basic observation that underlay his teachings on kamma that it is possible to develop a skillThis simple fact carries a number of important implications for any teaching on actionActions give results and their results follow a discernible patternOtherwise it would not be possible to develop a skillSome results are more desirable than othersOtherwise there would be no point in developing a skillBy observing ones mistakes one may learn from them and use that knowledge to act more skillfully in the futureThis means that the mind is a crucial agent in determining actions and their results and there is an opening for feedback to influence the process of actionIt is thus a nonlinear process and there is room for free willResults can be observed while one is acting as well as after the action is doneThis means that actions have both immediate results and longterm results a fact that makes the nonlinear process very complexThe passages in the second section discuss how these observations apply in practice discusses how the Buddha applied the principle of skillfulness to reach Awakening shows how to use it to decide what teachings are valid discusses how to apply it to all of ones actionsThe remaining passages are selfexplanatoryThe third section on kamma consists of passages that build a larger theory of action based on these observationsThese passages are divided into three subsections based on a classification given in Subsection A is the most theoretical part of this study guideIt covers the Buddhas basic theory of causation and treats the place of intention  the factor that the Buddha identified as the essence of kamma  in the context of the Buddhas analysis of physical and mental phenomenaIn the light of the Buddhas observation in  that views influence kamma this subsection concludes with two levels of right view mundane right view which informs the sort of good kamma that brings about happy results within the process of death and rebirth and transcendent right view which informs the sort of kamma that brings freedom from that processSubsection B focuses on the issue of how long it takes for the results of kamma to appear and gives particular attention to some of the complexities that arise from the fact that kamma is nonlinearSometimes the results of an action dont appear immediately or even in the immediate next life discusses the role that the mind plays in determining how the results of kamma are experienced and  treats the intelligent way to use the Buddhas teachings on kamma when reflecting on ones own past bad kamma so as to train oneself in the proper frame of mindSubsection C is divided into two further subsections based on a classification in The first of these two subsections discusses types of actions and mental qualities that lead to good or bad results within the process of rebirth and deathIn some passages the emphasis is on results in the present life in others on results in future livesThe second of these two subsections discusses the type of kamma  and the right views underlying that kamma  leading to freedom the cessation of kamma the realization of nibbanaThe concluding passages make the point that transcendent right view contains the seeds for its own transcendence once it has done its duty in cutting away other attachments it creates the momentum so that the mind can then abandon attachment to views of any sort right or wrong mundane or transcendentThat is how true freedom is gainedThere are brahmans  contemplatives who hold this teaching hold this view Whatever a person experiences  pleasant painful or neither pleasant nor painful  that is all caused by what was done in the past There are brahmans  contemplatives who hold this teaching hold this view Whatever a person experiences  pleasant painful or neither pleasant nor painful  that is all caused by a supreme beings act of creation There are brahmans  contemplatives who hold this teaching hold this view Whatever a person experiences  pleasant painful or neither pleasant nor painful  that is all without cause  without conditionHaving approached the brahmans  contemplatives who hold that whatever a person experiences is all caused by what was done in the past I said to them Is it true that you hold that whatever a person experiences is all caused by what was done in the past Thus asked by me they admitted Yes Then I said to them Then in that case a person is a killer of living beings because of what was done in the pastA person is a thief unchaste a liar a divisive speaker an abusive speaker an idle chatterer covetous malevolent a holder of wrong views because of what was done in the past When one falls back on what was done in the past as being essential monks there is no desire no effort This should be doneThis shouldnt be done When one cant pin down as a truth or reality what should  shouldnt be done one dwells bewildered  unprotectedOne

without conditionA person is a thief unchaste a liar a divisive speaker an abusive speaker an idle chatterer covetous malevolent a holder of wrong views without cause without condition When one falls back on lack of cause and lack of condition as being essential monks there is no desire no effort This should be doneThis shouldnt be done When one cant pin down as a truth or reality what should  shouldnt be done one dwells bewildered  unprotectedOne cannot righteously refer to oneself as a contemplativeKing Ajatasattu Purana Kassapa said to me Great king in acting or getting others to act in mutilating or getting others to mutilate in torturing or getting others to torture in inflicting sorrow or in getting others to inflict sorrow in tormenting or getting others to torment in intimidating or getting others to intimidate in taking life taking what is not given breaking into houses plundering wealth committing burglary ambushing highways committing adultery speaking lies  one does no evilIf with a razoredged disk one were to turn all the living beings on this earth to a single heap of flesh a single pile of flesh there would be no evil from that cause no coming of evilEven if one were to go along the right bank of the Ganges killing and getting others to kill mutilating and getting others to mutilate torturing and getting others to torture there would be no evil from that cause no coming of evilEven if one were to go along the left bank of the Ganges killing and getting others to kill mutilating and getting others to mutilate torturing and getting others to torture there would be no evil from that cause no coming of evilThrough generosity selfcontrol restraint and truthful speech there is no merit from that cause no coming of meritAjita Kesakambalin said to me Great king there is nothing given nothing offered nothing sacrificedThere is no fruit or result of good or bad actionsThere is no this world no next world no mother no father no spontaneously reborn beings no brahmans or contemplatives who faring rightly and practicing rightly proclaim this world and the next after having directly known and realized it for themselvesA person is a composite of four primary elementsAt death the earth returns to and merges with the earthsubstanceThe fire returns to and merges with the external firesubstanceThe liquid returns to and merges with the external liquidsubstanceThe wind returns to and merges with the external windsubstanceThe sensefaculties scatter into spaceFour men with the bier as the fifth carry the corpseIts eulogies are sounded only as far as the charnel groundThe bones turn pigeoncoloredThe offerings end in ashesGenerosity is taught by idiotsThe words of those who speak of existence after death are false empty chatterWith the breakup of the body the wise and the foolish alike are annihilated destroyedThey do not exist after deathPakudha Kaccayana said to me Great king there are these seven substances  unmade irreducible uncreated without a creator barren stable as a mountainpeak standing firm like a pillar  that do not alter do not change do not interfere with one another are incapable of causing one another pleasure pain or both pleasure and painWhich sevenThe earthsubstance the liquidsubstance the firesubstance the windsubstance pleasure pain and the soul as the seventhThese are the seven substances And among them there is no killer nor one who causes killing no hearer nor one who causes hearing no cognizer nor one who causes cognitionWhen one cuts off head there is no one taking anyones lifeIt is simply between the seven substances that the sword passesThere is the case of a certain brahman or contemplative who does not discern as it actually is that This is skillful or that This is unskillful If I not discerning as it actually is that This is skillful or that This is unskillful were to declare that This is skillful or that This is unskillful  There are brahmans and contemplatives who are pundits subtle skilled in debate who prowl about like hairsplitting marksmen as it were shooting philosophical positions to pieces with their dialecticThey might crossquestion me press me for reasons rebuke meI might not be able to stand my ground that would be a distress for me an obstacle for me So out of a fear for questioning a loathing for questioning he resorts to verbal contortions to eellike wrigglingThere is the case of a certain brahman or contemplative who is dull  exceedingly stupidOut of dullness  exceeding stupidity he  being asked questions regarding this or that  resorts to verbal contortions to eellike wriggling If you ask me if there exists another world if I thought that there exists another world would I declare that to youI dont think soI dont think in that wayI dont think otherwiseI dont think notI dont think not notIf you asked me if there isnt another world both is  isnt neither is nor isnt if there are beings who transmigrate if there arent both are  arent neither are nor arent if the Tathagata exists after death doesnt both neither I dont think soI dont think in that wayI dont think otherwiseI dont think notI dont think not notDevelop what is skillful monksIts possible to develop what is skillfulIf it were not possible to develop what is skillful I would not say to you Develop what is skillful But because it is possible to develop what is skillful I say to you Develop what is skillful If this development of what is skillful were conducive to harm  suffering I would not say to you Develop what is skillful But because this development of what is skillful is conducive to benefit  happiness I say to you Develop what is skillfulBefore my selfawakening when I was still just an unawakened Bodhisatta the thought occurred to me Why dont I keep dividing my thinking into two classes So I made thinking imbued with sensuality thinking imbued with malevolence  thinking imbued with harmfulness one class and thinking imbued with renunciation thinking imbued with nonmalevolence  thinking imbued with harmlessness another classAnd as I remained thus heedful ardent  resolute thinking imbued with sensuality arose in meI discerned that Thinking imbued with sensuality has arisen in me and that leads to my own affliction or to the affliction of others or to the affliction of bothIt obstructs discernment promotes vexation  does not lead to UnbindingAs I noticed that it leads to my own affliction it subsidedAs I noticed that it leads to the affliction of others to the affliction of both it obstructs discernment promotes vexation  does not lead to Unbinding it subsidedWhenever thinking imbued with sensuality had arisen I simply abandoned it destroyed it dispelled it wiped it out of existenceWhatever a monk keeps pursuing with his thinking  pondering that becomes the inclination of his awarenessIf a monk keeps pursuing thinking imbued with sensuality abandoning thinking imbued with renunciation his mind is bent by that thinking imbued with sensualityJust as in the last month of the Rains in the autumn season when the crops are ripening a cowherd would look after his cows He would tap  poke  check  curb them with a stick on this side  thatWhy is thatBecause he foresees flogging or imprisonment or a fine or public censure arising from thatIn the same way I foresaw in unskillful qualities drawbacks degradation  defilement and I foresaw in skillful qualities rewards related to renunciation  promoting cleansingAnd as I remained thus heedful ardent  resolute thinking imbued with renunciation arose in meI discerned that Thinking imbued with renunciation has arisen in me and that leads neither to my own affliction nor to the affliction of others nor to the affliction of bothIt fosters discernment promotes lack of vexation  leads to UnbindingIf I were to think  ponder in line with that even for a night even for a day even for a day  night I do not envision any danger that would come from it except that thinking  pondering a long time would tire the bodyWhen the body is tired the mind is disturbed and a disturbed mind is far from concentration So I steadied my mind right within settled unified  concentrated itWhy is thatSo that my mind would not be disturbedWhatever a monk keeps pursuing with his thinking  pondering that becomes the inclination of his awarenessIf a monk keeps pursuing thinking imbued with renunciation abandoning thinking imbued with sensuality his mind is bent by that thinking imbued with renunciationJust as in the last month of the hot season when all the crops have been gathered into the village a cowherd would look after his cows While resting under the shade of a tree or out in the open he simply keeps himself mindful of those cows In the same way I simply kept myself mindful of those mental qualitiesUnflagging persistence was aroused in me and unmuddled mindfulness establishedMy body was calm  unaroused my mind concentrated  singleQuite withdrawn from sensuality withdrawn from unskillful mental qualities I entered  remained in the first jhana rapture  pleasure born from withdrawal accompanied by directed thought  evaluationWith the stilling of directed thoughts  evaluations I entered  remained in the second jhana rapture  pleasure born of composure unification of awareness free from directed thought  evaluation  internal assuranceWith the fading of rapture I remained in equanimity mindful  alert and physically sensitive of pleasureI entered  remained in the third jhana of which the Noble Ones declare Equanimous  mindful he has a pleasant abiding With the abandoning of pleasure  pain  as with the earlier disappearance of elation  distress  I entered  remained in the fourth jhana purity of equanimity  mindfulness neither pleasure nor painWhen the mind was thus concentrated purified bright unblemished rid of defilement pliant malleable steady  attained to imperturbability I directed it to the knowledge of recollecting my past livesI recollected my manifold past lives ie one birth two five ten fifty a hundred a thousand a hundred thousand many eons of cosmic contraction many eons of cosmic expansion many eons of cosmic contraction  expansion There I had such a name belonged to such a clan had such an appearanceSuch was my food such my experience of pleasure  pain such the end of my lifePassing away from that state I rearose thereThere too I had such a name belonged to such a clan had such an appearanceSuch was my food such my experience of pleasure  pain such the end of my lifePassing away from that state I rearose here Thus I remembered my manifold past lives in their modes  detailsThis was the first knowledge I attained in the first watch of the nightIgnorance was destroyed knowledge arose darkness was destroyed light arose  as happens in one who is heedful ardent  resoluteWhen the mind was thus concentrated  attained to imperturbability I directed it to the knowledge of the passing away  reappearance of beingsI saw  by means of the divine eye purified  surpassing the human  beings passing away  reappearing and I discerned how they are inferior  superior beautiful  ugly fortunate  unfortunate in accordance with their kamma These beings  who were endowed with bad conduct of body speech  mind who reviled the Noble Ones held wrong views and undertook actions under the influence of wrong views  with the breakup of the body after death have reappeared in the plane of deprivation the bad destination the lower realms in hellBut these beings  who were endowed with good conduct of body speech  mind who did not revile the Noble Ones who held right views and undertook actions under the influence of right views  with the breakup of the body after death have reappeared in the good destinations in the heavenly world Thus  by means of the divine eye purified  surpassing the human  I saw beings passing away  reappearing and I discerned how they are inferior  superior beautiful  ugly fortunate  unfortunate in accordance with their kammaThis was the second knowledge I attained in the second watch of the nightIgnorance was destroyed knowledge arose darkness was destroyed light arose  as happens in one who is heedful ardent  resoluteWhen the mind was thus concentrated purified bright unblemished rid of defilement pliant malleable steady  attained to imperturbability I directed it to the knowledge of the ending of mental fermentationsI discerned as it had come to be that This is stress This is the origination of stress This is the cessation of stress This is the way leading to the cessation of stress These are fermentations This is the origination of fermentations This is the cessation of fermentations This is the way leading to the cessation of fermentations My heart thus knowing thus seeing was released from the fermentation of sensuality released from the fermentation of becoming released from the fermentation of ignoranceWith release there was the knowledge Released I discerned that Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task doneThere is nothing further for this worldThis was the third knowledge I attained in the third watch of the nightIgnorance was destroyed knowledge arose darkness was destroyed light arose  as happens in one who is heedful ardent  resoluteOf course you are uncertain KalamasOf course you are doubtfulWhen there are reasons for doubt uncertainty is bornSo in this case Kalamas dont go by reports by legends by traditions by scripture by conjecture by inference by analogies by agreement through pondering views by probability or by the thought This contemplative is our teacher When you know for yourselves that These qualities are unskillful these qualities are blameworthy these qualities are criticized by the wise these qualities when adopted  carried out lead to harm  to suffering  then you should abandon themWhat do you think Kalamas when greed arises in a person does it arise for benefit or for harmFor harm lordAnd this greedy person overcome by greed his mind possessed by greed doesnt he kill living beings take what is not given go after another persons wife tell lies and induce others to do likewise all of which is for longterm harm  sufferingYes lordSo what do you think Kalamas are these qualities skillful or unskillfulUnskillful lordBlameworthy or blamelessBlameworthy lordCriticized by the wise or praised by the wiseCriticized by the wise lordWhen adopted  carried out do they lead to harm  suffering or notWhen adopted  carried out they lead to harm  to suffering Now Kalamas dont go by reports by legends by traditions by scripture by conjecture by inference by analogies by agreement through pondering views by probability or by the thought This contemplative is our teacher When you know for yourselves that These qualities are skillful these qualities are blameless these qualities are praised by the wise these qualities when adopted  carried out lead to benefit  to happiness  then you should enter  remain in themWhat do you think Kalamas when lack of greed arises in a person does it arise for benefit or for harmFor benefit lordAnd this ungreedy person not overcome by greed his mind not possessed by greed he doesnt kill living beings take what is not given go after another persons wife tell lies or induce others to do likewise all of which is for longterm benefit  happiness  rightYes lordSo what do you think Kalamas are these qualities skillful or unskillfulSkillful lordBlameworthy or blamelessBlameless lordCriticized by the wise or praised by the wisePraised by the wise lordWhen adopted  carried out do they lead to benefit  to happiness or notWhen adopted  carried out they lead to benefit  to happinessThe Buddha What do you think Rahula What is a mirror forRahula For reflection sirThe Buddha In the same way Rahula bodily acts verbal acts  mental acts are to be done with repeated reflectionWhenever you want to perform a bodily act you should reflect on it This bodily act I want to perform  would it lead to selfaffliction to the affliction of others or to bothIs it an unskillful bodily act with painful consequences painful results If on reflection you know that it would lead to selfaffliction to the affliction of others or to both it would be an unskillful bodily act with painful consequences painful results then any bodily act of that sort is absolutely unfit for you to doBut if on reflection you know that it would not cause affliction it would be a skillful bodily act with happy consequences happy results then any bodily act of that sort is fit for you to doWhile you are performing a bodily act you should reflect on it This bodily act I am doing  is it leading to selfaffliction to the affliction of others or to bothIs it an unskillful bodily act with painful consequences painful results If on reflection you know that it is leading to selfaffliction to affliction of others or both you should give it upBut if on reflection you know that it is not you may continue with itHaving performed a bodily act you should reflect on it If on reflection you know that it led to selfaffliction to the affliction of others or to both it was an unskillful bodily act with painful consequences painful results then you should confess it reveal it lay it open to the Teacher or to a knowledgeable companion in the holy lifeHaving confessed it you should exercise restraint in the futureBut if on reflection you know that it did not lead to affliction it was a skillful bodily act with happy consequences happy results then you should stay mentally refreshed  joyful training day  night in skillful mental qualitiesHaving performed a mental act you should reflect on it If on reflection you know that it led to selfaffliction to the affliction of others or to both it was an unskillful mental act with painful consequences painful results then you should feel horrified humiliated  disgusted with itFeeling horrified you should exercise restraint in the futureBut if on reflection you know that it did not lead to affliction it was a skillful mental act with happy consequences happy results then you should stay mentally refreshed  joyful training day  night in skillful mental qualitiesRahula all the brahmans  contemplatives in the course of the past who purified their bodily acts verbal acts  mental acts did it through repeated reflection on their bodily acts verbal acts  mental acts in just this wayAll the brahmans  contemplatives in the course of the future All the brahmans  contemplatives at present who purify their bodily acts verbal acts  mental acts do it through repeated reflection on their bodily acts verbal acts  mental acts in just this waySo Rahula you should train yourself I will purify my bodily acts verbal acts my mental acts through repeated reflection Thats how you should train yourselfThat is what the Blessed One saidGratified VenRahula delighted in the Blessed Ones wordsAnd what are the roots of unskillful thingsGreed aversion delusion These are termed the roots of unskillful thingsAnd what is skillfulAbstaining from taking life is skillful abstaining from taking what is not given from sexual misconduct from lying from abusive speech from divisive talebearing abstaining from idle chatter is skillfulLack of covetousness lack of malevolence right views are skillfulThese things are termed skillfulAnd what are the roots of skillful thingsLack of greed lack of aversion lack of delusion These are termed the roots of skillful thingsAnd how is one made pure in three ways by bodily actionThere is the case where a certain person abandoning the taking of life abstains from taking lifeHe dwells with his rod laid down his knife laid down scrupulous merciful compassionate for the benefit of all living beingsAbandoning the taking of what is not given he abstains from taking what is not givenHe does not take in the manner of a thief things in a village or a wilderness that belong to others and have not been given by themAbandoning illicit sex he abstains from illicit sexHe does not get sexually involved with those who are protected by their mothers their fathers their brothers their sisters their relatives or their Dhamma those with husbands those who entail punishments or even those crowned with flowers by another manThis is how one is made pure in three ways by bodily actionAnd how is one made pure in four ways by verbal actionThere is the case where a certain person abandoning false speech abstains from false speechWhen he has been called to a town meeting a group meeting a gathering of his relatives his guild or of the royalty if he is asked as a witness Come  tell good man what you know If he doesnt know he says I dont know If he does know he says I know If he hasnt seen he says I havent seen If he has seen he says I have seen Thus he doesnt consciously tell a lie for his own sake for the sake of another or for the sake of any rewardAbandoning false speech he abstains from false speechHe speaks the truth holds to the truth is firm reliable no deceiver of the worldAbandoning divisive speech he abstains from divisive speechWhat he has heard here he does not tell there to break those people apart from these people hereWhat he has heard there he does not tell here to break these people apart from those people thereThus reconciling those who have broken apart or cementing those who are united he loves concord delights in concord enjoys concord speaks things that create concordAbandoning abusive speech he abstains from abusive speechHe speaks words that are soothing to the ear that are affectionate that go to the heart that are polite appealing  pleasing to people at largeAbandoning idle chatter he abstains from idle chatterHe speaks in season speaks what is factual what is in accordance with the goal the Dhamma  the VinayaHe speaks words worth treasuring seasonable reasonable circumscribed connected with the goalThis is how one is made pure in four ways by verbal actionAnd how is one made pure in three ways by mental actionThere is the case where a certain person is not covetousHe does not covet the belongings of others thinking O that what belongs to others would be mine He bears no malevolence and is not corrupt in the resolves of his heartMay these beings be free from animosity free from oppression free from trouble and may they look after themselves with ease He has right view and is not warped in the way he sees things There is what is given what is offered what is sacrificedThere are fruits  results of good  bad actionsThere is this world  the next worldThere is mother  fatherThere are spontaneously reborn beings there are brahmans  contemplatives who faring rightly  practicing rightly proclaim this world  the next after having directly known  realized it for themselves This is how one is made pure in three ways by mental actionThese Cunda are the ten courses of skillful actionWhen a person is endowed with these ten courses of skillful action then even if he gets up at the proper time from his bed and touches the earth he is still pureIf he doesnt touch the earth he is still pureIf he touches wet cow dung he is still pureIf he doesnt touch wet cow dung he is still pureIf he touches green grass If he doesnt touch green grass If he worships a fire If he doesnt worship a fire If he pays homage to the sun with clasped hands If he doesnt pay homage to the sun with clasped hands If he goes down into the water three times by nightfall If he doesnt go down into the water three times by nightfall he is still pureWhy is thatBecause these ten courses of skillful action are pure and cause purityFurthermore as a result of being endowed with these ten courses of skillful action the devas is declared human beings is declared  that or any other good destinationA person endowed with three things is to be recognized as a foolWhich threeBodily misconduct verbal misconduct mental misconductA person endowed with three things is to be recognized as a wise personWhich threeGood bodily conduct good verbal conduct good mental conductThus monks you should train yourselves We will avoid the three things that endowed with which one is to be recognized as a foolWe will undertake  maintain the three things that endowed with which one is to be recognized as a wise person Thats how you should train yourselvesNow as for the course of action that is unpleasant to do and that when done leads to what is unprofitable one considers it as not worth doing for both reasons because the course of action is unpleasant to do and because the course of action when done leads to what is unprofitableAs for the course of action that is unpleasant to do but that when done leads to what is profitable its in light of this course of action that one may be known as a wise person or a foolFor a fool doesnt reflect Even though this course of action is unpleasant to do still when it is done it leads to what is profitable So he doesnt do it and thus the nondoing of that course of action leads to what is unprofitable for himBut a wise person reflects Even though this course of action is unpleasant to do still when it is done it leads to what is profitable So he does it and thus the doing of that course of action leads to what is profitable for himAs for the course of action that is pleasant to do but that when done leads to what is unprofitable its in light of this course of action that one may be known as a wise person or a foolFor a fool doesnt reflect Even though this course of action is pleasant to do still when it is done it leads to what is unprofitable So he does it and thus the doing of that course of action leads to what is unprofitable for himBut a wise person reflects Even though this course of action is pleasant to do still when it is done it leads to what is unprofitable So he doesnt do it and thus the nondoing of that course of action leads to what is profitable for himAs for the course of action that is pleasant to do and that when done leads to what is profitable one considers it as worth doing for both reasons because the course of action is pleasant to do and because the course of action when done leads to what is profitableThese are the four courses of actionIntention I tell you is kammaIntending one does kamma by way of body speech  intellectAnd what is the cause by which kamma comes into playContactAnd what is the diversity in kammaThere is kamma to be experienced in hell kamma to be experienced in the realm of common animals kamma to be experienced in the realm of the hungry shades kamma to be experienced in the human world kamma to be experienced in the heavenly worldsAnd what is the result of kammaThe result of kamma is of three sorts I tell you that which arises right here  now that which arises later and that which arises following thatAnd what is the cessation of kammaFrom the cessation of contact is the cessation of kamma and just this noble eightfold path  right view right resolve right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness right concentration  is the path of practice leading to the cessation of kammaNow when a noble disciple discerns kamma in this way the cause by which kamma comes into play in this way the diversity of kamma in this way the result of kamma in this way the cessation of kamma in this way  the path of practice leading to the cessation of kamma in this way then he discerns this penetrative holy life as the cessation of kammaAnd why do you call it feelingBecause it feels thus it is called feeling What does it feelIt feels pleasure it feels pain it feels neitherpleasurenorpainBecause it feels it is called feelingAnd why do you call it perceptionBecause it perceives thus it is called perception What does it perceiveIt perceives blue it perceives yellow it perceives red it perceives whiteBecause it perceives it is called perceptionAnd why do you call them fabricationsBecause they fabricate fabricated things thus they are called fabrications What do they fabricate as a fabricated thingFrom formness they fabricate form as a fabricated thingFrom feelingness they fabricate feeling as a fabricated thingFrom perceptionhoodFrom fabricationhoodFrom consciousnesshood they fabricate consciousness as a fabricated thingBecause they fabricate fabricated things they are called fabricationsAnd why do you call it consciousnessBecause it cognizes thus it is called consciousnessWhat does it cognizeIt cognizes what is sour bitter pungent sweet alkaline nonalkaline salty  unsaltyBecause it cognizes it is called consciousnessAnd what is right viewRight view I tell you is of two sorts There is right view with fermentations siding with merit resulting in the acquisitions and there is noble right view without fermentations transcendent a factor of the pathAnd what is the right view that has fermentations sides with merit  results in acquisitionsThere is what is given what is offered what is sacrificedThere are fruits  results of good  bad actionsThere is this world  the next worldThere is mother  fatherThere are spontaneously reborn beings there are brahmans  contemplatives who faring rightly  practicing rightly proclaim this world  the next after having directly known  realized it for themselves This is the right view that has fermentations sides with merit  results in acquisitionsAnd what is new kammaWhatever kamma one does now with the body with speech or with the intellectThis is called new kammaThe Buddha There are cases where some feelings arise based on bileYou yourself should know how some feelings arise based on bileEven the world is agreed on how some feelings arise based on bileSo any brahmans  contemplatives who are of the doctrine  view that whatever an individual feels  pleasure pain neitherpleasurenorpain  is entirely caused by what was done before  slip past what they themselves know slip past what is agreed on by the worldTherefore I say that those brahmans  contemplatives are wrongThere are cases where some feelings arise based on phlegm based on internal winds based on a combination of bodily humors from the change of the seasons from uneven care of the body from attacks from the result of kammaYou yourself should know how some feelings arise from the result of kammaEven the world is agreed on how some feelings arise from the result of kammaSo any brahmans  contemplatives who are of the doctrine  view that whatever an individual feels  pleasure pain neither pleasurenorpain  is entirely caused by what was done before  slip past what they themselves know slip past what is agreed on by the worldTherefore I say that those brahmans  contemplatives are wrongNow there is the case where a certain person is seen garlanded  adorned freshly bathed  groomed with hair  beard trimmed enjoying the sensualities of women as if he were a kingThey ask about him My good man what has this man done that he has been garlanded  adorned as if he were a king They answer My good man this man attacked the kings enemy and took his lifeThe king gratified with him rewarded himThat is why he is garlanded  adorned as if he were a kingThen there is the case where a certain person is seen bound with a stout rope with his arms pinned tightly against his back his head shaved bald marched to a harshsounding drum from street to street crossroads to crossroads evicted through the south gate and beheaded to the south of the cityThey ask about him My good man what has this man done that he is bound with a stout rope and beheaded to the south of the city They answer My good man this man an enemy of the king has taken the life of a man or a womanThat is why the rulers having had him seized inflicted such a punishment upon himNow what do you think headman have you ever seen or heard of such a caseI have seen this lord have heard of it and will hear of itSo headman when those brahmans  contemplatives who hold a doctrine and view like this say All those who kill living beings experience pain  distress in the here  now do they speak truthfully or falsely  Falsely lordAnd those who babble empty falsehood are they moral or immoralImmoral lordAnd those who are immoral and of evil character are they practicing wrongly or rightly  Wrongly lordAnd those who are practicing wrongly do they hold wrong view or right view  Wrong view lordAnd is it proper to place confidence in those who hold wrong viewNo lordThen headman there is the case where a certain person is seen garlanded  adorned as if he were a kingThey ask about him My good man what has this man done that he has been garlanded  adorned as if he were a king They answer My good man this man attacked the kings enemy and stole a treasureThe

good man what has this man done that he is bound with a stout rope and beheaded to the south of the city They answer My good man this man has brought the aims of a householder or a householders son to ruin with a lieThat is why the rulers having had him seized inflicted such a punishment upon himNow what do you think headman have you ever seen or heard of such a caseI have seen this lord have heard of it and will hear of itSo headman when those brahmans  contemplatives who hold a doctrine  view like this say All those who tell lies experience pain  distress in the here  now do they speak truthfully or falsely Is it proper to place confidence in those who hold wrong view  No lordBut there is also the case where a certain person takes life holds wrong views on the breakup of the body after death he reappears in the good destinations in the heavenly worldAnd there is the case where a certain person abstains from taking life abstains from taking what is not given is not covetous not malevolent  holds right viewsOn the breakup of the body after death he reappears in the good destinations in the heavenly worldBut there is also the case where a certain person abstains from taking life abstains from taking what is not given is not covetous not malevolent  holds right views on the breakup of the body after death he reappears in the plane of deprivation the bad destination the lower realms in hellIn the case of the person who takes life on the breakup of the body after death reappears in the good destinations in the heavenly world either earlier he performed fine kamma that is to be felt as pleasant or later he performed fine kamma that is to be felt as pleasant or at the time of death he adopted  carried out right viewsBecause of that on the breakup of the body after death he reappears in the good destinations in the heavenly worldBut as for the results of taking life holding wrong views he will feel them either right here  now or later or following thatIn the case of the person who abstains from taking life but on the breakup of the body after death reappears in the plane of deprivation the bad destination the lower realms in hell either earlier he performed evil kamma that is to be felt as painful or later he performed evil kamma that is to be felt as painful or at the time of death he adopted  carried out wrong viewsBecause of that on the breakup of the body after death he reappears in the plane of deprivation the bad destination the lower realms in hellBut as for the results of abstaining from taking life holding right views he will feel them either right here  now or later or following thatThere is the case where a trifling evil deed done by a certain individual takes him to hellThere is the case where the very same sort of trifling deed done by another individual is experienced in the here  now and for the most part barely appears for a momentNow a trifling evil deed done by what sort of individual takes him to hellThere is the case where a certain individual is undeveloped in the body undeveloped in virtue undeveloped in mind undeveloped in discernment restricted smallhearted dwelling with sufferingA trifling evil deed done by this sort of individual takes him to hellNow a trifling evil deed done by what sort of individual is experienced in the here  now and for the most part barely appears for a momentThere is the case where a certain individual is developed in the body developed in virtue developed in mind developed in discernment unrestricted largehearted dwelling with the unlimitedA trifling evil deed done by this sort of individual is experienced in the here  now and for the most part barely appears for a momentSuppose that a man were to drop a salt crystal into a small amount of water in a cupWhat do you thinkWould the water in the cup become salty because of the salt crystal and unfit to drinkYes lord Now suppose that a man were to drop a salt crystal into the River GangesWhat do you thinkWould the water in the River Ganges become salty because of the salt crystal and unfit to drinkNo lord In the same way there is the case where a trifling evil deed done by one individual takes him to hell and there is the case where the very same sort of trifling deed done by the other individual is experienced in the here  now and for the most part barely appears for a momentNigantha Nataputta teaches the Dhamma to his disciples in this way lord All those who take life are destined for the plane of deprivation are destined for hellAll those who steal All those who indulge in illicit sex All those who tell lies are destined for the plane of deprivation are destined for hellWhatever one keeps doing frequently by that is one led Thats how Nigantha Nataputta teaches the Dhamma to his disciplesIf its true that Whatever one keeps doing frequently by that is one led then no one is destined for the plane of deprivation or destined to hell in line with Nigantha Nataputtas wordsWhat do you think headman If a man is one who takes life then taking into consideration time spent doing  not doing whether by day or by night which time is more the time he spends taking life or the time he spends not taking life the time he spends taking life is less lord and the time he spends not taking life is certainly moreIf its true that Whatever one keeps doing

that is dark with dark resultThere is the case where a certain person fabricates an injurious bodily fabrication an injurious verbal fabrication an injurious mental fabrication He rearises in an injurious world where he is touched by injurious contacts He experiences feelings that are exclusively painful like those of the beings in hellThis is called kamma that is dark with dark resultAnd what is kamma that is bright with bright resultThere is the case where a certain person fabricates an uninjurious bodily fabrication an uninjurious verbal fabrication an uninjurious mental fabrication He rearises in an uninjurious world where he is touched by uninjurious contacts He experiences feelings that are exclusively pleasant like those of the Everradiant DevasThis is called kamma that is bright with bright resultAnd what is kamma that is dark  bright with dark  bright resultThere is the case where a certain person fabricates a bodily fabrication that is injurious  uninjurious a verbal fabrication that is injurious  uninjurious a mental fabrication that is injurious  uninjurious He rearises in an injurious  uninjurious world where he is touched by injurious  uninjurious contacts He experiences injurious  uninjurious feelings pleasure mingled with pain like those of human beings some devas and some beings in the lower realmsThis is called kamma that is dark  bright with dark  bright resultAnd what is kamma that is neither dark nor bright with neither dark nor bright result leading to the ending of kammaThe intention right there to abandon this kamma that is dark with dark result this kamma that is bright with bright result this kamma that is dark  bright with dark  bright resultThis is called kamma that is neither dark nor bright with neither dark nor bright result leading to the ending of kammaA related discourse repeats most of the above defining dark kamma with dark result with the following exampleThere is the case of a certain person who kills living beings steals what is not given engages in illicit sex tells lies and drinks fermented  distilled liquors that are the basis for heedlessness and bright kamma with bright result with the following example There is the case of a certain person who abstains from killing living beings abstains from stealing what is not given abstains from engaging in illicit sex abstains from telling lies and abstains from drinking fermented  distilled liquors that are the basis for heedlessnessThese are three causes for the origination of actionsNow these three are causes for the origination of actionsWhich threeNongreed is a cause for the origination of actionsNonaversion is a cause for the origination of actionsNondelusion is a cause for the origination of actionsAny action performed with nongreed  born of nongreed caused by nongreed originating from nongreed When greed is gone that action is thus abandoned its root destroyed made like a palmyra stump deprived of the conditions of development not destined for future arisingJust as when seeds are not broken not rotten not damaged by wind  heat capable of sprouting wellburied planted in wellprepared soil and a man would burn them with fire and burning them with fire would make them into fine ashesHaving made them into fine ashes he would winnow them before a high wind or wash them away in a swiftflowing streamThose seeds would thus be destroyed at the root made like a palmyra stump deprived of the conditions of development not destined for future arisingIn the same way any action performed with nongreed performed with nonaversion performed with nondelusion  born of nondelusion caused by nondelusion originating from nondelusion When delusion is gone that action is thus abandoned its root destroyed made like a palmyra stump deprived of the conditions of development not destined for future arisingThese monks are three causes for the origination of actionThe word sheds acts as a lamp in this verse  it appears only once but functions in two phrases as I have rendered it in the translationOn the use of the lamp as a literary figure of speech see the Introduction to Dhammapada A TranslationAnd what does it mean to be consummate in initiativeThere is the case where a lay person by whatever occupation he makes his living  whether by farming or trading or cattle tending or archery or as a kings man or by any other craft  is clever  untiring at it endowed with discrimination in its techniques enough to arrange  carry it outThis is called being consummate in initiativeAnd what does it mean to be consummate in vigilanceThere is the case when a lay person has righteous wealth  righteously gained coming from his initiative his striving his making an effort gathered by the strength of his arm earned by his sweat  he manages to protect it through vigilance How shall neither kings nor thieves make off with this property of mine nor fire burn it nor water sweep it away nor hateful heirs make off with it This is called being consummate in vigilanceAnd what is meant by admirable friendshipThere is the case where a lay person in whatever town or village he may dwell spends time with householders or householders sons young or old who are advanced in virtueHe talks with them engages them in discussionsHe emulates consummate conviction in those who are consummate in conviction consummate virtue in those who are consummate in virtue consummate generosity in those who are consummate in generosity and consummate discernment in those who are consummate in discernmentThis is called admirable friendshipAnd what does it mean to maintain ones livelihood in tuneThere is the case where a lay person knowing the income and outflow of his wealth maintains a livelihood in tune neither a spendthrift nor a pennypincher Thus will my income exceed my outflow and my outflow will not exceed my income Just as when a weigher or his apprentice when holding the scales knows It has tipped down so much or has tipped up so much in the same way the lay person knowing the income and outflow of his wealth maintains a livelihood in tune neither a spendthrift nor a pennypincher Thus will my income exceed my outflow and my outflow will not exceed my income If a lay person has a small income but maintains a grand livelihood it will be rumored of him This clansman devours his wealth like a fruittree eater If a lay person has a large income but maintains a miserable livelihood it will be rumored of him This clansman will die of starvation But when a lay person knowing the income and outflow of his wealth maintains a livelihood in tune neither a spendthrift nor a pennypincher Thus will my income exceed my outflow and my outflow will not exceed my income this is called maintaining ones livelihood in tuneThese are the four drains on ones store of wealth debauchery in sex debauchery in drink debauchery in gambling and evil friendship evil companionship evil camaraderieJust as if there were a great reservoir with four inlets and four drains and a man were to close the inlets and open the drains and the sky were not to pour down proper showers the depletion of that great reservoir could be expected not its increaseIn the same way these are the four drains on ones store of wealth debauchery in sex debauchery in drink debauchery in gambling and evil friendship evil companionship evil camaraderieThese are the four inlets to ones store of wealth no debauchery in sex no debauchery in drink no debauchery in gambling and admirable friendship admirable companionship

gambling and admirable friendship admirable companionship admirable camaraderieThese TigerPaw are the four qualities that lead to a lay persons happiness  wellbeing in this lifeVery well then headman I will question you on this matterAnswer as you see fitSuppose a man were to throw a large boulder into a deep lake of water and a great crowd of people gathering  congregating would pray praise  circumambulate with their hands palmtopalm over the heart Rise up O boulderCome floating up O boulderCome float to the shore O boulder What do you think would that boulder  because of the prayers praise  circumambulation of that great crowd of people  rise up come floating up or come float to the shoreNo lordSo it is with any man who takes life steals indulges in illicit sex is a liar one who speaks divisive speech abusive speech  idle chatter is covetous malevolent  holds to wrong viewsEven though a great crowd of people gathering  congregating would pray praise  circumambulate with their hands palmtopalm over the heart  May this man at the breakup of the body after death reappear in a good destination the heavenly world  still at the breakup of the body after death he would reappear in destitution a bad destination the lower realms hellNow suppose a man were to throw a jar of ghee or a jar of oil into a deep lake of water where it would breakThere the shards  jarfragments would go down while the ghee or oil would come upThen a great crowd of people gathering  congregating would pray praise  circumambulate with their hands palmtopalm over the heart Sink O gheeoilSubmerge O gheeoilGo down O gheeoil What do you think would that gheeoil because of the prayers praise  circumambulation of that great crowd of people sink submerge or go downNo lordSo it is with any man who refrains from taking life from stealing  from indulging in illicit sex he refrains from lying from speaking divisive speech from abusive speech  from idle chatter he is not covetous not malevolent  holds to right viewEven though a great crowd of people gathering  congregating would pray praise  circumambulate with their hands palmtopalm over the heart  May this man at the breakup of the body after death reappear in a destitution a bad destination the lower realms hell  still at the breakup of the body after death he would reappear in a good destination the heavenly worldAnd what does it

mind consumed  wrongly inflicts on another person through beating or imprisonment or confiscation or placing blame or banishment I have powerI want power that too is unskillfulThus it is that many evil unskillful qualitiesevents  born of greed caused by greed originated through greed conditioned by greed  come into playAnd a person like this is called one who speaks at the wrong time speaks what is unfactual speaks what is irrelevant speaks contrary to the Dhamma speaks contrary to the VinayaWhyBecause of having wrongly inflicted suffering on another person through beating or imprisonment or confiscation or placing blame or banishment I have powerI want power When told what is factual he denies it and doesnt acknowledge itWhen told what is unfactual he doesnt make an ardent effort to untangle it This is unfactualThis is baseless Thats why a person like this is called one who speaks at the wrong time speaks what is unfactual speaks what is irrelevant speaks contrary to the Dhamma speaks contrary to the VinayaA person like this  his mind overcome with evil unskillful qualities born of greed born of aversion born of delusion his mind consumed  dwells in

the One WellGone the Teacher said furtherAnd what is the path of practice leading to the cessation of kammaJust this noble eightfold path This is called the path of practice leading to the cessation of kammaAnd what is right viewKnowledge in terms of stress knowledge in terms of the origination of stress knowledge in terms of the cessation of stress knowledge in terms of the way of practice leading to the cessation of stressAnd what is right resolveBeing resolved on renunciation on freedom from malevolence on harmlessnessAnd what is right speechAbstaining from lying abstaining from divisive speech abstaining from abusive speech abstaining from idle chatterAnd what is right actionAbstaining from taking life abstaining from stealing abstaining from illicit sexAnd what is right livelihoodThere is the case where a noble disciple having abandoned dishonest livelihood keeps his life going with right livelihoodAnd what is right effortThere is the case where a monk generates desire endeavors activates persistence upholds  exerts his intent for the sake of the nonarising of evil unskillful qualities that have not yet arisenHe generates desire endeavors activates persistence upholds  exerts his intent for the sake of the abandonment of evil unskillful qualities that have arisenHe generates desire endeavors activates persistence upholds  exerts his intent for the sake of the arising of skillful qualities that have not yet arisenHe generates desire endeavors activates persistence upholds  exerts his intent for the maintenance nonconfusion increase plenitude development  culmination of skillful qualities that have arisenAnd what is right mindfulnessThere is the case where a monk remains focused on the body in  of itself  ardent aware  mindful  putting away greed  distress with reference to the worldHe remains focused on feelings in  of themselves  ardent aware  mindful  putting away greed  distress with reference to the worldHe remains focused on the mind in  of itself  ardent aware  mindful  putting away greed  distress with reference to the worldHe remains focused on mental qualities in  of themselves  ardent aware  mindful  putting away greed  distress with reference to the worldAnd what is right concentrationThere is the case where a monk  quite withdrawn from sensuality withdrawn from unskillful qualities  enters  remains in the first jhana rapture  pleasure born from withdrawal accompanied by directed thought  evaluationWith the stilling of directed thoughts  evaluations he enters  remains in the second jhana rapture  pleasure born of concentration unification of awareness free from directed thought  evaluation  internal assuranceWith the fading of rapture he remains equanimous mindful  alert and senses pleasure with the bodyHe enters  remains in the third jhana of which the Noble Ones declare Equanimous  mindful he has a pleasant abiding With the abandoning of pleasure  pain  as with the earlier disappearance of elation  distress  he enters  remains in the fourth jhana purity of equanimity  mindfulness neither pleasure nor painThis monks is called right concentrationThis is how he attends inappropriately Was I in the pastWas I not in the pastWhat was I in the pastHow was I in the pastHaving been what what was I in the pastShall I be in the futureShall I not be in the futureWhat shall I be in the futureHow shall I be in the futureHaving been what what shall I be in the future Or else he is inwardly perplexed about the immediate present Am IAm I notWhat am IHow am IWhere has this being come fromWhere is it boundAs he attends inappropriately in this way one of six kinds of view arises in him The view I have a self arises in him as true  established or the view I have no self or the view It is precisely by means of self that I perceive self or the view It is precisely by means of self that I perceive notself or the view It is precisely by means of notself that I perceive self arises in him as true  established or else he has a view like this This very self of mine  the knower that is sensitive here  there to the ripening of good  bad actions  is the self of mine that is constant everlasting eternal not subject to change and will endure as long as eternityThis is called a thicket of views a wilderness of views a contortion of views a writhing of views a fetter of viewsBound by a fetter of views the uninstructed runofthemill person is not freed from birth aging  death from sorrow lamentation pain distress  despairHe is not freed I tell you from suffering  stressThe wellinstructed noble disciple  who has regard for noble ones is wellversed  disciplined in their Dhamma who has regard for men of integrity is wellversed  disciplined in their Dhamma  discerns what ideas are fit for attention and what ideas are unfit for attentionThis being so he does not attend to ideas unfit for attention and attends to ideas fit for attentionHe attends appropriately This is stress This is the origination of stress This is the cessation of stress This is the way leading to the cessation of stressAs he attends appropriately in this way three fetters are abandoned in him identityview doubt and grasping at precepts  practicesThese are called the fermentations to be abandoned by seeingThen the Blessed One having encompassed with his awareness the awareness of that monk addressed the monks Its possible that a foolish man  his awareness immersed in ignorance  governed by craving  might think that the Teachers message can be slipped past in this way It seems then that form is notself feeling perception fabrications consciousness is notselfSo what self will be touched by the actions done by what is notself Havent I counterquestioned  trained you with regard to each of these phenomenaWhat do you think monks is form constant or inconstant Inconstant lord And is that which is inconstant easeful or stressful Stressful lord And is it fitting to regard what is inconstant stressful subject to change as This is mineThis is my selfThis is what I am No lord Is feeling constant or inconstant Inconstant lord Is perception constant or inconstant Inconstant lord Are fabrications constant or inconstant Inconstant lordWhat do you think monks  Is consciousness constant or inconstant Inconstant lord And is that which is inconstant easeful or stressful Stressful lord And is it fitting to regard what is inconstant stressful subject to change as This is mineThis is my selfThis is what I am No lordThus monks any form whatsoever that is past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or near every form is to be seen as it actually is with right discernment as This is not mineThis is not my selfThis is not what I amAny feeling Any perception Any fabricationsAny consciousness whatsoever that is past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or near every consciousness is to be seen as it actually is with right discernment as This is not mineThis is not my selfThis is not what I amSeeing thus the instructed noble disciple grows disenchanted with form disenchanted with feeling disenchanted with perception disenchanted with fabrications disenchanted with consciousnessDisenchanted he becomes dispassionateThrough dispassion he is fully releasedWith full release there is the knowledge Fully released He discerns that Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task doneThere is nothing further for this worldThe Buddha  The one who acts is the same

belong to someonesomething else both of them would have the same meaning even though their words would differWhen a monk is of the view that the soul is the same as the body there is no leading the

know entirely what views Gotama the contemplative hasThen tell us what views the monks haveI dont even know entirely what views the monks haveSo you dont know entirely what views Gotama the contemplative has or even that the monks haveThen tell us what views you haveIt wouldnt be difficult for me to expound to you what views I haveBut please let the venerable ones expound each in line with his position and then it wont be difficult for me to expound to you what views I haveWhen this had been said one of the wanderers said to Anathapindika the householder The cosmos is eternalOnly this is true anything otherwise is worthlessThis is the sort of view I haveAnother wanderer said to Anathapindika The cosmos is not eternalOnly this is true anything otherwise is worthlessThis is the sort of view I haveAnother wanderer said The cosmos is finite The cosmos is infinite The soul  the body are the same The soul is one thing and the body another After death a Tathagata exists After death a Tathagata does not exist After death a Tathagata both does  does not exist After death a Tathagata neither does nor does not existOnly this is true anything otherwise is worthlessThis is the sort of view I haveWhen this had been said Anathapindika the householder said to the wanderers As for the venerable one who says The cosmos is eternalOnly this is true anything otherwise is worthlessThis is the sort of view I have his view arises from his own inappropriate attention or in dependence on the words of anotherNow this view has been brought into being is fabricated willed

presentWhen this had been said the wanderers fell silent abashed sitting with their shoulders drooping their heads down brooding at a loss for wordsAnathapindika the householder perceiving that the wanderers were silent abashed at a loss for words got up  leftI have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Sāvatthī at Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monasteryAnd on that occasion there were many contemplatives brahmans  wanderers of various sects living around Sāvatthī with differing views differing opinions differing beliefs dependent for support on their differing viewsSome of the contemplatives  brahmans held this doctrine this view The cosmos is eternalOnly this is true anything otherwise is worthlessSome of the contemplatives  brahmans held this doctrine this view The cosmos is not eternal The cosmos is finite The cosmos is infinite The soul is the same thing as the body The soul is one thing and the body another After death a Tathāgata exists After death a Tathāgata does not exist After death a Tathāgata both exists  does not exist After death a Tathāgata neither exists nor does not existOnly this is true anything otherwise is worthlessAnd they kept on arguing quarreling  disputing wounding one another with weapons of the mouth saying The Dhamma is like this its not like thatThe Dhammas not like that its like thisThen in the early morning a large number of monks adjusted their under robes and  carrying their bowls  robes  went into Sāvatthī for almsHaving gone for alms in Sāvatthī after the meal returning from their alms round they went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one sideAs they were sitting there they said to the Blessed One Lord there are many contemplatives brahmans  wanderers of various sects living around Sāvatthī with differing views differing opinions differing beliefs dependent for support on their differing views And they keep on arguing quarreling  disputing wounding one another with weapons of the mouth saying The Dhamma is like this its not like thatThe Dhammas not like that its like this Monks the wanderers of other sects are blind  eyelessThey dont know what is beneficial and what is harmfulThey dont know what is the Dhamma and what is nonDhammaNot knowing what is beneficial and what is harmful not knowing what is Dhamma and what is nonDhamma they keep on arguing quarreling  disputing wounding one another with weapons of the mouth saying The Dhamma is like this its not like thatThe Dhammas not like that its like thisOnce monks in this same Sāvatthī there was a certain king and the king said to a certain man Come my good manGather together all the people in Sāvatthī who have been blind from birth Responding As you say your majesty to the king the man  having rounded up all the people in Sāvatthī who had been blind from birth  went to the king and on arrival said Your majesty the people in Sāvatthī who have been blind from birth have been gathered togetherVery well then I say show the blind people an elephantResponding As you say your majesty to the king the man showed the blind people an elephantTo some of the blind people he showed the elephants head saying This blind people is what an elephant is like To some of them he showed the elephants ear saying This blind people is what an elephant is like To some of them he showed the elephants tusk the elephants trunk the elephants body the elephants foot the elephants hindquarters the elephants tail the tuft at the end of the elephants tail saying This blind people is what an elephant is likeThen having shown the blind people the elephant the man went to the king and on arrival said Your majesty the blind people have seen the elephantMay your majesty do what you think it is now time to doThen the king went to the blind people and on arrival asked them Blind people have you seen the elephantYes your majestyWe have seen the elephantNow tell me blind people what the elephant is likeThe blind people who had been shown the elephants head said The elephant your majesty is just like a jarThose who had been shown the elephants ear said The elephant your majesty is just like a winnowing basketThose who had been shown the elephants tusk said The elephant your majesty is just like plowshareThose who had been shown the elephants trunk said The elephant your majesty is just like the pole of a plowThose who had been shown the elephants body said The elephant your majesty is just like a granaryThose who had been shown the elephants foot said The elephant your majesty is just like a postThose who had been shown the elephants hindquarters said The elephant your majesty is just like a mortarThose who had been shown the elephants tail said The elephant your majesty is just like a pestleThose who had been shown the tuft at the end of the elephants tail said The elephant your majesty is just like a broomSaying The elephant is like this its not like thatThe elephants not like that its like this they struck one another with their fistsThat gratified the kingIn the same way monks the wanderers of other sects are blind  eyelessThey dont know what is beneficial and what is harmfulThey dont know what is the Dhamma and what is nonDhammaNot knowing what is beneficial and what is harmful not knowing what is Dhamma and what is nonDhamma they keep on arguing quarreling  disputing wounding one another with weapons of the mouth saying The Dhamma is like this its not like thatThe Dhammas not like that its like this Then on realizing the significance of that the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimedThis book contains two sets of newly revised Dhamma talksThe edition of Amata Dhamma has been completely revised and has new additions including its new title To the Last BreathDirections for Insight  the second part of this book  was only slightly revised although it now has its proper title back which somehow had become lost in the first printingAs Acharn Panyavaddho explained in the introduction he wrote for the Amata Dhamma  of these talks were given for the benefit of MrsPowpanga Vathanakul who had been staying in Wat Pa Bahn Tahd Udornthani Thailand since the beginning of NovemberThe other talk The Middle Way was actually given to the assembly of bhikkhus at the Wat in and was one which MrsPowpanga found useful She stayed at Wat Pa Bahn Tahd for almost four months and VenAcharn Maha Boowa gave about talks during that periodThe second part of this collection Directions for Insight seems to fit in well with the general approach of To the Last BreathIt is made up of six Dhamma Talks by Acharn Kor KhaosuanluangKhun Phoon Phongphanit a lay disciple of Acharn Kor suggested a joint translation of these six Dhamma talks originally printed under the title Na Naew Mong Darn NyThey form one booklet of a series printed over the years by Upasika Kee Nanayon who used the pen name Kor KhaosuanluangKhun Phoon Phongphanit should receive special thanks for all his work in seeing that translation into printThe first translation of To the Last Breath was mainly the work of VenBhikkhu AjThe present editor who also assisted at that time has now completely revised the whole translation and so must bear responsibility for the errorsAny merit arising from my work on this book may it be dedicated to my motherMay she find peace and happinessAnyone who has visited the forest monasteries of Thailand will need no introductionThey will have seen Acharns who teach in a spontaneous and direct way and who live as they teachThis is Forest Dhamma vigorous but without pretension inspiring one to live and practice the Way rather than reading about itYet here is a book  and a translation of a book at that  that can only attempt to offer a partial view of certain aspects of that TeachingThis is especially so with the first part of this collection of Dhamma talks To the Last BreathFor these were given under quite special circumstances A person quite knowledgeable about Buddhism is dying of cancerThe emphasis is therefore very much on dealing with pain suffering and finally deathAnd pointing towards that which is beyond suffering and deathThese circumstances mean that the beginning fundamentals of Dhamma practice are generally assumed to be already understoodFor those new to Dhamma however it is important to remember the special context and to take into account the other Dhamma qualities that make an essential foundation that will need to be cultivatedThe Lord Buddha gave an important example of this when he would begin his Dhamma Teaching with the Progressive or Graduated SermonThen the Lord delivered a graduated discourse to Kutadanta on generosity on morality and on heaven showing the danger degradation and corruption of sensedesires and the profit of renunciationAnd when the Lord knew that Kutadantas mind was ready pliable free from the hindrances joyful and calm then he preached a sermon on Dhamma in brief on suffering its origin its cessation and the path It is this joyful calm pliable ready mind  already settled firmly upon foundations of generosity and morality  that is receptive to the powerful Truths about pain suffering and deathIt is at this point that the emphasis changes to energetic striving to overcoming the obstacles that prevent insight and pin us blindly to the wheel of birth and deathThen the Lord said to the monks Now monks I declare to you all conditioned things are of a nature to decay  strive on untiringly These were the Tathagatas last words In this book you will find both these aspectsThere are constant references to gradually steadily step by step level by levelThese lead into a growing emphasis on earnestness and diligence in practiceAny translation is the impossible search for just the right wordThe expression that conveys both the sense and accuracy in a pleasing way and that also brings with it the spirit of the originalThis translation is much more of a blind gropingFirst there is the wide language and cultural gap between Thai and EnglishThen there is the change of medium from the living word to the printed page which must always lose the dynamism of the original experienceFinally and perhaps the most important point there is the great profundity of Dhamma which is really beyond the translators level of understandingThe reader will therefore need to make due allowance for the deficiencies in this translation effortThe only way truly to understand is to translate it back into your own life your own experience and practiceEven with its errors and inadequacies this book is the result of a great effort by many peopleIt will have all been worth while if a single person finds some truth in it that can help him or her face up to their situation their illness and painInsight into that suffering may they go beyond a mere books description to true liberationVenerable Acharn Maha Boowa was born in Udornthani Northeast Thailand inHe became a monk in the customary way at a local monastery and went on to study the Pali language and textsAt this time he also started to meditate but had not yet found a suitable TeacherThen he caught sight of the VenAcharn Mun and immediately felt that this was someone really special someone who obviously had achieved something from his Dhamma practiceAfter finishing his Grade Three Pali studies he therefore left the study monastery and followed VenAcharn Mun into the forests of NEThailandWhen he caught up with VenAcharn Mun he was told to put his academic knowledge to one side and concentrate on meditationAnd that was what he didHe often went into solitary retreat in the mountains and jungle but always returned for help and advice from VenAcharn MunHe stayed with VenAcharn Mun for seven years right until the VenAcharns passing awayThe vigour and uncompromising determination of his Dhamma practice attracted other monks dedicated to meditation and this eventually resulted in the founding of Wat Pa Bahn Tahd in some forest near the village where he was bornThis enabled his mother to come and live as a nun at the monasteryVenAcharn Maha Boowa is well known for the fluency and skill of his Dhamma talks and their direct and dynamic approachThey obviously reflect his own attitude and the way he personally practiced DhammaThis is best exemplified in the Dhamma talks he gives to those who go to meditate at Wat Pa Bahn TahdSuch talks usually take place in the cool of the evening with lamps lit and the only sound being the insects and cicadas in the surrounding jungleHe often begins the Dhamma talk with a few moments of stillness  this is the most preparation he needs  and then quietly begins the Dhamma expositionAs the theme naturally develops the pace quickens and those listening increasingly feel its strength and depthThe formal Dhamma talk might last from thirtyfive to sixty minutesThen after a more general talk the listeners would all go back to their solitary huts in the jungle to continue the practice to try to find the Dhamma they had been listening about  inside themselvesThis heart of ours is much like a childThe child is unable to take care of itself and so has to depend on mother and father on guardians and nursemaids holding on to various peopleBut the child at least has parents and guardians to look after it to make sure it seldom meets with harmWhereas although the heart is always grasping and clinging to various things it doesnt find any such safety and securityThe heart cant rely on itself and therefore always likes to cling onto thingsFor the most part it tends to reach for wrong things for things that do it harmThe reason it likes to search for and hold on to things is so that it can find safety security and comfort for itselfThe things it clings to however are not dependable and so they pose a constant danger for the heartWhether we are children or already grown up this is the way our minds tend to beInstead of trying to rely on ourselves we always put our hopes in other things other peopleWe cant stand on own two feetThis is because the heart isnt wise enough to check whether the objects it grasps hold of are right or wrong good or badIt doesnt know how to care for itself how to help itself because theres no one to teach itTheres nobody to advise on how to know which things are dangerous and which are beneficial which things should be held on to and which things shouldntThe heart therefore continues indiscriminately to grasp hold of anything whether good or bad as long as it likes the look of itEven if it isnt gratifying the hearts characteristic trait is still to keep on grasping and clingingWhy should it be like thisNormally one wouldnt think that a mood or a thing thats displeasing is worth clinging toYet the heart continues to grasp hold of such thingsIt clings to anger to delusion and lust hatred and disgust because it becomes involved and caught up in themWe can never say that the heart simply knows an object for it always gets caught up in it and clings to itFor the most part those things have nothing good in themWhy does the heart have to go and grasp at thingsIts because it is attracted without realizing the repercussions of its attachmentEven though you may wish to break away from it you cant because theres something else which is powerful enough to force the heart to grasp and hang onThe object then becomes caught up in emotions which continually overcloud and obscure yourselfHere were talking about emotional objects and moodsNow Ill speak about material objectsThe heart will grasp at and cling to whatever object is presentIt doesnt matter how trifling or significant how valuable or worthless it might be the heart can and will attach itselfWe wouldnt be wrong if we were to call the heart an expert hangeronThis is because its still unable to rely on itself and so must depend on outside things until the end of the body that has led one through the changing situationsIt may even forget itself by surrendering to the power of external objects even though their control is baseless and leads the wrong wayThe Lord Buddha taught that self is the protector of selfTry to cure the heart of its dependency of the tendency it has of always hoping to rely on other thingsDisengage yourself from such objects and turn inward to rely more on your own resources and abilitiesDont depend on your parents friends and others so much that you forget yourselfOur human trait of continually seeking support in other people develops eventually into a personal habitIts like this all over the world and in this regard we can hardly even measure up to some kinds of animalsThis then is why the Lord Buddha taught about selfrelianceIn our commonplace and coarse affairs like work and other such responsibilities we should try to be more selfreliantComing in towards Dhamma  the practice of meditation in the heart  we need to have had sufficient training under a Teacher to know the right direction in which to proceedThe actual practice though is the duty of each one of us to find assurance in our selfreliance following the principles of DhammaThe Lord Buddha taught for example about cultivating goodness and virtue through generosity precepts and meditationThis is so that we can develop selfreliance which is the heart firmly holding to good and wholesome objectsThere is then peace and happiness in both the present and future lives because they are beneficial things and originate from wholesome actionsThey make up fine objects or superior quality food for the heartWe are taught to meditate which is a step higher in refinementThis effort to train ourselves in meditation is a way of selfreliance that is steadily taken onto a firmer and more dependable levelWe use a meditationword as the means to direct and control the heartFor as the mind is not yet able to sustain itself we have to rely on the meditationword as the object to soothe and bring peace and calmThe settling of the mind in buddho buddho buddho is one example of thisIt is an object for the heart to occupy itself with which is correct and right and appropriate to finding refuge in DhammaIn the beginning of the practice the heart is still restless and distracted still unable to settle itself on Dhamma principles and become selfreliantIt has to depend on a meditationword to direct it until it merges in with that meditationword and gathers into stillnessWhen it enters calm even the meditationword itself ceases to be an issueThis is one step towards selfreliance for the meditationword can be released at this stage as the heart is well settled in calmThis is a foundation and refuge for the heart that can be clearly seenEven with just this much theres calm and ease in the heart that used to be restless and distracted unable to find any peaceThis is because the heart normally does not know peace but only trouble and unrest hunger and thirst worries and concerns over affairs that are of no use to it at allFor the most part these affairs are the hearts own thoughts and imaginings which poison and burn oneself  without anyone else being involvedThe Lord Buddha discovered the correct way to practice and achieved results to his hearts contentmentHe was therefore able to explain about the causes or the way to practice together with their fulfillment and fruitsHe taught us that the way to depend on oneself is through meditation and that this is the direct route to a firmly established selfrelianceBasing the heart in calm to whatever degree brings increasingly selfassurance and confidence  without having to ask anyone else about itYou will know from within yourselfThis is termed paccatam or sanditthikoThe knowledge of good or bad what needs remedying removing or developing will then arise in the heartThis will be understood by oneself and for oneself as the heart is more and more firmly establishedThe level of concentration once reached is already sufficient to form a foundation for the heart a home where the heart can find shelter and peaceAt the moment when we think so much that we feel fainthearted and weary we should turn inwards and meditateThe heart can then rest and be stilled from all its preoccupations finding peace and calmThis is called going inward for refuge to find a resting place of comfort and easeThis is one level of refuge for the heartThe next steps even though theyre still concerned with samadhi are proceeding into more subtle and refined aspects of the heartThe levels of momentary concentration access concentration and attainment concentration show the refining of samadhiThis culminates in attainment concentration and beyond that samadhi cant advanceOnce the heart has some degree of calm according to the level of samadhi achieved it is stilled and refinedHowever without developing mindfulness and wisdom it will just remain at that level lacking wisdom radically to uproot its defilementsIf we compare the defilements to a tree although we may have pruned the branches the main trunk remains uncut and is still capable of sending out new branchesThis is why were taught to investigate by way of wisdomWisdom is a keen intelligence and ingenuityIt is able to investigate and follow through without any limitationThe Lord Buddha described wisdomandknowledge  being even more refined than wisdom  in the Discourse of Setting the Wheel of Dhamma in MotionListen to thisNyaanam udapaadi panyaa udapaadi vijjaa udapaadi aaloko udapaadiKnowledge arose wisdom arose higherknowledge arose light aroseKnowledge or vijjaa refers basically to the Threefold KnowledgeWisdom arose and with greater refinement higher knowledge arose  arising right from this same heartWisdom is that which removes the defilements covering the heart whereas samadhi is simply that which herds the defilements together in quietness within the heartIt is not yet capable of cutting off any defilementsThe hearts attachment which embroils it with various things remains intact though its weakeningOnce the heart gains some calm and peace wisdom can come into its own as the important weapon that strikes down and uproots all the different defilements in the heart step by stepSamaadhiparibhaavitaa panyaa mahapphalaa hoti mahaanisamsaaThereWisdom once supported and nurtured in samadhi is of great fruit and great advantage Its examination becomes skilled its scrutiny agile and bold so that it is able to cut away the defilements one after anotherPanyaaparibhaavitam cittam sammadeva aasavehi vimuccatiThe heart nurtured with wisdom gains proper release from the cankersListen to thatIts wisdom alone that can uproot the defilements it doesnt matter whether they are gross intermediate or subtle no defilement lies beyond the scope of wisdomThis is a primary principle that secures the quality and value of our practice which is the total elimination of the defilements from the heartIts the same practice which the Lord Buddha and his Noble Disciples have already completed before usThus samadhi and wisdom cant be separated from each otherWhatever our character and tendencies might be samadhi is always needed as a quiet resting place for the heartThe heart rests from work by stilling in samadhi its thoughts and preoccupationsEven work in the world requires a period of rest and recuperation  making do without is just not possibleThis may certainly use up workingtime but just as eating uses up food and the money needed to buy that food it is necessary that the body has renewed vigour to continue its workResting and sleeping may waste some time but again they give the constitution new strength to fulfill its duties and tasksOtherwise it wont be able to go onThis use of time and material to provide for and restrengthen the body is certainly not wastedRather they act like fuel for a car which wont go anywhere without itSamadhi and wisdom have the same sort of relationshipThe mind needs time to be still and calm in samadhi and after it has rested it can then continue its investigation using mindfulness and wisdom in line with its abilitiesThis word wisdom describes something very subtle and broad ranging to accord with the character and tendencies of the person bringing it into useAny approach we use to investigate for the sake of uprooting the defilements is termed right wisdomIts not necessary always to have to go and read the scriptures in order to know how to deal with the defilements and in order for it to be DhammaThese texts were extracted from the heart that is Dhamma which had actually performed the uprooting of the defilements and clearly seen the fruitsOnly then was it written down in the scripturesSo its not the case that the texts originated before the Truth  which is the actual practiceThe Lord Buddha was the first to practice and so no scriptures had been made for him to useWhen he taught his disciples the Noble Truths he didnt write them down in palm leaf textsHe taught them by word of mouth and then his disciples themselves carried on the Teaching through word of mouthWhere did they get their teachings From the reality in their hearts which they had seen clearly as a result of their own practiceIt is for this reason that the techniques and strategies of mindfulness and wisdom depend primarily on the individualEach of us needs to think examine investigate and work out strategies using our own intelligence and abilities according to each caseTherefore theres no need always to go back to retrieve scriptural authority with questions like Ive thought this up myself so it cant possibly deal with the defilements This way of thinking is not in accord with the principles of Dhamma and cant be called right wisdomWhen those things we remember from the scriptures cant be actualized in ridding our heart of any defilements then this too for us isnt right wisdomIt may be right wisdom in the scriptures but its wrong in the way its usedThe Dhamma is only explained to a limited extent in the scripturesIts not really all that muchIf we compare it to a medicine its a general nonspecific remedy rather than one aimed at a particular illnessOur integrating and formulating a specific approach capable of dealing with each particular defilement is termed medicineIt is a remedy aimed at steadily uprooting a certain defilementThis is why those who are successfully practicing in the way of wisdom have Dhamma have mindfulness and wisdom with them wherever they areVenAcharn Mun once said that he listened to Dhamma day and nightJust think of thatThings keep making contact with our senses of sight hearing smell taste and touch at all timesIf the knowledge of this contact doesnt arise at the heart which is waiting with acknowledgment where else is it going to occurWhat is it that acknowledgesThe hearts acknowledging also stirs up mindfulness and wisdom which must come in to examine the ongoing involvement with a wellfounded scrutiny that accords with cause and effectIt checks out the contact and when it knows it is able progressively to withdraw or let goThis is what is called listening to Dhamma day and night listening to Dhamma in the primal principles of natureDefilements are natural principles together with the heartDhamma with its virtue samadhi and wisdom are natural principles within the heartIt all depends on how we bring them out to use in our investigating utilizing them to full advantage according to the ability of mindfulness and wisdom which is the ideal instrument to useThe bodyListenElements aggregates bodyThe Lord Buddha had them and all his disciples have had themAt one stage they seized hold and attached to those aggregates just as we do nowSuch defilements were the same for them as they are now for usBut by grasping and attaching to we establish conditions and causes for the accumulation of defilement in our heartsThe Lord Buddha and his arahant disciples formerly had defilements  just like us now  so why was it possible for them to uproot themThe body is the same the five aggregates are the same yet they could release their attachment whereas we cantWhyWe dont seem able to understand yet how was it that they were able to gain realizationWhy cant we also comprehendThe heart is present and mindfulness and wisdom can be built up in each aspect according to whatever angle we wish to take up for examinationThis body which exists right with us here now is something that can be known and understoodWhen we say that the heart cant depend on itself what it all comes down to is that it needs to depend on the bodyMoreover it not only relies on the aggregates but also holds to them as being selfThereWe depend on them and unashamedly uphold them as selfWhat about that thenEven with some measure of shame they inevitably must be held onto because comprehension is still lacking and without it any possibility of lettinggoSo it is quite correct to say that weve been shameless and we need to admit to our stupidityFrom here we must endeavor to develop some cleverness that will see these things and let go of them through the strength of our own effortsSo for once lets get down to the factsThese things follow the principles of nature and remain as they are they whereas we exert ourselves to pull them in as ourselfNow that is going to make problems because it goes against the truth of thingsTo be in line with the facts you have to investigate to see according to the truth about themRepeatedly examine and keep on investigating until you can understandOnce you understand you wont have to order the mind to let goIt will let go on its own because these things are poisonous and harmful to us owing to our own attachmentThere are certainly no benefits in this attachmentIf there were any merit or advantage the Lord Buddha would have told us to grasp hold  but then such advice would not be needed as the heart would have already involved itselfIt is that attachment that is the truly poisonous and harmful thingEven though those things may be dangerous to us we still seize and bring them close inWe hold them by making the assumptions that Im like this Im like that they are me they are mineThe trouble arises right there with these assumptions and notions based in delusionNone of these aggregates have any meaningfulness in themselvesThey exist in truth in the same way as trees and mountains and such likeWe are conscious of their various aspects and this makes it the affair and concern of the heartOnce dead we cant be aware of them which shows that its all mixed up with the heartIf we are here there is no happiness if we go theres no contentment if we grasp hold theres no peaceAnd this goes on and on and onHow exasperating and vexing this can beThis heart is totally filled with delusionWhatever aspect it exposes there is nothing but delusion and harmful attachmentsWe murmur that the heart cant depend on itself and so has to go and hang onto this thing or thatOur investigation through wisdom is carried forth so that we can understand this whole situationThen we can push away press on out disentangle and steadily attain to selfrelianceWe give other things a complete looking over and can manage to understand themWe look at building homes women men animals and material thingsWe can tell whether theyre good or bad valuable or not worth keeping or not  yet why cant we realize this about our bodyNot only do we fail to understand but we also love and grasp hold of it in attachmentWe wouldnt dare love or hold on to outside things in the same way especially if we know theres nothing good in themWe wouldnt have anything to do with themYet here we will take it all  the good with the badWhat can one sayThis is where we really show our stupidityThese eyes in our head see what the body is like our heart knows but its all on the superficial level of commonplace peopleIt therefore keeps on going in a stubborn unrelenting way without true knowledge following the commonplace mundane understandingThis is really the commonplace way of ignorance the ordinary type of delusion in the circle of knowledgeIts out of line with the truth which is why we must find a way to introduce truth into the heart for this is wisdomOnce wisdom is there we will realize the truth  no longer concealed  about ourselves incorporated in this physical bodyInspect it carefullyThis body is not all that big a fathom long a cubit wide and just a hands span thickWe ought to be able to look it all over  externally it should only take a momentOn the inside look deeply with a heartfelt examination following its present state and conditions to its final dissolutionIt doesnt really go anywhere it does nothing but advance towards its disintegration and a return to its original elementsAnd thats allUsing wisdom make a deepreaching and heartfelt investigation of this truthWhen the truth goes straight to the heart in a way beyond dispute the grasping and attachment will immediately withdrawIf the truth hasnt yet penetrated then investigate with wisdom until it doesThis wisdom doesnt appear from anyone elseThis profound insight into the body  which is right with us here  is something that arises from your own investigation your own understandingWhen that understanding is complete youll completely let goYoure the one whos been holding on and no one else can let go for you so investigate and free yourselfJust look on the body as something to lean upon and abide withIf through your stupidity and lack of wisdom you see it as yourself or as belonging to you it will cause you endless sufferingThis is especially so at the final breakup of the aggregatesYour worries and regrets loves and attachments will all go out of controlEven more than a kite with broken string on high youll spin along with the windNo one will know where youll come down and all this in spite of the fact that the body is not worth such affection and regretIt is wholly made up of things destined for dissolutionAre you going to persist in resisting the truthWhen the time comes theres no denying that the aggregates must break apartThis is the truthAre you going to set yourself against it by still loving and cherishing not wanting them to fail and fall apartIn this opposition to the truth you will only heap up suffering for yourself until finally there will be no way outUnless of course you take this present moment quickly to dispatch it through wisdomIf you succeed in this then you will receive that great gain  the supreme happiness of Nibbaana Nibbaanam paramam sukhamHowever if you should go against Dhamma then its also quite possible that at that moment youll lose your faculties and witsWisdom is a state of the art weapon system that should penetrate through your investigation to the truthRelease and let go in accordance with the truth both now while youre still living here and at the time of disintegrationWisdom will then have clearly appraised the present situation and the future  nothing can now pose a problemPleasures and pains are still present because the aggregates are still functioningThese things arise in dependence on one anotherAnd its the heart that acknowledges and takes responsibilityIt knows but doesnt graspYou should understand that there are two possible ways in which it can know  either knowinginlinewiththetruth or by knowingandseizingholdFeelings of whatever type or level are present with the aggregates but not in the purified heartThe arahant does not have to bear with the feelings of both aggregate and heart whereas us lot take up the contract to build the cycleofrebirthWhen this condition of various aggregates tilts and skews we follow and when it topples and falls were knocked sprawling with itIts because of the reliance we put on themThey lead us to tilt and we tilt to fall over and we fall tooWhen they lead us to stand in place we might be able also to hold up to a certain extent but they arent willing to stand stillEven if they persist and havent yet reached death we are more upset about dying than they areIts therefore necessary for us to investigate clearly to see with wisdom that these things are solely something to abide withDays minutes time steadily consumes everythingIf we see the way time and nature eat away gnaw away at these things well see that its like a dog gnawing away on a meaty boneTheres no difference at allIt keeps gnawing away biting and tearing until theres nothing left to get its teeth intoSo there is the eating away in just the same wayThey keep disintegrating bit by bit until they reach their final truthWhether were sitting standing walking lying down or sleeping soundly time keeps on eating away gnawing awayDisintegration diminishing and declineThe continual gnawing and consumingSo you think that you can oppose and stop thisNo theres no halting thisIt is the course of nature  something of massive proportionsOur assumptions are wrong and whats wrong is no match for whats right and trueDisintegration is quite the correct course it is following their principle of natureTo resist their essential nature is the hearts error that must end in sufferingStart right now with an allround investigation of these thingsWhen the time comes finally to go there will then be no trembling because your investigation and understanding are complete and youll know that this is the inevitable way of thingsTheres just no alternativeSo then let each thing go its own separate wayWhatever happens let it occur without trying to resist the truthPainful feelings burn away at the body and it gradually becomes brittle and overdoneIt steadily declines until it breaks apart and disintegratesHowever a heart circled with mindfulness and wisdom wont be broken wont be extinguished and wont hang onIt is its own self by itself selfreliant without needing to depend on anything  and infinitely at easeRight here is where we see the importance of investigation its value for the heartThis is why sages beginning with the Lord Buddha teach mindfulness and wisdom as their major point  so that we can take the mind drag the mind out of the bonfire and release it from dangerThe Teachings of every Buddha are taught in the same wayThis is because the natural principles are the same and the defilements are always the sameNo Buddha will teach differently or diverge from thisThe practice is always to remove the defilements  whether great or small  from the heartThis follows from the basic principles of Dhamma which they all teachIf we deviate from these principles well be the laughing stock of the defilementsTherefore investigateNo matter how broadly or how narrowly  take the whole universe and worldly elementsIs there anything there on which the heart can depend and which offers refugeTake note of this term refugeEven those things that are intimately associated with ourself are not safeFarther out than the body theres no hope of finding refuge in anythingEven those things closely connected with us arent trustworthyIf we cant discern the threat they pose then where else will we be able to see itIts here where the danger must be seen and the heart withdrawn from its perilThe quality that then arises in full measure is calledAttaa hi attano naatho self is the protector of selfIt doesnt depend on anythingVirtue samadhi or wisdom in the final stage of release are also terms no longer neededWhy should a refuge be found in tools and instruments that have successfully done their job of clearing out the defilementsThe tools are laid down in accordance with their conditionA knife taken up to chop vegetables or to peel fruit is put aside when we take the food and eat itIts obvious that we dont eat the knife as wellVirtue samadhi and wisdom are tools for dealing with the defilementsWhen the defilements are eliminated all the problems for the heart also goWhile life remains these tools can be utilized for the sake of the world in line with conventional notionsHowever they wont be needed to correct the defilements ever againIn particular at the final time when the passage from the elements and aggregates will take place theres definitely no need for anythingMindfulness and wisdom are no longer an issue and the body poses no problem because all problems in the heart are already finished withNothing can possible cause concernSo you should move forward to this ending of problems for this is where all your worries will ceaseIf you still have problems  then that is a problemWe hear of problems concerning suffering and hardship concerning birth aging sickness and deathThey follow on from what we call problemsWith the ending of problems all issues ceaseInvestigate and understandAll the things Ive mentioned here lie in your own body or heartAnalyze them through the power of your mindfulness and wisdomExamine day after dayDont be complacentIts not that mindfulness and wisdom are something that can be brought in to cook and eat but they can be brought in to deal with the defilementsBy utilizing them in this way the removal can carry on all day longHowever complacency will only lead you to sink  and theres certainly nothing to be gained by thatThe final result will be that when youre stuck in a corner you wont even know where your wisdom has disappeared toYoull end up banging your head against the wallsThat certainly wont doWere not disciples of a Tathaagata the Lord Buddha who banged his head against the wallThe Lord Buddha didnt do it neither did the Noble Disciples whom we revere with Sangham saranam gacchaamiHow can we go and bang our heads in this wayYou must endeavor using whatever means and strategies to find the way that leads outTry to the best of your abilityReaching the limit of our capability then thats all we can manageWhatever state or level we reach we accept it  because thats as much as we can doBut as long as its not beyond our ability we can strive to go further struggling crawling and forcing our way throughSinking into the cycle of birth and death is similar to when a ship capsizes and everything on board goes downThe ship the goods and cargo all sink together and the people dieWe go down with the elements and aggregates through delusion and ignoranceThe body goes down in accordance with its nature but our heart sinks because of its own stupidityDo you approve of thatTheres nothing good about this fallThe heart goes straight down into the deep under the compulsion of delusion and that surely isnt goodIn fact its disastrously bad and unwished forIts for this reason that we have to make sure that we steadily look for a way outInvestigate to see the truth and especially the truth of the painful and unpleasant feelings of the body and heartThis is of great importanceThe heart goes in and seizes hold so much that it becomes a mental disease on top of everything elseRealize that the five conditions are not me Body feelings memory or perception mental formations and consciousness are particular conditions interdependent within the elements and aggregatesThe heart is something apartBy successfully analysing and dissecting using your mindfulness and wisdom youll reach safety from all dangerDeath  just let it go along its wayAll the things of this world die they have death builtinHow can you expect them to be constant and enduring  when the time comes for them to die they have to dieNothing can constrain or contradict thisEven arahants have to die for them however there is the difference that they pass away without concern and worryAs for us were worried even before we come to die  perturbed and possessiveOn death the worry and possessiveness intensify so that they pile up into a threat bigger than a mountainBe careful not to let that happen to youMake sure you get beyond such anxietiesAs Im always saying prepare and establish yourself with sufficient qualities  kusalaa dhammaa enough skill and intelligenceThis is our kusalaaKusalaa dhammaa akusalaa dhammaa Wherever theres akusalaa  unskillfulness or stupidity  drive it out with kusalaa skillfulness which is your own mindfulness and wisdomThis is what is called chanting kusalaa for oneself and its something you have to do for yourselfDepending on others to track down monks to chant kusalaa dhammaa after your death causes so much fuss and botherSomething we dont wantKusalaa dhammaa prepare yourself enough skillfulness complete and all encompassing and there will be no need for anything elseYoull die without turmoil and confusion like a sugatoSo then thats all for nowSelf is the protector of self for who else could protector beListening here to this Dhamma talk please make sure that you dont allow the mind to wander awayKeep it within yourself rather than sending it out following after various moods and imaginingsDont look back and pine after past thoughts and conceptions for here and now they cant bring any benefitAt this time you should be trying to suffuse the heart with Dhamma for it has become parched through its long deficiencyIts similar to a droughtridden jungle lacking in moisture where the dried out vegetation easily ignitesBoth living and dead trees are then scorched and consumedForest fires during the rainy season are rare but the hot season when the vegetation dries out brings a danger of fireThis may happen even in a forest monastery when it is very dryBahn Tahd forest monastery has in fact caught on fire several timesThis is due to its becoming dry and parchedWhen the heart becomes parched through lack of Dhamma to cool and nourish it the fire of the defilements can rapidly take holdThis will then scorch everything coming into experienceFire brings damage so when the defilements blaze within the heart how can the heart itself escape harmRegardless of its value it will become tarnished and eventually worthlessSuch is the way of the heart that has been constantly scorched and consumed by fireA fire will damage our possessions depending on its intensity and extentUnless of course they happen to be stored in a safeplace like a security vault which banks use to protect their valuablesBut do we have a safety vault or safe place within our heartsOr are we continually exposing ourselves to danger always leaving ourselves vulnerable without any concern for our deserving heartWe can use this approach when considering our situation and learning a lessonThe heart cannot find any happiness because its constantly being burntThis fire is the blaze of greed hatred and delusion that is described in the Fire SermonTheres nothing doubtful or uncertain about thisIts a timeless truthWe need to take these Dhamma questions onto a personal level carefully comparing and considering the correctness and truth of them there and then well at least be in a position to escape the heatWe will have found a breathing space a safe cool place and will no longer be always caught up in the conflagrationEach of you has made the effort to come here to practiceYou may consider it as a search for a safeplace for your riches  which are the virtue and skillfulness you have gathered and their protection from the devastation of the three great firesFighting ordinary outside fires is difficult enough especially when the blaze has taken such a hold that even water cant contain itThe hoses always seem to clog up and if that cant be fixed then the house will soon be charred remains and ashesTurning to extinguish the inner blaze however relies on the assiduous cultivation of virtueThe meditation on loving kindness for instanceThe heart is then calmed and concentrated cooled and strengthened so that it can quench the harmful fires withinFire almost by definition must be hotEven sparks burn and sting if were in their way when they fly upSo if we go along allowing ourselves to be burnt day after day after day  whats going to be leftThe heart will be burnt outThe body may remain but the heart will survive with a poor and indifferent sort of knowing without wholesome aspect because its totally given over to the allconsuming defilementsIt is a knowingness invested with suffering not with comfort and easeIt lacks lucidity and wisdom and is completely overwhelmed in sufferingSo much so that the heart seems worthlessIt will need a sustained effort in cultivating meditation to extinguish the fire within the heartThis will steadily bring peace and happinessAll the teachings of the Lord Buddha are within our reach and rangeHe never offered impossibilities or taught blindly and haphazardlyThose of us who practice should see these Dhamma teachings as being of vital importance and take them deeply to heartJust as we all shy away from pain and suffering  which nobody wants  so we must incline towards the remedy and antidoteAnd that is DhammaOn analysing the situation we will find that in doing the practice the question of easiness or difficulty doesnt appear so importantWe have already carefully reasoned it out and are satisfied and convinced of its effectivenessIts this that has obliged us to take up the practiceWe can only do our bestFor who isnt lazy when the defilements rule the roostThis laziness which loathes acting towards anything good or beneficial is with us allIt always likes to hold the lead but is certainly not going to deliver us from sufferingWe remain complacent and negligent steadily being dragged down through the deceit and coercion of the defilementsThe Lord Buddha himself also went through and then overcame these oppressions of the heartThis is something we should use as a reflection on our own situationThen when laziness and discouragement overwhelm us we can encourage and arouse ourselves with his ideal exampleA way will appear of resistance and commitment without always having to yield and submitIts difficult yes but just carry on and do itThe way to overcome and transcend suffering takes on a crucial importance if we acknowledge the truth of sufferingOtherwise this predicament that we detest and dread will always confront usBut merely intellectualizing about ways of escape without actually taking remedial action isnt going to get us anywhereIt doesnt matter whether a technique is easy or difficult as long as its effective in ridding the heart of its torments it must be appliedWe are all fellows and equal in suffering in birth and death amid the various realms of existenceEven after so long we are still equal first with no one coming in behindEach of us has gone through repeated birth and death matching each other in the suffering involvedThere can be no competition or rivalry here for we all manage an equal first and are all in the same boatInstead of achieving our top marks with the heart and Dhamma they come from being foremost together in suffering following the guidance and direction of the defilementsWithout going against that lead there will never be an end to sufferingDhamma is concerned with resisting the influence of the defilementsIt uses careful analysis and reason perceiving that the source of suffering and danger must be remedied in such and such a wayThe puttingtoright may be difficult or easy but that is beside the pointWhen the craftsman works he selects the appropriate tool for the job in handAs he selects his tool he isnt concerned with its weight but only with steadily accomplishing his taskThe tools selected to be used against the defilements and for establishing the heart in genuine wholeness and integrity come from the DhammaThese Dhamma tools are varied and need to be chosen to fit the circumstancesIf the heart is only mildly disturbed by the defilements we may apply a lighter controlThe level of mindfulness and wisdom the strength of application the length of our sitting or walking or investigating isnt yet of great significance because the work isnt at the critical stageHowever when the defilements rise up to disturb and obsess the heart and it finds it cant unburden or release itself we can no longer remain idle and indifferentNow is the time for actionWhatever is available is thrown in with a doordie attitude and without thought of surrender or defeat unless death does indeed come for its then beyond usOur response must be to mobilize all our resources and willingly endure the painful predicamentOur resistance might bring with it suffering but thats nothing compared with the aberrant effects of defilementborn sufferingIts this that sinks one so thoroughly that theres no telling when one might emergeWe all know about the discomfort and pain of sitting or walking in meditation for long periodsWeve experienced the difficulties involved in finding strategies and skillful means to oppose the defilementsWe know this muchBut when the fruits of our exertion arise it will be experienced as something truly remarkableThe happiness and wonder that arisesThe new insight with such ingenuity and resourcefulnessThis is exactly what we have been hoping forOnce the results arrive to join up with the cause well be able to cope with any obstacle or difficulty that may ariseIf there were only hardship and struggle without the final rewarding peace and contentment then no one in this world would be able to continueI dont mean just us ordinary people but even the Lord Buddha couldnt have awakened nor his enlightened disciples  whom we celebrate withBuddham Dhammam Sangham saranam gacchaamiI go for refuge to the Lord Buddha Dhamma and SanghaThe right time and opportunity will always eventually arrive and we will then be able to manage the taskPerseverance is therefore crucial as is a steady and systematic use of clear reasoning but should this weaken the defilements will immediately grow more threatening and incisiveWith strong effort with mindfulness and wisdom sharp and keen the defilements will gradually fall awayDefilements only fear Dhamma for nothing else can contain and subdue themDhamma is faith diligent effort mindfulness samadhi and wisdomFaith is trust in the fruits of the Lord Buddhas RealizationThat the Dhamma he offered to the world definitely leads out from suffering  it is the Niyyaanika DhammaThat if we too practice following the Lords teaching we will steadily and surely come to those same fruitsDiligent effort will always bring the right and proper result to any actionWhether the task be internal or external it will be well accomplished when supported by diligent effortThis will be evident in its outstanding and appropriate resultMindfulness is the vital factor that oversees each task preventing any negligence or errorSamadhi is the firm undistracted commitment to the task in hand right up to its final completionThat is the causal aspect while the samadhi of result appears in the established concentrated mindThe heart of peace and contentmentThe samadhi of cause concentrates on the action without vacillation or bias and the resulting samadhi state is that of tranquillityThis leads up to ekaggataa which the Lord Buddha described as the mind having only one object without depending on anything elseWisdom is penetrative discernment which is necessary in checking out each situation will it be damaging or fulfilling and effectiveWe must rely on wisdom to investigate and analyzeThese are the factors of Dhamma that will steadily lead us out from suffering accomplishing the work we set out to doThe Lord Buddha also described the Four Ways to Success as being of equal importanceThey areSatisfactionWhat is it that brings satisfaction to usIf we are content with defilements then that is what will spring upWhatever gratified us becomes the object of our searchWe want that and so that is what arisesHowever the Four Ways to Success are not concerned with such low gratifications but are directed at fulfilling our high and virtuous aspirationsThey are the four means to achieve those aims that lie within the reach of us human beingsTogether with satisfaction there is diligent effort attentiveness and application to the work and allaround wisdomThese combine to form a single effective force in accomplishing the single objectiveThis is the Dhamma that builds the complete and whole human beingThe heart becomes firmly basedEfforts to accomplish the work are consolidated with excellent principles methods and suitable customs and traditionsAll of this ensures that those who take up the practice do not go counter to the basic principles of DhammaOnce the heart is attuned to Dhamma in this way it is safeguarded with the Dhammaprotection and will steadily prosperHarmful factors will fade because regardless of how long the heart had fallen into misery it was not ruined without any hope of renewalFor once the heart is purged through exertion it will be left bright serene and happyThis then is the key the vital instrument in turning our aspiration into full realityA mere passive wishing or easy discouragement will abort such accomplishmentsWhatever you are doing or thinking never forget our great Teacher the Lord BuddhaWhen discouragement presses down recollect his exampleHis persistent exertion and his Awakening through using these Dhamma factors of faith effort mindfulness samadhi and wisdomThis is how he attained to AwakeningWhat direction should one take to develop and nourish peace of mindSo that at the very least you can claim to be following the way with a guide and teacherThe Lord Buddha explained his own fruitful practice in an orderly and methodical way so theres really no alternative way to tryDhammam saranam gacchaami I go to refuge in Dhamma  this phrase finds its source in the five factors of faith diligent effort mindfulness samadhi and wisdomIts these five factors that arose with the Lord Buddha himselfSangham saranam gacchaami  going for refuge to the Sangha is just the sameNone of the noble disciples regardless of their wealth or class were weakwilled or easily discouragedOnce gone forth into Dhammas Way they were characterized by their energy and diligent effortThis aspect of exertion is a vital factor in steadily uplifting the quality of ones heartThese five factors and four ways go together to raise the heart releasing it from the oppressed condition of worldlings sunk in sufferingSome of the disciples walked on their meditation path until their feet blisteredHows that for strivingSome didnt lie down for three months at a timeThe VenCakkhupala strove like that until his eyes ruptured and were broken and blindedIs that enduring in ones endeavor or notAs for us theres no need to ruin our body but it would be good if we could at least make the defilements suffer a bit so that they run away and hideDont let them swarm all over the eyes ears nose tongue body and mindOnce infested with defilements youll never be able to find Dhamma or anything essential within the heartHow on earth are you going to find any peaceWe must rely on these Dhamma factors to overcome those defilements that remain dominant in the heartThese principles of Dhamma must be taken deeply to heart  dont cherish anything elseThey are the tools that will steadily deliver the heart to the perfect freedom that we all prize so highlyYour choice is between the heart of freedom and the heart under the domination of the defilementsSo which is better the slave totally deprived of liberty or the free personWe have long been passively submissive under the mass of defilements and cravingIts only when we become weary of their domination and start to recognize their curse that well be able to resist by whatever way we canUltimately well have to rely on these five essential Dhamma tools to finish off and eliminate the defilementsWhere is the arena and battleground for anyone going into Dhamma practiceWhat do those who relentlessly walk their meditation path or sit crosslegged day and night take as their battlefield and zone of investigationThe Lord Buddha brought forward the Four Noble Truths from the principles of DhammaThese Four Noble Truths are there within the body and mind of human beingsYou are human so when you walk or sit in meditation searching for truth and Dhamma its obvious that you must look for the Noble TruthsWe are aware of the suffering that arises in the body and mind of human beings and animalsWe unlike the animals know a way to remedy the situationHow can this suffering be so welcome and desirableWhen it appears in the body its plainly unwished for yet even with bodily ease and comfort any suffering that comes up will bring anxiety and negative unsightly behaviorAnd increasing distress manifests in an even more unattractive wayThe tormented heart will always expose itself in detrimental ways for instead of alleviating and ridding itself of suffering it actually makes the situation worseThe idea that one can be rid of suffering  get it off ones chest  with harsh words and offensiveness is completely mistakenIn reality the perpetrator not only hurts others with outpourings from a soiled heart but also increases his own sufferingHe spreads and multiplies his troubles rather than throwing them outOne element of the Noble Truths concerns the searching into how suffering actually arisesWe may be aware of suffering but to do anything about it we need to know its rootcauseThis is the originator the producer of suffering or samudayaThe Lord Buddha usually explained this as sensual craving craving for existence and craving for noexistenceDesire for things that I love and aversion for what I dislike is the source of our sufferingThose thought fabrications based in defilements are producing suffering and so can be classed as a sourceAll these branches and ramifications spring from one main trunk  and thats in the heartThe heart is embedded with the roots of greed hatred and delusionExamine your body and then turn your inspection inward to the heartCheck on its ongoing thoughts and fabricationsWhat do you findThe endless proliferating of thoughts that contrive and process suffering for both yourself and othersThe Lord Buddha taught about the application of mindfulness and wisdom to inspect whats going onThe heart appears anxious and concerned for these aggregatesBut whats the point in thatThe aggregates have their space here so surely theres room enough in a cemetery or crematorium ahead just as there is for everyone else in the worldWhat can all this concern and possessiveness achieveWheres the advantageWont the result be that of unfulfilled desires that breed suffering for the heartThe Lord Buddha therefore advised against indulging such desires and to turn and examine the actual situationThe bodily aggregate is fashioned and put together and is thus also destined for eventual breakupJust thatThis can be irrefutably seen once wisdom is brought to bear and then any possessiveness seems altogether pointlessWe can then let go our grasp and allow the body to follow its own nature whether its still holding together or has entered the inevitable final phase of dissolutionThis world is full of cemeteries awaiting each person and animalExamining the truth we can no longer doubt the reality of our reserved plot or indeed the inevitability of our future deathClearly acknowledging this mortality means we can then let go of our worries and concernDeath is a fundamental part of the law of nature that can neither be denied or defiedLet nature take its course and the earth water air and fire will follow their own essential naturesThat which knows should genuinely know and not mistake water fire and air as myselfThis acts like a parasite hooking in and trapping the heart in turmoilWe mistake them for self and thereby fall into sufferingThe aggregate of feeling is much the sameWe have experienced pleasure and pain from the day of our birth up to the presentWhether it was a feeling of body or heart its all about impermanence suffering and notselfIt arises so as to pass away When this assumptions and suppositions has come forward nothing is able to keep steady and unchangingWhere exactly is the suffering in feelingBodily pains are not too difficult to examine when wisdom penetrates throughBut the painful feeling in the heart  this is importantWhen there is bodily pain there is also pain and suffering in the heart that arises because of the source of sufferingThis is the way that the defilements trick all beings in the world with their beguilementsThe deception of taking this body as myself must be cleared by a thorough analysis of the true nature of the bodyThe investigation of pleasant and unpleasant feeling is aimed at erasing from the heart the notion that this feeling is myselfLet things be as they truly are feeling is feeling while this is me which is that knowingnessDont mix them upBut anyway thats not possible as they are intrinsically differentHow can they become merged together into oneCan two individuals be combined as only oneHaving to bear the burden of one person is heavy enough  but to have the extra weight of two three four or five others We dont just take up the body but also shoulder the other four aggregates which press down with the weight of attachmentIts the heart that takes responsibility and so the heart alone must bear the consequencesThat is suffering  and theres no compensation to be foundAnd yet we still persist with such hanging onThis needs looking at to see the true nature of painThere is then the aggregate of perception or memory that remembers something only to forget it againWhen that memory is required we may recall it anew and then it will fade away again  sanyaa vaassa vim hatiThats how the Lord Buddha described it and who can argue with thatPerception is impermanent memory fades into forgetfulness  sanyaa aniccaaThis aniccaa was explained by the Lord Buddha and its this that we now use when we chant for the deadAniccaa vata sankhaaraa  impermanent are all conditioned thingsBut no chants or spells are able to conjure up a person or a selfYou wont find any sign of self in all the five aggregates for they are impermanent suffering and notselfInvestigate and analyze through to a more refined understandingDont be so afraid of dying for death like that isnt found with the heartBy bringing in such fears youll only succeed in deceiving yourself and piling up sufferingThis goes counter to Dhamma to the truth taught by the Lord BuddhaIf you accept his Way then obviously you should follow it and see the truth for yourself rather than going against itThis is the true going for refugeBuddham saranam gacchaami Its a discerning of the truth of the heart rather than a mere mouthing of wordsThe Lord Buddha offered this Teaching to all creatures of the world and as that includes us why shouldnt we too be able to comprehend the Four Noble TruthsTheyre there within each one of usNow about thoughtconcocting formationsIs this contriving and fabricating of thoughts trustworthyWe think up various forms from various things  for instance take the form of a doll that is quickly brokenOur thoughtfabrications are much the sameWe think up good or bad anything at all becomes a concoction to fool ourselvesThis is why the heart is the chief of fools gullible and easily taken in by any deceptionIt believes in anything and is endlessly played falseHowever when wisdom is also present it will be able to keep in check and carefully screen such fabricationsThey may appear a hundred or thousand times a second but wisdom is ready at every turnWhat can fool wisdomIt realizes that formations are formations and that knowingness is the heartHow can it be deceived by themWhy be startled and react to shadows arising from oneself  for this is what formations areIt is the same with consciousness that flicks on and off whenever anything contacts through the senses and is known by the heartIt is then concocted through formations and memory into selfcontrived delusionsWe repeatedly fall for our selfmade fancies and its this wrong taking up of objects that creates sufferingThe damage is done here and this is where it must be seenYou will learn about the Noble Truths right at this pointFollow and probe into it with greater precision and refinement without concern over how many times you have to go over itThe importance lies in the eventual clear penetration of wisdom which can pierce through any attachment even if it may seem as big as a mountainWhen wisdom is in close pursuit craving will have to retreat into the big cave into the heartDriving forward with wisdom using impermanence suffering and notself exactly where the real substance of these shadows is foundPenetrating further you will see that it only exists there in the heart where they have gathered togetherElsewhere its just disassociated shadows excitement and deception over form feeling perception formations and consciousnessOnce they have all converged the heart must turn and investigate right there in the heartAt this point we must be willing to follow them in and destroy them there in their hiding place in the heartThey are like brigands in ambush waiting to shoot our heads offWhen bandits take over a place no matter how valuable the building might be we must go in with explosives and blow them out destroying it all including the banditsIf all must be obliterated  so be itWe still have life and can build again for we managed to avoid dying tooThis is how to deal with this most subtle sort of defilement hiding out in the heartHit them hard with the truth of impermanence suffering and notself because these defilements are the essence of sammuti  all our suppositions about the worldThey must be crushed and dispersed from the heart and then well see whether the heart has also been annihilatedNo it is not destroyedThe heart has no cemeteryIt is undying by its very nature  even when it still has defilementsThe Lord Buddha called this the complete dissolution of the defilements the end of danger the quenching of the fires of greed hatred and delusion by the pouring of the Undying Dhamma elixirWith the defilements gone only spotless purity remainsIt is here in this fully purified heart that perfect happiness is to be foundAll work finishes here all projects end hereThe Lord saidDone is the task fulfilled is the holy life there is no further work to do All suffering ends with this right understandingThe summit of Dhamma is found in this purified heartThe Buddham Dhammam Sangham saranam gacchaami that we repeat to reverently recollect the Lord Buddha all gather and converge in this pure natureBuddho Dhammo Sangho are exactly this pure natureConcern with questions about the Lord Buddhas final passing away in India  how many centuries ago is it now  will now endThe true nature of Buddha Dhamma and Sangha will now be evident in ones own heart of purityThis is the hearts priceless treasure where the true state of things is seen and all questions settledWhere did the Lord Buddha go when he finally passed awayThe bodily aggregate certainly disintegrated following its nature  bodies being the same anywhereHowever the purified nature Buddho was not destroyed or annihilated for it is not confined by time or positionIt is this that we refer to in Buddham Dhammam Sangham saranam gacchaamiWhen we can experience this for ourselves we will be able to verify with complete certainty that this nature cannot be annihilatedThe arahant disciples understand thisWherever they may be they are together with Dhamma with Buddha Dhamma and Sangha having constant audience with the Lord BuddhaTheir minds are unshakable because the fires of desire are quenched with the waters of DhammaThe quelling and cessation of all conditioning factors is supreme happiness These conditioning factors are really samudaya the source of suffering so when this is ended all that remains is supreme happinessThe means and the results the good and the bad are within all of us who are aware and careThis nature that knows is uniquely suited to all levels of Dhamma up to and including the state of purity and theres nothing apart from this knowledgePlease try steadily to purify this nature that knows ridding it of all obstructions and oppressive influencesThere will then be no need to make enquiries about Nibbana for having experienced the purified heart all questions will be finally settledIts appropriate to stop this Dhamma talk hereThe Dhamma of the Lord Buddha was revealed correctly and properlyIt was neither hidden nor obscured but was clearly presented on every level according to the truthFor example it states that virtue and wrongdoing heaven and hell Nibbaana all really do existIt continues unequivocally to maintain that the defilements are also things present and extantThese truths cant be deniedYet why do such things pose a problem for usThe Dhamma was openly and forthrightly presentedThere was nothing esoteric and mysterious about it for it was expounded entirely in accordance with truth  the reality thats present nowIt was offered from every aspect and level of truth and yet we still cant understand itIts as if the Lord Buddha is saying to the blind and the deaf Look hereLook at thisApparently we must be like those blind people who can only grope around but cant actually seeEven though we know that the Lord has already explained all about it we still always seem to bump into sufferingWeve been told that suffering isnt something to welcome and yet we are constantly caught up by itThis is because our motives  the causes we put into effect  become aimed entirely at amassing the fire of suffering to heap on ourselvesOne quality of Dhamma that the Lord has pointed out is that it is visible here and now  sanditthikoHappiness and suffering can both be seen and experienced within ourselvesDeath is one example of thisThe other qualities of ehipassiko and opanayiko are also very important principlesEhipassiko means calling one to come and see the genuine DhammaThis though does not mean that we should go out calling other people to come and see itEhi refers to teaching the one listening to Dhamma and practicing it so turn your heart to look inwards to where the truth is foundUsing more worldly terms we can say that the truth is constantly proclaiming itself constantly inviting and challenging  because of its candour and honesty it challenges us to look hereThis ehi invites you to look rather than getting other people to come and seeHow can others see when they neither know the truth nor where to look for itThe truth is in themselves but if they dont search for it there then they are certainly not going to find the truth inside usEhipassiko  the Lord taught us to look at the truth the truth about ourselves that is right hereOpanayiko means to bring withinWhatever we see or hear or touch needs leading inside so that we can make good use of itAnything coming into contact through the eyes ears nose tongue and body or appearing in the heart must always be opanayiko  brought inwardWhether it is concerned with goodness or wickedness happiness or suffering the internal or external past or future it must all  opanayiko  incline towards the heartFor this is the principle source of all internal affairsThe heart is preeminent and nothing surpasses it in importanceThe issue of the heart is therefore pressing and critical All dhammas originate from the heartThis statement alone is enough to shake up the entire physical worldOnes slightest movement must originate in the mind and in fact all dhammas must look to the heart as being foremostOnly the heart is able to know about all the various thingsWhat are these various kinds of dhammaThere are wholesome dhammas and unwholesome dhammas These are only found in the heartWholesome dhammas come from the resourcefulness and cleverness of the heart which enables it to respond quickly and appropriately to the ongoing situationIn fact the various issues and consequences of these ongoing events spring from our own heartWhen unwholesome dhamma arises in the heart bring up the investigative wisdom of wholesome dhamma to examine and rectify our foolishness  which is that unwholesome dhamma  so that it can be disposed ofOpanayiko is the inclining drawing inward of any experienceWhether it be one of foolishness or cleverness happiness or suffering coming from anyone whatsoever it all needs to be brought inside and made a lesson for the heartEhipassiko is the viewing of the point source the well spring of all issuesAnd that is the heartIts involved in neverending activity outperforming commonplace machinery that starts and stops according to its fixed scheduleThe heart is never shut down but goes on and on until the last day of lifeIt makes no difference how much we grumble and complain about the suffering involved in this state of affairsOnly by correcting it at its root cause will there be any practical valueRectify the cause and the resultant suffering will diminish  in proportion to the proficiency of our circumspection and wise judgmentThe Lord Buddha never pointed away from these principles for that would be like teaching one to catch hold of distant shadowsThere over there  whereby one overlooks the real perpetrator the original causeThis is of paramount importance because thats where the defilements are bornWhat are we going to doHow are we going to copeWhat is the origin of the suffering and the hardship that all beings must endureWhat is the source of birth aging sickness and deathThe defilements are the source and the primemover and yet they themselves can only arise in the heartThey are right hereThats why the Lord didnt teach about other placesSo when we get down seriously to investigate the structure the cause and effect of all this and gradually see the truth and steadily uproot the defilement  we must do it hereThis is the spot where our ignorance and stupidity binds and confines us allowing the defilements to accumulate and growThis is also the place where mindfulness and wisdom as they increase in their range and discernment must uproot the defilementsMindfulness must be maintained there with care and vigilanceThis place  which is the heart  needs to be closely protected and sustained nourished with mindfulness and with meditationMindfulness protects the heart by not allowing it to stray outside whereby it would involve itself in external affairs and finally return with fireFrom protection one moves to eradication by analysing and probing into the reasons for this situationWe must then try to correct whatever is detrimental by examining its fundamental nature and rectifying it at its place of originThe essential point at issue lies with the heartIt is the heart that takes up birth and endlessly wanders through the repeated cycles of birth and deathThe accumulated corpses of just one person would be enough to fill the whole world  yet ignorance so blinds the owner that nothing is known about the true extent of the situationWhat remains is just deception and delusion where no essence of truth can be foundThis is where you should try to advance your mindfulness so that it can come to terms with the thoughts and imaginings bubbling up in the heartWith awareness in attendance the slightest rippling of agitation in the heart will simultaneously arouse mindfulness and wisdom As we sit and watch right at the place where all developments originate  right at the heart  we will gradually start to notice the first flurries of activityThis is where the deception of the heart begins and the heart will need wisdom to get to the truth of itWell also have to investigate the nature of the body until insight is implanted in the heart so that the truth of each bodily part is deeply felt by the heartBy repeatedly examining and going over each part the heart will understand more and more and the initial understanding will deepen to profound convictionFormListen what is this formHair of the head hair of the body nails teeth and skin flesh sinews and bones These are all formThis includes every internal bodily part and organ that is on the physical and material sideThe Lord called this the form aggregate or simply the bodyAll right thenLets look at thisWhile exploring and probing mindfulness will need to follow each observation of a part or organ of the bodyLet mindfulness direct the work of investigation being constantly in attendanceLet wisdom screen and process the information for a more and more subtle understandingThis is our work and taskOur previous occupation with thinking and imagining with drifting and wandering always lacking in mindfulness has been of enormous harm to the heartWhereas this other work is directly leading to the ending of the internal suffering and dangerMindfulness holds down each piece of work while wisdom explores and knowledge follows through each bodily part and provides a guideline for the heart to followMindfulness and wisdom must constantly follow along closely as writing follows the ruled lineThis is the Kammatthana Tour the sightseeing meditation trip around the cemetery found within ourselvesYou must not allow wishful overeagerness for a speedy realization to interfere with the investigationKeep your understanding following what is currently being investigatedContinue the analysis and differentiate and penetrate into the nature of this bodily aggregateIts covered with a mere membrane of skin  that still manages to deceive the eyes of us allIts not even as thick as a palmleaf manuscriptThats skinYet whichever way your investigations proceed they must always be aimed at the overcoming of delusionThat wont be all for they will soon start to become a quite fascinating and absorbing exercise tooAlrightLets take this body and look up to the top and down to the bottomLets see its outside and its insideLets immerse ourselves in this tour not merely going along for the ride but with mindfulness in full attendance together with wisdom checking each experienceIn this way wherever you look youll find the true DhammaThis can be considered the work of purging and eliminating the poison of attachment which infiltrates and infects every part of the bodyIt is primarily because of this attachment that suffering is spread everywhereThis universal suffering refers to the suffering in the heart caused by attachment rather than any other sortThe bodily pain and suffering arising from illness  the aggregates must always fall under the law of impermanence suffering and notself  was experienced by the Lord Buddha and the noble disciplesBut the heart that has transcended those conditions or is in a position to do so can observe  without negligence  these things so that its no longer affected by themThis is because the envisioning of oneself is done so that you can investigate and get to the truthThis is the important factor in preventing anything from affecting the heartIn other words suffering can no longer arise within because the body is no longer imagined and credited as being me or mineExamine this bodyProbe right into itAlright then what is skin really likeHow about those animal hides that are made into handbags and shoesLets look at the whole lot the flesh sinews and boneSee hereBoth animal flesh and human flesh are much the sameDelve into it  whats the nature of boneWhats the difference between animal and human boneLook to see the full truth within yourselfCarry on inPenetrating this body that inherently poses such a challenge to usSo why cant we fathom it outWhy isnt the heart bold and courageousOnce we begin to see the truth it will be enough to start challenging the deceptionThe truth realized with wisdom is potent and able gradually to wipe out those false and treacherous views until they are entirely eliminatedThe truth that appears within the heart arises through mindfulness and wisdomThis truth is valid in two aspects or conditions In one respect theres the truth of the aggregates whose very existence offers us a challengeAnd then when wisdom has fathomed and realized the truth of those conditions there will be the truth within the heartSuch is the way of uprooting the defilementsOnce these two truths meet and connect they are no longer harmful and will expel all the poison and danger out from the heartWhile on the Kammatthana sightseeing tour of the body we have examined and investigated its various organs both large and smallNow we have to continue this Kammatthana trip to see how this body ends in transformation and dissolutionWe must fix our attention here to see in what way it will decay and rot until it has disintegrated and dispersedThe body must definitely go this way though which aspects we target can be adjusted according to inclination and preferenceSuppose that we wish to fix our attention on one particular object so as to clearly see it within the heartWhatever object we take  skin for instance  must be firmly held and targeted so that it appears as an image in the heartShould the image appear high or low dont speculate about its positionThe object under investigation must be taken as the target for our awareness with mindfulness directing the way without distractionHowever much the object might appear to expand just see it as it is in the presentWhether its high or low let there just be awareness of that without wondering if its too high or too low or has already left the bodyAt first we might wonder why it is that although we set our investigation inside the body the particular part now seems to be external to itDont allow such thoughts to interveneBy not permitting awareness to wander from its target  whatever position it may have assumed  the object will give us a sight of the extraordinary and wondrousFor example if you concentrate on flesh of whatever part of the body see it clearly within yourself and then youll observe that it will gradually transform itselfWith mindfulness firmly established  which is when we have undivided attention firmly fixed in front of us  the heart will know that it is doing the work and that wisdom is doing the analysisIn a short while that object begins to transform itselfIt starts to decay and decomposeRight thenLets get to see this clearly without fear of deathWhy should we be afraid when we are looking at the truth of the matter and not our own mortalityGo ahead then let it disintegrateI did my own investigations in this wayEach of the different bodilyparts just brokeupIt was really fascinating doing this investigation this exploration into ones own bodyYet while being absorbed in the investigation it then seemed as if the body had completely disappearedAwareness of the body was not apparent even though I was investigating the bodySoThe body disintegratesThe head falls off and an arm breaks off right there in front of oneThen the other arm goes and a length of bone and everything inside ruptures and bursts outKeep on lookingBe absorbed in watching the body as it falls apartSome of the bodily fluids seep out into the ground and some evaporate into the airThats the way it goesOnce all the liquids are lost into the ground and atmosphere the bodily parts start to dry out and steadily dehydrate until they finally crumble into dustThen the dust from the bones of the body and the earth itself merge into oneThis is seen so clearlyThose more solid parts like a bone for instance could be taken up and seen as if its burnt in a fire or as it slowly decomposes and crumbles awayEventually they all seem to have become one with the earthIn this particular investigation both the earth and water elements appeared the most vivid but especially the earth elementThe water element seemed to remain as water while neither the air nor fire elements posed any problemUnlike the courser more solid parts they didnt seem the weighty objects of this investigation and therefore didnt appear so vividly to the heartOnce this stuff had completely dispersed into and become one with the earth the heart was empty and bareAt that moment everything was voidHowever when you are doing the investigation please dont speculate about such thingsJust take the truth within yourself as your own as your living testimonyDont bring in outside speculation for witness and mode of practice because thats about other people and doesnt belong to youWhat you have realized by yourself is your own and whatever that might be let it happen within yourselfYour own realization and experience are what mattersSo remember this as you go furtherAt other times the results of the practice were not always exactly the sameAlthough they would still be following the natural course of thingsOn occasion the body would have dispersed into the earth but some skeletal parts were left in a partial state of decompositionThen a thought appeared in the heart predicting that even though they havent all gone yet whats left is still doomed to return to the earth againThis when there was no awareness of ones body  yet the heart was still able to create such thingsA moment later and the ground suddenly seemed to swell up out of nowhere and the rest of the remains were swallowed upAnd so they all were transformed into earthWhen that was done the heart turned around to another angle and everything disappearedEven the ground that had so suddenly swallowed up the bone fragments was no longer thereThere was the knowledge and realization that AhaEvery part of the body is made of earth and has returned to earth Then the heart turned around and everything disappeared with only pure awareness remainingAn indescribable feeling of wonder and amazement arose because my investigation had never ended like this beforeBut now it had actually happened and was vividly perceived and experiencedThe heart was now one without a single moment of duality because it was steadfast and constant in a true state of onenessas soon as the heart begins to stir it will form two with the thought process but here there was absolutely no thought processAll that remained was bare awareness which was marvellous and amazingAt that moment there was no physical world  no trees no mountainsNothing was presentIt was empty and void as if it was all space however there was also no conjectures using such ideasOnly knowingness was presentThe heart was stilled like this for hours and then having emerged from that condition any object focused upon appeared empty and voidSuch an experience probably only happens once for each practitionerFor me it happened just that one time and has never occurred againHowever the investigative process can be repeated and will eventually be successful every time depending on the skillfulness of the heartThe transformation process into earth water air and fire will then be vividly seen every time one investigates itThis repeated experience strengthens the heart familiarizes it with the truth of the elements and enables it steadily to uproot the view that they are me or mineFor thats how things really are  this body is made up of elements when one talks in terms of elements or its the earth elementIt is not me or mine as ones various opinions and imaginings like to impute and depictRepeated investigations will steadily deepen your insight until you are able clearly to comprehend and detach yourself from seeing the body as me and mineThen there will be merely the body and we can also say that even thats only a labelWe could also call it a conditioned phenomenon if we wanted toOnce this is sufficiently understood nothing can pose a problem any moreWhatever the heart may call it it wont make any difficulties because the problem has always lain solely within the heartOur problems have to be dealt with by disengaging from fantasy and delusion and by entering into the truth of DhammaThis is that bare awareness of the bare elementsWe might designate body but thats just the bare elementsTurning in towards the heart is bare awarenessWe then have the two as the bare truthAlright then if feeling springs up let it carry on for its elemental or a natural process similar to the bodyThis is how they are connectedPerception or notions are concerned with knowledge of the hearts engaging in thought concoctionsWe know that it has gone out from the heart and is engaged in a particular thought fabrication or suppositionOn becoming aware of this the heart will withdraw and perception will stop straight awayBut if we are not aware it will continue on connecting up with this and that in progression like a chain link to linkAnd it will only stop the moment that mindfulness catches upFor it will then cease to concoct concepts and associations of ideasThis is what is meant by mindfulness matching up  and if it cant catch up with the train of thoughts they will perpetually go on and onInvestigating the body should become one of your major concernsThe Lord Buddha therefore taught the Four Foundations of Mindfulness that are all found within this body and mindAnd this includes the Noble TruthsYet what might be the purpose of all these investigationsThey are aimed at enabling the heart to understand the truth of the situation and thereby let go of its deluded attachmentIt will then come up against this beingaselfSo then when our confused misconceptions concerning the four elements and the five aggregates are resolved we must then turn to investigate the delusion of the heartSeeThere is a problem remainingThis level of delusion is more insidious due to the subtle nature of its defilementsWe need to move in closer to examine and then decide what to use as the basis for this investigationWe are investigating the heart and the heart is naamadhammaSo are feelings defilements and wisdom itself so it doesnt just apply to the heartNaamadhammas are able to coexist and interrelate and this means that the defilements and the heart can associate togetherIts wisdom then that must do the probing for it too is a naamadhammaWe must investigate in the same way as we did with the aggregates by differentiating and analysing so as to see through to the true natureThen we must put the heart in the dock and hit hard at the accused the offenderThe heart has gathered its offenses into itself and is conceited thinking itself allwise and allknowingIt thinks it knows everything about this physical world of sense impressions and aggregatesBut it doesnt yet know about itselfThis is where it gets stuckThis is where it is ignorantWisdom must now be turned loose into the heart dissecting and cutting away so as to penetrate itWe must thrust through to that knowingness which is the body of conceited awareness which forms the real delusion of the heartA careful and thorough scrutiny and analysis of the condition that has infiltrated within the heart will show that its just another natural processThe heart therefore wont come to ruin by such a rigorous investigationNevertheless ones investigation cant be eased back for fear of harming it because if the heart is able to stand up to the truth it will prevail and wont be destroyedIt will be true to its nature and so will not only survive but will go beyond all offenses to purityLets see whether the heart will be annihilated or notDelve and dig into itDont be hesitant or over protective of anything not even of the heartDont be afraid that the heart will be destroyed or ruinedOnce wisdom has completely wiped out the infiltrators every kind of defilement will disappearFor its this that makes up all the falsity existing within the heartWhen the investigation really gets moving properly those things that are vulnerable to dispersion will not be able to resist and will be annihilatedBut the nature that cant be annihilated will come through and standPlease notice therefore that it is the heart that is dominated by the defilementsAnd that once wisdom has totally shattered and cleared the defilements away the heart will be transformed into the state of purityThis is the genuine purityHow can it vanishWere it to disappear how could it be pureThat dies that is ruined but this is the genuine deathless the undyingIt is undying through purity and doesnt turn  unlike the immortality that spins with the revolving wheel of birth and deathThis is the vital truth present in the midst of our aggregatesSo we come to the main culprit the one that incites and agitates the heart pressing it into falling for the world for the elements for the aggregates for pain illness and confusionIn truth these things dont have anything to say about the matterThe body is how it isFeeling arises as it should  it doesnt know that its pain or pleasure or neutral feelingIt is this heart that goes and gives meaning to them and afterwards is duped by those selfmade meaningsIt gains nothing but harm and affliction for itself in the processWe must therefore inquire into thisWhat can be lost by a vigorous examination into the true state of affairsIf the body should break let it breakIt comes like all things in the world under the law of impermanence suffering and notself  just as the Lord always said it didHow can we interfereLet go of itIf it cant endure then let it goEverything in this physical world is breaking and dissolvingSome sooner others later but surely our aggregates cant last for aeons and aeons for they too fall under the same law and limitSo lets investigate to see our aggregates according to truth before they break upThis is encompassing allaround wisdom ready clearly to see painful feeling coming on the sceneAlright thenToday we climb into the ringThats itToday we are going into the ring to see and realize the truth in accordance with DhammaWere certainly not going in there to fall down or collapseWhen painfulfeeling arises thats pains business but the investigation of it belongs to mindfulness and wisdomWe are searching for the truth so how can we be knocked downWe dont do it for our downfall but for victory and for penetrative insightFor the allembracing realization of truth  of every aspect of truth within our heartVictory will bring us freedom and its this that is the highest blessingThe Lord said thatThe realization of Nibbaana is the highest blessingSo you can see that this is the way to goNibbaana is concealed because the heart is covered and obscured by defilements craving and ignoranceThis has to be cleared and put right by investigation and an analysis to gain insight into the truthIt is the way to uncover and reveal all the things that have been hiddenIts called the way of realizing Nibbaana and seeing it clearly within the heart  here is the highest blessingWhat can be any higher than thisFrom here on it isWhatever comes into contact this heart is no longer shaken or upsetNothing can reach it or affect it Asoka viraja khema etam mangalamuttamaThis is the secure and blissful heart  khemam  and it is the highest blessingThese two blessings that Ive mentioned are found in the heart and nowhere elseIt is the heart that is the blessing yet it can also become a baneRight at this moment we are turning the malediction that has infiltrated our hearts into the benediction Nibbaana sacchikiriyaSo then lets open and clear all of thisTapo ca brahmacariyanca Ariya sacca na dassanamHere tapo means the burning up of defilementsThey sear the heart with their own heat so we must turn on them the dhammatorch which is mindfulness and wisdomIts putting the heat on the defilements and burning them outAriya Sacca and dassanam is the realization of the Four Noble Truths Suffering is now fully understood by the heart its Cause is completely relinquished the Path is fully developed to its ultimate level of greatermindfulness and wisdomAll thats left to say is the Cessation of suffering is now fully apparentThis is what is meant by seeing the Truth of Dhamma and the one who truly knows this is the one who reveals NibbaanaThis one is the heart that is no longer shaken and upset by all the worldly dhammasSo then shouldnt we try to reach the essential the heart of the matterAs far as the aggregates and body go well we already have gone into thatIts the heart that really countsIf any thing should break up and come apart well let itThats the way the world goes along and its been like that from time immemorialWe have followed that way for so long dying and being born again and again Continuing along the old highwayThis socalled highway is really the common course of things the way the world gets alongNo one can block this path and all must follow itYet surely by now you are starting to have an inkling of the truthWhat else can I say I cant present anything morePlease take this up and examine it with careDont be careless and complacentEndeavoring for the realization of Nibbaana is the highest blessing Nibbaana sacchikiriya ca etammangalamuttamamAnd one day it must definitely belong to the followers of the Lord Buddha to those who determinedly strive onMay I close this Dhamma talk with thatAsokam virajam khemam etam mangalamuttamamWhenever VenAcharn Mun touched on this particular topic in his Dhamma talks or conversation he would always say I think its in the Muttodaya collectionBut there its only couched in general terms whereas I recorded it in more detail than the compiler of MuttodayaThe VenAcharn himself didnt always go into detailed analysis but what he said was enough for us to understand the implicationsWhen he brought up the whole tree trunk the finer points and branches would come along tooWhat he said was thisThe Dhamma of the Lord Buddha is pure by nature but when it comes to stay in an ordinary worldling it becomes counterfeit and is corruptedOnly when its placed in a Noble One is it the real genuine DhammaThat was the general way in which he described itThere are many levels of Noble Ones Streamenterers are the first level followed by oncereturners nonreturners and then arahants as the fourthWhen we analyze it in this way we can then go on to say that in the hearts of streamenterers the dhamma of streamentry is pure and true but the dhammas of oncereturning nonreturning and arahantship are still corruptedThe streamenterer may commit all these dhammas to memory and fully know the way to reach them yet even so they remain falsified in his heart in spite of his awarenessThe oncereturner is still counterfeit on the levels of nonreturning and arahantship while the nonreturner remains false to the dhamma of arahantshipOnly when arahantship is attained does every level of the Dhamma become fully complete in the heart with no corruptions at allSome may argue that since the Dhamma of the Lord Buddha is real and pure it must remain so wherever it might beIt can be compared with pure gold which though fallen in the mire is still pure goldIt cant turn into mud or muckIf we fail to analyze this further it does indeed seem that gold cant change into mudBut who will deny that there isnt any mud aroundThe dirt is smeared over and contaminates the gold as they lie there togetherIs there no difference between gold that has fallen in mud and that which hasntOf course there isHow can anyone assert that the pure uncontaminated gold and slime covered gold are both equally pureSurely there must be a differenceA second illustration could consider food prepared and ready to eatIf the morsel was to drop from our fingers and land in some dirt then what had been eminently eatable becomes unacceptable  and even offensively soAlternatively if the actual food container is soiled then regardless of how succulent the food appears once its placed in the dirty vessel it too becomes contaminatedHow can it remain pure when its mixed with dirtThe Dhamma of the Lord Buddha is much the sameIn this case the vessel equates to the heart which alone is suitable for receiving DhammaHowever much the heart has been soiled will rub off on the Dhamma when it comes into contact and associates with itIt is this impurity that the Lord described as counterfeit and corruptedFurthermore although the palmleaf scriptures are Dhamma when we look them up and study them we can only commit them to memory and retain them in mindYet that mind is already full with defilements so the Dhamma that comes into the heart is really more a rotelearned Dhamma than the genuine thingIf it is the authentic Dhamma why dont the defilements all disappear from our hearts since each of us has studied and engraved it in our memoryWeve gone into every intellectual aspect of Dhamma  including the subject of Nibbana  and yet we cant go beyond the fact that our hearts remain brimful with defilementsThis is why Dhamma can be falseTake up the Lord Buddhas Dhamma both the theory and the practice and open it up through practicing what was correctly taught thereOnly then will the true Dhamma begin to emerge from what has been memorizedWe committed it to memory as an outline and plan ready to put into practice rather than just storing it awayIts similar to the building plans for a houseRegardless of how many hundreds or thousands of designs might have been drawn up they are still merely specifications and not a houseIt cant be properly called a house until its construction  following the blue print  is completedCommitting it to memory for practical use is one thing but simply to store it away without any interest in its practical application is something elseWhatever happens that which has been studied must then be put into practiceHaving practiced youll then undoubtedly experience the results of practice which are steady penetrating discernment and realizationWe Buddhists should take both the theory and the practice as being basic to the Teaching being its fundamental DhammaBy so doing the Teaching and its followers will excel in Dhamma in virtue and in the knowledge and understanding that brings calm and peace to both the individual and all the communityThe case then is that the Teaching is merely retained in memory or it just remains inscribed on palm leavesThe person goes one way that which has been memorized goes another way and the way of practice goes in yet another directionThey dont harmonize and are all in a constant state of conflict right there in the same individualFurthermore it also disturbs and annoys other people making them wonder how the followers of the Lord Buddha can be in such a messSuch criticism is wellfounded and irrefutableWhatever is wrong must be accepted as suchOnce the theory is put into practice the results will be in harmony and youll truly be able to understand according to your present abilityWhatever your practice has enabled you to experience in the heart can plainly be describedYoull be bold and confident when talking about them without fear of contradiction  for youve seen it for yourselfHow could there be any misgivingsTherell be no scruples or twinge of conscience because it isnt a matter of guessing or blind hypothesizingYou spoke from your own experience and insight and didnt plagiarize anybody elseHow can it be wrong and how can one be intimidated or shakenEvery one of us is seeking for the truthWe know the truth as far as our ability allows and can talk about it so far as we know itHow then can there be any diffidence or misgivingsThere are none of courseIt was never said that the Lord Buddha took a Nibbana course at any institutionNor did he go to any school to study about the Eightfold Path or the Middle Way of PracticeOn the contrary this was something he taught himself through analysis and investigation leading up to EnlightenmentHe realized and experienced Dhamma to his hearts contentment and then declared this Dhamma to the worldWho can be more accomplished than the Lord Buddha for he is a Selfenlightened One and the founder of the Way of BuddhismIf we wish to match up to the Teaching to find the way to growth and benefit we must make ourselves worthy followers of that Noble TeachingIt then wouldnt be a case of vainly carrying the stack of scripturesAt the same time being unable to use them to make even a scratch on the defilements resident in the heart or to gain any practical valueThis doesnt measure up to the reputation of the Lord Buddha nor to the purpose of his Teaching which is the removal and elimination of the defilementsInstead we shoulder the burden of the defilements by merely learning the Dhamma by roteThats quite contrary to the purpose of the TeachingAnd it explains how Dhamma becomes worldly and mundaneThe way for Dhamma really to be Dhamma is by the practice that Ive already mentionedWhen the texts have been studied and one turns to practice only then will the truth be learnedThis is because the Lord Buddhas way of teaching was the Wellproclaimed DhammaIt doesnt go wrong or deviate from this principle unless its through the practitioners own misunderstandingIf that happens there isnt much that can be done because it runs contrary to the truth which is DhammaThe Dhamma Teachings of the Lord Buddha are like merchandise that boldly challenge any test of validity or qualityThis Dhamma merchandise regardless of the market place will put all the other products out of business because people are always on the lookout for a good and genuine productOnce theyve seen it how can they fail to recognize its worth  even small children can perceive that muchHowever Dhamma is no material commodity that can be advertised to compete with other productsIt can only be appreciated by those who have experienced it and can only be individually realizedYet this isnt aimed at the accumulation of defilements whether boastfulness or conceitEvery stage of insight and realization is for the sake of uprooting defilements for these are inimical to both oneself and othersHow then could one show off and boast  for thats promoting and exhibiting the defilementsThats enough to make anyone sick and it certainly isnt the way to get rid of themIts because of this that those who practice and understand anything about Dhamma appear serene and at peaceTheir speech is appropriate to the circumstances and when theres no reason to say anything they remain silentThey are neither grasping nor covetous but live like a samana responding serenely and appropriately with words or stillnessThis is what the Lord referred to when he saidTo behold a samana who is free from corruption and perversion is the highest blessingThe samana here can be considered in four stages The first is streamenterer the second nonreturner the third oncereturner and the arahant as the fourthThe standard viewpoint refers to those who have become a samana by virtue of their attainment to the various levels of Dhamma streamentry oncereturning nonreturning and arahantshipAll of them are a blessing to those who look to them with respectThis is the external samanaTurning within to the internal samanaWe see the first second and third samana in the heart by investigating the DhammatruthIts this that uncovers the Path and the Fruit so that they can be clearly perceived within the heartAnd it forms another of the highest blessingsWe must turn inward for our own benefit or else we will be constantly searching for the external samana always speculating as to who is at what stageNone of the streamenterers oncereturners nonreturners or arahants wear labels or insignia like military officers so how can we pick them outAnd if they are genuine how can we know from their behavior and deportmentThey would never flaunt their achievement in the gross way the world likes to indulge inThose with impeccable virtue who seek after and are imbued with the Truth and Dhamma cant possibly behave in this waySeeking out this kind of samana to pay our respects is far from easyIts so difficult to know when we might come across themInstead we should take up the Teaching that points towards those four levels of samana and with application well be able to reach those same stages within ourselvesThis is by far the most fitting way and really gets us to the heart of the problem without wasting time in hunting for clues and chasing after shadowsWhen we actually encounter a teacher imbued with truth and Dhamma peaceful in body speech and heart  or better still a first second third or fourth level samana  we mustnt let slip the first second third and fourth levels of samana that could appear within our own heartsWhen the necessary conditions are fulfilled we would then definitely reap the fruits of our practice because the Lord Buddha did not reserve those fruits exclusively to himselfSota means streamIt is the entry into the stream of NibbanaHowever we tend rather to indulge in speculation using various theories and models to try to work out what its really likeHow wide or narrow how deep or shallow how coarse or subtle is this stream This merely grows into subjective emotional ideas without practical valueIn fact the stream refers to the sphere of certitude and assurance of definitely reaching release from sufferingNevertheless whatever happens stream or no stream as one who practices you should try to have inner peaceIt is the heart itself that with constant attention and wholesome care will become NibbanaA home is a home a house is a house earth is earth water is water air is air and fire is fireNeither earth sky nor space can become Nibbana nor lead one to NibbanaNor can they be developed into a streamenterer oncereturner nonreturner or an arahantHow then can it ever be possible to transform them into NibbanaIt is only the heart through Dhamma practice that is able steadily to uncover the darkness that shrouds the vision of the heartPeace and happiness will then naturally occurIt hasnt happened before because of those dark things that continually try to provoke agitation in usDay and night they disturb us with worry and anxiety and confusion and in every position whether standing walking sitting or lying downThese are the defilements that constantly agitate and disturb choking out any peace and calmThe defilements have been an endless source of trouble for all the creatures of the world  even though they may not have been recognized as suchIn fact people commonly hold them up as being something good and never give a thought to letting them goIf they are really so wonderful why is there all this grumbling we hear in the worldIts really the defilements that cause all our moaning because its they that bring about suffering and hardshipSo this is why the Lord taught that we have to develop the samana dhammaSamana here means calm and serenityWith calm slowly but steadily the first samana and the second and the third and the fourth appears within our heartYet how do we practice to reach these four samanaThe Lord explained this in general terms in the First Sermon the Turning of the Dhamma WheelAlthough there it wasnt presented in too great a detail so a beginner in the way of practice might find it quite difficult to understandThe Lord spoke there aboutThe Noble Truth of Suffering that is birth old age and death are suffering association with the unwanted is suffering separation from the loved is suffering This is the story of sufferingNow how does this suffering come aboutIt arises from birthBirth is the cause for the arising of sufferingThe real agent of birth has its root in ignorance conditions the arising of determinationsIndeed other than avijjaa paccaya sankhaaraa what else can condition birthThe Lord started right here at the principal determinantVenAcharn Muns way of analysing it was very interestingHe said Thiti bh tam avijjaa paccaya sankhaaraaHow is it possible for ignorance to arise and persist if it has nothing to depend on no father and mother for its originIt must rely on thiti bhutam avijjaa paccaya sankhaaraa as the basis for birth for life and existenceThis can then be separated into three categoriesAccompanied by enjoyment and lust and enjoying this and that in other words craving for sensual pleasure craving for being and craving for nonbeingThe Lord called these the Source of SufferingThis is the Noble Truth but what can be used to remedy itThe Noble Truth of the Origin of Suffering is all about the darkening of the heart about a nature that agitates and sulliesThinking in material terms its as if the heart is all messed up with dirt and mudThese three cravings that are the source of suffering are the hankering and hunger the inability to continue at ease the loss of peace and the ability to live alone with oneselfCraving is necessarily hungry and ravenous with a driven restless struggling towards sensual pleasure being and non beingThis is putting it simply and vividly for thats how it continually hounds and oppresses the heartThe heart is unable to sustain its natural poise because these agents continually come in to upset and disturb so that it cant find any peaceHow can we remedy thisThe Lord taught the Noble Truth of the Path that begins with right view and right thoughtHe described this as the Way to overcome that nature or condition that is responsible for creating through the power of craving and discontent all the upheaval and confusionOnce anyone is consumed by desire  and its just the same for animals  they will openly or covertly take up the chase and using fair means or foul grasp hold of itThis is due to compulsive craving ambition and insatiability with the heart struggling after its desires through torment and sufferingWhy sufferingSuffering because of samudayaAnd its this cause that oppresses the hearts of all beingsBy day and night whether walking standing sitting or lying down beings of all the realms of existence come under its yokeAs each train of thought goes out only to be taken under its sway what can we do to save the situationThe state of the art instruments to use for the combating and the eradication of these three cravings from the heart are the eight factors of the PathThese are right view right thought right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness and right samadhiNothing else can match the Middle Way of PracticeThis right view is the seeing of what rightlyFor us here now everything is wrongly seen and goes to make up the wrong views of desire for sensual pleasure being and nonbeingThis is the way that our body and heart unfailing takeWhy should we feel affection and loveWhats the reason behind itUse mindfulness and wisdom to examine the body which forms the immediate object of affectionWe first cherish this body before being attracted to other bodiesThis is where youll find sensual cravingYou must get to the bottom of this and find out the reason for such love and affectionSo its love for the skin the flesh the muscles the bones the hair of head and body  Is that itBut whether mine or whoevers theyre much the sameSo whats with this fondnessThis analysis and dissection is called the right view of the PathIts that discerning examination that searches out the object of attachment and the reason behind itWhat value does this object of attachment bringReally instead of giving comfort benefit and happiness it brings a blazing fire to sear the heart with suffering and tormentIt arises out of the false notion that such an object belongs to me and is myselfThis is all nonsenseIts up to wisdom therefore to follow up and straighten out the wrong ideaThis was why the Lord taught about the investigation with mindfulness of the bodyProbe into itExamine both inside and out above and below internally and externallyDo it thoroughly and judiciously over and over again until you come to discern it clearlyThis is the way of wisdom that is able to quash the craving and thirst of the defilementsIts only right view and right thought can overcome and cure us of our desires for they are factors of the Eightfold PathAnd that is the Noble Truth which tames every kind of defilementThis is the way we should goYou must hit hard with mindfulness and wisdom for this is the instrument that can counter any stratagem of the defilementsWithout hesitating carefully probe into anywhere that appears dark and obscure  for thats where the viper will be lurkingWhenever wisdom fails to follow up quickly enough that becomes the place for the arising of the views of self of creature or person of me or they of mine or theirsWisdom must therefore penetrate to see according to the living scriptures  which are this body and mindThe truth will then be revealed and there will be no more notions about person animal I and theyOnce wisdom has fathomed the truth the conjurations and suppositions will be seen for the fraud they really are having been designed by those masters of deception the defilementsWisdom then steadily follows through with its cleanup work until everything had been dealt withThe heart long crushed under the weight of attachment will now be freed and uplifted through mindfulness and wisdomThe title deeds of me and mine and the claims of territorial right especially over the five aggregates will be overturnedThese claims have stood since birth  the flesh the sinews and the bones the arms and the legsEach bodily part has been taken as meThey have been declared me and mine even though they know nothing about such claimsWe draw up the boundaries of our own domain and as other things impinge or intrude they give rise to unease and pain to suffering within the heartIts suffering of heart not only of body which arises because of attraction and possessiveness in the setting out of our domainThe Lord described this examination into the true state of things as investigating the Noble Truth with wisdom and right viewIn essence this refers to the correct view concerning the four Noble Truths  the right view about Suffering for instanceRight thought is reflection aimed at uprooting defilementsThe Lord divided this into threeFirst the nonholding of thoughts of malice or enmity against othersThis concerns all those defilements based in hostility and resentmentSecond not thinking of being cruel to oneself or othersThird is the thought and resolution to be free from all entanglement  free from delight in sense pleasures for exampleTheres a natural principle that insists that before anything can go out to disturb other people it must affect oneself firstThis is where right view comes in to rectify matters for the problem arises due to defilementenforced wrong viewRight thought and right view coming together are like single strands spliced into a strengthened cordThey are the hearts activity the thinking processes and together they become wisdom  the resourcefulness and ingenuity of the heart become one with the heartWhen all eight strands combine and splice together as one this is called the Middle WayEver since the time of the Lord Buddha this had formed the most fitting way to deal with the defilementsYour investigation needs to be aimed at those things that are currently entangling the heartThey will have to be disentangled using the Path  right thought for example  for only this can rid the heart of defilementsBy using mindfulness and wisdom we can investigate and challenge delusion in the arena of the body and aggregatesThese will form our target so we must penetrate to their true naturePersonally I find that it goes against the grain to teach from other angles  but elucidating on these themes goes right to the heart because these things are for realThe defilements and the Path are both found hereThe Four Noble Truths exist right hereAs the Path steadily quells defilements so the Cessation of suffering comes about for its dependent on the strength of the Path that is the factor moving things alongIt is mindfulness and wisdom that subdue and eradicate defilements systematically bringing about the cessation of sufferingIts no good thinking anyone can aim at putting an end to suffering without treading the PathThe Lord said that Cessation had to be clearly realized yet the only way to achieve that is through the PathConcentrating all ones efforts on knowing Cessation without having the Path to clear the way cant succeed because this Dhamma is the fruit of the PathThe Lord taught about all these conditionsHowever the important principle to remember is that mindfulness and wisdom have to be fixed on a particular point and from there they will steadily resonate through to all four Noble TruthsThey simultaneously work together like the various parts of a single clockwork mechanismTrying to distinguish each independent function would be as confusing as trying to follow individual ox tracks inside the stallIts just not possibleWe therefore should investigate a single object within the r pa or naama dhammas the body or mindFor example by taking up one of the many different bodily partsAlthough feeling may arise during this investigation there shouldnt be any upset or bother because while the body is r pa feeling is mental phenomenonWhere is this self this creature this person this me or themAll feeling whether pleasant or painful has similar characteristics  theres nothing there about self creatures or people  and theyre just mental phenomena arising in the heartThe heart can be aware of an arising conditionThat it has attributes of pain or pleasure and will disappear following those causes that lead to its ceasingAlright thenThere is a way for wisdom to discern the situation because these things really are presentThey manifest themselves openly without being mysterious or hidden entirely dependent on their root causesThe bodily aggregate We are with this body day in day out  putting it to bed lulling it to sleep discharging its wastes standing it up and taking it for walksThe aggregate of feeling is also constantly manifesting itself even right at this very momentIf it isnt pleasant its painful as feelings alternate and changeThe important point is that the heart doesnt take on board that pain and sufferingWhen pain is present be aware that it is part of the aggregates with their impermanence suffering and notselfIf you dont allow the heart to involve itself with them it wont be sufferingFeeling  Ive talked about this each day so listen carefully and get to understand itThe defilements tenaciously cling to these five aggregates and theyve done it day after day for countless agesThis is why its inadequate to think of making an examination every now and againThe occasional Dhamma talk is also insufficient for the point needs repeatedly driving home until it is definitely understoodYou must also repeatedly examine this until you comprehend and then the lettinggo will happen of itselfThereGet to see it clearlyWhere is feeling where is painful feelingIf its present you cant deny its existence nor make it in to something elseIt must always be true to its natural statePerception is recollectionWeve been looking back from the day of our birth right up to the presentIn all of that have we managed to find anything thats of fundamental significanceIf amongst it all there really were self creature or person then probably we wouldnt be able to find a chest big enough to store them all  because were continually recalling more and more of them all the timeYet really as soon as they are recalled they pass away without remainderListen then what sort of essence can be found in themThe thinking processing perpetually concocts from dawn till dusk dusk to dawnSometimes it thinks so much that it overheats and the heart becoming exhaustedThis may continue to the point of nervous breakdown and may even end up killing someoneFor instance take the person who pines away through some sorrow or disappointmentThe defilements takeover this aggregate as their concoctingdevice as their tool to keep up the pressure of proliferating thoughts and imaginingsOnly mindfulness and wisdom can effectively check this proliferationWhen the defilements take over this recollecting and thought processing they can pierce right through to the heartThe results are torment and suffering in no small measureWhen its worse than this it may end with insanityWe are tormented because of so much thinking yet we dont ask ourselves whether its all worthwhileConsciousness is the plain awareness of an object present through contact which then dies away together with itWhere in this is any core or substance to be foundIts here with these objects where we fall into delusionOther than this its merely the byproduct of the defilementsThese are the fundamental principlesThis is the way to tread the Path of Practice and it is here that we must investigate to achieve clear insightIn other words this is the Truth of the Path and is the means of correcting and overcoming our delusionThen as the result of our letting go the heart can be at peace and free from all worriesDeath is a basic principle beyond the worlds challenge or objectionThe laws of impermanence suffering and notself are like a highway for they shape the way and course of natureIf tenure isnt yet up wont break apart but when the time finally comes theres no stopping it  however tenaciously we may cling and hold backIt will just go its own way along the highway the way of nature which takes precedence and cant be blocked or stayedNature must take its course for this is an undeniable principle directing things throughout this worldWe must investigate so that we can see according to their true nature  as they say felling a tree from the windward sideSo dont go against the Lord Buddhas Dhamma that accords with the natural course but rather achieve knowledge by following the truthThe heart will then be at peaceBut when the heart coexists with the defilements it dwells in confusion and consequently reaps sufferingWe have already seen the harm of this and so must make sure the heart stays with Dhamma with mindfulness and wisdomThe heart will then be safeguarded and at peaceStrive to overcome these things known as defilements wherever you find themAfter dealing with the external ones turn to those involved with the body and then inside the heart itselfDeploy wisdom for a complete allround penetration of them  these authors of the concepts of creature and personAll notions of self of creature and person will cease to be a problem the moment the defilements have been entirely dispersedThey will disappear by themselves and we will no longer pointlessly fantasize about themWhile the truth remains as it actually is bringing peace of mind and freedom from all anxietyYet this peace shouldnt be thought of as the Noble Truth itself  for that is concerned with sufferingIt is the suffering of body and heart that is called the Truth of Suffering the Truth of the Source of Suffering is the affair of all defilements and taints the Truth of the Path from right view through to right samadhi is the instrument for the correction and eradication of defilementsThe Truth of Cessation follows the steady extinguishing of suffering until the total penetrative realization of the nature of the Source is accomplishedThe complete elimination of this Source  which though only existing within the heart makes up the principal culprit  together with that of the defilements is the Truth of the Cessation of SufferingThe one that knows the ending of suffering through the Paths destruction of the defilements is the one that knows freedomThat was the Noble Truth and this is FreedomThis is the purified one and it is not the Four Noble Truths  for they are the means to an end and when that end is reached they naturally lose their raison detre without need of coercion or forceIts a natural consequence just as the stairs lose their significance once we have climbed to our final goal so traveling the Path comes to an endMindfulness and wisdom have accomplished their task and the heart has gone beyond  so their instrumental work in dispelling the defilements is overThis is our arrival at the summitIts the Samana Dhamma the supreme samana the fourth class of recluseThe first samana we encountered in our practice was the streamenterer the second was the oncereturner and the third the nonreturnerThe fourth samana is the arahant the Arahatta DhammaThis is the ultimate and final achievement realized through the Path of Practice that most penetrating and luminous of waysThe four samanas are now found within the heart  Etam mangalamuttamam the highest blessing arises thereTheres no need to seek for it elsewhere because when the heart goes beyond all oppressive domination to perfect purity then that itself is the supreme blessingWhatever has been discussed here about the four Noble Truths or the four samanas is all found within the one that knows and nowhere elseThis is the one who can uphold the four samanas through the work of emancipation and who arrives at freedomIn brief that which knows is the one with absolute certainty in consistently being able to deal with anything that comes to awarenessThe defilements are capable of ruining many things but they cant destroy the heartAlthough they may be up to bringing the heart to experience hardship and suffering they cant possibly annihilate itThis nature is constantIt is upright and consistent and only appears otherwise  taking on differing characteristics  because of the things it associates and involves itself withOnce shaken off and cleaned free of all stain this nature is poised and wholly imperturbableIts this that people call the perfect fourth samana while in Dhamma terms its the Arahatta Dhamma inside the heartThis heart is now wholly DhammaThe citta is Dhamma the Dhamma is cittaWhichever way you want to put it this truth is beyond disputeThere can be no more contradictions because there are no more defilements left to agitateThis is how all issues are resolvedThey cease right hereSuffering ends here birth and becoming finish at this pointIt cant happen anywhere elseIt was from here that birth and existence came into being  this one was the seed of birth and existence because it originates with the defilements which were together with the heartThis is the reason why there is the wandering through the various realms of existenceThere has been endless suffering affliction upset and hardship arising from this seed that generates and perpetuates these experiencesOnce the cankerous shell and fecund kernel can be completely cut out every difficulty and problem will be removedPlease take up and make sure you examine it until you realize your situation and achieve the resultsWhether woman or man ordained or lay the heart of those individuals who practice can attain to this insight and realizationAll can succeed because it doesnt depend on gender or age or anything else like thatTherefore may I conclude this Dhamma talk with thisToday is Magha Puja dayIts the day when the Lord Buddha declared his intention to let go of the conditioned state bidding goodbye to the world and to the prison of the cycle of birth and deathHe chose to relinquish and discard his body after having carried it for eighty years and throughout that period it had always been an oppressive load to bearBut then such is the nature of this bodyOther things in contrast have their times of heaviness and lightness occasionally allowing us to catch a breathCarrying food and water are heavy when we first shoulder them but become progressively lighter as we steadily use them upYet we have been bearing the load of our body since birth and it never seems to get any lighterIts always heavyIn fact as we advance in years and decline in strength it seems increasingly heavyThat is why the Lord Buddha asserted thatThese five aggregates are an extremely heavy burdenApart from shouldering the heavy load of this form or body there is also painful feeling and the rest of the aggregatesThey are not only heavy and oppressive but also have razor sharp barbs that pierce through our body and heartThe Lord Buddha put up with this until he was eighty years oldTo put it simply he must have saidAhThis body is beyond bearingIts time to leave itThus he declared that in three months time he would relinquish his life and lay down the burdenHe made the decision on the full moon day of the third lunar monthOn that very same day twelve hundred and fifty noble disciples assembled spontaneously and without invitation each coming through his own initiativeThe Lord Buddha therefore presented this teaching to the arahant disciples delighting them with the bliss of the BuddhadhammaThe gathering thus became the Pure AssemblyHere is a brief outline of what was said on that daykusalassuupasampadaa The doing of what is goodSacitta pariyodapanam The purifying of ones own heartetam BuddhaanasaasanamThis is the Teaching of the BuddhasAnuupavaado anuupaghaato Not insulting not harmingpaatimokkhe ca samvaro Restraint according to the PatimokkhaMattanyutaa ca bhattasmim Moderation in taking foodpantanyca sayanaasanam Having a secluded placeAdhicitte ca aayogo Intent on the pure heartetam BuddhaanasaasanamThis is the Teaching of the BuddhasThe Buddha gave this teaching to the twelve hundred and fifty as a form of diversion on that afternoon which accords with todayFor those arahants it was more of an enjoyment than an exhortation because they were already pure no longer needing instruction to cleanse the defilements from their heartsThat is why they were called the Pure AssemblyThis was a unique event in the Buddhas teaching life never again were arahant disciples to gatherand be offered such teachingWe celebrate the Buddhas and arahants because of their prodigious and brilliant natureThey were figures of wonder among the majority of people because the worldly peoples hearts remain corrupted by the staining defilements  not one of them could compare with the spotless arahantsSabbapaapassa akaranam to refrain from unwholesome downcasting actions that give rise to all kinds of sufferingIts this base side of the heart that is so critically importantDepraved actions and speech have natural limitations but the depravity of the heart which depresses and downcasts itself is propelled by our own continuous thinking and imaginingIts these agents that drive the heart into gloom and dark depression that are exactly the things in the heart that are already murky and defiledThe Lord Buddha named them defilementsThey are those factors that manoeuvre and instigate memory and thought processes into actionWhile another sort of defilement causes the heart to become gloomy and disconsolateWrongdoing and base deeds dont just refer to robbery looting and plunderingThats evil on a gross level but we manage continually to generate similar depravities on the intermediate and more subtle levelThis is equivalent to constantly depressing our own heartThis downcast heart will continue to be cast down wherever we may go because we are also generating depression for the heartWalking standing sitting lying down  the heart is always concocting and contriving and thus becoming miserable in every postureOne aspect of the Lord Buddhas teaching therefore is his emphasizing that we shouldnt indulge in creating gloom and misery for ourselvesWhat method can we find to avoid this depressionKusalass uupasampadaa wisdom must be sufficiently developed to remedy this depression by cleaning out the gloommakers and the base evils we will then haveSacitta pariyodapanam a bright and cheerful heartWhen our cleverness which is mindfulness and wisdom has cleaned out all the filth and gloom from the heart it becomes bright and clear  sacitta pariyodapanamThe evil whether great or small will then start to wane as our heart becomes pureThe Teaching of all the Buddhas is like thisThey all say Do it this wayTheres no alternativeAny alternative easier way would have been known to the wisest of all the Lord BuddhaHe might have woven us all a hammock to lounge in while we steadily swatted at and ridded ourselves of defilementsThis might seem to accord with his fame as a teacher full of love and compassion to a world full of frail and grumbling beingsIn fact the Lord Buddha had already used all his skill and ability in establishing the shortest and most direct pathEach of the Buddhas had to cultivate the perfections before realizing BuddhahoodThey used the Dhamma in their hearts to drive out the defilements and then taught this as the true and correct wayThey tested and selected with the maximum power of their minds before discovering and teaching the Dhamma which is most suitable for all living beingsSuitable here does not mean that it fits in with peoples own fancies but rather that it points to a practice appropriate to overcoming their defilementsThis is DhammaNothing else can surpass the Middle Way of practice as passed on from the Lord BuddhaThe defilements fear no other means methods or dhammasNothing else can eject them from the heart or even scratch their skinsAnuupavaado Dont slander other peopleAnuupaghaato Dont harm or kill human beings or animalsPaatimokkhe ca samvaro Keep your behavior within the bounds of Dhamma for this is the means of uprooting the defilementsMattanyutaa ca bhattasmim Know the right measure in using food and live simply and frugallyDont indulge and exceed what is reasonable for one who practicesKnow the right amount in whatever youre involved withPantanyca sayanaasanam Look for seclusion and use this solitude to deal with the defilementsAdhicitte ca aayogo Develop the heart to excel in Dhamma employing mindfulness and wisdom step by stepThis is the essence of the Teaching of all the BuddhasThis was the Dhamma with which the Lord Buddha delighted all the noble disciplesTo those who were not yet arahant he also taught sabbapaapassa akaranamIt is an essential practice being the only way we can hope to use gradually to drive the defilements from our heartYet do we truly take it to heartOr is it rather that hammock hanging over there that takes our fancyThe essence of the pure Dhamma imparted by each Buddha is directly drawn from each of their heartsBut do we receive it into oursThe Lord Buddha bequeathed it with his great compassionBut do we receive it with full devotion and trustWith total mind and heartIf we merely feign acceptance of the Dhamma and later come to discard it then it will all have been worthlessIt would in fact have gone against the Lord Buddhas original intentionThe Lord Buddha decided to relinquish the body on the full moon of the sixth lunar month and made the announcement to that effect on the third months full moon  which is todayFrom that moment on the constraints and irritations of the elements and aggregates would vanishThis is the complete passing away without remainder with no more concerns or obligations to any worldly conditionThis is the Dhamma transcending the worldThe ultimate DhammaWorld is the whole gamut of suppositions and assumptions existing in this world  the three worlds are the worlds of supposition and change the worlds governed by impermanence suffering and notselfWhatever ones birth or state these three marks spin that world with confusion and no one can bar their courseBut once one has got beyond them all concerns come to an endNicchato parinibbuto craving totally ends mundane suppositions are goneIt is out of this Dhamma that all the truths taught by the Lord Buddha resoundIf we take this Dhamma deeply to heart in our practice then it will ring and roar in our heartAt first it will resonate in a cool calm and peaceful condition of heart  which are the various levels of samadhiThen it will reverberate with wisdom in our thinking and analysis so that we can steadily free ourselvesFinally it will resound in the pure state of complete freedomThereNicchato parinibutto craving is totally extinguishedThe source of those cravings was defilement of every sort because it is never sated or satisfiedNatthi tanhaa samaa nadii the waters of river and ocean cant equal the defilementinspired cravingThey perpetually engulf the hearts of sentient beings and never run outHow can we dry up these watersWe must bail them out using the energy of the one who practices until they eventually ebb and diminish
