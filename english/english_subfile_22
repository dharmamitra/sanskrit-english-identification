Draining and drawing out every day examining every day understanding and thereby relinquishing every dayThe waters will then start to seem not quite so greatThey are really only as large as our aggregates thats allBut for the heart that is attached to the aggregates this is a weighty matterThe heart doesnt bother with any piece of land instead it comes and seizes hold right hereThis is the big issue the hot and heavy concernThis is where the defilements scorch the heart as no other fire can endlessly turning up the heatWe have all heard about floodsWhen our lungs are flooded and congested the doctor can drain themBut when the defilements complete with craving engulf the heart what are we going to use to draw them offWe can only bring in faith energy mindfulness and wisdomThus we must probe examine and investigate to see things clearly as they really areWhat is being clung toAbout what are false assumptions being madeAnd why is it that the voice of Dhamma the aid in drawingout is never listened toThe defilements usually try to play smart with the BuddhaThey are his adversary and must always assert their cleverness against the Dhamma and contend with itGrasping is the defilements line while correcting and uprooting is the way of DhammaExtracting defilements with wisdom is Dhamma and transcending them and arriving at serene happiness is the Nibbana Dhamma or the Pure DhammaThere is always this rivalryKeep on tryingDont lose out to these things for you now have entered the boxing ring and must determine to be the championFight without backing downYoull have to be dead before youll allow yourself to be carried out of the ringIf youve been floored but still live and can return to the fight then battle onIf you cant manage to fight on anymore then you can always denounce and curse them right there in the ringWhat harm can that doWe are fighters and if we can no longer fight the defilements then curse every mother and father of themThis is our single remaining weaponWe are down and cannot punch back yet we still have a mouthWe can still talk scold and curse even though we are knocked downOf course this is only an analogyTo be a warrior doesnt mean that we go round cursing or abusing anyone but rather that we combat the defilementsWe must fight to the extent befitting a disciple of the Tathagata who was himself of the warrior classHave you ever noticed how our teachers and venerable acharns practicedThese meditation masters whom we respect so deeply were all warriors in this wayIf thats how they themselves triumphed why should they teach us to go in a different directionAlright thenKeep switching and varying your probe using wisdom to stay on top of the events withinThis wisdom is of such sharp discernment that it will be able to find a way to draw us out of the deep mire of elements and aggregates in which weve been stuck and buried for countless eonsUltimately we end up with the heart and even here we have to pull everything outThe I must be extracted from form from the body and from the elements of earth water air and fireWe must pull the heart out of the painful feeling that we have taken on as ourselfThe way to withdraw from form is simply to let go of the very form that we have grasped as selfWe pull away from grasping each of the aggregates that we have taken as me and mineUse wisdom to try and rootout right here keeping pace with whatevers going onThe heart is subtle and extraordinaryThe body in contrast is nothing special  however much we uphold and cling to it in our delusionIt can only be our utter stupidity that leads us so readily to shoulder this gross thing without ever wanting to put it downIf we were really smart and considered whats behind it all we would let it goWhy carry itProbe and investigate these questions using mindfulness and wisdom that are availableTheres no need to go and be so afraid of dyingFear itself is just another defilementWhy build up defilements by being frightenedWe must rather build up our courage because this is a quality that counters the defilementsBring it out to fight the defilements and to find out what actually diesIn fact nothing diesAnd the defilements are always lying to us about itThe moment we are unguarded they instantly insinuate themselves and whisper When will I die today tomorrow here or over there Im going to die very soon We upset ourselves with such thinking while the elements just exist indifferentlyIn this way we complicate matters and confuse ourselves by thinking that we are responsibleWhat sort of responsibility is thisIts more a matter of selfconfusion than selfresponsibilityIf we are to be truly selfresponsible and selfreliant then our heart will need full mindfulness and wisdom to use for investigation and rooting outIt must be able to probe and extract from the heart all the anxieties and confusions about living about death and sickness  and whatever else is found thereThere can be no easing off or allowing the defilements in to fool usOne can then say that those who practice in this way are truly being responsible for themselvesBy investigating everything both close in and all around you will come to realize the true situation and be able to free the heartThen theres contentment and reliefContentment is found right hereSuccess and correctly assumed responsibility are also right hereWe hear news reports that so and so is an arahant  as in the case of those arahants  or that that person is a streamenterer oncereturner or nonreturnerBut what about ourselvesOur news is only about weakness discouragement depression stupidity dejection and confusionThis is our whole storyDoesnt it run contrary to the reports about those othersOur personal news is exactly the opposite of those who possess the Ariyan Treasure the Dhamma Wealth in their heartsIf our news only measures up to this then it can only be concerned with the thousandandone kinds of sufferingIts more like sinking in the mudThe unwanted news makes up our account and because we create this story we must also bear the resultWho is Dhamma intended forWho is it taught forWho makes up the Buddhist Community  if we cant be counted as membersSurely the Dhamma was taught and intended for usThen what are we taught to overcomeDo we have the means for this purposeYes they are right here  its as if the Lord Buddha is right here before our very eyes pointing them out to usThis isnt something about long ago or far awayIts fresh and vibrant right hereThe Dhamma of the Lord Buddha exists here with us now so why go elsewhere with all your worthless speculationsThe Buddha realized Nibbana in a distant time and placeHe taught the Dhamma long ago and it has become stale and insipidIts flavor cant last up until todayThereListen to thatThe defilements lie to us  cant we hear themBeware of Maara whose fabrications will destroy us with such ideas mashing us to pulpThe Truth has no time or era and is there with everyone who is searching for itHow can Dhamma ever vanish with timeHow can we kill the truth with these ideas needlessly bringing utter ruin to ourselvesWho in this world can know better than the Lord BuddhaThe Buddha Dhamma and Sangha always stand challenging the defilements in the arena of truthThis is something timelessTherefore virtue concentration and wisdom are never outmoded or behind the timesTheyre independent of period or place  and yet are within everyoneThey can be produced at anytime and whenever developed they grow and thriveThis is the way leading to the Path Fruit and Nibbaana which is timeless and independent of placeWhile the defilements for their part also manage a continued presence within the hearts of sentient beingsWe all now as in the Buddhas time have defilementsThe overcoming of these defilements must still be done with the same old virtue concentration wisdom faith and effortHow can this be kept far away and long ago from usIt cannotWe will all be able to go beyond suffering by rectifying the situation at the right spot and in the right wayExpose whatever is cloaking the heart by focusing with wisdom and mindfulness on whatever is dark and obscure taking that spot as the target for investigationWhere exactly is this sadness and gloomIts a condition of the heart that we can perceive just as we know when darkness or light contacts our eyesWe notice that darkness is dark but the one who knows is not also in the darkLight is known darkness is known any amount of darkness can be known within our heartAnd gloom and depression are also known together with brightness and cheerfulnessThe one who knows knows in this wayWe must make wisdom penetrate further taking the heart or these things as its targetWhen sadness and gloom appear within the heart dont be alarmed or glad or regretfulLook on them as mental conditions that must be investigated as things that arise and ceaseTheyre not of the heart but simply depend on it to appear and then hook into itPersevere with the examination but dont get excited or unsettled with the objects themselvesWhatever arises and passes through  that we must knowThen we can be counted as being one who takes up the study and practiceWe have to study until we know through wisdom and can understand those things that appear within ourselvesThis true knowingness has no ups and downsIt is never like thatA condition arises and the one who practices recognizes it as suchWhen all these conditions end so does any concern about themAll that is left is the consummate state of purityOur investigations depended on the continual encountering with such conditions in the heartIf they were around they would need to declare their existence so that its always possible to know the true state of affairsTherefore if we want the truth we must look for and investigate the feelings that arise and similarly with any sadness or cheerfulness any happiness or suffering that appearSuch is the way of one who knows with allround wisdom being aware of any condition that resides with the heartThere is only this one place where we can finish off our studiesThey talk of graduating with a Bachelor degree or a Masters or Doctorate or of passing the various exams of Paali language study following the popular convention of the timeThroughout the ages people with defilements have always had to rely on customs and observances and these are numerous beyond descriptionThe ways of Dhamma though always remain current because their nature is constant and immutableYou can have as many grades and degrees as you like  level fifteen or level thirty But I wonder if defilements bother with such thingsThey just have a great time singing away there on top of peoples heartsSince when were they meeker and more humble than peopleThey wield greater power than people  stupid people that isIntelligent people are able to crush and destroy them and this is the way to gain our knowledge and qualificationOur Bachelors degree of virtue samadhi and wisdom is all around us  better to take this BAThen on to the Masters and the premier Ek grade so that we have one heart One DhammaBut this isnt the preeminence of someone with only one eye who is already nearly blindDont be foremost in that wayThe true preeminence of the Lord Buddha is one heart One DhammaStudy up to this PhDby having allround knowledge to the highest degree replacing our ignorance with knowledge about ourselvesInspect using wisdom to probe and clearup until reaching the Highest Dhamma level or the genuine Dhamma which are the sameThe heart and Dhamma are one and the sameBuddham Dhammam Sangham saranam gacchaami  finding refuge in Buddha Dhamma and Sangha falls completely within this One DhammaDhammo padiipo  the radiance of Dhamma always shining brightlyThis is the genuine DhammaIt is timeless and unconditioned the true DhammaAlright then  build the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha right here within the heartBuddham Dhammam Sangham saranam gacchaamiWe go for refuge to the Buddha Dhamma and SanghaMore precisely we arrive at the Buddha Dhamma Sangha in the purity inside the heart for this is the coming together of all three refugesSee them clearly within the heart and make yourself a refuge withinThis is the complete attaahi attano naatho We are our own refuge not needing to depend on anything elseAs is the Buddha so is Dhamma and SanghaBuddha Dhamma Sangha are the sameWhen one has reached this stage theres no need to go out seeking to pay respects to the Lord Buddha for we can now offer this purity of heart  the whole Dhamma of this purity  as our puja offering to himNothing else intermeshes and fits together as wellAs is the Buddha of the Lord Buddha so is the Buddha of usAs is that Dhamma so this Dhamma hereWithout doubt they are all one and the sameDid the Lord Buddha finally pass away so long agoWe no longer ask because this concerns the conditioned state of elements the body and aggregatesThe Lord merely let go of his aggregates at a certain time in a certain year and placeThe Noble Disciples were just the sameWere they all completely annihilated after they passed awayIs it really like thatThis is the view of empty worthless men and women the truth is otherwiseThe real Dhamma is that of supreme happiness which endorses and confirms the fruit of that purityWhat is SanghoIt is the one who upholds the state of purityThis is the true sangho and is found within ourselves Attaahi attano naatho  oneself is ones own protectorThe vital point is to make this refuge sufficiently secure for its imperative that the heart frees itself from all dangers and attains to deliveranceWhatever is worth attaining is worth striving forGo for it right hereDont upset yourself over anything at allNothing really matters in this worldIts just that our heart goes and gets involvedWe actually go looking for affairs to indulge ourself in and this needs cutting away with mindfulness and wisdomWherever we are we are always aloneWe are born aloneWhen illness comes it isnt the assembled relatives that are in painWhen we die we die alone  nobody else can die in our place or deputize for our distressTherefore we must help ourselves  Attaahi attano naatho  using our own mindfulness and wisdomThis is the right and most fitting responseThe Lord Buddha decided to let go of his life on this same full moon dayFor us today we should resolve to abandon craving and defilementsThese are the essential things that one must be rid ofAs far as dying is concerned the Lord Buddha said it wasnt important which day we die onWhenever the breath runs out that is the day we dieThe only criterion is our last breathIf theres still breath then we havent yet diedSo we keep on breathing which in itself is no great problemIts really just about a lot of windThe important point is the founding of a base and the putting ourselves on alert  all for the sake of our heartAttaahi attano naatho oneself is ones own protectorWhen this is accomplished then there is contentment in living or dying wherever and whenever it might take placeNo more problems remain for they were only concerned with mundane conditionsThats it for this talk on DhammaI think its suitable to stop hereNo one can surpass the Lord Buddha in wishing for people to be virtuous and goodHis Teaching was offered so that people in the world might find goodness and happinessHe didnt want the world to be troubled and hurt through misdeeds arising from ignorance of the right way of conductThe building up of the perfections to become a Buddha full of compassion for all sentient beings was an exacting task  very different from all other forms of achievementAnd his mastery went along with his compassion hand in handAnyone listening to the Lord Buddhas teachings  from his own lips or from the scriptures  and trusting those principles of truth would then try to correct and improve themselves so as to be a virtuous personOne individual takes it up and a second and then each family member however many there might be all change themselves for the betterOne virtuous person  but when such people live together it becomes one virtuous familycircle and then one virtuous village and town and countryTheres no need to ask about the whole countrys peace and stability for it must definitely follow from the goodness of all its individual citizensOn the other hand hardship and discontent only arise because of wrong doings and basenessThe number of corrupted individuals corresponds to the extent that the body of society is stuck with splinters and thornsThe more there are the more hellish the world becomesIt is then dark both in the night and daytime and is in a constant state of disturbanceThere is no need to go and search after hell for it is being forged right there in the hearts of peopleFrom there it spreads and extends everywhere turning all to fireThis only happens because of those wrongdoings not because of what is skillful and rightWhen things are in harmony with the Buddha Dhamma such a situation cant ariseThere would then be no need for judges courts of appeal or a supreme courtThere would be no cases to settle because everyone is intent on living virtuously all trying to follow a just and sensible way togetherIn discussions there would be mutual understanding  it wouldnt matter if it were between young and old man and woman ordained and householderThis springs from a deep understanding of the nature and reasons for goodness and baseness that is within ones heartThere only would be the wish and intention to see in the way of reason truth and virtueEveryone would listen sympathetically to one another and always conduct themselves fairly and justly with no need for secrecyThe world however doesnt seem to follow the hearts wishWherever one goes there are only complaints about suffering and misfortuneThe whole earth seems to be in a state of confusion and unrest even though everyone studies and searches for knowledgeThis knowledge however doesnt appear to be of much use  it might even end up burning one instead  because it isnt knowledge imbued with DhammaIt doesnt have Dhamma to add a protective coat or to act as a support a brake an accelerator or steeringwheelIt therefore trundles forward in any old direction without any limit or boundsWhen examined in this light the value and importance of the Lord Buddhas Dhamma stands out clearlyThe individual effort to change oneself for the better even though one cant do the same for anyone else will provide peace and contentment wherever one isSuch happiness will result from your right actions and way of living and this will follow for anyone who practices in the same wayThis right way and contentment have a series of levels  everyone being able to step up to the general level with the right intention and effortDont allow yourself to miss out on this for the world can be worth living in and can bring happiness peace and joyBeyond this mundane joy lies the prospect of progress and happiness within the heart itselfHowever it does need commitment and energy to achieve this subtle and more refined type of happinessThose who are especially interested in the way of meditation really stand in the front line  if this is considered in images of going to war and battleThose who decide on this approach cant afford to be weak and faintheartedWhatever they attempt will require vigilance and such exertion will then steadily develop in them a consistent and stable mindfulnessAny lack of this and they wont be considered tough enough to succeed in the warThis toughness depends on an alert effort together with mindfulness and wisdom checking on the behavior to see whether it is going in the right or wrong wayAs this becomes increasingly subtle and involved it is more and more necessary to depend on the protection of mindfulness and wisdomThe stream of the heart and its various imaginings and concoctions will not then go and amass poisonous ideas and emotional objects with which to burn and torment itselfOnce the heart has received proper care and nurturing it will gradually come to peace and be radiant and happy without any fading into downhearted dullness as it did beforeAll of you have been training here for quite a long time so please draw into your heart the Dhamma of the Lord BuddhaDont think that youll be leaving your teacher and monastery behindYour departure is only an activity or physical movementThe important thing to remember are the Lord Buddhas wordsAnyone who practices Dhamma in accordance with the way of Dhamma is truly one who offers reverence to the TathagataThat practice is the way of mindfulness wisdom faith and diligent effortIt has to be there in every posture and at all timesThis right conduct within the heart together with continuous watchfulness is what is meant by practicing Dhamma following the Way and giving constant reverence to the Tathagata the Lord BuddhaThe Lord Buddha continuedWhoever sees Dhamma sees the TathagataHow does one see know and practice so as to see this DhammaIts by practicing as we are doing now and especially refers to meditationThis is the way of practicing DhammaSeeing Dhamma is discerning those obstructions present within oneself that should be counted the enemyThese are the first two Noble Truths that of Suffering and its CauseWe investigate these things to penetrate to their true nature which exists in every human being and animal  the only exception being the arahant who has gone beyondThe rest of us must possess this Cause to some degree and its this that he called the Noble TruthBy examining and seeing Dhamma in the true state of affairs its then possible to turn to letting go and uprootingThis results in coolness and peace withinThis letting go and uprooting is also termed seeing Dhamma for it is a gradual seeing level by level step by step until one finally perceives the whole TathagataWe can speak about these levels of attainment in this way Those who have practiced up to streamentry can be said to have seen the Lord Buddha at one level having penetrated into the stream of DhammaIt is the beginning of seeing as if you are standing in a field and can glimpse the Lord in the distanceThe oncereturner stage seems to bring the Lord a little closer and the nonreturner sees him closer stillUntil finally with the arahant stage you see the Lord Buddha in fullThe Dhamma that facilitates our reaching each of these stages resides with everyone of usHolding to the practice is like following behind and sighting the TathagataOne sees him by way of cause which is our practice and by way of result which is the steadily attained fruit of that practiceThe Lord Buddha went this way before seeing and steadily realizing and passing beyondTherefore the heart of the one who practices is never apart from the Lord Buddha Dhamma or the SanghaBy virtue of that practice reverence is given to the Tathagata the Dhamma and the SanghaThis is true reverence and is the way  through diligent effort  of having continuous audience with the Lord BuddhaDeparting and going away is only activityThere is a departing right here when for example after sitting here you leave to sit over there from there you return to sit hereThere is a continual departingYou shouldnt be concerned with leaving this place for that this town for that this house for elsewhereLeaving from here for far or near  there is continual departing in this world of impermanence where things are constantly changingBy using the three marks we can reflect upon these things so that it becomes a Dhamma lessonThose who truly know and see will always depend on this principle as the way to move forwardWhile we are here we practice Dhamma and when we are there we practice Dhamma  because it is aimed at letting go at eradicating defilements and ending all the suffering within the heartWe practice wherever we are so as to uproot and release and for this purpose our present location isnt relevantThe Lord Buddha therefore taught the Noble DisciplesGo bhikkhus and seek secluded placesBe steadfast and resolute thereThis is the way to have constant audience with the TathagataThere is no need for all of you to come here to gather around the TathagataThat is not the wayBut rather whoever has mindfulness and is diligent in all postures immediately gives reverence and has audience with the TathagataNonchalantly sitting around here is not the way to meet nor to see or have audience with the TathagataThe Tathagata does not regard the coming here and the going away as having an audience with or taking leave of the TathagataThe Tathagata considers that diligence in the practice to eradicate defilements from the heart whether little or much as steadily gaining audience with the TathagataThis is the progressive seeing of the TathagataIt is the major principle in the Teaching that allows a clear sight of the Tathagata rather than peering with dim and blurry eyes lacking in mindfulnessJust completely rid yourselves of the poisons in the heart and then compare the resulting state that you have realized  is there any difference between that nature and the TathagataPlainly without question such a purified nature is identical with itListenThe essence of the Lord Buddhas teaching is just like thisTraining your heart and developing yourself into a good person is the way to accumulate happinessWith increasing growth within the heart the result will of course be happinessNot being able to find happiness or it being incomplete arises because of obstructions in the heart which are the defilementsNothing else is able to obstruct and pierce the hearts of all sentient beings preventing them from finding happiness and fulfillmentSuffering and hardship whether internal or external is solely caused by defilementsFor example when the body is feverish or ill the defilements will also get in the act by moaning about the pain here or the ache thereThis disturbs and worries which adds yet another load of suffering for the heart to go with the bodily illnessCommon bodily upset or illness was experienced by both the Lord Buddha and the Noble DisciplesIts the nature of the aggregates to be ruled by the thisworldly law of the three marksWhoever has aggregates and elements cannot go beyond this worldly norm with the inevitable consequences of change and impermanenceHowever their hearts did not waver because there was already total understanding of the state of thingsBut its not like that for usWhen we have bodily pain whether much or little it also shows in the heart that accumulates additional sufferingThe amount cant be estimated but sometimes the suffering within the heart becomes greater than that of the bodyThis is what is meant by an encompassing infiltration by the defilements when we are absentminded and carelessWhen there is no mindfulness and wisdom to know what the defilements are up to they can penetrate in every possible way regardless of time place or postureAll thats necessary is for the heart to move and show itself without mindfulness and wisdom becomes more like perceivingmemoryIts as if the heart becomes the defilements unknowing helperIn such a situation Dhamma cant possible arise and it can only go the way of the defilements and their steady increaseIts therefore necessary to throw in the full force of your mindfulness and wisdom faith and energy to keep up with the events happening within the heartResearch into these elements and aggregates will make you an outstanding person but graduation from any other kind of study will never be enoughThere will still be the thirst for more much like anything in this worldHowever when your studies into the elements aggregates and heart are completed that thirst will also be endedYou will find complete fulfillmentAt present you are deficient in the theory of Aggregateology and the application and practice of itThis is really about mindfulness and wisdom and the penetrative insight into the true nature of the elements and aggregatesIt is analysis by separating the true from the falseBut when the study is not yet concluded or understood endless confusion and turmoil will remain with the elements aggregates and heartThere is no confusion and agitation worse than that found in the elements the aggregates and heartThis is where all sorts of complications are constantly emerging because we have yet to clear them upThis indictment can only be dismissed through the studying of the case right there with mindfulness and wisdom disentangling the truth and giving judgment after careful deliberationAlrightLets wind up these studiesWhat is there in these elements and aggregates  as Ive always said theresForm aggregate which is everything in this body of oursFeeling aggregate which comprises painful pleasant and neutral feelings that arise within the body and heartPerception aggregate is memory and assumed knowledge of various thingsThought processing is the creative concocting facility of the heart that thinks about virtue or wickedness past or future without any limitationConsciousness aggregate which acknowledges forms sounds smells tastes or tactile objects as they come into contact with the sensesAnd at that moment reports them to the heart to acknowledgeOnce that contact ends the consciousness lapses as the object passesThis is called consciousness of the five aggregatesThe consciousness of the five aggregates is different from the relinking consciousnessThis refers to mind and particularly to the heartIt is the heart that is about to enter into relinking consciousness taking birth in the various forms of existenceThe consciousness of the five aggregates arises and ceases with the things that come into contact with itThat is the acknowledgement ceases along with the passing away of those thingsThe relinking consciousness however refers to the heart that possesses the faculty of knowing alone and by itselfEven if nothing makes contact with it it doesnt endStudy these five aggregates  and do it exhaustivelyKeep on going over it revising and researching until you can understandThis is the field of work for anyone wanting to be rid of defilements and craving by the demolishing of the cycle of birth and deathThe heart spins through birth in various forms of existence endlessly roving and reserving itself a place in cemeteries all over the placeThe reservation is made even before deathThis is all due to delusion  ignorance about the true nature of the aggregatesWe grasp at more of them even though we already have a heap of themTheres never enough so we fall and catch hold of them without limit  unless of course wisdom can be called in to investigateAnalyze and investigate so that you come to true knowledge and can therefore cut free the attachmentTake up the study of the elements and aggregates  or take this body for therein lies the substance of the Noble Truth and the Four Foundations of MindfulnessThese are synonyms for the same thing and can replace each other in our investigationsWe will find that they are all essentially concerned with the Noble Truths and the Four Foundations of MindfulnessNormally without illness or disease the body exists simply as the body and form is still just formHowever when the body changes and becomes abnormal and disordered it then follows its natural courseThe painful feeling that arises due to this irregularity does not remain for long and you should just let the heart know it for what it isThis is the way to study AggregateologyDont be alarmed or frightened or depressed with them for this is their normal inevitable course in the worldThey have to follow a progressive transformation with both subtle unnoticed changes and marked changesThey change in accordance with their nature  at every period every secondBut perhaps even a second is too long a time rather make it every instant all the timeThey just change continually changeThere is no pause no taking time off for rest and sleep like animals and people doAs for suffering that also manifests itself constantly without stopping for sleep or restPeople may take time off for leisure and recuperation but that doesnt apply to the Noble Truths and the three marksThey never stop never ease off with anybodyThey proceed along their course both day and night with standing walking sitting or lying downThe condition of these things is to turn through their changesThis body too revolves as it changes its position and stateWe sit for a little while and then an ache appearsHave things changedWell if they havent whats this pain doing hereThis ache is called painful feelingIt is one sort of condition that arises in our awareness one aspect of the Noble TruthsExamine it and see it as it really is for in the last resort theres no alternativeTo think that you can depend on some other person is a misreading of the situationSomething that will drain your resolve leaving you weak and disheartened in the task of saving yourselfSuch wrong understanding or misapprehension comes from the defilements subversive insinuations constantly deceiving youThis happens both in normal times and in times of sickness and emergency cutting the ground from under your feet by means of their trickeryWhen the final time is really drawing near it is like a boxer in the ringBefore climbing into the ring the trainer can teach and instruct but once in the ring there is no way to teach anything moreRight or wrong good or bad alive or dead  you now have to rely and help yourself to the utmostIts now too late to learn any new boxing techniquesThe time of going into battle is that of the final moment when the aggregates and the heart are going their separate waysIt is the time of breaking upIt is like when crows and vultures come down and sit together on the branches of a treeWhen they alighted the branches hardly shook at all but when they fly away they jolt the branches until the whole tree vibratesAny dry dead branches will break and fall in the processAt the time when the body is departing how hard will it shake usHow are we going to stand up to this shaking  with mindfulness and wisdom thats howWithout them we definitely wont be able to bear it and will lose our balance and controlWe must therefore fight to the fullest capacity of our mindfulness and wisdomDont even think about the possibility of collapsing in the fightOur vigorous questioning of the truth about the nature of the body is aimed towards gaining release not towards destructionThis is the chief way to help oneself in a critical situation by using all ones strength and is the right course recommended by the wiseWhen the time of emergency arrives it will be all pain  clearly showing itself throughout every part of the body as if each piece is burningInside the body will be like a blazing redhot furnaceSo what are we going to do nowMindfulness and wisdom must be sighted on that heat that suffering and painClearly discerning we can then turn and observe our heartIs the heart also redhotOr is it only the body and aggregates that are on fireIf you are already wellpracticed in using mindfulness and wisdom youll find that the heart is cool and unaffected even in the midst of such a conflagrationIt is the body that is burning with the flames of sufferingThis is how we who practice must see itThis is the way of selfhelp without leaning on any one else for you are already up in there in the fighting ringOnce you are determined to fight then fight using reason and your full strengthCome what mayLive or dieWho cares who might have to carry me out of the ring Its a fight to the end  but fight cleverly dont just close your eyes and allow yourself to be like a dummy accepting all the punishment without blocking or returning punchesThats uselessFight with energy putting your life on the lineIf you have to die then so be itBut therell be no retreatUse your mindfulness and wisdom that is tuned to be the most advanced weapon goingBattling with feeling means penetrating to its true natureDont attempt to force it to disappear for that is trying to go against feelings natural courseThe only way is to examine it as it really is and then let it disappear of itselfIf it still lingers then realize that thats how things are and dont go in and grasp hold of itForm is form  dont bring in anything to contradict this or make it something elseForm is form body is body and its just body just formFeeling is feeling  whether its painful pleasant or neutral its really only feelingWhat is this that knows body knows feelingIts the heart of courseThe heart is not of that nature and must be separated and clearly seen with wisdomThis is truly seeing the Noble Truth and there will now be no wavering even if the body cant endureRight thenLets turn and face the battle lets see what will go first and what will outlastWith our confidence riding with mindfulness and wisdom well know the truth that the heart is not the one that dies but is that which is there to acknowledge whatever is presentAlright then whatever is impermanent  may it go its wayThe body cant endureThen let it break upFeelings dont last well let them dissolveIf its impermanent then let is all disperseHowever whatever endures will last and prevailWhat is it that prevailsIt is that which knows which is the heartThereIts the one who knows standing out distinctly all the timeThe results will definitely be like this once you have successfully trained yourself in the way of mindfulness and wisdomBut if your mindfulness and wisdom are deficient then the heart will remain feeble and easily discouragedAll kinds of suffering will then converge into the heart because it is the heart itself that accumulates suffering through its own stupidityWeakness therefore is certainly not the path that leads away from harm and dangerIt has to be accomplished through diligence and hard work with a warrior spirit armed with mindfulness and wisdomNothing else can bring victory and preeminence goodness and virtue excellence and distinction nothing else brings bravery and fearlessness to arise within the heartPlease consider it in this way Suppose that we return home without a teacher or instructorWell what teaching have we already received and what are we really missingThe teacher is still present in his teaching and its there that well find the Tathagata and the DhammaWe are with the Dhamma with the Lord Buddha and with the Sangha at all times because of the Teaching that we train ourselves withWe do not lack a teacher or an instructorWe live with a refuge in having mindfulness wisdom faith and energy out fighting to destroy those things that are our enemyHow can we say we are without a teacher when we exist with our teacherSo we must strive to gain knowledge together with this teacherThis is the way to practice without loneliness or wavering but endowed with firmness and steadfastness in the truth of DhammaThe teachers instructions are constantly embraced as the internal guide within the heartWherever we may be we can say that we are with a teacher with an instructor with the Lord Buddha the Dhamma and the Sangha  because the real Buddha Dhamma and Sangha are within the heartIt is only the heart that can be with Buddha Dhamma and Sangha or the whole essence of DhammaThe body doesnt know anythingHow on earth can it ever know anything about the Lord Buddha the Dhamma and the SanghaFeeling also doesnt know while perception just remembers and then its gone and thought processing imagines and then vanishesHow can there be any basis in them sufficient to accommodate the Lord BuddhaThe one who can truly receive is that which really understands the Lord BuddhaThe real Buddho is just this heartSo investigate the heart to your utmostDont be weak or discouragedIn any case all of us must eventually enter into this battleIts unavoidableAll we can do is to help ourselves and its very certain that we will need to help ourselvesWhen the time of necessity is upon us nobody else can helpWhether father or mother son or daughter husband or wife they can only stand by and watch with affection sympathy and yearningThey all long to help but when the time comes they are powerlessThe only things that can help us transcend suffering and torment and to be free from all bondage are mindfulness wisdom and our own effortThere is nothing elseWe must therefore be strict with ourselves be firm at heart even if the body is nearing its endFrom this moment on this is something to keep close to your heartThen you wont lose out later onHowever the aggregates might display themselves the one certain thing is that they arent above deathWhether they appear often or not they will come to dieSo the one who knows knows till death at which time the body dissolves and that which knows is rid of all problems and obligationsLets get down to the crux of the matterRight to the essence of truth of cause and effectThen we will arrive at the real and genuine Dhamma within the heartThis Dhamma presentation seems enough so Ill finish hereListening to a Dhamma talk keep your attention in the presentDont send the mind outward but keep it focused within youll then be able to experience the true taste of Dhamma right in your heartIt has been taught that one may gain five benefits while listening to a Dhamma talkThen there are also those benefits that come to fruition in the future that are extra gainsThis is the reason that so many followers became enlightened while listening to the Lord Buddhas DhammaThey had correctly stationed their heart in the present without concern for past or future being wholly receptive and ready to experience the taste of Dhamma that the Lord was presentingThe Lord first went forth into homelessness greatly aroused by DhammaEven prior to this he had had a growing fascination and concern originating with his successive encounters with the four devadutas  the sights of the old man the sick man the dead man and the holy manFrom the first day of his going forth he labored with great effort and determination through the austere practices always committed to his task up to the day of his EnlightenmentHe thought neither to abandon his undertaking nor to slacken in his pursuitThe laziness discouragement and weakness prevailing over the hearts of all other sentient beings could not overcome himThe noble disciples also went forth with conscientiousness and the intention to find freedom from suffering following the example of the LordThey attended to each word of the Lords Dhamma and put it into practice with devotionTheir staying their coming or going were always accompanied by mindfulnessEvery facet of exertion went together with reflection and application of the principles of truthThe results and the rewards of their concern and dedication seem to contrast with those of our timeThis is due to the immense difference in the appreciation of Dhamma and the intensity of practiceIts then obvious that the results cant possibly be the sameThe Lord Buddha didnt relent or relax in his quest from the first day of his endeavor to the day of his EnlightenmentIt was on finally reaching his goal that he became the Great Teacher of the worldHe then brought the Dhamma out to the Buddhist Community  teaching and urging them to follow the path of Dhamma by which he himself had succeededThose who received what was revealed by the Lord delighted in the essence of DhammaBy taking it up and applying it in their practice in due course they had all variously come to Dhamma attainments acquiring the Dhamma Eye like the Lord had before themThe Lord Buddha became the model and ideal for the Buddhist Community right from the beginningThis is made plain from the way he practiced by always spending his time living away in the forestWhen he renounced the home life he went forth into the forest and no longer took any interest in people including those in the realm he had once ruled over with peace and securityNo longer being concerned with his princely status he courageously and unflinchingly stood up to the ordeal of his exertionsIn this respect no one can surpass the Lord for every mode of his practice transcended the worldHis renunciation and going forth into homelessness differed from the usual way of the world so when the results appeared they also differedThey were now of two disparate worlds for his heart had been transformed into the purified heart of a BuddhaHis accomplishments stood in distinct contrast to the rest of the worldThis was also true for the noble disciples who had gone forth following the Lord BuddhaThey rejoiced and delighted on hearing the Lord present the basic fundamental guidelinesRukkhamuulasenaasanam nissaaya pabbajjaa tatthavo yaavajivam ussahokaraniiyoWe could express this in our own wordsLook over thereTheres a mountain and a deep jungle mountainsides and gorges brooks and streams cliffs peaks and mountain slopesThere are the water courses and banks of mountain riversThese are places of ease and quietude free from all forms of entanglementSeek for such areas and strive there amongst such scenesThe Tathagata attained his Buddhahood from these settings and surroundings not through socializing and mingling togetherHe didnt become enlightened by indulging in frivolity and merriment by trailing in the flow of desire selfseeking ambitions and obsessions and allowing himself to be dragged away under the authority of defilements and desiresOn the contrary the Tathagata came to his Enlightenment in secluded and deserted placesThose were the spots where he made his great effort escaping from his palace and city and all their manner of peoplesThe Tathagata went through hardship and adversity that was born and derived from his exertion in those secluded and remote placesEnlightenment didnt come to him amidst the grandeur and magnificence of palaces or amongst the crowds at crossroads or market placesIt came to him in solitude and seclusion totally retired from the worldThe Tathagata accomplished and arrived at the state of purity of a Buddha in these outlying placesMay all of you therefore turn towards these places that the Tathagata has describedThe mountains hillsides caves and shady trees the deep forests and the distant open spaces where the air is light and clearThese spots are deserted and quiet free from confusions and troubles forsaken by peopleIf you all aspire to the state free from suffering then you must follow the route of the Tathagata to those placesThen you too will definitely one day also reach the ending of lives and existences the of the glowing coals in the pit of repeated births and deathsWhat Ive just explained was in fact the second of the basic guidelinesThe first directive wasPamsakuula ciivaram All of you who have gone forth should seek for discarded materials left in cemeteries or along the road sidesStitch and sew them together to make your lower robe upper robe and outer robe so they may be used to cover and protect your body sustaining the holy life from day to dayThis will accord with your recluseship and spartan life following the way of DhammaSubsist frugally on the four requisites of living  food shelter clothing and medicine  and be content with little satisfied with whatever requisites accrue without indulgence in excess and lavish wastefulnessYou may however accept the gift of robes presented by lay devotees as long as it is the way of simplicity and moderationOne causes oneself to be easily fed and cared for without causing problems and concerns for the faithful supportersThe third of the guidelines wasPindiyaalopabhojanaHaving gone forth in the religion you cant afford to be lazyGo on an almsround feeding yourself by your own effort and on your own two feet with a pure and honest heartThe faithful devotees willingly and happily offer the gift of food following the samanas tradition avoiding the usual worldly bargaining with moneyThe going for alms in order to support yourself is the pure and impeccable livelihood for one who has gone forthYou should try to maintain this practice for the rest of your lifeAny occasions of abundance and excess should be considered exceptional circumstances when you need to oblige the laityAny shower of gifts however must never be taken heedlessly complacently thinking that they indicate your honor and dignityThey would then be transformed into gifts and offerings that kill the unworthyThe fourth instruction was GilaanabhesajjaThis refers to medicine for curing the sickness that can depending on conditions afflict both monks and lay peopleThe remedy needs to accommodate to and measure up with the particular situation as if it were its shadowHowever know and exercise moderation in requesting assistance from relatives or those supporters who volunteer their serviceYou must keep it well within the bounds of proprietyKnowing moderation is the necessary quality that all who have gone forth must bear in mindHe then becomes sangha sobhana a graceful recluse who adorns the religion with refinement and beauty being well received by fellow Buddhists and the public everywhereThe important point for a monk to remember is to be always prudent and wary of immoderation in soliciting anything at allNever make a habit of visiting and seeking aid from lay people but rather exercise moderation in response to the given situationAfter hearing and accepting these fundamental Dhamma guidelines from the Lord Buddha the noble disciples all gladly practiced them with zealous dedicationEach went their separate ways into the seclusion and solitude of the forests and mountains unhindered by concern for life and well beingWhatever their family backgrounds  some were even kings and princes  none asserted their status and positionThat would have only activated pride and snobbery and contempt for those requisites of living that the ordinary lay supporters were able to provideThe noble disciples welcomed any kind of food  save that set aside under the vinaya code  for the sake of sustaining their life processes and supporting a steady Dhamma practiceThey were mindful of their exertion their practical duties and observancesThey were attracted to quiet and secluded surroundings far away from noise confusion and all disturbing influencesThey continued with steady endeavor by both day and night and in all posturesFor them nothing was more worthwhile and rewarding than the practice that would rid them of sufferingAll the noble disciples considered freedom from suffering as the priceless DhammaIt went beyond any gains that repeated births and deaths could show for those all originated in the deceit of ignorance which is the root source of the constant suffering of all sentient beingsThe total dedication of the noble disciples meant that neither pride of royal blood and wealthy family nor pride of scholarship and erudition could infiltrate their heartsFor this reason all of them from the first to the last arahant disciple were able to gain Enlightenment following the Lord BuddhaMay all you who practice therefore turn your attention to the reports describing the Lord Buddha and his arahant disciplesConsider how their practicing came to success how they achieved renown and were revered by all sections of the world  including those of the heavenly deva realmsThe Lord Buddha the Dhamma and the Sangha cannot be surpassed for wisdom discernment and accomplishmentThey reign supreme so let us all carefully consider thisBeing easily discouraged and obsessed with food and sleep are not ways to nobility and freedom from sufferingThey cant make the supreme Dhamma manifest within the field of our awareness which is our heartIn every movement and posture always give heed to reason and be constantly observant of your actionsMake sure that these actions dont cause delay or stain your body speech and heartDelight in seclusion and solitude and totally commit your efforts of both body and heart to the Dhamma workLet a dogged determination be your guide through every thought and movement always pointing to the goal  freedom from sufferingThe outcome is then assuredly equivalent to that found by the Lord Buddha and the noble disciples since it follows the same pathThe Lord Buddha did not present the Dhamma teaching  about right view and right thought for instance  to just anyoneIt was aimed specifically at all those who practice the way of moral precepts samadhi and wisdomHaving once stepped out along the Path that the Lord pointed out by living and practicing in accord with the fundamental guidelines that weve already discussed  rukkhamuula senaasanam or living at the foot of trees is another example  there can only be one resultIt is freedom from suffering and reaching to the natural prominence of a noble disciple of the Lord Buddha which is the state of purity within the heartWhatever your posture whatever youre doing always be mindful  the only exception being during sleep when its beyond ones meansIncline yourself towards applying mindfulness and wisdom with strenuous effortThe reality of deliverance will then appear within the heartDuring the Lord Buddhas time people listened to Dhamma with earnest interest securing the Dhamma they heard within their mindThey didnt allow the Dhamma to slip away and disperse nor did they listen merely for courtesys sake treating it more as a ritualWhatever people do nowadays  and that includes all you monks here  seems to become mere ritualWithout true dedication and firm determination everything you attempt will insensibly turn into ritualFor instance to walk along your meditation path just to keep up with a set schedule becomes ritualisticThe question is whether the heart and mindfulness are in harmony with your exertionConsequently the end results may very well be different from what was expectedWhy should it be soIts because even though we may be walking meditation the heart is elsewhere occupied with every other thing except the DhammathemeWhat is this principle of DhammaIt is always to be mindful while striving in ones practiceThe heart together with mindfulness may drift and wander drawn away by the allure and fascination of other places and objects rather than being focused in the object taken upThis indicates that the flow of the heart is already going astrayWhether your practice is one of samadhi or investigation the ensuing results must be contrary to Dhamma  being something else altogetherSuch is the way when we are not observant of our actions and strive in the practice more for practices sake or from a sense of obligationWe might then fall into wrong view and criticize the religion disparaging the Lord Buddhas Dhamma Teaching as not being the true Niyyanika Dhamma unable to lead us away from sufferingAnd that its unequal to its claim of being the Welltaught DhammaThe reality is that the flow of our heart is constantly by both day and night pulling toward the worldSo please bear in mind that the world whether the inner or the external world is different from DhammaThe endeavor of the Lord Buddha and all the noble disciples is aimed at the Dhamma principle as the deliverance from sufferingConsequently every turn of their exertion was for the erasing of stains until they were totally removed and came to Buddho  to which the world pays homage and respectThey had attained to the summit of Dhamma because their practices accorded with DhammaThis has to be the outcome when the means and ends come together in complete harmonyFor us though we may be walking on our meditation path or sitting in samadhi practice but our samadhi is merely a stumplike samadhiThis is when we actually fall asleep right in that samadhi practiceWe may do this many times  and it may even become routine for some people although I personally cant confirm itYet it does seem quite probable going by the results people manage to getIf the cause accords with Dhamma then the result cant be otherwiseBoth the means and ends must correspondIt must be because we dont practice following the principles of DhammaInstead of walking or sitting in meditation  with mindfulness in tune with our exertion and the Dhamma theme or processes under investigation  the heart turns asideThe flow of the heart goes chasing after forms sounds smells tastes and tactile objectsFurthermore the mental objects conceived in the heart are also about forms sounds smells tastes and tactile objects whether they be past or futureThe heart never stays with the present for even a single momentIf this is the case the results must always be mundane and commonplace since the flow of the heart is constantly involved with worldly affairsThe heart for its part will also remain mundane acting as the source of suffering that afflicts us with trouble and hardshipWe consequently find fault with that which results Why should there be anxiety and worryWhy am I miserable today We never consider that its we ourselves who perpetually instigate this unpleasantness by running at crosspurposes with DhammaThats why the outcome has to be as it isFor this reason all of us who practice must constantly secure within our minds the resolution to be free from sufferingWe must never allow our actions done through body speech and mind to deviate from the teaching of the Lord BuddhaHe taught us to seek for seclusion and solitude in the deep forests that are appropriate and conducive to our exertionThere were no exhortations to go live and practice in the market at the crossroads or in crowded places packed with peopleAs if such places would instantly enable us to arrive at the safe haven free from sufferingWe must consider what this living at the root of a tree really meansEvery facet of the Dhamma Teaching expounded by all the Buddhas has behind it sound and justifiable reasonIt is the basis for truth bringing benefit to those who observe and practice itThis is why the story of the Lord Buddha and the noble disciples  how they cultivated the Way and came to the ultimate accomplishment becoming great teachers for the whole world  is a story of great wonder and marvelYet however great a Teacher they may be the teaching cant always hit homeFor us the vital point is to take the Dhamma  the principle of truth and reason that is the essence of the Great Teacher  as that which will give us constant instructionEvery action will then be made known to our teacher which is our own heartThis must without neglect or absentmindedness always be borne in mindOtherwise we will never manage to keep to our course and survive but will squander time worthlesslyDont allow the idea that one particular day or night whether past present or future is somehow exceptional or unusualIts still that regular sort of day or nightThe defilements dont depend on time but are concerned with the heart and all related states and conditionsThis is the crucial factPlease investigate itWherever you go always make sure the great Teacher leads as the guideWhether sitting lying down standing or walking mindfulness must be there with each postureWithout a basis in mindfulness and wisdom calm of heart and clear discernment cannot ariseThis is because mindfulness wisdom and diligent effort form the surrounding protective barrier and are the elements that substantiate themAs we tread the path through our strenuous effort we keep within the guidelines of precepts samadhi and wisdomThis is all that is requiredWe will then experience the realm free from suffering right within our own heart  without having to ask anyone else about itRegardless of time if the Welltaught Dhamma is still extant in the world and if the one listening to it takes it up for study by dedicatedly practicing following its instruction the result can only be freedom from sufferingThis will be clearly perceived in their heartPlease keep this in mind and correct the problem there otherwise youll steadily regress and will fail to accomplish anythingWith mindfulness and a continual probing with wisdom into the natural things and processes  the body for example  youll constantly come across extraordinary understandingOn the other hand if your effort is unsettled and spasmodic the forthcoming results will similarly be deficientTherefore really try to cultivate and develop mindfulness and wisdom up to a steady awareness and discernmentThis will definitely contribute to samadhi the firmness and stability of heart and to a genuine wisdom that follows from investigating the four Foundations of Mindfulness and the four Noble TruthsPlease also understand that both the Foundations of Mindfulness and the Noble Truths are dhammas of the present which are constantly manifesting here and now within our body and heartIn the Middle Way of Practice the Lord detailed right viewThere are right views concerning things in general more specific things and the really subtle aspects of DhammaThe right views of ordinary Buddhists deal especially with the conviction that virtuous deeds and wrongdoing good and evil really do existAnd that those performing such actions must reap the corresponding results either of good or evilThis is one level of right viewThe more specific view is of those who take up the practice and using wisdom investigate the four Foundations of Mindfulness and the four Noble TruthsHere one examines the body feeling citta and dhamma in terms of the three marks  that they are all intrinsically bound up with impermanence suffering and notselfBuild up your faith and firm conviction in Truth and Dhamma through investigating the three marks inherent within all things and by making that the course for wisdom to followMoreover explore the Noble Truths to realize that suffering  that which arises in body and heart in both oneself and all other beings  is something that one cant afford to remain complacent aboutRecognize the harm caused by the Source that generates the immeasurable suffering that all creatures must endlessly endureThen youll be ready to dismantle and undo that Source using wisdom to arrive at Cessation which is the sphere of the total ending of sufferingThe level of right view on these subtler aspects of Dhamma deals with correctly seeing the Truth of Suffering its Source its Cessation and the Way which are precepts samadhi and wisdomThis is right view void of judgmental opinions concerning the Noble Truths and the natural processes everywhereThis is another level of right viewThe levels of right view vary according to the Dhamma accomplishments of the one practicingIf there was only a single level of right view then wisdom would be limited tooSince there are many grades of defilements many layers of downheartedness and depression wisdom must have the equivalent levelsIts for this reason that Ive been explaining about the varied aspects of sammaa ditthi or right viewThe second path factor is right thoughtThere are three categories the thought of nonoppression the thought of friendliness free from enmity and illwill and the thought that extricates one from entanglement and bondsThe thought of nonoppression refers to a regard for the welfare of ones fellow creatures both human and animal alikeHowever you will also need to take care of your own wellbeing by not straining or overburdening yourselfOne neither gives thought on how to inflict troubles and hardships on others nor on how one can indulge in selfdestructive habits  like consuming drugs alcohol or opium and heroinThese thoughts that go in the direction of non vindictiveness are really the not thinking in malicious and violent terms whether towards people or animalsOne doesnt wish to hurt anyone or that anyone should be sick or that they might drop deadNor does one think of suicide  killing oneself in the various ways they regularly report in the newspapersThese things happen because they are the fruit of the seed of the original wrong reflectionOne once valued oneself one thought of oneself as ones most precious resourceThen because of wrong thought it all turns sour and one now appears as the enemy ones antagonistThis seems to happen all the time and it does so because of wrong thoughts and reasoningThose who genuinely take care of themselves will immediately act to stop the train of wrong dangerous thoughtAs soon as the heart becomes aware of the beginning of such disquiet it will abandon and let go those thought concoctionsHow could one allow these wrong reflections to get out of hand to the point of committing suicideIts hardly an example of caring for oneselfThe commonplace ideas of finding a way to cast off the bonds of poverty and want in order to find abundance and wealth is also a thought of renunciationSo is the thought of involving oneself in actions of generosity morality and meditationOne might think about contributing to the construction of roads wells or pagodas about maintaining and renovating old and crumbling shrines about building dwellings and halls for monks or other structuresThis impulsion towards good works in order to extricate oneself from the mass of suffering also comes under thought of renunciationAnother kind of renunciation is the contemplating and the seeing of the peril contained in birth decay sickness and deathThis being inherent within every form of sentient existence  without exception  one sees the life of one gone forth as fulfilling ones own aspiration to develop precepts samadhi and wisdomSo one resolves to go forth as nun white robe monk or noviceOne who practices contemplates and investigates his subject of meditation to release the heart from all mental hindrancesHe utilizes all the various methods developed by continuing analysis and reflection to remove defilementsHe steadily eradicates defilements through the various levels right up to the automatic stage of right thoughtWith a constant probing and examining he will ultimately eliminate all defilementsThis is the final category of right thought which completes the explanation of this second path factorThe third path factor was stated as being right speechThis includes general speech and specifically that concerned with DhammaPassing on aphorisms of the wise that are not detrimental to those who listen speaking from sound principles that are impressive and eloquent speaking politely and modestly and expressing gratitude and appreciation to anyone of whatever rank who has shown kindness and supportThese can all be classed as one level of right speechThe primary form of right speech within the sphere of Dhamma are the sallekha dhammas which are fitted to scour out the defilementsThese includeSantutthiikathaa  talk of contentment with whatever requisites become available and are properly offered according to DhammaAsamsaggakathaa  talk favorable to not mingling together or socializingPavivekathaa  talk favorable to seclusion and detachment of body and heartViriyaarambhakathaa  talk favorable to strenuous exertionSiilakathaa  talk favorable to upholding the purity of moral precepts and to the development of samadhi and wisdomVimuttikathaa  talk favorable to deliverance and to the clear penetrative realization of deliveranceThese are the subtler aspects of right speechTheres no vain talk or gossip here but only serious speech dedicated to exertion and the utilization of these purifying dhammasThe fourth path factor was stated as being right action or right undertakingThere are those right actions that deal with commonplace work and those concerned with the task of DhammaOccupations that are not against the law like farming or trading for example fall within the bounds of right undertakingLikewise with the building of temples and monasteries or the practice of generosity morality and the development of the meditation on loving kindnessThese form another kind of right actionWalking meditation and sitting in samadhi are also there as right actionEvery movement of the body speech and heart is kamma which is actionThe body acts speech verbalizes and the mind deliberates and its all action or kammaActions done by body speech and heart are called kammaThose correct and proper bodily actions speech and thoughts are called right actionsRight action covers a wide and extensive range and its up to each individual to work it out and apply it for himselfThis is because the world and Dhamma have always been paired together like the left and right hands of the same personThe world and Dhamma cant be separated  the world has its work as has DhammaSince the situation and makeup of each person vary their undertakings cannot all be identicalIts because of this that lay people and those who have gone forth following the way of Dhamma have to undertake work that is appropriate to their positionDont allow opinions to interfere and conflict with anyones undertaking each person will then be able to undertake his or her right actionEach day will then see the world and Dhamma steadily flourishing together because of everyones mutual contribution and supportThe fifth path factor was stated as being right livelihoodOne aspect of this is the eating and consuming that is an everyday form of making a living whether by humans or animalsCatering to feed the heart with emotional objects born of contact is another kind of livelihoodThe step by step nourishing of the heart with the various levels of Dhamma is anotherMaking ones living in a scrupulous manner that accords with Dhamma without violating the law by actions like robbery and theft is one form of right livelihoodOne lives within ones means from day to dayBut if things accrue in abundance and through honest means then that can also be reckoned as right livelihoodContact will arise with external objects such as the form the sound smell taste or touch of man or womenIf it suits ones disposition and provides nutriment for the heart with mental and emotional objects that delight and relieve the hearts sadness then it serves as an elixir of lifeHowever by pursuing them in the wrong way it becomes poison and devours the heartThis type of right livelihood is appropriate for the person in the world who knows the right measure of things and their suitability and limitsSustaining the heart with Dhamma is done by declining to admit entrance to the worlds poison to disturb the heart through contact between the sense organs and external objectsEvery contact made with forms sounds smells tastes tactile and mental objects should always be contemplated in the light of DhammaNeither a warm welcome nor a hostile rejection should be allowed for that would bring hardship for the heartA Dhammaimbued investigation will provide and sustain the heart with the essence of Dhamma and it will be gladdened and delighted through both the hearts serenity and its wisdom and discernmentThere will then be no seeking after poisonous objects that are ruinous for the heart rather it will be constantly nourished with DhammaIn the light of Dhamma always try to push the investigation of every contact made between the sense organs and the sense objects towards true understanding and emancipationNever contemplate in a worldlyminded way for that will be the taking in of fire to burn oneself with and it can only cause the heart to overheatConstantly screen and feed the heart only with objects of Dhamma and this Dhamma essence will nourish the heart steadily sustaining and protecting itWhat Ive been talking about here is one more kind of right livelihoodThe sixth path factor was stated as being right exertionThere are four ways of exertionThe effort involved in preventing the accumulation of unwholesomeness within ones character and make up in getting rid of anything unwholesome that has arisen in developing and bringing up wholesomeness and the effort in maintaining that wholesomeness that has already arisenThese must be drawn inwards by applying them to the level of Dhamma that you are actually practicing in where they will be ready to add to whatever basis of samadhi and wisdom is necessaryFirst Devote yourself to caring for the heart that is so liable to become obsessed and infatuated with the flow of cravingThis is based in ignorance and will drag the heart awaySecond Try to develop precepts samadhi and wisdom for these are the dhammas capable of rectifying every type of defilementIf you aspire for Nibbana totally extinguish your burning anxietyThird Dont allow your standard of precepts samadhi and wisdom to fall back and slip away through negligenceYou will need to develop and nourish them to full maturity and to their transmutation into the supramundane knowledge of the Path which erases all defilements including those lying latentThe sphere of Freedom and Nibbana previously perceived as beyond ones capacity will arise within the heart the instant all the defilements are cleared outThe seventh path factor was stated as being right mindfulnessThis is setting up mindfulness to attend to your exertionWhatever you fix on as the hearts meditation object  Buddho or mindfulness of breathing for instance  should be the place where mindfulness is establishedIf you settle on the Four Foundations of Mindfulness  whether as a basis for samadhi or in the development of wisdom  you must constantly have awareness minding and attending to every round of practiceThis is one section of right mindfulnessThe eighth path factor was stated as being right samadhi which is the heart rightly and firmly established in calmThis refers to the samadhi that is imbued with wisdom and not that stumplike samadhiAlso it isnt the addictive sort of samadhi that sticks both day and night and is loath to investigate by way of wisdomThat sort of samadhi may seem in itself to be an adequately exalted dhamma but wisdom will end up being dismissed as phoneySamadhi in this case is called incorrect or wrong samadhi and cant truly deliver one from sufferingTo practice the samadhi that will free one from suffering attention has to be focused on ones selected Dhamma principle or theme with mindfulness guarding and directing until the heart convergesIt doesnt matter too much which class of samadhi this may be  its the right or correct samadhi as long as you feel that the heart has calmed downIt has ceased from concocting amongst the various thought processes and abides for a time singular and distinct from all surrounding conditions before withdrawing from that stateThis is not the same as that type of samadhi where once the heart has converged one loses track of day and night not knowing if one is alive  and its as if one is deadIt is only after the heart has emerged that one starts to wonder about what had happened Was it that the heart convergedWherever did my mind goThis is stumplike samadhi because it resembles a stump without any consciousnessTry to avoid and quit this type of samadhi and if youve already fallen for it then you must immediately extricate yourselfThis stumplike samadhi is certainly found among those of us who practiceThe remedy is to hold back and break the habitual way the heart tends to convergeIf one indulges it then it will always stick with that propensity so you will have to compel it to break away and take a tour of the bodyMindfulness needs to be firmly in control traveling up and around and down and around over and over again until wisdom Path and Fruit are realizedThe kind of samadhi that is right samadhi is that which has mindfulness attending to the state of calm when the heart has converged into samadhiAfter the heart has emerged again the various natural conditions found within the body and mind should be investigated with wisdomTherefore with the right occasion and appropriate conditions start up the investigationSamadhi and wisdom are dhammas that should always interrelate and collaborateDont allow your samadhi development to drift without giving it the necessary attentionSo to summarize one can say that these three dhammas  mindfulness samadhi and wisdom  are interrelated and inseparableThey cant move forward alone for samadhi and wisdom have to take their turns in taking a step with mindfulness minding and watching over themIve discussed these eight path factors partly according to the principles of Dhamma and partly from practical experiencePlease note that right view through to right samadhi are formed from dhammas of many different levelsIts up to each of you listening here to take them up and apply them in your own practiceHow far you can go depends on your Dhamma understanding and abilityRegardless of whether youre a lay person or have gone forth with commitment youll be able to practice for the full development of these eight path factorsThe fruits of Freedom and knowledge and insight of Freedom will then become your most valuable possessionThis is because precepts samadhi and wisdom are integral to this Path and they function as the key that clearly reveals these two Freedoms to the heartMoreover all of you who practice shouldnt misunderstand and think that Freedom and knowledge of Freedom are separate from each other or that they perform two different functionsTruly thats not soWhen a man uses an axe to chop up wood as soon as the wood is cut through he both sees it with his eyes and at the same instant realizes it in his heartIn the same way Freedom and knowledge of Freedom simultaneously allow the seeing and the knowing that the defilements have been excised from the heart through using precepts samadhi and wisdomThereafter there can be no more fussing with problems because all bothersome concerns derive from the conflict between the heart and the defilementsThis is the truly great issue of the three realms of existenceBy letting go of the heart which is the cardinal problem the defilements that are lodged there will spontaneously detach themselvesFurthermore sila samadhi and wisdom Freedom and knowledge of Freedom all remain as they really areEach side comes to truth and consequently all the contentious issues come to an endToday I have presented a talk on Dhamma to all of you who practice by highlighting the example of the Lord Buddha and the Noble DisciplesMay it serve you as a guide pointing out the Way so that you can set your compass  your programme of practice  and relentlessly strive to follow the Lord BuddhaOnce you have fully developed sila samadhi and wisdom then Freedom and knowledge of Freedom which is the essence of Nibbana will undoubtedly be yoursTherefore may all of you listening here realize that all these matters are found right here in your body and heartPlease draw Dhamma inwards as your ownThen both the cultivation of the means and the fruits of Freedom and Nibbana which I have elucidated will all belong to you either today or sometime in the futureMay this talk on Dhamma now reach its conclusionMrsPowpanga Vathanakul died on September thShe had asked her husband MrVai Vathanakul to keep her funeral rites simple and to cremate the body within a few daysBut when the time came her own family insisted on the customary Thai funeralKhun Vai for his part put together a book to give to family and friends at the funeralMemorial books are customary on such occasions but Khun Pow had rather preempted this by already distributing when she ill some Dhamma books that she had had printedKhun Vai however produced his book with the idea of it being a case studyFour of the Dhamma talks translated above came from this book and it seems worthwhile here to mention some of the other points that Khun Vai brought togetherIn many ways they are also highly relevant to Buddhists outside Thailand living under modern conditionsRelatives and friends contributed a section about Khun Pows life and careerShe was born in in Bangkok and studied there entering the Accountancy Department of Chulalongkorn UniversityHowever poor health forced her to cut short her course after only two yearsShe went out to work for an insurance company in and was one of the first staff of the newly established firmBusiness conditions were difficult in those early days but Khun Pow worked her way up so that in she was made Secretary to the BoardThe company sent her on study tours abroad to other insurance companies in India and Europe and for six months in the USAThe American insurance managers were highly impressed with her excellent judgment in underwriting problems and considered her  an unusually capable woman and apt scholar In she was made General Manager of the companyNine years later she stepped down from that post  although staying on as Secretary to the Board  so that she would have more time for Dhamma practiceAt that time the company had more than employees with another insurance agentsWhen in she fully retired she had been with the company for almost thirty years having overseen a large part of the companys growthShe now turned more to concentrate on DhammaIn the company she had been renown for her hard work and discipline and had expected the same from her workersShe was also known for her care and helpfulnessThis is perhaps made evident by the gathering of over a thousand former colleagues and coworkers who came to pay their final respects at her funeral ritesAnother section concerns Khun Pows Dhamma practiceIn Khun Pow started to visit Bangkok monasteries to listen to sermons and join in the meditationWhen for health reasons she retired from being General Manager she had more time for her Dhamma studies and a scholar monk at a major Bangkok monastery was designated by the abbot to teach her the third and then second grade General Dhamma studiesIn a friend gave Khun Pow a Dhamma book about the meditation masters in the North east of ThailandShe was deeply impressed and when one of them the VenAcharn Maha Boowa visited Bangkok she went to pay her respects and asked permission to go and stay at Wat Pa Bahn TahdOn first going to a jungle monastery she found herself too frightened to come out of her room at night but after listening to the Dhamma teaching she became determined to return every few months to practiceShe also decided not to go for her grade one General Dhamma studies but to concentrate on putting those studies into practiceKhun Pow with Khun Vais agreement started to keep the Eight Precepts on the Observance DaysWhen business pressures  guests from abroad for instance  made this difficult she would simply keep them on another dayTo help make such days more suitable for meditation practice at home one upstairs room was set aside and dubbed EkasatarnAny disturbing telephone calls could then be deflected with the news that Khun Pow had gone to EkasatarnKhun Pows friends would then assume that she had gone to the monastery and there would be no need to lie about Khun Pow not being at homeIn Khun Pow thought back upon the help given to her by her teacher in Dhamma studies the scholar monk in the central Bangkok monastery and offered to sponsor his further studies at the Banares University in IndiaBy Khun Pow was spending much more time away in the north eastern meditation monasteries and decided that the following year she would spent the whole of the three month Rains Retreat period up thereBack home a small hut had been made in the garden beneath a tree and with a view of the nearby pondThat was where she retired to for she was now regularly keeping the Eight PreceptsShe and Khun Vai decided that it was also time for her to fully retire from the company which she did in and she was then ready to go on the three months retreat that yearKhun Pow had always been bedeviled with health problems that resulted in many stays in hospitalThese included operations on the womb the gall bladder and the breastThis last treatment concluded with radiation therapy that seemed to clear things up inHowever that July when she was already settled in the monastery for the Rains Retreat she met a fellow devotee who was also a doctorThe doctor noticed that Khun Pows eyes were yellow and so advised her quickly to go to Bangkok for treatmentEventually after many tests and a final bone biopsy it was confirmed that this time the cancer had penetrated to the bone marrow and that no further treatment was possibleWhen Khun Pow knew that the cancer was terminal she asked permission to go and practice Dhamma at Wat Pa Bahn TahdShe arrived there in October and VenAcharn Maha Boowa gave her a Dhamma talk virtually every evening for over daysOther devotees were also staying there with her one being a lady doctor and when her condition made it necessary to be nearer the hospital she returned to BangkokWhen Khun Pow was home again she and Khun Vai decided that they would be fellow Dhamma farers rather than husband and wifeShe asked him to help remind her about Dhamma to awaken her mindfulness in the coming daysKhun Vai therefore prepared some appropriate Dhamma verses and set himself the task of giving as much spiritual support as he couldHe was able to sit with her and prayed and meditatedWhen Khun Pow could not read anymore he would read aloud and tape some of the important Dhamma teachings for her to listen and meditate onKhun Pow went into a semicoma but when she became more conscious Khun Vai was there to repeat some words of DhammaHe then thought a better way would be to use the original voices by using a tape machineSo he arranged tapes of the morning and evening chanting and a tape of the final Dhamma talk  the farewell night  that Khun Pow had listened to at Wat Pa Bahn TahdThere were also tapes of Dhamma chants and verses that Khun Pow particularly liked such as The First Sermon of the Lord Buddha the Turning of the Dhamma Wheel with its explanation about the Four Noble TruthsAnd the Discourse on the Highest BlessingBy the time that Khun Vai had arranged the tapes Khun Pows condition was obviously deterioratingThe oxygen tubes that she had resolutely refused and pushed away wanting to be left unencumbered in her final moments had now been reinserted by the nursesThis showed for certain that she had to be unconsciousKhun Vai started a cycle of tapes and within a few moments Khun Pows hands were lifted together in anyjali the traditional gesture of respect and venerationThe hands fell back and were then raised again palms together over the heartKhun Vai was delighted with this sign that the Dhamma was penetrating even though Khun Pow was in a comaHe therefore arranged for the tapes to be continually interchanged using two machinesThe Turning of the Dhamma Wheel sounded with words about the heart of one who practices how knowledge and light arise and how by going beyond all attachment there is the Undying DhammaKhun Pow appeared calm but her breathing became irregularKhun Vai sat close by and quietly meditated and as her breathing faltered he asked everyone in the room to stay still and not to cry and for nobody else to come inAs they meditated the sound of the breathing gradually diminishedAnd was stillKhun Vai collected all the above to be a case study about an ordinary person taking up the practice of DhammaKhun Vai himself is something of a case study tooHe was Khun Pows business colleague throughout successfully overcame a major cancer operation and more to the point is a devout ChristianIts said that Khun Vai would accompany Khun Pow to the Buddhist monastery and everyone who didnt know would think he was a Buddhist tooIt was much the same when Khun Pow went with Khun Vai to churchReligion for him is not just Christianity for he sees much value in Dhamma and fully supported his wife in her practiceWith his wifes death he was keenly aware that both faiths are concerned with suffering  death and separation from the person one loves  and how to deal with that truthKhun Vai has been a leading member of the YMCA  hes now President Emeritus of the YMCA in Bangkok  and has addressed various international meetings often concerning his understanding of religionHe has spoken about how he sees a similarity between Christianity and BuddhismOn the basic level he compares the Buddhist generosity and moral precepts with the Christian Commandments and loveOr Love in action for all faiths and beliefs Then he says Whereas for spiritual higher attainment we have to leave to each person depending on his or her belief to pursueIt is now fifteen years since Khun Pows death yet the Dhamma Teachings she received and practiced are still available to those who want to develop their own case studyThe language used in these talks is that of Forest DhammaThis means that apart from some Paali quotations  usually taken from the chants that many of the listeners would be familiar with and most of the monks would have learned by heart  it is usually ordinary ThaiMany Thai words are rooted in Paali and this can be seen in their spellingHowever both the present pronunciation and the meaning of the word have often been transformedForest Dhamma therefore should not be treated as if it was classical Paali and scholars should beware of trying to track definitions through the textIts important to remember that this is an oral teaching which afterwards was warmed up between pagesAs this book is mainly concerned with meditation here are some Sutta passages with descriptions of generosity and moral preceptsDaana GenerosityIn contrast to the modern emphasis on consuming and possessing the Lord Buddha spoke of the virtue of giving and being content with whatever one hasThere are always circumstances where one can giveFor instance one can offer ones time help and sympathyAnd one can forgiveIf one has wealth he explained the use of possessions the benefits which one should get from wealth reasons for earning and having wealthii to share this happiness and comfort with ones friendsiii to make oneself secure against all misfortunesiv to make the fivefold offeringto guests by receiving themto the departed by dedicating merit to themto the king by paying taxes and duties and so onto the deities ie those beings who are worshipped according to ones faithv to support those monks and spiritual teachers who lead a pure and diligent lifeSappurisa Daana Gifts of a good manii to give choice thingsiii to give at fitting timesiv to give suitable thingsv to give with discretionvi to give repeatedly or regularlyvii to calm ones mind on givingviii to be glad after givingSiila PreceptsThe basic guidelines for the actions and speech of any Buddhist can be appreciated by anyone of any religion or noneThere is no dogma involved it is a plain and simple way of living without harming or hurting any creatureThe other feature to bear in mind is that it is accepted voluntarily by the individualThis is not something that one is commanded to receiveIt is the individuals volition that changes a list of precepts into a way of livingWith that change the appreciation and mindfulness of ones actions and speech become more subtle and which automatically leads on to meditationThere are the basic Five Precepts and these become more refined with the Eight PreceptsEveryone who listened to the original Dhamma talks would be keeping the Eight PreceptsThese Precepts can be received by simply sayingI undertake the training rulepreceptii to abstain from taking what is not giveniii to abstain from sexual misconductiv to abstain from false speechv to abstain from intoxicants causing heedlessnessvi to abstain from untimely eatingvii to abstain from dancing singing music and unseemly shows from wearing garlands smartening with scents and embellishment with unguentsviii to abstain from the use of high and large luxurious couchesThus have I heardOn one occasion the Exalted One was dwelling at Anathapindikas monastery in Jetas Grove near SavatthiNow when the night was far spent a certain deity whose surpassing splendor illuminated the entire Jeta Grove came to the presence of the Exalted One and drawing near respectfully saluted him and stood at one sideStanding thus he addressed the Exalted One in verseMany deities and men yearning after good have pondered on blessingsPray tell me the greatest blessingNot to associate with the foolish but to associate with the wise and to honor those who are

afflicted by a famine causing death especially to the poor folkDue to the presence of decaying corpses the evil spirits began to haunt the city this was followed by a pestilencePlagued by these three fears of famine nonhuman beings and pestilence the citizens sought the help of the Buddha who was then living at RajagahaFollowed by a large number of monks including the Venerable Ananda his attendant disciple the Buddha came to the city of VesaliWith the arrival of the Master there were torrential rains which swept away the putrefying corpsesThe atmosphere became purified the city was cleanThereupon the Buddha delivered this Jewel Discourse to the Venerable Ananda and gave him instructions as to how he should tour the city with the Licchavi citizens reciting the discourse as a mark of protection to the people of VesaliThe Venerable Ananda followed the instructions and sprinkled the sanctified water from the Buddhas own alms bowlAs a consequence the evil spirits were exorcised the pestilence subsidedThereafter the Venerable Ananda returned with the citizens of Vesali to the Public hall where the Buddha and his disciples had assembled awaiting his arrivalThere the Buddha recited the same Jewel Discourse to the gatheringWhatever beings are assembled here terrestrial or celestial may they all have peace of mind and may they listen attentively to these wordsO beings

the Buddha was staying at Savatthi a band of monks having received subjects of meditation from the master proceeded to a forest to spend the rainy seasonThe tree deities inhabiting this forest were worried by their arrival as they had to descend from tree abodes and dwell on the groundThey hoped however the monks would leave soon but finding that the monks would stay the vassana period of three months harassed them in diverse ways during the night with the intention of scaring them awayLiving under such conditions being impossible the monks went to the Master and informed him of their difficultiesThereon the Buddha instructed them in the Metta sutta and advised their return equipped with this sutta for their protectionThe monks went back to the forest and practicing the instruction conveyed permeated the whole atmosphere with their radiant thoughts of metta or lovingkindnessThe deities so affected by this power of love henceforth allowed them to meditate in peaceThe discourse gets divided into two partsThe first detailing the standard of moral conduct required by one who wishes to attain Purity and Peace and the second the method of practice of mettaHe who is skilled in well being and who wishes to attain that state of Calm should act thus he should be dexterous upright exceedingly upright obedient gentle and humbleContented easily supportable with but few responsibilities of simple livelihood controlled in the senses prudent courteous and not hanker after association with familiesLet him not perform the slightest wrong for which wise men may rebuke himMay all beings be happy and safeMay they have happy mindsWhatever living beings there may be  feeble or strong long stout or of medium size short small large those seen or those unseen those dwelling far or near those who are born as well as those yet to be born  may all beings have happy mindsLet him not deceive another nor despise anyone anywhereIn anger or ill will let him not wish another illJust as a mother would protect her only child with her life even so let one cultivate a boundless love towards all beingsLet him radiate boundless love towards the entire world  above below and across  unhindered without ill will without enmityStanding walking sitting or reclining as long as he is awake let him develop this mindfulnessThis they say is Noble Living hereNot falling into wrong views  being virtuous endowed with insight lust in the senses discarded  verily never again will he return to conceive in a wombThe Dhammapada is the best known and most widely esteemed text in the Pali Tipitaka the sacred scriptures of Theravada BuddhismThe work is included in the Khuddaka Nikaya of the Sutta Pitaka but its popularity has raised it far above the single niche it occupies in the scriptures to the ranks of a world religious classicComposed in the ancient Pali language this slim anthology of verses constitutes a perfect compendium of the Buddhas teaching comprising between its covers all the essential principles elaborated at length in the fortyodd volumes of the Pali canonAccording to the Theravada Buddhist tradition each verse in the Dhammapada was originally spoken by the Buddha in response to a particular episodeAccounts of these along with exegesis of the verses are preserved in the classic commentary to the work compiled by the great scholiast Bhadantacariya Buddhaghosa in the fifth century CEon the basis or material going back to very ancient timesThe contents of the verses however transcend the limited and particular circumstances of their origin reaching out through the ages to various types of people in all the diverse situations of lifeFor the simple and unsophisticated the Dhammapada is a sympathetic counselor for the intellectually overburdened its clear and direct teachings inspire humility and reflection for the earnest seeker it is a perennial source of inspiration and practical instructionInsights that flashed into the heart of the Buddha have crystallized into these luminous verses of pure wisdomAs profound expressions of practical spirituality each verse is a guideline to right livingThe Buddha unambiguously pointed out that whoever earnestly practices the teachings found in the Dhammapada will taste the bliss of emancipationDue to its immense importance the Dhammapada has been translated into numerous languagesIn English alone several translations are available including editions by such noted scholars as Max Muller and DrSRadhakrishnanHowever when presented from a nonBuddhist frame of reference the teachings of the Buddha inevitably suffer some distortionThis in fact has already happened with our anthology an unfortunate selection of renderings has sometimes suggested erroneous interpretations while footnotes have tended to be judgmentalThe present translation was originally written in the late sSome years earlier while consulting a number of Englishlanguage editions of the Dhammapada it was observed that the renderings were either too free and inaccurate or too pedantic and it was therefore felt that a new translation avoiding these two extremes would serve a valuable purposeThe finished result of that project presented here is a humble attempt by a practicing follower of the Buddha to transmit the spirit and content as well as the language and style of the original teachingsIn preparing this volume I have had access to numerous editions and translations of the Dhammapada into various languages including Sanskrit Hindi Bengali Sinhala Burmese and NepaliI particularly benefited from the excellent translations of the work by the late Venerable Narada Mahathera of Vajirarama Colombo Sri Lanka and Professor Bhagwat of Poona India To them I acknowledge my debtA few verses contain riddles references or analogies that may not be evident to the readerThe meanings of these are provided either in parentheses or notes and for their interpretation I have relied on the explanations given in Bhadantacariya Buddhaghosas commentaryVerses discussed in the notes are indicated in the text by an asterisk at the end of the verseA first edition of this translation was published in and a second in both by the Maha Bodhi Society in Bangalore IndiaFor this third edition the translation has undergone considerable revisionThe newly added subtitle The Buddhas Path of Wisdom is not literal but is fully applicable on the ground that the verses of the Dhammapada all originate from the Buddhas wisdom and lead the one who follows them to a life guided by that same wisdomI am grateful to the editors of the Buddhist Publication Society for their helpful suggestions and to the Society itself for so generously undertaking the publication of this workI make this offering of Dhamma in grateful memory of my teachers parents and relatives departed and livingMay they find access in the Buddhas Dispensation and attain NibbanaMay all beings be happy Acharya BuddharakkhitaFrom ancient times to the present the Dhammapada has been regarded as the most succinct expression of the Buddhas teaching found in the Pali canon and the chief spiritual testament of early BuddhismIn the countries following Theravada Buddhism such as Sri Lanka Burma and Thailand the influence of the Dhammapada is ubiquitousIt is an everfecund source of themes for sermons and discussions a guidebook for resolving the countless problems of everyday life a primer for the instruction of novices in the monasteriesEven the experienced contemplative withdrawn to forest hermitage or mountainside cave for a life of meditation can be expected to count a copy of the book among his few material possessionsYet the admiration the Dhammapada has elicited has not been confined to avowed followers of BuddhismWherever it has become known its moral earnestness realistic understanding of human life aphoristic wisdom and stirring message of a way to freedom from suffering have won for it the devotion and veneration of those responsive to the good and the trueThe expounder of the verses that comprise the Dhammapada is the Indian sage called the Buddha an honorific title meaning the Enlightened One or the Awakened One The story of this venerable personage has often been overlaid with literary embellishment and the admixture of legend but the historical essentials of his life are simple and clearHe was born in the sixth century BC the son of a king ruling over a small state in the Himalayan foothills in what is now NepalHis given name was Siddhattha and his family name GotamaRaised in luxury groomed by his father to be the heir to the throne in his early manhood he went through a deeply disturbing encounter with the sufferings of life as a result of which he lost all interest in the pleasures and privileges of rulershipOne night in his twentyninth year he fled the royal city and entered the forest to live as an ascetic resolved to find a way to deliverance from sufferingFor six years he experimented with different systems of meditation and subjected himself to severe austerities but found that these practices did not bring him any closer to his goalFinally in his thirtyfifth year while sitting in deep meditation beneath a tree at Gaya he attained Supreme Enlightenment and became in the proper sense of the title the Buddha the Enlightened OneThereafter for fortyfive years he traveled throughout northern India proclaiming the truths he had discovered and founding an order of monks and nuns to carry on his messageAt the age of eighty after a long and fruitful life he passed away peacefully in the small town of Kusinara surrounded by a large number of disciplesTo his followers the Buddha is neither a god a divine incarnation or a prophet bearing a message of divine revelation but a human being who by his own striving and intelligence has reached the highest spiritual attainment of which man is capable  perfect wisdom full enlightenment complete purification of mindHis function in relation to humanity is that of a teacher  a world teacher who out of compassion points out to others the way to Nibbana final release from sufferingHis teaching known as the Dhamma offers a body of instructions explaining the true nature of existence and showing the path that leads to liberationFree from all dogmas and inscrutable claims to authority the Dhamma is founded solidly upon the bedrock of the Buddhas own clear comprehension of reality and it leads the one who practices it to that same understanding  the knowledge which extricates the roots of sufferingThe title Dhammapada which the ancient compilers of the Buddhist scriptures attached to our anthology means portions aspects or sections of DhammaThe work has been given this title because in its twentysix chapters it spans the multiple aspects of the Buddhas teaching offering a variety of standpoints from which to gain a glimpse into its heartWhereas the longer discourses of the Buddha contained in the prose sections of the Canon usually proceed methodically unfolding according to the sequential structure of the doctrine the Dhammapada lacks such a systematic arrangementThe work is simply a collection of inspirational or pedagogical verses on the fundamentals of the Dhamma to be used as a basis for personal edification and instructionIn any given chapter several successive verses may have been spoken by the Buddha on a single occasion and thus among themselves will exhibit a meaningful development or a set of variations on a themeBut by and large the logic behind the grouping together of verses into a chapter is merely the concern with a common topicThe twentysix chapter headings thus function as a kind of rubric for classifying the diverse poetic utterances of the Master and the reason behind the inclusion of any given verse in a particular chapter is its mention of the subject indicated in the chapters headingIn some cases this may be a metaphorical symbol rather than a point of doctrineThere also seems to be no intentional design in the order of the chapters themselves though at certain points a loose thread of development can be discernedThe teachings of the Buddha viewed in their completeness all link together into a single perfectly coherent system of thought and practice which gains its unity from its final goal the attainment of deliverance from sufferingBut the teachings inevitably emerge from the human condition as their matrix and starting point and thus must be expressed in such a way as to reach human beings standing at different levels of spiritual development with their highly diverse problems ends and concerns and with their very different capacities for understandingThence just as water though one in essence assumes different shapes due to the vessels into which it is poured so the Dhamma of liberation takes on different forms in response to the needs of the beings to be taughtThis diversity evident enough already in the prose discourses becomes even more conspicuous in the highly condensed spontaneous and intuitively charged medium of verse used in the DhammapadaThe intensified power of delivery can result in apparent inconsistencies which may perplex the unwaryFor example in many verses the Buddha commends certain practices on the grounds that they lead to a heavenly birth but in others he discourages disciples from aspiring for heaven and extols the one who takes no delight in celestial pleasures Often he enjoins works of merit yet elsewhere he praises the one who has gone beyond both merit and demeritWithout a grasp of the underlying structure of the Dhamma such statements viewed side by side will appear incompatible and may even elicit the judgment that the teaching is selfcontradictoryThe key to resolving these apparent discrepancies is the recognition that the Dhamma assumes its formulation from the needs of the diverse persons to whom it is addressed as well as from the diversity of needs that may coexist even in a single individualTo make sense of the various utterances found in the Dhammapada we will suggest a schematism of four levels to be used for ascertaining the intention behind any particular verse found in the work and thus for understanding its proper place in the total systematic vision of the DhammaThis fourfold schematism develops out of an ancient interpretive maxim which holds that the Buddhas teaching is designed to meet three primary aims human welfare here and now a favorable rebirth in the next life and the attainment of the ultimate goodThe four levels are arrived at by distinguishing the last aim into two stages path and fruitThe first level is the concern with establishing wellbeing and happiness in the immediately visible sphere of concrete human relationsThe aim at this level is to show man the way to live at peace with himself and his fellow men to fulfill his family and social responsibilities and to restrain the bitterness conflict and violence which infect human relationships and bring such immense suffering to the individual society and the world as a wholeThe guidelines appropriate to this level are largely identical with the basic ethical injunctions proposed by most of the great world religions but in the Buddhist teaching they are freed from theistic moorings and grounded upon two directly verifiable foundations concern for ones own integrity and longrange happiness and concern for the welfare of those whom ones actions may affectThe most general counsel the Dhammapada gives is to avoid all evil to cultivate good and to cleanse ones mindBut to dispel any doubts the disciple might entertain as to what he should avoid and what he should cultivate other verses provide more specific directivesOne should avoid irritability in deed word and thought and exercise selfcontrolOne should adhere to the five precepts the fundamental moral code of Buddhism which teach abstinence from destroying life from stealing from committing adultery from speaking lies and from taking intoxicants one who violates these five training rules digs up his own root even in this very worldThe disciple should treat all beings with kindness and compassion live honestly and righteously control his sensual desires speak the truth and live a sober upright life diligently fulfilling his duties such as service to parents to his immediate family and to those recluses and brahmans who depend on the laity for their maintenanceA large number of verses pertaining to this first level are concerned with the resolution of conflict and hostilityQuarrels are to be avoided by patience and forgiveness for responding to hatred by further hatred only maintains the cycle of vengeance and retaliationThe true conquest of hatred is achieved by nonhatred by forbearance by loveOne should not respond to bitter speech but maintain silenceOne should not yield to anger but control it as a driver controls a chariotInstead of keeping watch for the faults of others the disciple is admonished to examine his own faults and to make a continual effort to remove his impurities just as a silversmith purifies silverEven if he has committed evil in the past there is no need for dejection or despair for a mans ways can be radically changed and one who abandons the evil for the good illuminates this world like the moon freed from cloudsThe sterling qualities distinguishing the man of virtue are generosity truthfulness patience and compassionBy developing and mastering these qualities within himself a man lives at harmony with his own conscience and at peace with his fellow beingsThe scent of virtue the Buddha declares is sweeter than the scent of all flowers and perfumesThe good man like the Himalaya mountains shines from afar and wherever he goes he is loved and respectedIn its second level of teaching the Dhammapada shows that morality does not exhaust its significance in its contribution to human felicity here and now but exercises a far more critical influence in molding personal destinyThis level begins with the recognition that to reflective thought the human situation demands a more satisfactory context for ethics than mere appeals to altruism can provideOn the one hand our innate sense of moral justice requires that goodness be recompensed with happiness and evil with suffering on the other our typical experience shows us virtuous people beset with hardships and afflictions and thoroughly bad people riding the waves of fortuneMoral intuition tells us that if there is any longrange value to righteousness the imbalance must somehow be redressedThe visible order does not yield an evident solution but the Buddhas teaching reveals the factor needed to vindicate our cry for moral justice in an impersonal universal law which reigns over all sentient existenceThis is the law of kamma of action and its fruit which ensures that morally determinate action does not disappear into nothingness but eventually meets its due retribution the good with happiness the bad with sufferingIn the popular understanding kamma is sometimes identified with fate but this is a total misconception utterly inapplicable to the Buddhist doctrineKamma means volitional action action springing from intention which may manifest itself outwardly as bodily deeds or speech or remain internally as unexpressed thoughts desires and emotionsThe Buddha distinguishes kamma into two primary ethical types unwholesome kamma action rooted in mental states of greed hatred and delusion and wholesome kamma action rooted in mental states of generosity or detachment goodwill and understandingThe willed actions a person performs in the course of his life may fade from memory without a trace but once performed they leave subtle imprints on the mind seeds with the potential to come to fruition in the future when they meet conditions conducive to their ripeningThe objective field in which the seeds of kamma ripen is the process of rebirths called samsaraIn the Buddhas teaching life is not viewed as an isolated occurrence beginning spontaneously with birth and ending in utter annihilation at deathEach single life span is seen rather as part of an individualized series of lives having no discoverable beginning in time and continuing on as long as the desire for existence stands intactRebirth can take place in various realmsThere are not only the familiar realms of human beings and animals but ranged above we meet heavenly worlds of greater happiness beauty and power and ranged below infernal worlds of extreme sufferingThe cause for rebirth into these various realms the Buddha locates in kamma our own willed actionsIn its primary role kamma determines the sphere into which rebirth takes place wholesome actions bringing rebirth in higher forms unwholesome actions rebirth in lower formsAfter yielding rebirth kamma continues to operate governing the endowments and circumstances of the individual within his given form of existenceThus within the human world previous stores of wholesome kamma will issue in long life health wealth beauty and success stores of unwholesome kamma in short life illness poverty ugliness and failurePrescriptively the second level of teaching found in the Dhammapada is the practical corollary to this recognition of the law of kamma put forth to show human beings who naturally desire happiness and freedom from sorrow the effective means to achieve their objectivesThe content of this teaching itself does not differ from that presented at the first level it is the same set of ethical injunctions for abstaining from evil and for cultivating the goodThe difference lies in the perspective from which the injunctions are issued and the aim for the sake of which they are to be taken upThe principles of morality are shown now in their broader cosmic connections as tied to an invisible but allembracing law which binds together all life and holds sway over the repeated rotations of the cycle of birth and deathThe observance of morality is justified despite its difficulties and apparent failures by the fact that it is in harmony with that law that through the efficacy of kamma our willed actions become the chief determinant of our destiny both in this life and in future states of becomingTo follow the ethical law leads upwards  to inner development to higher rebirths and to richer experiences of happiness and joyTo violate the law to act in the grip of selfishness and hate leads downwards  to inner deterioration to suffering and to rebirth in the worlds of miseryThis theme is announced already by the pair of verses which opens the Dhammapada and reappears in diverse formulations throughout the workThe ethical counsel based on the desire for higher rebirths and happiness in future lives is not the final teaching of the Buddha and thus cannot provide the decisive program of personal training commended by the DhammapadaIn its own sphere of application it is perfectly valid as a preparatory or provisional teaching for those whose spiritual faculties are not yet ripe but still require further maturation over a succession of livesA deeper more searching examination however reveals that all states of existence in samsara even the loftiest celestial abodes are lacking in genuine worth for they are all inherently impermanent without any lasting substance and thus for those who cling to them potential bases for sufferingThe disciple of mature faculties sufficiently prepared by previous experience for the Buddhas distinctive exposition of the Dhamma does not long even for rebirth among the godsHaving understood the intrinsic inadequacy of all conditioned things his focal aspiration is only for deliverance from the everrepeating round of birthsThis is the ultimate goal to which the Buddha points as the immediate aim for those of developed faculties and also as the longterm ideal for those in need of further development Nibbana the Deathless the unconditioned state where there is no more birth aging and death and no more sufferingThe third level of teaching found in the Dhammapada sets forth the theoretical framework and practical discipline emerging out of the aspiration for final deliveranceThe theoretical framework is provided by the teaching of the Four Noble Truths which the Buddha had proclaimed already in his first sermon and upon which he placed so much stress in his many discourses that all schools of Buddhism have appropriated them as their common foundationThe four truths all center around the fact of suffering understood not as mere experienced pain and sorrow but as the pervasive unsatisfactoriness of everything conditionedThe first truth details the various forms of suffering  birth old age sickness and death the misery of unpleasant encounters and painful separations the suffering of not obtaining what one wantsIt culminates in the declaration that all constituent phenomena of body and mind the aggregates of existence being impermanent and substanceless are intrinsically unsatisfactoryThe second truth points out that the cause of suffering is craving the desire for pleasure and existence which drives us through the round of rebirths bringing in its trail sorrow anxiety and despairThe third truth declares that the destruction of craving issues in release from suffering and the fourth prescribes the means to gain release the Noble Eightfold Path right understanding right thought right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness and right concentrationIf at this third level the doctrinal emphasis shifts from the principles of kamma and rebirth to the Four Noble Truths a corresponding shift in emphasis takes place in the practical sphere as wellThe stress now no longer falls on the observation of basic morality and the cultivation of wholesome attitudes as a means to higher rebirthsInstead it falls on the integral development of the Noble Eightfold Path as the means to uproot the craving that nurtures the process of rebirth itselfFor practical purposes the eight factors of the path are arranged into three major groups which reveal more clearly the developmental structure of the training moral discipline concentration and wisdomBy the training in morality the coarsest forms of the mental defilements those erupting as unwholesome deeds and words are checked and kept under controlBy the training in concentration the mind is made calm pure and unified purged of the currents of distractive thoughtsBy the training in wisdom the concentrated beam of attention is focused upon the constituent factors of mind and body to investigate and contemplate their salient characteristicsThis wisdom gradually ripened climaxes in the understanding that brings complete purification and deliverance of mindIn principle the practice of the path in all three stages is feasible for people in any walk of lifeThe Buddha taught it to laypeople as well as to monks and many of his lay followers reached high stages of attainmentHowever application to the development of the path becomes most fruitful for those who have relinquished all other concerns in order to devote themselves wholeheartedly to spiritual training to living the holy lifeFor conduct to be completely purified for sustained contemplation and penetrating wisdom to unfold without impediments adoption of a different style of life becomes imperative one which minimizes distractions and stimulants to craving and orders all activities around the aim of liberationThus the Buddha established the Sangha the order of monks and nuns as the special field for those ready to dedicate their lives to the practice of his path and in the Dhammapada the call to the monastic life resounds throughoutThe entryway to the monastic life is an act of radical renunciationThe thoughtful who have seen the transience and hidden misery of worldly life break the ties of family and social bonds abandon their homes and mundane pleasures and enter upon the state of homelessnessWithdrawn to silent and secluded places they seek out the company of wise instructors and guided by the rules of the monastic training devote their energies to a life of meditationContent with the simplest material requisites moderate in eating restrained in their senses they stir up their energy abide in constant mindfulness and still the restless waves of thoughtsWith the mind made clear and steady they learn to contemplate the arising and falling away of all formations and experience thereby a delight that transcends all human delights a joy and happiness that anticipates the bliss of the DeathlessThe life of meditative contemplation reaches its peak in the development of insight and the Dhammapada enunciates the principles to be discerned by insightwisdom that all conditioned things are impermanent that they are all unsatisfactory that there is no self or truly existent ego entity to be found in anything whatsoeverWhen these truths are penetrated by direct experience the craving ignorance and related mental fetters maintaining bondage break asunder and the disciple rises through successive stages of realization to the full attainment of NibbanaThe fourth level of teaching in the Dhammapada provides no new disclosure of doctrine or practice but an acclamation and exaltation of those who have reached the goalIn the Pali canon the stages of definite attainment along the way to Nibbana are enumerated as fourAt the first called streamentry the disciple gains his first glimpse of the Deathless and enters irreversibly upon the path to liberation bound to reach the goal in seven lives at mostThis achievement alone the Dhammapada declares is greater than lordship over all the worldsFollowing streamentry come two further stages which weaken and eradicate still more defilements and bring the goal increasingly closer to viewOne is called the stage of oncereturner when the disciple will return to the human world at most only one more time the other the stage of nonreturner when he will never come back to human existence but will take rebirth in a celestial plane bound to win final deliverance thereThe fourth and final stage is that of the arahant the Perfected One the fully accomplished sage who has completed the development of the path eradicated all defilements and freed himself from bondage to the cycle of rebirthsThis is the ideal figure of early Buddhism and the supreme hero of the DhammapadaExtolled in Chapter under his own name and in Chapter under the name brahmana holy man the arahant serves as a living demonstration of the truth of the DhammaBearing his last body perfectly at peace he is the inspiring model who shows in his own person that it is possible to free oneself from the stains of greed hatred and delusion to rise above suffering to win Nibbana in this very lifeThe arahant ideal reaches its optimal exemplification in the Buddha the promulgator and master of the entire teachingIt was the Buddha who without any aid or guidance rediscovered the ancient path to deliverance and taught it to countless othersHis arising in the world provides the precious opportunity to hear and practice the excellent DhammaHe is the giver and shower of refuge the Supreme Teacher who depends on nothing but his own selfevolved wisdomBorn a man the Buddha always remains essentially human yet his attainment of Perfect Enlightenment elevates him to a level far surpassing that of common humanityAll our familiar concepts and modes of knowing fail to circumscribe his nature he is trackless of limitless range free from all worldliness the conqueror of all the knower of all untainted by the worldAlways shining in the splendor of his wisdom the Buddha by his very being confirms the Buddhist faith in human perfectibility and consummates the Dhammapadas picture of man perfected the arahantThe four levels of teaching just discussed give us the key for sorting out the Dhammapadas diverse utterances on Buddhist doctrine and for discerning the intention behind its words of practical counselInterlaced with the verses specific to these four main levels there runs throughout the work a large number of verses not tied to any single level but applicable to all alikeTaken together these delineate for us the basic world view of early BuddhismThe most arresting feature of this view is its stress on process rather than persistence as the defining mark of actualityThe universe is in flux a boundless river of incessant becoming sweeping everything along dust motes and mountains gods and men and animals world system after world system without number  all are engulfed by the irrepressible currentThere is no creator of this process no providential deity behind the scenes steering all things to some great and glorious endThe cosmos is beginningless and in its movement from phase to phase it is governed only by the impersonal implacable law of arising change and passing awayHowever the focus of the Dhammapada is not on the outer cosmos but on the human world upon man with his yearning and his suffering his immense complexity his striving and movement towards transcendenceThe starting point is the human condition as given and fundamental to the picture that emerges is the inescapable duality of human life the dichotomies which taunt and challenge man at every turnSeeking happiness afraid of pain loss and death man walks the delicate balance between good and evil purity and defilement progress and declineHis actions are strung out between these moral antipodes and because he cannot evade the necessity to choose he must bear the full responsibility for his decisionsMans moral freedom is a reason for both dread and jubilation for by means of his choices he determines his own individual destiny not only through one life but through the numerous lives to be turned up by the rolling wheel of samsaraIf he chooses wrongly he can sink to the lowest depths of degradation if he chooses rightly he can make himself worthy even of the homage of the godsThe paths to all destinations branch out from the present from the ineluctable immediate occasion of conscious choice and actionThe recognition of duality extends beyond the limits of conditioned existence to include the antithetical poles of the conditioned and the unconditioned samsara and Nibbana the near shore and the far shore The Buddha appears in the world as the Great Liberator who shows man the way to break free from the one and arrive at the other where alone true safety is to be foundBut all he can do is indicate the path the work of treading it lies in the hands of the discipleThe Dhammapada again and again sounds this challenge to human freedom man is the maker and master of himself the protector or destroyer of himself the savior of himselfIn the end he must choose between the way that leads back into the world to the round of becoming and the way that leads out of the world to NibbanaAnd though this last course is extremely difficult and demanding the voice of the Buddha speaks words of assurance confirming that it can be done that it lies within mans power to overcome all barriers and to triumph even over death itselfThe pivotal role in achieving progress in all spheres the Dhammapada declares is played by the mindIn contrast to the Bible which opens with an account of Gods creation of the world the Dhammapada begins with an unequivocal assertion that mind is the forerunner of all that we are the maker of our character the creator of our destinyThe entire discipline of the Buddha from basic morality to the highest levels of meditation hinges upon training the mindA wrongly directed mind brings greater harm than any enemy a rightly directed mind brings greater good than any other relative or friendThe mind is unruly fickle difficult to subdue but by effort mindfulness and unflagging selfdiscipline one can master its vagrant tendencies escape the torrents of the passions and find an island which no flood can overwhelmThe one who conquers himself the victor over his own mind achieves a conquest which can never be undone a victory greater than that of the mightiest warriorsWhat is needed most urgently to train and subdue the mind is a quality called heedfulnessHeedfulness combines critical self awareness and unremitting energy in a process of keeping the mind under constant observation to detect and expel the defiling impulses whenever they seek an opportunity to surfaceIn a world where man has no savior but himself and where the means to his deliverance lies in mental purification heedfulness becomes the crucial factor for ensuring that the aspirant keeps to the straight path of training without deviating due to the seductive allurements of sense pleasures or the stagnating influences of laziness and complacencyHeedfulness the Buddha declares is the path to the Deathless heedlessness the path to deathThe wise who understand this distinction abide in heedfulness and experience Nibbana the incomparable freedom from bondageAs a great religious classic and the chief spiritual testament of early Buddhism the Dhammapada cannot be gauged in its true value by a single reading even if that reading is done carefully and reverentiallyIt yields its riches only through repeated study sustained reflection and most importantly through the application of its principles to daily lifeThence it might be suggested to the reader in search of spiritual guidance that the Dhammapada be used as a manual for contemplationAfter his initial reading he would do well to read several verses or even a whole chapter every day slowly and carefully relishing the wordsHe should reflect on the meaning of each verse deeply and thoroughly investigate its relevance to his life and apply it as a guide to conductIf this is done repeatedly with patience and perseverance it is certain that the Dhammapada will confer upon his life a new meaning and sense of purposeInfusing him with hope and inspiration gradually it will lead him to discover a freedom and happiness far greater than anything the world

goddess is asked about the cause for his or her rebirth within that particular mansionThe deva thereupon relates his or her previous good deeds John DIreland in Vangisa An Early Buddhist PoetIn the passages listed below the translator appears in the square bracketsEditors note There are currently no translations from the Abhidhamma at Access to InsightThe seven books of the Abhidhamma Pitaka the third division of the Tipitaka offer an extraordinarily detailed analysis of the basic natural principles that govern mental and physical processesWhereas the Sutta and Vinaya Pitakas lay out the practical aspects of the Buddhist path to Awakening the Abhidhamma Pitaka provides a theoretical framework to explain the causal underpinnings of that very pathIn Abhidhamma philosophy the familiar psychophysical universe is distilled to its essence an intricate web of impersonal phenomena and processes unfolding at an inconceivably rapid pace from moment to moment according to precisely defined natural lawsAccording to tradition the essence of the Abhidhamma was formulated by the Buddha during the fourth week after his EnlightenmentSeven years later he is said to have spent three consecutive months preaching it in its entirety in one of the deva realms before an audience of thousands of devas each day briefly commuting back to the human realm to convey to VenSariputta the essence of what he had just taughtSariputta mastered the Abhidhamma and codified it into roughly its present formAlthough parts of the Abhidhamma were recited at the earlier Buddhist Councils it wasnt until the Third Council that it became fixed into its present form as the third and final Pitaka of the canonDespite its relatively late entrance into the Canon the Abhidhamma stands as an essential pillar of classical Theravada Buddhist thoughtIts significance does however vary considerably across regional and cultural boundariesIn Thai Buddhism for example the Abhidhamma play a relatively minor role in Buddhist doctrine and practiceIn Sri Lanka and Myanmar however they hold the same venerated status as the Vinaya and Sutta Pitakas themselvesThe modern Burmese approach to the teaching and practice of Satipatthana meditation in particular relies heavily on an Abhidhammic interpretation of meditative experienceRegardless of the Abhidhammas position on the shelf of Buddhist canonical texts the astonishing detail with which it methodically constructs a quasiscientific model of mind insures its place in history as a monumental feat of intellectual geniusThe Abhidhamma Pitaka is divided into seven books although it is the first and last that together lay out the essence of Abhidhamma philosophyThe seven books areThe Abhidhamma Pitaka has a welldeserved reputation for being dense and difficult readingThe best way to begin studying Abhidhamma is not to dive right into its two key books but to explore some of the more modern  and readable  commentarial textsThese will help you get

disciples during and shortly after the Buddhas fortyfive year teaching career as well as many additional verses by other members of the SanghaMore than one thousand sutta translations are available on this websiteThe suttas are grouped into five nikayas or collectionsThe Division of Short Books consisting of fifteen booksThe Vinaya Pitaka the first division of the Tipitaka is the textual framework upon which the monastic community is builtIt includes not only the rules governing the life of every Theravada bhikkhu and bhikkhuni but also a host of procedures and conventions of etiquette that support harmonious relations both among the monastics themselves and between the monastics and their lay supporters upon whom they depend for all their material needsWhen the Buddha first established the Sangha the community initially lived in harmony without any codified rules of conductAs the Sangha gradually grew in number and evolved into a more complex society occasions inevitably arose when a member would act in an unskillful wayWhenever one of these cases was brought to the Buddhas attention he would lay down a rule establishing a suitable punishment for the offense as a deterrent to future misconductThe Buddhas standard reprimand was itself a powerful correctiveIt is not fit foolish man it is not becoming it is not proper it is unworthy of a recluse it is not lawful it ought not to be doneHow could you foolish man having gone forth under this Dhamma and Discipline which are welltaught It is not foolish man for the benefit of unbelievers nor for the increase in the number of believers but foolish man it is to the detriment of both unbelievers and believers and it causes wavering in some The Book of the Discipline Part I by IBHorner ppThe monastic tradition and the rules upon which it is built are sometimes navely criticized  particularly here in the West  as irrelevant to the modern practice of BuddhismSome see the Vinaya as a throwback to an archaic patriarchy based on a hodgepodge of ancient rules and customs  quaint cultural relics that only obscure the essence of true Buddhist practiceThis misguided view overlooks one crucial fact it is thanks to the unbroken lineage of monastics who have consistently upheld and protected the rules of the Vinaya for almost years that we find ourselves today with the luxury of receiving the priceless teachings of DhammaWere it not for the Vinaya and for those who continue to keep it alive to this day there would be no BuddhismIt helps to keep in mind that the name the Buddha gave to the spiritual path he taught was Dhammavinaya  the Doctrine and Discipline  suggesting an integrated body of wisdom and ethical trainingThe Vinaya is thus an indispensable facet and foundation of all the Buddhas teachings inseparable from the Dhamma and worthy of study by all followers  lay and ordained alikeLay practitioners will find in the Vinaya Pitaka many valuable lessons concerning human nature guidance on how to establish and maintain a harmonious community or organization and many profound teachings of the Dhamma itselfBut its greatest value perhaps lies in its power to inspire the layperson to consider the extraordinary possibilities presented by a life of true renunciation a life lived fully in tune with the DhammaMany of the formidable social and cultural problems we face today are rooted in the sharp schism that has divided Western civilization between science and religion where science claims invincible knowledge based on the empirical investigation of the natural world while religion can do little more than call for faith in supernatural creeds and obedience to codes of ethics that require restraint selfdiscipline and selfsacrificeSince religion as traditionally understood often rests on little more than blithe promises and pompous threats its appeals to our allegiance seldom win assent while the ethical ideals it advocates stand hardly a fighting chance against the constant injunction  thrust upon us by TV radio and signboard  to enjoy life to the hilt while we canAs a result a vast portion of humankind today has become alienated from religion as a meaningful guide to life left with no alternative but to plunge headlong into the secular religion of consumerism and hedonismToo often those in the religious camp sensing the threat secularism poses to their own security feel driven toward an aggressive fundamentalism in a desperate bid to salvage traditional loyaltiesThe quest to establish a sound basis for conduct in todays world has been made particularly difficult because one consequence of the dominance of the scientific worldview has been the banishment of values from the domain of the realWhile many scientists in their personal lives are staunch advocates of such ideals as world peace political justice and greater economic equality the worldview promulgated by modern science grants to values no objective grounding in the grand scheme of thingsFrom this perspective their root and basis is purely subjective and thus they bring along all the qualities the notion of subjectivity suggests being personal private relative even arbitraryThe overall effect of this scission despite the best intentions of many responsible scientists has been to give a green light to lifestyles founded on the quest for personal gratification and a power drive aimed at the exploitation of othersIn contrast to the classical Western antithesis of religion and science Buddhism shares with science a common commitment to uncover the truth about the worldBoth Buddhism and science draw a sharp distinction between the way things appear and the way they really are and both offer to open our minds to insights into the real nature of things normally hidden from us by false ideas based on sense perception and common sense Nevertheless despite this affinity it is also necessary to recognize the great differences in aim and orientation that separate Buddhism and scienceWhile both may share certain conceptions about the nature of reality science is essentially a project designed to provide us with objective factual knowledge with information pertaining to the public domain while Buddhism is a spiritual path intended to promote inner transformation and the realization of the highest good called enlightenment liberation or NibbanaIn Buddhism the quest for knowledge is important not as an end in itself but because the main cause of our bondage and suffering is ignorance not understanding things as they really are and thus the antidote needed to heal ourselves is knowledge or insightAgain the knowledge to be acquired by the practice of Dhamma differs significantly from that sought by science in several major respectsMost importantly the knowledge sought is not simply the acquisition of objective information about the constitution and operations of the physical world but a deep personal insight into the real nature of ones personal existenceThe aim is not to understand reality from the outside but from the inside from the perspective of ones own living experienceOne seeks not factual knowledge but insight or wisdom a personal knowledge inescapably subjective whose whole value lies in its transformative impact on ones lifeConcern with the outer world as an object of knowledge arises only insofar as the outer world is inextricably implicated in experienceAs the Buddha says It is in this body with its perception and thought that I declare is the world the origin of the world the cessation of the world and the way to the cessation of the worldBecause Buddhism takes personal experience as its starting point without aiming to use experience as a springboard to an impersonal objective type of knowledge it includes within its domain the entire spectrum of qualities disclosed by personal experienceThis means that Buddhism gives prime consideration to valuesBut even more values for Buddhism are not merely projections of subjective judgments which we fashion according to our personal whims social needs or cultural conditioning to the contrary they are written into the texture of reality just as firmly as the laws of motion and thermodynamicsHence values can be evaluated rated in terms of truth and falsity ranked as valid and invalid and part of our task in giving meaning to our lives is to unearth the true scheme of valuesTo determine the true gradation of values we must turn our attention inward and use subjective criteria of investigation but what we find far from being private or arbitrary is an integral part of the objective order permeated by the same lawfulness as that which governs the movement of the planets and the starsAffirmation of the objective reality of value implies another major distinction between Buddhism and scienceIn order for the liberating knowledge of enlightenment to arise the investigator must undergo a profound personal transformation guided by inner perception of the genuine valuesWhile natural science can be undertaken as a purely intellectual discipline the Buddhist quest in its entirety is an existential discipline which can only be implemented by regulating ones conduct purifying ones mind and refining ones capacity for attention to ones own bodily and mental processesThis training requires compliance with ethics all the way through and thus ethical guidelines support and pervade the entire training from its starting point in right action to its culmination in the highest liberation of the mindWhat is especially noteworthy is that the ethical thrust of the Buddhist training and its cognitive thrust converge on the same point the realization of the truth of selflessnessIt is just here that contemporary science approaches Buddhism in its discovery of the process nature of actuality implying the lack of an ultimate substance concealed behind the sequence of eventsBut this correspondence again points to a fundamental differenceIn Buddhism the impermanent and substanceless nature of reality is not simply a factual truth apprehended by objective knowledgeIt is above all an existential truth a transformative principle offering the key to right understanding and right liberationTo use this key to open the door to spiritual freedom its sole purpose we must govern our conduct on the premise that the idea of a substantial self is a delusionIt is insufficient merely to give intellectual assent to the idea of selflessness and turn it into a plaything of thoughtThe principle must be penetrated by training ourselves to discover the absence of selfhood in its subtlest hiding place the deep recesses of our own mindsIt is to be hoped that Buddhist thinkers and openminded scientists by sharing their insights and reflections can show us an effective way to heal the rift between objective knowledge and spiritual wisdom and thus bring about a reconciliation between science and spiritualityIn this way spiritual practice will become an integral part of the discipline aimed at knowledge and spiritual practice and knowledge in combination will become the tools for achieving the highest good enlightenment and spiritual freedomThis has always been the position of Buddhism as evidenced by the most ancient texts themselvesWe must remember that the Buddha the Enlightened One is not only like the scientist a lokavidu a knower of the world but also above all a vijjacaranasampanno one complete in both knowledge and conductThe Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creedsFounded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topicsIts publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddhas discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practiceThese works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first aroseToday the practice of insight meditation has gained global popularity yet in achieving this success it has undergone a subtle metamorphosisRather than being taught as an integral part of the Buddhist path it is now often presented as a secular discipline whose fruits pertain more to life within the world than to supramundane releaseMany meditators testify to the tangible benefits they have gained from the practice of insight meditation benefits that range from enhanced job performance and better relationships to deeper calm more compassion and greater awarenessHowever while such benefits may certainly be worthwhile in their own right taken by themselves they are not the final goal that the Buddha himself holds up as the end point of his trainingThat goal in the terminology of the texts is the attainment of Nibbana the destruction of all defilements here and now and deliverance from the beginningless round of rebirthsPerhaps the most powerful pressure that has shaped the contemporary expression of insight meditation has been the need to transplant the practice into a largely secular environment remote from its traditional matrix of Buddhist faith and doctrineGiven the skeptical climate of our age it is quite appropriate that newcomers to Dhamma be invited to explore for themselves the potential inherent in the practicePerhaps the last thing they need is to have the full agenda of Buddhist doctrine thrust upon them from the startHowever though we may initially take up meditation with an open and explorative mind at a certain point in our practice we inevitably arrive at a crossroads where we are faced with a choiceEither we can continue the meditation as a purely naturalistic nonreligious discipline or we can transpose the practice back into its original setting of Buddhist faith and understandingIf we choose the first route we might still deepen our meditation and reap more abundantly the same benefits we have obtained so far  deeper calm more equanimity greater openness even a kind of penetration of the here and nowNevertheless as desirable as these fruits might be in themselves viewed against the Buddhas word they remain incompleteFor the practice of insight meditation to achieve the full potential ascribed to it by the Buddha it must be embraced by several other qualities that rivet it to the framework of the teachingForemost among such qualities is the complementary pair of faith and right viewAs a factor of the Buddhist path faith does not mean blind belief but a willingness to accept on trust certain propositions that we cannot at our present stage of development personally verify for ourselvesThese propositions concern both the nature of reality and the higher reaches of the pathIn the traditional map of the Buddhist training faith is placed at the beginning as the prerequisite for the later stages comprised in the triad of virtue concentration and wisdomThe canonical texts do not seem to envisage the possibility that a person lacking faith in the tenets specific to the Dhamma could take up the practice of insight meditation and reap positive resultsYet today such a phenomenon has become extremely widespreadIt is quite common now for meditators to make their first contact with the Dhamma through intensive insight meditation and then to use this experience as a touchstone for assessing their relationship to the teachingAt this juncture the choice they make divides meditators into two broad campsOne consists of those who focus exclusively on the tangible benefits the practice yields here and now suspending all concern with what lies beyond the horizons of their own experienceThe other consists of those who recognize the practice to flow from a fount of understanding far deeper and broader than their ownTo follow this wisdom to its source such meditators are prepared to subordinate their own familiar assumptions to the disclosures of the teaching and thus embrace the Dhamma as an integral wholeThe fact that insight meditation can be seriously practiced even outside the domain of Buddhist faith raises an interesting question never explicitly posed by the canon and commentariesIf insight meditation can be pursued solely for its immediately visible benefits then what role does faith play in the development of the pathCertainly faith as a full acceptance of Buddhist doctrine is not a necessary condition for Buddhist practiceAs we have seen those who do not follow the Dhamma as a path to spiritual deliverance might still accept the Buddhist ethical precepts and practice meditation as a way to inner peaceFaith must therefore play a different role than that of a simple spur to action but the exact nature of this role remains problematicPerhaps the solution will emerge if we ask what faith actually means in the context of Buddhist practiceIt should be clear at once that faith cannot be adequately explained simply as reverence for the Buddha or as some alloy of devotion admiration and gratitudeFor while these qualities often exist alongside faith they may all be present even when faith is absentIf we examine faith more closely we would see that besides its emotive ingredients it also involves a cognitive componentThis consists in a readiness to accept the Buddha as the unique discoverer and proclaimer of liberating truthSeen from this angle faith necessarily involves a decisionAs the word decision implies to place faith in something is to exercise an act of discriminationThus Buddhist faith entails at least implicitly a rejection of the claims of other spiritual teachers to be bearers of the liberating message on a par with the Buddha himselfAs a decision faith also entails acceptanceIt involves a willingness to open oneself to the principles made known by the Enlightened One and adhere to them as trustworthy guides to knowledge and conductIt is this decision that separates those who take up the practice of insight meditation as a purely naturalistic discipline from those who practice it within the framework of the Buddhist faithThe former by suspending any judgment about the picture of the human condition imparted by the Buddha limit the fruit of the practice to those that are compatible with a secular naturalistic worldviewThe latter by accepting the Buddhas own disclosure of the human condition gain access to the goal that the Buddha himself holds up as the final aim of the practiceThe second pillar that supports the practice of insight meditation is the cognitive counterpart of faith namely right viewThough the word view might suggest that the practitioner actually sees the principles considered to be right at the outset of the training this is seldom the caseFor all but a few exceptionally gifted disciples right view initially means right belief the acceptance of principles and doctrines out of confidence in the Buddhas enlightenmentThough Buddhist modernists sometimes claim that the Buddha said that one should believe only what one can verify for oneself no such statement is found in the Pali canonWhat the Buddha does say is that one should not accept his teachings blindly but should inquire into their meaning and attempt to realize their truth for oneselfContrary to Buddhist modernism there are many principles taught by the Buddha as essential to right understanding that we cannot in our present state see for ourselvesThese are by no means negligible for they define the framework of the Buddhas entire program of deliveranceNot only do they depict the deeper dimensions of the suffering from which we need release but they point in the direction where true liberation lies and prescribe the steps that lead to realization of the goalThese principles include the tenets of both mundane and transcendent right viewMundane right view is the type of correct understanding that leads to a fortunate destination within the round of rebirthsIt involves an acceptance of the principles of kamma and its fruit of the distinction between meritorious and evil actions and of the vast expanse and multiple domains of samsara within which rebirth may occurTranscendent right view is the view leading to liberation from samsara in its entiretyIt entails understanding the Four Noble Truths in their deeper ramifications as offering not merely a diagnosis of psychological distress but a description of samsaric bondage and a program for final releaseIt is the transcendent right view that comes at the head of the Noble Eightfold Path and steers the other seven factors toward the cessation of sufferingWhile the actual techniques for practicing insight meditation may be identical for those who pursue it as a purely naturalistic discipline and those who adopt it within the framework of Dhamma the two styles of practice will nevertheless differ profoundly with respect to the results those techniques can yieldWhen practiced against the background of a naturalistic understanding insight meditation can bring greater calm understanding and equanimity even experiences of insightIt can purify the mind of the coarser defilements and issue in a tranquil acceptance of lifes vicissitudesFor these reasons this mode of practice should not be disparagedHowever from a deeper point of view this appropriation of Buddhist meditation remains incompleteIt is still confined to the sphere of conditioned existence still tied to the cycle of kamma and its fruitWhen however insight meditation is sustained from below by deep faith in the Buddha as the perfectly enlightened teacher and illuminated from above by the wisdom of the teaching it acquires a new capacity that the other approach lacksIt now functions with the support of dispassion moving toward ultimate deliveranceIt becomes the key to open the doors to the Deathless the means to gain a freedom that can never be lostWith this insight meditation transcends the limits of the conditioned transcends even itself to arrive at its proper goal the eradication of all the fetters of existence and release from the beginningless round of birth aging and deathThe Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creedsFounded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topicsIts publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddhas discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practiceThese works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first aroseHave I not told you already Ananda that there must be parting and separation from all who are dear and agreeable to oneself These words spoken by the Buddha to his devoted attendant on the eve of his parinibbana took on an especially poignant meaning for me this past rainy season when in quick succession my beloved ordination teacher VenBalangoda Ananda Maitreya Mahanayaka Thera and my longtime spiritual friend VenPiyadassi Nayaka Thera succumbed to the implacable law of impermanenceVenAnanda Maitreya expired on th July just one month short of his nd birthday VenPiyadassi followed exactly a month later on th August a little more than a month past his th birthdayBoth monks had lived full and fruitful lives in the Sangha throughout the twentieth century leaving behind such deep tracks in the contemporary history of Sri Lankan Buddhism that it would hardly be an exaggeration to say that their death spells the end of an epochYet though the two were firmly rooted in Sri Lanka and its ancient Theravada heritage neither was a narrow nationalist who restricted his field of activity to his native landTo the contrary they both had a breadth of heart and range of vision that enabled them to feel at home anywhereTheir rich inner springs of compassion extended to people throughout the world and even in their ripe old age they both traveled the globe to teach the Dhamma to all who would lend an earBoth monks also transcended the limits of hidebound traditionalism achieving for themselves a rare synthesis of tradition and modernityThey had studied English in their youth had read widely in world literature other religions and modern modes of thought and had developed approaches to the Dhamma that highlighted its timeless rationality and timely contemporary relevanceMy own relationship with these two elders was close and deeply personal unfolding under such unlikely circumstances that it seems a karmic nexus had reached out across the oceans and linked us half a world awayThe story of this relationship began in when I was living at a Vietnamese Buddhist center in Los Angeles and teaching world religions at a college in the sprawling conurbation of southern CaliforniaOne day at our center we received notice that a Buddhist monk from Sri Lanka would be coming to LA and we invited him to stay with us and give a series of lectures on Theravada BuddhismThat Buddhist monk was none other than VenPiyadassi who was then on his second world Dhamma tourHis lectures were excellent conveying with crystal clarity and gentle humor the heart of the Buddhas teachings which he knew so wellAt the end of the week when we parted at the LA airport VenPiyadassi suggested to me that some day I should come to Sri Lanka and spend time in a Buddhist monasteryThis suggestion resonated with an idea that was already taking shape in my mind and thus the following year when I decided to come to Asia to enter the Sangha I wrote to VenPiyadassi to remind him of his invitationIn reply he gave me the name and address of a senior prelate VenBalangoda Ananda MaitreyaAt first I hesitated to contact this elder for he was already years old and I feared that at such an age he might not be fit enough to teach meLittle did I realize I was being introduced to a monk of such amazing strength and vitality that he would still be striding the globe well into his th yearIn any case I took the chance and wrote to him and his welcoming reply set me on a journey to the East that culminated in my ordination as a bhikkhu and a threeyear tutelage under him at his small village temple near BalangodaThe future Mahanayaka Thera had been born just across the paddy field from this temple in and was ordained there as a novice inHis teacher VenDenihena Silananda reputed to be the most learned monk in the Balangoda area subjected his young pupil to a nineyear course of training so rigorous it left him only a few hours of sleep per nightBut Ananda Maitreya emerged with a masterly knowledge of the Tipitaka and its commentaries and of the languages Pali and SanskritAt this point his farsighted guru aware of the need of the hour sent him to Ananda College in Colombo to study English a move which equipped him for his important work later in lifeThrough the middle decades of this century VenAnanda Maitreya played a pivotal role in almost all the major episodes in the modern history of Sri Lankan BuddhismAs a teacher at Ananda College he helped to educate many of the future leaders of the nationHe founded a prestigious monastic college in Balangoda which he served as principal for yearsHe served on the Buddhist Committee of Inquiry which sought to rectify the injustices imposed on Buddhism during the period of colonial ruleHe was a member of the Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Editorial BoardHe compiled the first modern biography of the Buddha in Sinhala and wrote school textbooks for the study of Pali Sanskrit and EnglishHe joined the faculty of the new Vidyodaya University as professor of Mahayana Buddhist studiesHe was elected the first Mahanayaka Thera of the United Amarapura NikayaOn the wider Buddhist scene he participated in the Sixth Buddhist Council in Burma where he was appointed the Sri Lankan representative on the Final Editing Committee and later became chairman of the entire CouncilIn at the age of a new leaf opened up to VenAnanda Maitreyas life that of a Buddhist missionary to the WestBetween then and he must have made seven or eight extended Dhamma missions which brought him to Britain France the USA and CanadaHe also appeared in the wellknown BBC television series The Long Search where as the informant on Theravada Buddhism he deeply impressed viewers around the worldDuring one stay in the US at the age of he learned to use the computer and returned home with his own little desktop unit living proof that one is never too old to learnOn a trip to Colombo in June I had the fortune to meet VenAnanda Maitreya in his temple near ColomboHe had just returned from a trip to Taiwan Thailand and Singapore and appeared to be in sound health except for complaints about  a little phlegm trouble He then seemed so fit so clearminded and energetic that we never suspected the little phlegm trouble would turn into the illness that only a month later would take him from our midstIt is testimony to the high regard in which he was held in this country that a hundred thousand people attended his cremation and the whole road which the cortege traveled from Avissawela to Balangoda was lined with yellow banners and flags to welcome the prelate on his last journeyVenPiyadassi needs hardly an introduction to our BPS readers who will know him through his classic The Buddhas Ancient Path The Spectrum of Buddhism and his many contributions to the Wheel Bodhi Leaves and Damsak seriesIt was in fact a sermon he gave in late that led to the birth of the BPS on New Years day in an edited version of that sermon appeared as Wheel No The Seven Factors of EnlightenmentFrom onward he was the editor of the Damsak series the Sinhala counterpart of the Wheel a role he fulfilled amidst a host of other duties so numerous and demanding that they would normally require the talents of three or four monksHe was the director of the Vajirarama Monastery in Colombo chief incumbent of the Sambodhi Vihara and patron of a large number of Buddhist organizations chiefly those devoted to helping the poor and handicappedHe was also one of the countrys most popular preachers constantly in demand because of his ability to convey the deep truths of the Dhamma in clear simple languageThe salient characteristic of VenPiyadassis life is summed up in the title of his biography Piyadassi The Wandering MonkThis however was not a leisurely wandering on foot with bowl and shoulder bag but a global airborne wandering that took him on fourteen international Dhamma tours to over fifty countriesWithin Sri Lanka VenPiyadassi was in his own words a shuttle on a loom moving back and forth between Colombo and the provinces with hardly a pauseOn his frequent trips to Kandy once or twice a month he would stay next door to me in the Udawattakele Forest Reserve and through this close connection and our shared work for the BPS our friendship became deep steadfast and solidHis loss will be irreparable and his place irreplaceable throughout Sri Lanka and particularly at the BPSMay these two great elders who for so long held aloft the torch of the Dhamma attain the supreme bliss of NibbanaThe Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creedsFounded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topicsIts publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddhas discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practiceThese works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first aroseOutside a Buddhist temple early on a summer Saturday morning a monk named Bhikkhu Tissa is sweeping the stone walkHis work is neither slow nor fast but steady and careful as if the sweeping of dust and leaves were something important to himFrom the road some yards away comes the hum of an approaching automobileIn the morning quiet the hum rises to a rumble and a shiny sports car passes byIf Bhikkhu Tissa were watching  which he is not  he would notice that the driver momentarily slows down and regards him curiously before disappearing around a curveThen there is a slight screech of tires and in a moment the sports car returns and zooms into the driveway by the templeMrCarp a young man in expensive casual clothes climbs out and approaches the monkMRCARP Hey there friendBHIKKHU TISSA Good morningCARP My names CarpIm a friend of Charlie PrenticeYou know him I thinkBHIKKHU Oh yes MrPrentice comes by quite often nowCARP You are Bhikkhu Tissa arent youBHIKKHU Yes I amCARP Or Venerable Tissa Charlie saysYou guys sure have some strange namesBHIKKHU Is there anything I can do for you MrCarpCARP Probably not to tell the truthIm on my way down to the beach and anyway Im not really interested in BuddhismBut I was reading these books seeBHIKKHU Books on BuddhismBHIKKHU Why were you reading books on Buddhism if youre not interested in itIt sounds like a terrible waste of timeCARP Well I mean  maybe it wasCharlie gave me those books and let me tell you they were pretty annoyingAll that talk about sufferingI mean page after page of misery old age death and so onIt sounds like Buddhism is the most pessimistic religion in the worldI got to thinking about it and I was wondering why you Buddhists have such a negative attitude toward life and why you dwell on sufferingBHIKKHU You might also say that suffering dwells on usCARP Hows thatAnyhow I saw you just now and I thought why not ask the guy about itSo I have a few questionsUnless youre busy of courseBHIKKHU Id be glad to try to answer questions about the DhammaCARP Dhamma Thats the word that keeps popping up in those booksWhat does it meanI forgetBHIKKHU Usually it means just the teaching of the BuddhaIt also means truth reality the way things are the law of the universe bare phenomena themselves the path to deliverance  depending on the contextCARP Its pretty important huhBHIKKHU The word is just a wordWhats behind the word is the most important thing in the worldCARP I figured youd say something like thatId like to hear about itSay could we sit down somewhereBHIKKHU SureHow about this nice patch of grass over hereCARP I guess you dont have any lawn chairs around hereBHIKKHU We make do with what we haveI find grass very accommodatingThey sit down in a shady spotMrCarp uncomfortably inspects the area for antsCARP You know Bhikkhu Tissa I never met a Buddhist monk beforeI understand people treat you monks with all kinds of respectBHIKKHU Depends on the person depends on the monkCARP You get called venerable sir and all thatBHIKKHU We get called other things tooCARP Yes I bet you doBut let me get on to my questionsThis business of suffering really bothers meIsnt there enough trouble in the world without you Buddhists harping on itBHIKKHU Its precisely because there is trouble in the world that we pay attention to it or harp on it if you willCARP Do you think you can do anything about itBHIKKHU YesThats the reason Buddhism existsCARP This I want to hearTo me it seems like we should emphasize the happy side of lifeWhy should we pay attention to all the miseryBHIKKHU If a wasp stings you do you pay attention to itCARP Well of courseBHIKKHU But what good does that doWhy dwell on itCARP Because I want to get away from it because I dont want to be stung againBHIKKHU If you dont want to be stung again it would make sense to learn something about wasps wouldnt itWhere they build their nests whats likely to upset them how to keep from annoying them and so onThere are a great many kinds of suffering in the world and they all have their own causes and characteristicsIf you feel any of these afflictions or think that you might be prey to them wouldnt it be wise to take a good look at them and see what might be done about themCARP Yes thats so I supposeBut any way you go theres some amount of trouble so I prefer to accent the positive so to speakYouve got to take the bitter with the sweetBHIKKHU Would I be wrong in guessing that you have a fair amount of sweet in your lifeCARP Its true Im getting along real wellI work for a real estate development company organizing some new projectsAnd to tell the truth Im doing pretty well at itLifes good to me I admitThats why I object to BuddhismBHIKKHU Are you completely satisfied with the way things areCARP Not completelyWho isThe important thing is to keep totally in command of your lifeBHIKKHU Permit me to disagreeNobody keeps totally in command of his lifeConsider just your bodyYou look pretty healthyBut can you keep your body from ever getting sickCan you keep it from getting old and breaking downOr from dyingCARP No I cant do thatBHIKKHU Or consider your workCan you be sure your colleagues will treat you fairlyCARP Those guysNo wayBHIKKHU Will your creditors always be tolerantWill your customers always pay their bills quicklyWill your competitors put up no resistanceCARP Theres a lot of uncertainty in businessBHIKKHU Theres a lot of uncertainty in social life in family life in all spheres of activityAm I wrongWhat do you thinkCARP No I cant deny itBHIKKHU Or to get right down to the most important thing can you keep totally in control of your own mindCARP Im a pretty cheerful guyBHIKKHU Thats not what I asked MrCarpWhen things go wrong around you can you keep your mind steady and peacefulCARP Of course notHow could that beBHIKKHU If you tell your mind not to get upset or angry or distracted does it obey youCARP Thats a funny way to look at itBut no I guess my mind pretty much does what it likesThoughts and feelings just come boiling upBHIKKHU Then you certainly arent in command of your mind are youAnd if you cant control your body or your mind or the actions of other people you can hardly say youre in command of your lifeCARP It was just a figure of speechBHIKKHU Lets examine this a bit further if you dont mindHow many people do you think can control their lives to any degreeCARP Not many probablyYou never know what will happenBHIKKHU RightYou never know what will happenIf its pleasant you will be elatedIf its unpleasant you will be upset and depressedIf someone is kind to you youll be gratifiedIf they cheat you youll be angryTell me MrCarp do you see any independence or security in this state of affairsCARP Since you put it like that not muchI suppose we have to admit we live in insecurity and dependence to a large degreeBHIKKHU Would you call this situation pleasant or unpleasantCARP Unpleasant mostlyBHIKKHU The Buddha spoke about sorrow pain and insecurity not because he liked them but because he saw them as the key to an understanding of lifeCARP Pessimistic like I sayBHIKKHU A fact is just a factIf youre going to come to a good decision about how to act you need accurate information about the matter at handSo you look and you take note of the important details you see regardless of whether or not they are personally appealing to youCARP What was the Buddha looking forBHIKKHU AhA good questionHe was looking for a way outCARP A way out of dependence and insecurityBHIKKHU ExactlyThe word that describes this situation is dukkhaThis is usually translated as suffering but it means a great deal more than thatUnsatisfactoriness might be a better wordCARP Well excuse me Bhikkhu Tissa but when you get right down to it everything is unsatisfactory to some degreeBHIKKHU IndeedCARP Nothing is completely dependableYou cant expect thatEverything has flawsBHIKKHU How about permanentAre pleasure and security permanentCARP Not in my experienceYouve got to keep chasing them downThats what life is all aboutBHIKKHU Lets see if I can summarize a bitNobody  at least nobody that we know of  can truly control his own body and make it do exactly what he wantsNobody can tell his mind how to behave when disturbing events occurNobody can prevent disasters from happening to him or keep people from doing things he doesnt likeNobody can make pleasures last or keep good feelings from fading awaySo we find ourselves always running after something desirable or away from something frightfulWhat would you call this state of affairsThere is a pause while MrCarp fidgets plucks grass blades laughsCARP SufferingOkay suffering or unsatisfactoriness or whatever you want to call itIt goes pretty deep does itBHIKKHU It is stitched right into the fabric of thingsYou could even say its the thread in the fabric itselfCARP What a view of lifeNow let me ask the Buddha was looking for a way outAnd he found it I supposeBHIKKHU He didThe way out that he found is called Dhamma the word we began withCARP So this Dhamma that the Buddha created can get us out of sufferingBHIKKHU The Buddha didnt create itHe only discovered it and made it knownThe Dhamma exists whether or not anybody knows it or understands it just as apples will continue to fall from trees whether or not anyone understands the law of gravityCARP Is Dhamma some kind of godBHIKKHU NoThe Dhamma has many aspects but basically it is just the way things are the underlying laws of the universeCARP That sounds simple enoughWhy isnt it selfevident thenWhy dont people recognize itBHIKKHU Suppose on a dangerous seacoast there were a powerful light a great beacon in a lighthouseWould that be selfevident to sailorsCARP CertainlyBHIKKHU But what if the sailors never came out of their cabins or had the odd habit of wearing heavy cloths over their heads or slept all the timeCARP They wouldnt see it thenThey would run agroundBut what kind of metaphor are you suggestingBHIKKHU Fundamental truth or Dhamma is not by its nature hidden or obscure though countless philosophers have thought soBut there is something that prevents us from seeing the DhammaIt is called ignoranceThis ignorance this notknowing this blankness covers our minds and distorts our view of realityThe sailors in the ship may never leave the cabin  they may remain simply sunk in ignorance without trying to get outOr they may intentionally blind themselves with the masks of foolish beliefs and delusionsOr they may sleep all the time out of laziness and stupiditySo they will not see the light and may even deny that any such thing existsCARP But suppose somebody does see this Dhamma or sees enough of it to know its a good thingBHIKKHU Then if hes sensible hell follow it hell seek its protectionCARP But what kind of protection can Dhamma offer against all this suffering and uncertainty we were just talking aboutBHIKKHU Above all the Dhamma offers reliefThere is relief from doubt relief from fear relief from mental anguish relief from griefAs we study and practice Dhamma our ignorance about how the universe works is gradually reducedWe begin to understand cause and effectWe see that certain results follow from certain actions and we learn to govern our actions in order to get happy resultsSo we gain relief from doubt and begin to have confidence in our ability to make sense of the worldRight now we may be subject to all kinds of fears about what may happen to us thinking that some terrible fate may come crashing down on us at any momentBut the Dhamma teaches us that fear is one result of clinging to a permanence that does not really existWhen we are reconciled to the alwayschanging nature of things fear can be overcomeAlso we gain relief from mental anguish another result of clinging and craving because we train our minds according to Dhamma merely to pay attention to events and objects not to clutch them as me or mine If we have no obsession with being a sufferer then the suffering itself loses forceThen as for grief we have less to endure because we learn that all life is a constant flow and that grief is in a sense simply our own unhappy inventionTo know how life works is a great protection because it gives us confidence and helps us avoid sufferingCARP These are big promises Bhikkhu TissaBHIKKHU These are just possibilities very real possibilities  but not things that will happen simply because someone calls himself a BuddhistI dont expect you to believe themCARP You dontBHIKKHU Certainly notBuddhism holds out great hope to mankind but it does not expect or advise people to believe a set of doctrines without confirmationCARP And what kind of confirmation is necessaryBHIKKHU Why the confirmation of your own mind your own reason your own experienceCould anything less satisfy youCARP Well I believe in my own experience all rightBut why do you bother to tell me about these benefits of the DhammaBHIKKHU There is a saying that Buddhas only point the wayThe Buddha doesnt save anybodyHe only teaches people how to save themselvesHe points out the problems of life and shows how they may be solvedWe who are followers of the Buddha try to observe the same principle  we try to point out the way and encourage people to make the journey for themselvesCARP So you think that if people will make this journey they will find confirmation of Buddhist teachings for themselvesBHIKKHU YesYou see the truths the Buddha points out are right here in the body and the mindAnyone can see them who puts his mind to it but he has to put his mind to itCARP Can you explain some of these truthsI assure you theres no danger of my believing them without proofBHIKKHU Weve already touched on the truth of sufferingAs weve noted suffering or unsatisfactoriness is present in all worldly phenomena to one degree or anotherThis is one characteristic of existence that the Buddha repeatedly emphasizesThen there is the fact of impermanenceCARP Well nothing lasts foreverSure I know thatBHIKKHU Excuse me but the mark of aniccata or impermanence is extremely deepAnybody can notice gross physical changes  and these are certainly one aspect of impermanence  but few people realize that everything that exists in the world is whirling in a blur of change rising and falling every second flashing in and out of existence being born and dying appearing and perishing continuallyCARP You know modern physicists describe atoms and subatomic particles in almost the same way  as changing with incredible speed all the timeBHIKKHU So they doBut its not necessary to study physics to understand thisThe best laboratory is the mind itselfHave you ever known anything to change faster than your own mindCARP Sometimes I think my head will bust wide open the way my thoughts run onBHIKKHU Sometimes faster and wilder than you would wishCARP I suppose Ive already admitted I dont have much control over my mindSometimes its just a storm of passions ideas emotions memoriesBHIKKHU Can you remember a time when it wasnt like thisCARP No and thats pretty depressingBHIKKHU Its simply the nature of the mindPart of our trouble comes from conceiving the notion that the mind is ours that it is stable and permanent a self or an instrument of selfBut mind is just mind a collection of impersonal functionsIts nature is continual changeIt isnt you and it isnt ICARP I think were getting into deep waters hereBHIKKHU I hope soThe point I want to make is that when you look at it  especially when you look at it  the mind is like a pan of popping popcornIt just goes on jumping and making a racket and nobody knows what it will do nextIt is the best demonstration of impermanence there isIt just keeps changingNo matter how you want it to hold still it changesAll the aspects of mind are constantly changing feelings perceptions mental formations and consciousness itselfWouldnt you agreeCARP I guess soMemories feelings all those things keep running on foreverBHIKKHU This leads us on to the third mark of existence nonself or in Pali anattaCARP I believe I read about thatBut it seemed paradoxical to meI mean there is no self but we think there is only its just an illusion and so onBHIKKHU The basic marks of existence arent obscure in themselves here again its our own ignorance reinforced by craving that perverts our viewLets consider nonself in the light of the other two characteristics Ive mentioned  unsatisfactoriness and impermanenceEverything in the world is changing impermanent not lasting so it is always to some degree liable to suffering or unsatisfactorinessAnything we like or enjoy we want to keep on enjoying but we cant because it changes breaks up drifts awayCARP Like my girl friendsBHIKKHU We are always liable to be separated from what we love or united with what we hateCARP If you only knew some of the idiots I have to work withBHIKKHU Its unsatisfactory to be where we dont want to be and its unsatisfactory to lose what we cherishBut that is the unstable nature of thingsCARP Wait a minuteI thought of something that doesnt cause sufferingMy carIts a real beauty you can seeBHIKKHU And it never breaks downCARP NeverOf course I just bought it two weeks agoBut it runs perfectlyNo problemsBHIKKHU ReallyCARP SureOf course Ive got to watch out for itThe other day in the parking lot some idiot opened his door and banged the sideTook out a chip of paintUnbelievableBrand new carI was furiousI could have killed the guyBHIKKHU I seeWas that a pleasant sensationCARP Actually I felt lousyIt ruined the afternoonMy nerves are pretty bad when I get into conflictOkay I know what youll sayI admit that was unsatisfactory that was sufferingThe cars paint is impermanent and impermanent things are unsatisfactoryBHIKKHU Well then amid all this unsatisfactoriness and impermanence do you see any real selfCARP A selfSureI see meI see my own selfBHIKKHU Be careful now MrCarpWhat exactly does this self consist ofCARP Well Id have to say its my mindBHIKKHU Buddhism analyzes mind into feelings perceptions mental formations and consciousnessIs your self one or all of theseCARP Well I suppose Id say allBHIKKHU But havent we established that the mind and its functions are constantly changingCARP Yeah I guess soBHIKKHU So if the mind is constantly changing where is your self from one moment to the nextCARP I dont knowBHIKKHU Wouldnt it be changingBut in that case what does this self really amount toWhat makes it you if from moment to moment it changes into something elseWhen we say self we are really talking about some stable identity arent weBut where there is no stability we cant rightly talk about a selfFurthermore if the mind is your self if it is your essence then why cant you control it at willWhy cant you force it to be calm or happy or creativeAnd if you cant control it as you admit if you cant make it stay here or go there then who does it really belong toWhat sort of self is itCARP A pretty poor sort I must sayBHIKKHU Now this mind which changes every moment every instant which you cannot control at will  does it make you happyDoes it please youCARP Mostly its a pain the way my mind runs onBHIKKHU Then if it causes pain if its unreliable if its constantly in flux can we honestly call it a selfCARP OhWait now Im confusedPerhaps self is just a way of speakingBHIKKHU Indeed it is but what is behind the wordJust a flux of uncontrollable unreliable conditionsCARP Well Bhikkhu Tissa I dont know what to sayIf you look at it that way self is a rather flimsy conceptBHIKKHU Just soIts a concept that doesnt accurately reflect the factsEvents occur one after the other with terrific speedWe can observe the processBut self is merely a concept imposed on top of itWhen we Buddhists talk about nonself or anatta we mean this bare process of events giving rise to other eventsCARP Yes I follow your logic but still I feel that I am a self or have a selfBHIKKHU On a conventional level self is a perfectly useful termIts necessary for language and communicationI am I and you are you  thats true enough in everyday languageBut the trouble arises when we attribute to self a fundamental reality it doesnt possessBy imagining a precious ego by believing foolishly that we are permanent and satisfactory selves we set ourselves up for sufferingCARP Because the universe is not permanent or satisfactoryBHIKKHU ExactlyAnyone who persists in living contrary to the laws of the universe will continue to experience sufferingCARP This is really extraordinaryIm going to have to think this overBut you havent convinced me not at allBHIKKHU These three marks of existence  impermanence unsatisfactoriness and nonself  are significant because they indicate the way the universe is and the sort of conditions we have to deal withUnfortunately most of us out of ignorance see things incorrectlyWe take what is changing as stable we take what is imperfect and unsatisfactory as satisfactory we take what is without a self as having a selfCARP If what you say is true then most people are living exactly backward to the way they should be livingBHIKKHU Yes and that in itself is another aspect of dukkha or unsatisfactorinessCARP All right you Buddhists do have some justification for talking about sufferingBut one thing I still dont understand is why people misinterpret the world so grosslyIs it simply out of ignoranceBHIKKHU When we talk about ignorance we mean more than the absence of informationWe mean selfdeception and lack of judgment as wellFor example if we have a problem to solve we can gather information about the problem and from that information come to a conclusionBut what if the information is faultyWhat if we have misunderstood the facts to start withThen we begin reasoning with false premises and no matter how clever we are our conclusions will turn out false tooThe problem of understanding life itself depends on properly understanding factsWhen we are ignorant and uninstructed we tend to take things at face valueHuman nature being what it is we gravitate toward pleasant objects and shun unpleasant objectsBecause we are fond of pleasure we try to magnify it wherever we see it and because we hate pain we magnify thatSimply speaking we run to extremesWe have no special motivation to analyze the objects of our senses as long as they keep us entertained as they do so wellMoreover because we live a fair number of years and because there is a continuity in our experience we fasten onto the notion that we are selves or souls who experience things and have a definite identityWe dont know any better and without investigation we have no particular reason to question this life of loves and hates and quick assumptionsWe rely on our ignorant biases and continue to sufferCARP This ignorance sounds like plain carelessness and stupidityBHIKKHU YesTo the Buddha ignorance is not just a neutral notknowing it is a very reprehensible defilement a dangerous and foolish selfdeceptionCARP Now theres a funny old wordDefilement It sounds so negativeWho would want to believe in defilement nowadaysBHIKKHU Well I ask you who would want to escape sufferingCARP There is a connectionBHIKKHU Of courseIgnorance is the basic defilement the source of all greed hatred and delusionA mind clouded by defilements cannot see realityNot understanding not seeing the marks of impermanence suffering and nonself a person acts as if things were quite the contraryThus arises conflict with the laws of nature and misery followsCARP But how exactly does this misery come aboutBHIKKHU Are you familiar with the Four Noble TruthsCARP Oh themYes I read about themThey sounded depressing at the timeBHIKKHU But not nowCARP Well Im thinking about itBHIKKHU Sometimes people only hear the first noble truth which states the universal problem  that life passes away that it breaks up that health gives way to sickness and life gives way to death that all experiences and components of ordinary existence are impermanent and flawedNot that they are necessarily suffering all the time  indeed they are sometimes full of pleasure  but they are always liable to sufferingCARP That is a pretty sobering assessmentBHIKKHU The second noble truth is the origin of sufferingSuffering has a causeThis is a deceptively simple statement that contains much meaningSuffering does not happen spontaneouslyIt is caused and conditioned by other phenomenaAs the primary cause the Buddha singled out cravingWherever this craving or obsessive desire springs up suffering is sure to followWhyBecause craving leads to grasping and clinging to what is inherently unstableAll delightful objects experiences and persons break up and disappear so when ever we indulge in craving we are bound for disappointment and painCARP All right I am with you so farBut how do we get out of this messBHIKKHU The first two noble truths state the problemThe second two reveal the solutionThe third noble truth is called the truth of the cessation or ending of sufferingCARP Well its about timeBHIKKHU The Buddha realized that every phenomenon that arises arises from causes and conditions and that when those causes and conditions are removed the phenomenon must disappearSuffering has a causeThe cause is cravingWhen craving is brought to an end suffering is also brought to an endCARP But thats easier said than done I expectBHIKKHU Yes and thats where the fourth noble truth comes inThe Buddha states that there is a problem namely suffering there is a cause of the problem there is the possibility of eliminating the problem and finally there is a specific way to eliminate the problemThe fourth noble truth is simply the Noble Eightfold Path the Buddhas prescription for dealing with the unsatisfactoriness in lifeThe eight factors of the path are eight virtues or skills which can gradually weaken and ultimately destroy the craving that oppresses usRight Views means having a correct understanding of the way the universe operates the way suffering springs up in our livesRight Intentions means directing our thoughts and intentions toward wholesome things toward kindness mental purity and selftrainingRight Speech means refraining from harsh false or useless speechRight Action means acting in a virtuous way carrying out our intentions and following the moral preceptsRight Livelihood means earning a living by honest and respectable means fairly not cheating anyone not harming any living creaturesRight Effort means making an effort to guard the mind to overcome unwholesome mental states such as greed and hatred and to replace them with generosity and lovingkindnessRight Mindfulness means developing attention and presence of mind not being careless or unobservantRight Concentration means focusing the mind skillfully on objects so as to know them deeply without being distractedThese eight factors summarize the trainingCARP I hate to criticize Bhikkhu Tissa but that word training has an unpleasant soundLifes hard enoughWho wants any more training than he has to endure alreadyBHIKKHU What makes you think this training is disagreeableCARP I mean all those factors all that disciplineI dont think Id like to take it all on meBHIKKHU Pardon me but the purpose is to take it all off youCARP I dont understandBHIKKHU Buddhism as a religion  or as a way of life  aims at lightening your burden not increasing itIt is the untrained undisciplined mind that is weighed down and obstructed with woe just as a person who has no training in finding his way in a jungle is likely to lose the path and struggle miserably through thick vines and thornsWe are so accustomed to carrying unpleasant burdens that we can only think of taking on new pleasant burdens instead of putting them all downThe Dhamma is a training in putting downAs such it liberates and gladdens usCARP Well now Bhikkhu Tissa Ive got to say I enjoy some of these burdens Why should I get rid of them when they are really the only things that make my life worthwhileBHIKKHU Here we have arrived at an important point MrCarpEvery person has pleasant unpleasant and neutral experiencesNaturally we prefer the pleasantBut the burdens I refer to are not the experiences themselvesThey are our attachments to those experiencesCARP Ah youre getting subtle on meBHIKKHU Remember the Buddha identifies craving as the primary cause of our pain disappointment and sufferingThis craving or mental hunger is a strain or burden on the mindIt causes us to struggle against the natural changing state of thingsFor instance suppose we hunger after some desirable object and try to obtain itThen we suffer the strain of longing the worry about getting the object the fear that somebody else will get it first and the uncertainty of whether we really have the means to obtain itIf we fail to achieve our ends our inflamed mind suffers disappointmentIf we do get what we want then we have to protect it take care of it see that it is not stolen or destroyedSo we suffer anxiety on account of our craving and attachmentThen we have to deal with the unfaithfulness of our own mindThe mind changesWe may decide we dont like the object after all so we have the worry of getting rid of itOr the object turns out to cause us problems of one kind or anotherThen our attachment turns to aversion and we suffer the misery of being united with what we dont likeOr suppose we continue to enjoy the objectNot only does the mind change the object changesIt breaks it runs away it rusts it gets oldSooner or later we are separated from it and then we feel griefThen not knowing any better to cover up this grief our insatiable mind goes lurching after some new object mental or materialAnd the wheel keeps turning through the seconds and through the yearsAnd we do not escapeCARP Bhikkhu Tissa theres a lot of truth in what you sayI cant deny itBut how else can a person live if not by reaching for thingsHow can anyone be happyBHIKKHU Indeed we must reach for things but the right things and in the right wayTo put down the burden of craving does not mean to stop acting in the worldIt means to cut off our foolish hunger and vanityThe virtuous man the happy man is one who follows the middle way who is moderate in his desiresBuddhism teaches that good results follow good actions and evil results follow evil actionsEvents cause and condition other events so we should act responsibly knowing that we do in effect shape our own futureWhen we cut off an impulse of blind craving we gain peace in this very moment because the mind is no longer irritated and we gain benefit in the future because we have set up no painful cycle of grasping and losingIt is advantageous to live simply without superfluous possessions and entanglements but the most important thing is to root out craving itselfCARP So I dont necessarily have to give up thingsBHIKKHU Ah MrCarp you must give up what is painfulYou must give up what hurtsCARP And craving hurtsBHIKKHU Just look at your own mind thats allCARP Do you think I should meditateBHIKKHU I think you should examine yourself and watch the changes in your mind and bodyCARP Where does all this lead Bhikkhu TissaDoes it lead to happinessBHIKKHU Yes but not happiness as most people have been conditioned to thinkTrue happiness is not the piling up of sensepleasuresTrue happiness comes from liberation from the defilements from clear sight from an open generous heart that does not fear the ceaseless change of thingsCARP What about all this Ive read about supramundane wisdomBHIKKHU Wisdom arises from the practice of DhammaIt is a tool that helps us reach the goal but it is not the goal itselfCARP The goal is the end of suffering rightBHIKKHU RightSome people develop what you might call a craving after wisdom  wanting to know the secrets of the workings of things out of curiosity or prideThis is knowing for its own sake and it is not usefulIn fact the Buddha refused to answer speculative questions about the origin and the future of the universe because such questions are distractions from the matter at hand  the problem of suffering and the overcoming of sufferingCARP You know I had the idea that Buddhism was only concerned with very lofty esoteric things  not the everyday existence of ordinary peopleIts somewhat encouraging to hear that Buddhism deals with how to achieve happiness in this worldNot that I necessary believe it of courseBHIKKHU Sometimes people who are too much caught up in the world turn cynical thinking that there is nothing higher than the gaining and losing of status objects or relationshipsNot seeing that a higher worthier and more peaceful everyday life is possible they become bogged down in entertainments that fail to satisfyCARP I wonder if youre referring to me Bhikkhu TissaWell it doesnt matterI can testify that lots of my unreligious friends just dont believe that any different kind of life existsYoure suggesting that it doesBHIKKHU The Dhamma suggests that it doesNow let me return to your charge of pessimismCARP Well Im having second thoughts about thatBHIKKHU Buddhism deals with the problem of suffering and the cure of sufferingOnce we recognize that a disease exists we can treat the disease if we have the medicine at handImagine the joy of health to someone who has never before known healthImagine the relief of someone who has carried a boulder on his back all his life and now can set it downCARP Yes I can see thatBut really Bhikkhu Tissa I dont want to go live in a cave and meditate all the timeIve got to make a living in this worldBHIKKHU Theres no need to live in a caveThe practice of Dhamma can and should be carried on wherever you find yourselfIt is compatible with any kind of respectable livelihoodIt depends on mindfully observing our actions from moment to moment whatever we are doing and so it can benefit the businessman as well as the monkCARP Well my friend Charlie Prentice sure seems cheerful latelyBut a fellow has got to figure out what is best for himTell me if I wanted to  if a person wanted to practice Buddhism to follow the Dhamma what should he doIm speaking hypothetically of courseHow does somebody become a BuddhistBHIKKHU Somebody becomes a Buddhist by following the teachings of the BuddhaCARP Like the Noble Eightfold PathBHIKKHU YesBut theres a brief saying that covers it all to abstain from all evil to cultivate the good and to purify the mind  this is the teaching of all the BuddhasCARP That sounds pretty goodCould you explain just a bitBHIKKHU To abstain from all evil means to refrain from all actions that cause harm to oneself or othersIt means to follow the Five Precepts to avoid killing stealing sexual misconduct lying and taking intoxicantsCARP Im afraid Ive been known to break a few of those preceptsDo you mean for instance that I shouldnt kill at allLike not stepping on these ants crawling all around hereBHIKKHU The precepts protect not only all animals they protect you as well because they keep you from doing actions which will coarsen your mind and cause you suffering later onCARP But suppose somebody just cant keep all these precepts perfectlyBHIKKHU The precepts are not commandmentsThe Buddha wasnt a god who laid down absolute rulesThe Buddha did however perfectly understand the world and he simply pointed out that when someone keeps the precepts he is acting according to Dhamma and building up protection and happiness for himself and other beingsThe closer we can live to the precepts the better it is for usCARP Keeping those precepts would certainly make you thinkNow how about doing goodBHIKKHU Avoiding evil is the first stepBut beyond that we have to act virtuously and generouslyA Buddhist is expected to demonstrate his kindness by helping his fellow beings by making an effort to have a positive effort on his societyHe should show the blessings of the Dhamma in his own conductCARP And what about purifying the mindBHIKKHU The practitioner restrains his unwholesome impulses by observing the precepts and he becomes a force for good through his own willAnd through it all he should strive to cleanse himself of the defilements of greed hatred and delusion and the ignorance that spawns themHe should move steadily at whatever pace is suitable for him toward deliverance from all suffering toward enlightenmentCARP What you describe is impressive reallyHow can an ordinary guy do such a thingIm not really a strong person I knowI am what I am mainly out of weakness I guessBHIKKHU MrCarp let me emphasize one thing especiallyThe Dhamma is the noble path for everyone weak or strong or in betweenDo what you can because every act of kindness or virtue or mindfulness takes you a step closer to deliverance from sorrowCARP Youre really serious about this arent youI wish I could be like that  serious confidentYou know the trouble is Im so restless I cant sit stillSo I go racing here and there all the timeMy mind wanders so I wander tooBHIKKHU This wandering is called samsara the cycle of birth and deathCARP Thats depressingBHIKKHU Indeed it isAnd thats why the Dhamma is such a reliefIt can free us from that cycleCARP Were all wanderers in a way arent weBHIKKHU YesYou and I and  and even that big red ant crawling up your legCARP YeowMrCarp jumps up and dances around wildly brushing at his pantsCARP OwGet offGet offThese things will biteBHIKKHU Easy now MrCarpIt dropped offCARP It didBHIKKHU It probably considered you an unsteady surfaceCARP I amI am an unsteady surfaceBhikkhu Tissa stands up smilingBHIKKHU And what will you do about thatCARP Well I dont knowSay listen Ive taken up enough of your timeThanks for explaining thingsId better get goingIm heading down to the beach to meet some friendsBHIKKHU I hope you have a safe driveCARP Oh I will I willIts a great car a beauty you can seeOh noNoDid you see that birdDid you see what that bird just did to my carBHIKKHU Yes birds will do thatCARP I just had it waxedYou know that makes me think  oh never mindThanks for your time Bhikkhu TissaSmiling to himself Bhikkhu Tissa takes his broom in hand againBHIKKHU Im glad you dropped by MrCarpCARP Yeah me too I guessBHIKKHU If youll excuse me Ill get back to my work nowCARP Oh sure sureSay you know if you need any help around the temple I wouldnt mind lending a hand sometimeBHIKKHU Thats kind of you but we manage pretty wellCARP No Im serious Id be glad to help anytimeReallyBHIKKHU Well then would you like to sweepThe sidewalk out there needs itCARP You mean nowBut youve only got one broomBHIKKHU Oh theres another one in the tool shed thereBhikkhu Tissa turns away and placidly resumes his sweepingMrCarp fidgets for a moment then goes and gets the other broom from the shedHe returns and waits awkwardly for instructions but gets noneFinally he begins sweeping the sidewalk casting puzzled looks at the monkAt one point he opens his mouth to say something but shuts it againBhikkhu Tissa is no longer paying attention to himWith a bemused expression MrCarp applies himself to sweeping the sidewalkLittle puffs of dust and leaves fly out to either side as the broom finds its rhythmA morning breeze has now sprung up swaying the trees above and sending flickers of light and dark sun and shade across the sweepersIt is noon on a winter dayBhikkhu Tissa has been a guest for a midday meal in the home of a married couple Leona and Ernest and now sits with them in the family room sipping a cup of teaThe windows of the room look out on a snowy landscapeA fire leaps and crackles in the fireplaceLEONA Was everything all right Bhikkhu TissaBHIKKHU TISSA Just fine thank youLEONA Of course you know Im referring to the food not the state of the universeBHIKKHU Yes I thought as muchIt was deliciousLEONA The universe is quite another question rightERNEST Ive got to apologize for my wife venerable sirShe never stops philosophizingLEONA Ernest my dear husband I am a woman made for grand ideasERNEST How well I knowAre you going to bombard this venerable monk with impossible questionsLEONA Oh I think he can take care of himselfAnyway Ernest you were the one who invited himYou must have something on that ohsoserious mind of yoursERNEST Well I did think it might be useful to have a private little discussion about matters of substanceLEONA Do you hear that VenerableMy husband talks like an office memoWhy then do I love himBHIKKHU Wise men refrain from trying to figure out loveERNEST As you know Ive been getting interested in Buddhism over the last year and sometimes it seems like it raises more questions than it answersBHIKKHU Oh yes that often happens at firstI think its a good signIf Buddhism is to have a real effect on somebody it must challenge them make them think of a hundred problems and puzzles they never considered beforeThe average person all too often takes things for granted has a careless habitual way of looking at the world and idly believes in unexamined conceptsBut Buddhism kicks the props entirely out from under such habits and reveals many unanswered questions which have been there all alongLEONA Are you referring to big stuff like the meaning of life and so onBHIKKHU No just basic laws and relationships that we need to grasp little by little until we can tackle the bigger questionsSometimes simple intellectual curiosity can start this processSometimes its a single provocative incidentERNEST Thats sort of what happened to me  an incidentIve been studying Buddhism for a while maybe with a little more interest than Leona hereLEONA There he goes bragging alreadyEARNESTand then just recently a question arose that has no end of implicationsIt has to do with a job offerLEONA Oh youre going into this are youVenerable Tissa weve talked this over fifty times and I think hes crazy  dear but crazyWell Ernest tell our guestMaybe hell straighten you outERNEST My field is chemistry Bhikkhu Tissa and Ive been in and out of academia and private industry over the yearsAt the moment Ive got a teaching position at the college that I like pretty well though it doesnt pay a lotRecently I got a very attractive job offer from the research division of a local chemical companyIt would mean a sizable increase in salary and a chance to do some creative work in my particular specialtyProfessionally it would be a big step up for me and as a matter of fact I know some of the people there and I think wed get along fineBut I cant make up my mind to take the jobAnd its all because of something you saidBHIKKHU What was thatERNEST You were talking about the Noble Eightfold Path and you mentioned Right LivelihoodYou said one should earn a living without harming othersNow does this apply to animalsBHIKKHU Yes it doesERNEST I thought soTheres the problemYou see this company has a research laboratory where they test the effects of their chemicals on animalsI wouldnt be directly connected with that department I wouldnt do any experiments on animals but still Id feel uncomfortably closeAnd that bothers meBHIKKHU What do they do to the animals thereERNEST Toxicity tests mostlyThat means they poison them  dogs cats rabbits rats and other animalsThey paint chemicals into the eyes of rabbits and see what concentrations will cause ulcers and blindnessThey forcefeed lethal compounds to groups of dogs and see how long it takes for half of them to dieBHIKKHU What happens to the other halfERNEST They might use them again in other testsMore often they kill them allThey sacrifice them to use the euphemismSometimes they do autopsiesLEONA Ernest please youre making me illERNEST I got a brief look at the lab when they were giving me a tour of the companyNow Ive known about such labs all my professional life but Ive never worked in one or really paid too much attentionBut after studying Buddhism a little I found that it really upset me to see the animals in cages and the instruments and so onThe guy who was giving me the tour must have noticed because he said Dont worry your office is far away you wont hear anything They make noise I saidAnd he said Oh not so much and sort of shruggedSince then I literally havent been able to sleepI keep imagining sitting in my office in another part of the building and hearing faint screams coming up through the ventilation ducts or somethingLEONA This is how hes been going on Bhikkhu TissaI tell him he doesnt have to have anything to do with animal experiments so why worry about itERNEST Thinking about the suffering of animals Bhikkhu Tissa I find my mind wandering out in wider and wider circles trying to make sense of a world that seems well pretty horrible in many respectsBut to begin with Id just like to have your opinion about whether or not I should take this jobBHIKKHU I wonder if you would really be satisfied if I said yes you should or no you shouldntSometimes Buddhist teaching has a specific answer to a moral question sometimes notIn either case what is important is that the student understand the underlying principles himself so that he doesnt just rely on faith in the teacherYou began your reflections with Right Livelihood so lets pick up thereRight Livelihood means earning a living in a harmless honest and inoffensive mannerThe Buddha advised his disciples specifically to refrain from dealing in arms in living beings in meat in intoxicants and in poisonsLEONA You know that covers a whole lot of occupations venerable sirI mean  making guns bombs all kinds of weaponsAnd as for living beings and meat well you are talking about huge industries thereAnd do you mean to say that dealing in all kinds of intoxicants is prohibited  beer wine and everythingAnd you could include a host of products under the name of poisons everything from nerve gas to bug sprayDo you really believe that everybody working in all of these industries is necessarily evilAre they all going to suffer some terrible karmaAre they going to hellERNEST Hold on Leona give Bhikkhu Tissa a chance to answerBHIKKHU The Buddha teaches that for our own wellbeing and the wellbeing of others we should avoid these classes of occupationsDealing in arms means just what you think  all kinds of weapons and instruments for killingDealing in living beings refers to animals of course and it also extends into areas like slavery or prostitution or the buying and selling of children or adults in one way or anotherMeat refers to the bodies of beings after they are killedAnd poisons are just as you say  all kinds of toxic products designed to killLEONA Those are immense categoriesBHIKKHU The categories are wide because the principle is wide not to engage in occupations which cause suffering destruction and deathNow you ask whether somebody who works in one of these occupations necessarily suffers misfortune as a resultLEONA Yes what about the perfectly honest owner of a liquor storeOr a sporting goods dealer who sells guns to huntersBHIKKHU Kamma or karma means volitional actions by body speech or mindKamma produces a result for the doer according to its nature as wholesome unwholesome or neutralActs of killing and harming for instance will sooner or later bring painful results for the doerLEONA Yes I understand thatThats the practical basis for Buddhist moral preceptsBut if one doesnt actually kill or harm or steal and so on then it seems that one could be engaged in almost any professionBHIKKHU To sell liquor or guns assuming one does so honestly may not in itself bring karmic misfortuneBut with the factor of Right Livelihood the Buddha recognizes the truth that habitual associations strongly influence our thoughts and deedsThere may be someone for instance who works in a slaughterhouse but whose job is not to kill animals but only to grade meat or operate a conveyor beltHe may not actually break the precepts or do evil but this is nevertheless wrong livelihood because his mind is likely to be harmed by the unwholesome atmosphereHe becomes accustomed to pain and deathHe regards the suffering of living beings as unimportantAnd thus he sinks further into ignorance and becomes easier prey for mental defilements which will definitely cause him sorrowThe principle is the same for intoxicants or weaponsDealing with these a person becomes indifferent to the delusion and destruction that alcohol and drugs cause or becomes callous about the killing or maiming of living beings by weaponsLEONA But these are popular goods and servicesThere will always be somebody to provide themBHIKKHU True Leona but it neednt be youLEONA Oh dear I can see what you think about Ernests job offerBHIKKHU Maybe you are guessing a little too quicklyLets analyze the question furtherYes to do painful experiments on animals in ones work to wound poison or torment them in any way is certainly a violation of Right LivelihoodERNEST You would condemn such an occupation thenBHIKKHU YesTo inflict pain on living beings  even for the supposed advantage of other living beings  is cruel and shortsightedERNEST Ah wellBHIKKHU But I would not exactly on that account advise you to reject your job offerERNEST I dont understandBHIKKHU I believe you said your job would not involve experimenting on animals and you would not be directly connected with itERNEST Strictly speaking noBHIKKHU Then strictly speaking you would not be violating the principle of Right LivelihoodAccording to Buddhism we are karmically responsible only for what we do intentionally and what we order others to doBeyond that its up to the individual to decideRight Livelihood is a flexible concept that can guide us regarding professions that were unknown in the Buddhas timeWe have to decide how close we can come to occupations that are definitely unwholesome without becoming contaminatedUltimately almost every profession is somehow related to every other so we would likely go crazy if we looked for a job that was not distantly theoretically harmful to somebodyTake a big company with many divisions or subsidiariesIs somebody in one department responsible for what somebody in another department doesIs the typist in New York implicated in the killing of cattle in TexasERNEST No thats unreasonable in my opinionBHIKKHU So it comes down to this you must be quite sure and satisfied in your own mind that you are not willingly doing any harmful deeds and that you are not encouraging or condoning the illtreatment of living beingsERNEST Oh Thats so hard to knowLEONA Well and good Venerable TissaBut dont we have to balance off harm and benefitIm not willing to concede that doing scientific experiments on animals is entirely evilThink of the lasting benefits to humanity that come of such experimentsERNEST Uh Leona at this lab theyre presently testing ovencleaner and hairsprayLEONA OhNot the most vital products I grant youERNEST And before you go on to cite penicillin or some other wonder drug I think its fair to note that medicines can be developed and tested without recourse to live animal subjectsWe now have sophisticated techniques of computermodeling and tissueculture that are accurate and cause no bloodshedThe fact that animals have been used so much in the past does not prove that discoveries would have been impossible without them only that that has been the habit or conditioned reflex of scientific researchersLEONA Maybe maybeBut Bhikkhu Tissa I want to get at the philosophical question hereIf some real benefit to humanity can come about through experimenting on animals even though they suffer then why not use themShouldnt we be concerned with the greater good that will resultBHIKKHU Im glad you raise the question of benefit Leona because this is where people often go astray when considering Right Livelihood or those troublesome five preceptsYes I agree that we should act for the greater good but  and here is a question that has sent seekers into the Sangha for centuries  how do we know what the greater good isLEONA Its whatever benefits the most people I guessBHIKKHU Only peopleWhat about animalsLEONA Well people are more importantBHIKKHU IndeedTo whomLEONA To peopleOkay I know it sounds selfservingBHIKKHU Leaving animals out for the moment suppose some action helps us but harms other peopleHow do you evaluate itWhere is the greater goodLEONA I guess you just have to chooseBHIKKHU On what basisLEONA Oh Bhikkhu Tissa I can see you wont be satisfied with anything less than a moral foundation  a religious foundationBHIKKHU Better to say a foundation on realityAnd the question remains How do we know the greater goodERNEST Through study of the Dhamma I would guessBHIKKHU Through study and practice of the DhammaThe Buddha teaches that we should do certain things and avoid other things but not on his word alone or the words of our teachers or out of respect for traditionWe are told to test these teachings in our own minds and in our own practice and then put our faith in the Dhamma as we see its effectsLEONA Yes I will say that is one of the attractive qualities of BuddhismBHIKKHU Let me ask you what do you think is the ultimate goal of BuddhismLEONA I know that to put an end to sufferingBut we cant really call that the greater good can weWe need something more specificBHIKKHU The end of suffering or Nibbana is what the entire Dhamma points toThe Buddha said that just as the great ocean has only one taste the taste of salt so the Dhamma has only one taste the taste of liberationIn the Buddhist view every specific goal  to use your word  must be connected to the ultimate goal to be worthwhileWe have been discussing Right LivelihoodNow Right Livelihood is not the ultimate goal but in a sense it recapitulates the wholeWe want to escape the suffering involved with making a living  the disagreements difficulties guilt anxiety and so onTo accomplish this we first of all have to place ourselves in conditions where such unpleasantness is least likely to arise that is in those occupations which are peaceful nonthreatening undisturbing to the conscience and compatible with high idealsSecond we see to it that we conduct our business or perform our job in a scrupulously fair and honest mannerThis frees us from the suffering inherent in trickery and cheatingIt helps us get along with our coworkers and the public at large and gives us the security of a good reputationFinally by getting our livelihood with energy and effort in a lawful honest and harmless manner we liberate ourselves from selfcontempt and the disgust of base moneygrubbing so that one large area of our lives is protected from the worst danger  the danger of our own misguided actionThus we enjoy the satisfaction of honorable workThis is purification of the mind with regard to livelihoodERNEST It seems that the Buddha overlooked nothing that might contribute to happinessBut still even if we behave in the manner you suggest we cant be sure that making a living is going to be free of problemsLEONA Yes everybody  good evil and average  complains about his or her jobEven in the most blameless work theres some sufferingBHIKKHU Very trueRight Livelihood has a beneficial rippleeffect we cannot see the end of but certainly it will not eradicate all sufferingThere are if you remember seven more factors of the Noble Eightfold Path to developLEONA Ah I might have knownThis Buddhism is nothing if not methodicalTheres a sort of  well a sort of beauty about the way it fits together  like an exquisite watchERNEST Or like the molecular structure of DNAAll three laughLEONA This business of getting through life is certainly complicatedWe started with rabbits in cages and now where are weERNEST One eighth of the way to enlightenmentLEONA Oh youBut lets get an answer from the venerable monkOkay I see the need for Right Livelihood in a practical sense but why do we need to link it with anything elseWhy buy the whole deal so to speakBHIKKHU I think Leona that youve forgotten what you just saidYou noted that even a perfectly blameless livelihood will not remove all sufferingNow how much more suffering is there in lifeLEONA Oh heaps and heapsBHIKKHU Are you willing to endure itAre you ready for itLEONA No not at all no categorically noBHIKKHU Do you think you can escape it simply by wishing toDo you think that suffering  disease old age loss grief and so on  will just pass you byLEONA No I dont think thatBHIKKHU Well do you believe you have any power in the matterLEONA MaybeI dont knowIm not sureBHIKKHU Buddhism teaches that we do have power to reduce and ultimately eliminate sufferingWhen somebody makes even a small effort to follow the basic precepts he reaps an immediate benefit in the form of a pacified mindGood qualities  peacebringing qualities  are strengthened and bad qualities are ever so slightly weakenedWhen somebody makes a really systematic and conscientious effort to avoid killing stealing lying sexual misconduct and taking intoxicants he fortifies himself furtherWhen he pursues the good by acting out of benevolence and compassion he stores up benefit for the futureThen when he tries to purify his mind as well as his deeds he is moving positively to the greater good  Nibbana deliverance the end of sorrowERNEST I dont doubt what you say venerable sir but with all due respect we are lay people living very much in the world with many responsibilities and burdensHow can we realistically concern ourselves with getting to NibbanaBHIKKHU Nibbana isnt a place to get toIts not even a state of mindThe Buddha called it simply the end of sufferingThis is a goal that should concern everybody regardless of his or her worldly stationThe Noble Eightfold Path is a transcendent way that leads out of the world to the inconceivable bliss of Nibbana but it is also consistent with an active life in the world along the wayI mean by this that the Dhamma protects us now in our daily problems and challenges and later in the kind of future our deeds will lead us toSome people when they hear the transcendent promise of the Dhamma are elatedOthers like you perhaps are a little worried thinking that they are not ready to ascend any spiritual summitsReally there is no cause for worryIf we apply ourselves to solving immediate problems as the Buddha teaches then higher goals will simply come into focus in their own timeWe need only remind ourselves that there lies ahead of us a greater good which is timeless steady and ultimately accessibleSimple moral restraint and deeds of charity and the practice of mindfulness in the household life cannot fail to build a foundation for wisdomERNEST I have an instinct that what you say is trueThats why Im trying to order my life at least to the extent of giving wisdom a chance to ariseBut Im not sureLife is often mysterious like a wandering in the darkBHIKKHU You are rightLife is very mysteriousBut in the Buddhist system even that mystery is a suitable theme for meditationFor instance look out the window hereFrom where we sit we cant see the ground only that blank gray sky and a few snowflakes drifting pastIf we didnt know better we might think those snowflakes just appear spontaneously in our field of view and whirl out of it again into some kind of oblivion without a reason uncaused absurdly appearing and disappearingLEONA That would be just delusion just ignoranceBHIKKHU But because we have some experience because we have at one time or another stuck our heads out the window we know that snow falls from the clouds overhead and it piles up in drifts on the ground beneathWe see where it comes from and where it goesIts the same with the larger questions of life investigation destroys ignoranceSomebody might keep moral precepts just out of fear or tradition or habit  and theres nothing really wrong with this its still a help and protectionBut sooner or later most people think Why am I really following these rulesWhere will they lead me If a monk or somebody tells them the purpose is to get rid of suffering then if theyre intelligent they want to find out for themselves how and whyLEONA Exactly exactlyBHIKKHU The Buddha discovered and made known the path to deliveranceNow its a sorry old world we live in but that path is still open friends it is still openERNEST Perhaps Leona and I are following it already even without being fully awareBut I would hate to think Bhikkhu Tissa that all the mystery must go out of lifeBHIKKHU Ignorance must go but mystery in the sense I think you mean comes even more alive in the objects of our experienceOur wonder at the infinite and ineffable is an intuition of Nibbana itselfLooking here through this plain glass window on emptiness  even though we have no illusions about where those snowflakes come from and where they go still we find it peaceful and uplifting to gaze out on those random crystalsERNEST Yes thats trueBut why should that beBhikkhu Tissa smiles says nothing gazes thoughtfully out the windowLEONA Perhaps because  if I might be so bold  because looking out in that dimensionless space we re reminded of our connections to infinite thingsI mean the flake that bumps against our windowpane here is connected to the clouds and the clouds to the whole atmosphere and the atmosphere to the space beyond with its matter and energy and vast laws of generation and destructionOne cant help feeling part of a cosmic drama so to speakERNEST Ah what a philosopher you are LeonaLEONA And what of itI think Venerable Tissa would approveThats what Buddhism teaches isnt itInvestigationBHIKKHU Yes and when we investigate we see connections and when we see connections we are motivated to act in certain waysERNEST But why act at allIsnt passive contemplation enoughBHIKKHU NoThe mindful observation of the world that the Buddha recommends reveals that intentional deeds have results for the doerWe are where we are  in fortune or misfortune peace or trouble  as a result of what we have done in the pastWhere we go in the future depends on what we do nowLEONA Are you talking about rebirthWell that seems to me like a rather weak motivation since rebirth is not at all apparent to meIt may very well be true but I mean to say that I just dont see it in front of me as a reality the same way I see other facts about mind and matter that Buddhism talks aboutIve read that sutta you referred to where the Buddha says we shouldnt accept any teaching until we see for ourselves that it is trueBHIKKHU I see you remember the first part of the Kalama Sutta but do you remember the second partLEONA The secondBHIKKHU After giving specific examples of wrong reasons for believing a teaching the Buddha goes on to lead the skeptical Kalamas into the DhammaHe asks them whether greed hate and delusion are wholesome or unwholesome and whether they lead to suffering or notThe Kalamas make the obvious answer that they are unwholesome and lead to sufferingIn response to further questions they agree that the absence of these defilements and the positive cultivation of morality lead to blessing and happiness in this lifeIf this is so the Buddha goes on to say then there are four consolations for whomever is devoted to virtueFirst if there is a future world and if good and bad deeds have results for the doer then the virtuous person knows himself safe and can expect a happy situationSecond if there is no rebirth and if deeds have no future effect then he at least lives happily in this world without worryThird if evil things happen to evildoers then he who does no evil is secure and free from harmFourth if no evil things happen to evildoers then he in any event will not meet with evil fortuneLEONA Thats well saidEven a hardened skeptic would have to admire that reasoningAnd if one goes that far one would have to admit that it would be wise to pay more attention to ones behavior and even set out on a more systematic path of spiritual practiceERNEST Such as the Noble Eightfold Path LeonaLEONA Why yes now that you mention itWe keep coming back to that dont weBHIKKHU Well we should come back to itBut I hope you understand that this path is a path of practice and selfdevelopment and mindful investigationIts not necessary at the outset to believe in rebirth or other difficult facets of the DhammaWe need only bear these teachings in mind and watch as the evidence accumulates in our own experienceLEONA Thats fair thats certainly fairId say a certain amount has accumulated alreadyI can see that good and bad deed have effects here in this present life and if those effects go beyond say to a future birth well Im openminded about the matterTell me this pleaseThese connections we were speaking of  do they exist between animals and human beingsCan human beings be reborn as animals and vice versaBHIKKHU We must first note that according to Buddhism there is no self or soul that is literally born again but rather a chain of causes or a stream of life that springs up now here now there according to conditionsBut in ordinary conventional language we can certainly say that a human being can be reborn as an animal or vice versaIt all depends on the individuals kamma his or her accumulated deedsLEONA Ah here we have the core of your opposition to cruelty to animalsWe are related to themWe may even become themBHIKKHU In the Buddhist view all sentient life is relatedThe differentiations are temporary fluctuating and merely provisionalCountless living beings go wandering through the endless cycles of samsara being born high or low in this world or that with much suffering or little sufferingERNEST Hence the great Buddhist emphasis on compassionYes I seeWe are all part of an organic wholeBHIKKHU Yes all sentient life is organic and interrelated but you should not make the common romantic mistake of thinking that this whole is goodSamsara is to one degree or another suffering throughout and we beings trapped in samsara are sufferingERNEST All the more reason for compassion thenBHIKKHU Quite soAnd here is a point of Dhamma I want to emphasize especiallyOnes own ultimate welfare and the welfare of other beings are perfectly harmoniousThe life of moral restraint is a life of service to others because it protects others soothes them and inspires them to similar effortWhen we follow the path and strive to purify our minds we set incalculable reverberations going in the hearts of other beingsNever doubt that the Dhamma conduces to the greater good even when circumstances seem to push us toward shabby expediencyThe law of kamma sees to it that in the long run deeds work out according to their nature so we should always take the wide view always strive for detachment in our reflections so that we can make wise choicesERNEST If one lives as you suggest being diligent in practicing Dhamma could one be reborn in a heavenly world a world of blissBHIKKHU Yes thats possibleERNEST Wouldnt unadulterated bliss be as good as NibbanaWouldnt that be the end of sufferingBHIKKHU No the socalled heavenly worlds are not perfect refuges for two reasonsFirst all worldly bliss is adulteratedThere is suffering in even the highest realmsIt is very fine and attenuated but it existsIn the ultimate sense pleasure itself is suffering a disease a kind of irritation to the mind that deprives it of peaceThe second reason is that even though life in those planes is said to be very pleasant and long it is still impermanent it is going to come to an end it cannot be relied upon forever hence there is anxiety and uncertainty even for beings living thereLEONA A flawed heavenHow gloomyBHIKKHU Actually this human world is considered an especially fortunate place to be bornThe beings in higher realms are so drenched with pleasure that they have little inducement to strive for deliveranceAnd the animals and beings in the unhappy lower planes are too unintelligent or too miserable to make spiritual progressThis human world with its puzzling mixture of pleasure and pain often makes people thinkLEONA Indeed it does thatBHIKKHU We really need not speculate about other planes of life when our own provokes us to search for liberationAnd now of course though the world is full of misery still we have the priceless treasure of the Dhamma which the Buddha discovered and made known to cure suffering and free beings from the wheel of birth and deathERNEST Bhikkhu Tissa it seems the Dhamma is a very demanding teachingBHIKKHU And we are demanding people are we notWe demand pleasure and security and comfort  and we demand them to be permanentThis is impossible of course because the universe is not under our controlSo we sufferAnd then we demand an end to suffering preferably through no exertion of our ownWe want an escape from old age and illness and death but as the Buddha says this cannot be got by mere wanting and not to get what one desires that is suffering tooERNEST True trueWe are indeed contrary creaturesI see the justice of what you say  we have to make an effort if we really want to accomplish anythingBut the question I ask myself is how much do I want to accomplishBHIKKHU Nobody can answer that question but youERNEST Considering my limitations I sometimes wonder if I couldnt sort of stop halfway as it were  just practice basic morality and try to live a modest life and keep out of troubleBHIKKHU The way of Dhamma is a way that goes against the stream of the world and the worlds desiresIf you cease to struggle against the current do you think you will just remain stationaryERNEST Well no considering the nature of my mindLEONA Going with the flow just wont make it huhBHIKKHU Going with the flow means succumbing to craving and clinging which pull us down to sufferingIt is said that the Dhamma protects the DhammafarerThis means that one who resists craving and clinging who makes an effort against the worldly stream becomes stronger by that very effort just as when we exercise a muscle we strengthen itBy overcoming even small problems with mindfulness and detachment we find ourselves increasingly able  and willing  to surmount spiritual obstaclesI think that if you try to apply the Dhamma in life you will quickly notice within yourself the growth of confidenceERNEST Theres something in thatI do feel some confidence  just a little bitBHIKKHU The Buddha said that a follower should examine his teaching in the way that a goldsmith analyzes gold  carefully inspecting refining testing it before concluding that it is realSo if you have undertaken to practice the Dhamma even a little then please reflect on the result of that practice and see how you feel about it see whether you feel cheered and inspired to go a little furtherERNEST Here we are  Leona and I  offering a meal to a monk and listening to him preach  something I would have thought ridiculous a year agoI guess that says somethingLEONA To me Bhikkhu Tissa the Dhamma is appealing because it seems to satisfy both the intellect and the emotionsIve never been a religious person mainly because I couldnt believe passionately in the supernaturalOn the other hand the materialistic philosophies leave me cold because they have no understanding of the mind and what for lack of a better word I will call the transcendentalThey are earthbound and infinitely depressingThen there is the swarm of cults and quasireligions which are both hysterical and intellectually incoherentWhewIts enough to make me an absolute agnosticExcept agnosticism is itself a blind beliefNow Ive studied the Dhamma a little bit and while I dont understand everything I find it well refreshingAs I said it fits together intellectually and it gives scope to the desire for transcendence the impulse to become purer or wiser than we now areJust this morning before you came I read a passage in one of Ernests books that summarized the Dhamma as clear visible leading onward  something succinct like thatBHIKKHU Well expounded is the Dhamma by the Exalted One directly visible immediately effective calling one to come and see leading onward to be personally realized by the wiseLEONA Thats itAs clear a statement as Ive heardNow if it can fulfill that promiseBHIKKHU The truths of the Dhamma are for us to examine and confirmWe have to remove the obstructions to our understanding by practicing morality and training ourselves in the art of concentrationWhen the conscience is clear and the mind can hold steady on the objects of attention then wisdom arises of its own natureWe dont create itERNEST But wisdom is not the end is itBHIKKHU NoWisdom is the sword we use to cut off defilements to clear a path for ourselves out of the jungle and into the open airERNEST Buddhism grants us immense freedom of action doesnt itLEONA And immense responsibility it seemsIf all planes of existence are somehow tied to suffering then probably we should use that freedom of action to get freedom of beingOr I might say if it is possible to escape suffering and gain enlightenment then if we dont try our misery would be really our own faultERNEST What a predicamentBhikkhu Tissa you were right when you said that Buddhism challenges usBHIKKHU The problem of existence and its solution are both contained within the Four Noble TruthsThe truth of the omnipresence of suffering in samsara and the truth of its arising out of craving point out our plightThe truth of the cessation of suffering and the truth of the way to accomplish that point out the escape from this plightSo you see there is darkness and light  the darkness of pain and ignorance and confusion and the light of understanding and deliveranceLife for the intelligent person should be a journey from dark to lightERNEST But how long and how fastBHIKKHU As long as it takes and as fast as you wishERNEST Well its a little frightening but its exhilarating tooIn time I might actually be able to make sense out of the universeAlready I feel a certain tension between my miserable old habits of mind and my urge to pursue the Dhamma furtherIt is sort of dazzling to think that I can walk down the street like anybody else but still be practicing mindfulness or still be reflecting on impermanence suffering and nonselfI wonder if I shouldnt be living in a cave or a jungleBHIKKHU Youd still be dealing with the same mind in a cave ErnestBetter to investigate in your own house  I mean this very body and mindThe world is to be found there and liberation from the worldArising and passing away suffering and the empty flickering personality can be seen and examined withinWisdom isnt a treasure we can prospect for in the Himalayas it appears only when conditions are right for it when the mind is settled not distractedLEONA When I read the words of the Buddha I get a feeling of immense wisdom and yet he doesnt answer some questions about the origin of the universe about what happens to an enlightened person after death and so onNow Im sure he had good reasons for not answering what might be extraneous questions but stillBHIKKHU Never forget Leona that the Buddha was not out to build a reputation for himself or to be a human computer spewing information or to dazzle the ignorant with amazing secretsHe was out to cure sufferingHe was a supreme genius but he never lost sight of his practical purpose to teach suffering and the way to the ending of sufferingHe taught what was necessaryWhatever else he may have known it is useless to speculate aboutOnce when the Buddha was seated in a forest with a company of monks he took up a handful of leaves from the ground and showed them to the monksHe asked them which were more numerous the leaves in his hand or the leaves in the entire forestThe monks reasonably noted that the leaves in his hand were very few compared to those in the entire forestThe Buddha then said that those in his hand were as the truths he had revealed to them and those in the whole forest were as the truths he knew but had not revealedLEONA And why hadnt he revealed themBHIKKHU Because the Buddha said they were not useful they did not lead to dispassion to tranquility to higher knowledge to enlightenmentRemember the Buddha had no need to teach at allHe had attained enlightenment he was free he had vanquished sufferingThere was nothing further he needed to doYet he did act he did exert himselfWhySimply because of his allembracing compassionHe taught his followers everything they needed to know about suffering and how to conquer it themselvesHe held back nothing of valueBefore he died he declared that as a teacher he had never had a closed fist He gave unstintingly of the Dhamma that pointed to liberation entrusting it to his followers who have preserved it and honored it and offered it as the supreme refuge for a weary world even to this very dayERNEST Thats an encouraging thoughtIf the Buddha had no personal need to teach anything to anybody yet did teach for the rest of his life then surely he thought that the teaching would be effective that his followers even though they werent Buddhas could still attain enlightenment through their own effortsBHIKKHU Yes indeedThe Buddha is sometimes called the great physician for the ills of the worldHe doesnt cure by magic or layingon of hands or divine powerHe prescribes for us the medicine of the Dhamma and instructs us in how to use itLEONA But the patients have to be willing dont theyBHIKKHU Oh yesSome people complain about the emphasis on suffering in Buddhism they prefer not to think about itThey suffer they know they suffer but they dont realize that suffering is a deep and terrible spiritual diseaseOnly when they take a close look at their situation do they fell moved to do something about itIts like a man who smells smoke in his houseIf hes intelligent he investigates and sees that his house is on fireRather than waiting to be burned he looks around for an escape and makes use of it promptly  he climbs out a window and slides down the drainpipeWhat the Buddha teaches us first of all is that our house is on fire  on fire with greed with hate with delusion burning with sickness old age death lamentation despairERNEST The truth of suffering in shortBHIKKHU And then the Buddha points out the reasons for this suffering and what can be done about it and how there might be ease and relief for us instead of anxiety and painAnd more than this the Buddha shows how our lives may become calmer wiser and purer and how we may in fact achieve what we hardly can imagine enlightenment a radiant and unassailable securityLEONA Its a shame we are not living in the time of the Buddha himselfBHIKKHU Ah but we are LeonaWe areThe Buddha says that whoever sees the Dhamma sees the BuddhaAnd the Dhamma is not only written in books it is written in the elements of the world as wellLEONA What do you meanBHIKKHU The three characteristics of existence  impermanence suffering and nonself  spring up everywhere for the benefit of the diligent meditatorLook at the flames there in the fireplace snapping and curling and flickering in front of our eyesLEONA Ah impermanence yes of courseBHIKKHU Yes both an instance and an emblem of the changing nature of realityERNEST Transience and changeBHIKKHU And more than thatDont you see in those wavering sheets of fire and those sputtering little flames something futile and wearyThey leap up they fall back they smolder and failERNEST An incompleteness a restlessnessYou might call it sufferingBHIKKHU And within that chemical reaction we call fire within that shifting light and heat whats really going onIs the fire one stable thing and the log anotherDoes the wood stay the same while the fire just happens to itLEONA No theyre both changing theres only changeThe wood is always changing to something elseYou could say its not being its only becomingThereforeERNEST Therefore its not a selfJust nonselfWell Bhikkhu Tissa this is somethingEven my own fireplace can instruct me the DhammaBHIKKHU And why stop thereOut the window there we can see that its snowing a little harderThereSee that swirl of windLook at the flakes spinning against the graynessWhat do they suggest to youLEONA ChangeImpermanenceAnd the theres the sadness of it  I dont know why its just the wandering the endless uneaseWe could call it suffering sureAnd as before in that change in that process I dont see any persisting elementNo selfJust like the fireBHIKKHU Just like the fireAnd yet the one is blazing hot and the other is icy coldStill the same truths are manifest in bothDo you see the principle I am getting atLEONA I think I doAll the world is food for contemplationBHIKKHU And above all do not neglect your own body and mindThats where craving clings the tightest thats where ignorance residesLEONA You are assuming of course that Ill keep investigating the DhammaBHIKKHU I am assuming itLEONA Well youre right I guessCant quit nowIll keep going a little furtherERNEST Going toward what LeonaLEONA Why Lets call it the greater good shall weERNEST Why notLEONA It seems its possible to live deliberately and if so I think one ought to live for the benefit of oneself and othersERNEST And others yesSpeaking of thatUh Leona talking to this venerable monk has made me sure that I dont want to  I mean I couldnt possibly accept that job at the chemical companyLEONA Oh ErnestAs for the jobERNEST No really you have to see  I just wouldnt feelLEONA Peace husband of mineThere is no disputeERNEST Say whatLEONA Under no circumstances can you accept that jobYou are happy where you areYou dont want to be even distantly connected to the suffering of animalsI understand that nowI respect itVenerable Tissa is skillful I think in nudging us in the direction of the DhammaERNEST But you were so in favor of the jobLEONA Ah wellImpermanenceERNEST Youre a remarkable woman LeonaLEONA It depends on whos doing the remarkingBut enoughLets not weary this tolerant monk any more today all rightLook Ernest the snow is coming down harderMaybe you had better drive Venerable Tissa homeERNEST You dont have a home do you Bhikkhu TissaJust a monasteryBHIKKHU Theres no real home for any of us short of NibbanaBut yes perhaps its time to goERNEST Thank you for your timeBHIKKHU And thank you for your foodLEONA You are the one whos given real food Bhikkhu TissaERNEST We appreciate your teachingBHIKKHU Im glad you doBut the fire teaches tooAnd the snowAnd your own heartsERNEST Shall we go thenThey riseBhikkhu Tissa wrapped up in his robes follows Ernest out the door into the sudden cold and light of the snowy dayLeona stands on the doorstep and watches them go down to the carThe wind gusts and the snow falls harder blurring the landscape and the vanishing figuresAt the car Bhikkhu Tissa turns smiles and wavesOr does he waveShe is not sureMaybe he has pointed at the chaos of snowflakes or the invisible clouds or the ghostly horizon of the rooftopsThen the car rolls awayLeona stands gazing after for a momentThe world

essays Living As A Buddhist awaits publication in the United StatesBhikkhu Nyanasobhano presently resides at Jetavana Vihara in Washington DCThe Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creedsFounded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topicsIts publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddhas discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practiceThese works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first aroseIn its earliest phase as represented by the four main collections of the Sutta Pitaka the focal concern of Buddhism was the attainment of nibbaana by the practice of the Noble Eightfold PathIn these collections the Buddha teaches his doctrine as a direct path to deliverance and perhaps no feature of the presentation is so striking as the urgency he enjoins on his disciples in bringing their spiritual work to completion by reaching the final goalJust as a man who discovers his turban to be in flames would immediately seek to extinguish it so should the earnest disciple strive to extinguish the flames of craving in order to reach the state of security the consummate peace of nibbaanaThe oldest suttas however already mention three types of individuals who attain to the consummate state a sammaasambuddha or perfectly enlightened Buddha who realizes the goal without the aid of a teacher and teaches the Dhamma to others founding a dispensation a paccekabuddha or solitary enlightened one who achieves realization unaided but does not establish a dispensation and a disciple arahat who realizes the goal through the instruction of a supreme Buddha and then teaches others according to his inclination and capacityWith the passage of time quite possibly due to a decline in practice and an increasing rarity of higher attainments these three types came to be viewed as three alternative ideals toward which a disciple could aspire in the hope of some distant future attainmentAll were identical in their realization of nibbaana but each was seen to stand for a distinct aspect of the enlightened personality and to presuppose a distinct yaana a vehicle or spiritual career leading to its actualizationFor the Theravaada the more conservative of the ancient schools the emphasis was always placed on the ideal prescribed in the Paali suttas the attainment of arahatship by following the instructions of the historical Buddha the other ideals remained in the background acknowledged but not especially attended toOther early schools such as the Sarvaastivaada and the Mahaasanghika while upholding the primacy of the disciples course and the arahat ideal also gave consideration to the other ideals as possible goals for individuals inclined to pursue themThus they came to admit a doctrine of three yaanas or vehicles to deliverance all valid but steeply graded in difficulty and accessibilityWithin all the early schools thinkers and poets alike attempted to fill in the background history to the three enlightened persons composing stories of their past lives in which they prepared the foundations for their future achievementsSince it was the figure of the Buddha as the founder of the Dispensation who commanded the greatest awe and veneration gradually a literature began to emerge depicting the evolution of the bodhisattva or Buddhatobe along the arduous path of his developmentIn this way the figure of the bodhisattva the aspirant to Buddhahood came to claim an increasingly prominent place in the popular Buddhist religious lifeThe culmination of these innovations was the appearance in about the first century BC of the Mahaayaana the selfstyled Great Vehicle which proclaimed that of the three vehicles to enlightenment the bodhisattvavehicle was alone ultimate the other two being only expedients devised by the Buddha to lead his less competent disciples to perfect Buddhahood which they held to be the only valid spiritual idealThrough its conservative bent and relative insulation from the other schools the Theravaada managed to resist the metamorphic changes taking place elsewhere in the Buddhist world preserving the teachings as compiled at the early councils without radical alterations of their doctrinal frameworkNevertheless in this school as well from a period even preceding the rise of the Mahaayaana the figure of the bodhisattva began to make inroads into both its literature and spiritual atmosphereTwo elements in the early teaching seem to have provided the germs for this developmentOne was the fact that the Buddha had used the word bodhisattva to refer to himself in the period preceding his enlightenment pushing its scope as far back as his existence in the Tusita heaven before his final descent to earthThe second was the recognition of the multiplicity of Buddhas which showed the Sakyan Gotama to be not a unique figure in the cosmic genealogy but only the most recent member of a series of Buddhas each of whom attains enlightenment founds a dispensation and liberates a multitude of beings from the bondage of samsaaric sufferingThe Diigha Nikaaya mentions by name the six most recent predecessors of the Buddha Gotama and predicts as well the advent of Metteyya the Buddha of the future who will rekindle the lamp of the true Dhamma after it is extinguished in the dark ages that lie aheadThese two features jointly implied the existence of germinal Buddhas or bodhisattvas toiling to perfect themselves through countless lives in order to reach the summit of supreme enlightenmentThe trials and triumphs of the being who became our own Buddha were recorded in the Jaataka tales relating the bodhisattvas conduct in his previous birthsJust when and how the bodhisattva entered upon this course is told in the Buddhavamsa a late addition to the Sutta Pitaka in a story which has become the paradigm for all subsequent developments of the bodhisattva idealAccording to this story incalculable aeons ago in the far distant past our bodhisattva made an aspiration at the feet of the Buddha Diipankara the twentyfourth Buddha of antiquity in which he renounced the right to enter nibbaana then open to him in order that he might become a Buddha in the future and provide salvation for the host of gods and humansHe then received a prediction from the Buddha confirming his future success went off into solitude and reflected on the qualities that had to be perfected to fulfill his goalThese the ten paaramiis became the standard constituents of the bodhisattvas practice the requisites of enlightenment of our present treatiseBut though the existence of a bodhisattva career was thus acknowledged by the Theravaada the dominant attitude prevailed among the exponents of the school that this path was reserved only for the very rare and exceptional individualSince it was not recommended in the oldest authentic records of the Buddhas teaching those who professed to follow the Buddha were advised to comply with the instructions contained in these documents and aim at the attainment of nibbaana by the practice of the Noble Eightfold PathThus the bulk of literature in the Paali school was devoted to explaining the details of this path and its doctrinal ramifications while the practice of the paaramiis was treated only in broad and general termsAs time passed however perhaps partly through the influence of the Mahaayaana the bodhisattva ideal must have come to acquire an increasing appeal for the minds of the Buddhist populace and the need became felt for a work explaining in a practical manner the factors and phases of the paaramitaa path without deviating from the established doctrinal position of the TheravaadaWorks expounding the bodhisattva career abounded in the Mahaayaana schools since this was their axial concern but a comparable work was lacking in Theravaada circlesTo meet this need apparently AAcariya Dhammapaala composed his Treatise on the Paaramiis which is found in at least two places in the Paali exegetical literature in a complete version in the Cariyaapitaka Atthakathaa and in an abridged version in thetiikaa or subcommentary to the Brahmajaala SuttaThe work introduces itself as a treatise composed for clansmen following the suttas who are zealously engaged in the practice of the vehicle to great enlightenment in order to improve their skillfulness in accumulating the requisites of enlightenment Followers of the suttas are specified probably because those who aspired to follow the bodhisattva course had to work selectively from various suttas to determine the practices appropriate for their aim as the text itself illustrates in filling out its materialThe mention of the vehicle to great enlightenment does not indicate the historical Mahaayaana but signifies rather the greatness of the bodhisattva career by reason of the loftiness of its goal and its capacity to provide for the emancipation of a great number of beingsThe requisites of enlightenment are the paaramiis themselves the main topic of the treatiseThe word paaramii derives from parama supreme and thus suggests the eminence of the qualities which must be fulfilled by a bodhisattva in the long course of his spiritual developmentBut the cognate paaramitaa the word preferred by the Mahaayaana texts and also used by Paali writers is sometimes explained as paaram  ita gone to the beyond thereby indicating the transcendental direction of these qualitiesThe list of paaramiis in the Paali tradition differs somewhat from the more familiar list given in Sanskrit works which probably antedates the Mahaayaana and provided a ready set of categories for its useOur author shows that the two lists can be correlated in section xii and the coincidence of a number of items points to a central core already forming before the two traditions went their separate waysThe six paaramiis of the Sanskrit heritage are giving virtue patience energy meditation and wisdomLater Mahaayaana texts add four more  resolution skillful means power and knowledge  in order to coordinate on a onetoone basis the list of perfections with the account of the ten stages of the bodhisattvas ascent to BuddhahoodThe Paali works including those composed before the rise of Mahaayaana give a different though partly overlapping list of ten giving virtue renunciation wisdom energy patience truthfulness determination lovingkindness and equanimityUnlike the Mahaayaana the Theravaada never developed a theory of stages though such may be implicit in the grading of the paaramiis into three degrees as basic intermediate and ultimateThe treatise draws upon various sources for its material both Theravaada and Mahaayaana and thus represents perhaps a unique instance of a classical style Theravaada work consciously borrowing from its northern cousin in matters of philosophical doctrine however the work never deviates from the Theravaada perspectiveThe set of ten paaramiis itself comes from the Buddhavamsa as does the discussion of the great aspiration with its eight qualificationsAll of this had become part of the standard Theravaada tradition by the time the work was composed and was easily absorbedOther Paali sources  the suttas Jaatakas later canonical works the Visuddhimagga etc have all contributed to the overall composition of the treatiseThe basic methodology of the commentaries is evident in the explication of the ten paaramiis by way of the fourfold defining device of characteristic function manifestation and proximate causeThe heritage of the oral traditions of various teachers in later Paali scholasticism is seen in the various views expressed on the three grades of practice for each paaramii on the correlation of the four foundations with the different stages of the bodhisattvas career and on the classification of time required for the completion of the paaramiisPerhaps the influence of another early school the Sarvaastivaada lies behind the dyadic treatment of the six paaramiitasThe main Mahaayaana work utilized by the author is the Bodhisattvabhuumi the fifteenth chapter of the Yogaacaarabhuumi a voluminous text of the Yogaacaara school ascribed to Maitreyanaatha the teacher of AsangaThe Bodhisattvabhuumi has contributed to the sections on the practice of the paaramiis particularly the first on the four shackles to giving and on the special accomplishments resulting from the paaramiisThe originals however have all been divested of their specifically Mahaayaana features to make them fully compatible with the Theravaada perspectiveMahaayaana influence may further be discernible in the emphasis on compassion and skillful means in the vows to benefit all beings in the statement that the bodhisattva causes beings to enter and reach maturity in the three vehicles etcOn points of doctrine as we mentioned the work remains well within the bounds of Theravaada orthodoxyIts section on the perfection of wisdom has nothing more in common with the Prajnaapaaramitaa literature than the core of Buddhist doctrine shared by all schoolsThere is nothing about the identity of nibbaana and samsaara the triple body of the Buddha the suchness and sameness of all dhammas mindonly the provisional nature of the disciple and paccekabuddha vehicles or any of the other ideas distinctive of the MahaayaanaEven the mention of emptiness is restricted to the absence of a self or egoentity and is not carried through to the radical ontology of the Mahaayaana suutrasThe discussion of wisdom draws entirely upon the Paali suttas and the Visuddhimagga only with the stipulation that the bodhisattva must balance wisdom with compassion and skillful means and must postpone his entrance upon the supramundane path until his requisites of enlightenment are fully matureIt should be noted that in established Theravaada tradition the paaramiis are not regarded as a discipline peculiar to candidates for Buddhahood alone but as practices which must be fulfilled by all aspirants to enlightenment and deliverance whether as Buddhas paccekabuddhas or disciplesWhat distinguishes the supreme bodhisattva from aspirants in the other two vehicles is the degree to which the paaramiis must be cultivated and the length of time they must be pursuedBut the qualities themselves are universal requisites for deliverance which all must fulfill to at least a minimal degree to merit the fruits of the liberating pathThe present translation has been based on the version in the Cariyaapitaka Atthakathaa in the Burmesescript Sixth Council editionThis has been abridged in places in deference to the size limits of a Wheel bookletFor a translation of the complete text the reader is directed to my translation of the Brahmajaala Sutta and its commentaries The Discourse on the AllEmbracing Net of Views Part IV Bhikkhu BodhiWe now undertake a detailed explanation of the paaramiis for clansmen following the suttas who are zealously engaged in the practice of the vehicle to great enlightenment in order to improve their skillfulness in accumulating the requisites for enlightenmentThis is the schedule of the questions What are the paaramiisIn what sense are they called paaramiisHow many are thereWhat is their sequenceWhat are their characteristics functions manifestations and proximate causesWhat is their conditionWhat is their defilementWhat is their cleansingWhat are their oppositesHow are they to be practicedHow are they analyzedHow are they synthesizedBy what means are they accomplishedHow much time is required to accomplish themWhat benefits do they bringWhat is their fruitThe answers followThe paaramiis are the noble qualities such as giving etc accompanied by compassion and skillful means and untainted by craving conceit and viewsThe bodhisattvas the great beings are supreme since they are the highest of beings by reason of their distinguished qualities such as giving virtue etcThe paaramiis  the activities of giving etc are their character or their conductOr else he excels thus he is supremeThe bodhisattva is the fulfiller and guardian of the noble qualities such as giving etc that which belongs to the supreme  the character or conduct of the one who is supreme  is a paaramii ie the activities of giving etcIn brief there are tenThese have come down in the texts in their specific characterAs it is saidHow many qualities are there Lord issuing in BuddhahoodThere are Saariputta ten qualities issuing in BuddhahoodWhat are the tenGiving Saariputta is a quality issuing in BuddhahoodVirtue renunciation wisdom energy patience truthfulness determination lovingkindness and equanimity are qualities issuing in BuddhahoodBut some say there are sixThis is said by way of their synthesis which we will explain belowHere sequence means sequence of teachingThis sequence is rooted in the order in which the paaramiis are initially undertaken which in turn is rooted in the order in which they are investigatedThe quality which is investigated and undertaken at the beginning is taught firstTherein giving is stated first for giving assists virtue and is easy to practiceGiving accompanied by virtue is abundantly fruitful and beneficial so virtue is stated immediately after givingVirtue accompanied by renunciation renunciation by wisdom wisdom by energy energy by patience patience by truthfulness truthfulness by determination determination by lovingkindness and lovingkindness accompanied by equanimity is abundantly fruitful and beneficial thus equanimity is stated immediately after lovingkindnessEquanimity is accompanied by compassion and compassion by equanimityHow can the bodhisattvas the great compassionate ones look upon living beings with equanimity Some teachers say Sometimes they show equanimity toward living beings when it is necessary to do so But others say They do not show equanimity toward living beings but toward the offensive actions performed by beingsAnother method may be givenGiving is stated at the beginning because it is common to all beings since even ordinary people practice giving because it is the least fruitful and because it is the easiest to practiceVirtue is stated immediately after giving because virtue purifies both the donor and the recipient to show that while giving benefits others virtue prevents the affliction of others in order to state a factor of abstinence immediately after a factor of positive activity and in order to show the cause for the achievement of a favorable state of future existence right after the cause for the achievement of wealthRenunciation is mentioned immediately after virtue because renunciation perfects the achievement of virtue in order to list good conduct of mind immediately after good conduct of body and speech because meditation succeeds easily for one who has purified his virtue in order to show that the purification of ones end through the abandoning of the offensive mental defilements follows the purification of ones means by the abandoning of offensive actions and to state the abandoning of mental obsessions immediately after the abandoning of bodily and verbal transgressionsWisdom is mentioned immediately after renunciation because renunciation is perfected and purified by wisdom to show that there is no wisdom in the absence of meditation since concentration is the proximate cause of wisdom and wisdom the manifestation of concentration in order to list the causal basis for equanimity immediately after the causal basis for serenity and to show that skillful means in working for the welfare of others springs from meditation directed to their welfareEnergy is stated immediately after wisdom because the function of wisdom is perfected by the arousing of energy to show the miraculous work the bodhisattva undertakes for the welfare of beings after he has reached reflective acquiescence in their emptiness to state the causal basis for exertion right after the basis for equanimity and to state the arousing of energy right after the activity of careful consideration according to the statement The activity of those who have carefully considered brings excellent resultsPatience is mentioned immediately after energy because patience is perfected by energy as it is said The energetic man by arousing his energy overcomes the suffering imposed by beings and formations because patience is an adornment of energy as it is said The patience of the energetic man shines with splendor in order to state the causal basis for serenity immediately after the basis for exertion for restlessness due to excessive activity is abandoned through reflective acquiescence in the Dhamma in order to show the perseverance of the man of energy since one who is patient and free from restlessness perseveres in his work in order to show the absence of craving for rewards in a bodhisattva diligently engaged in activity for the welfare of others for there is no craving when he reflects on the Dhamma in accordance with actuality and to show that the bodhisattva must patiently endure the suffering created by others even when he is working to the utmost for their welfareTruthfulness is stated immediately after patience because the determination to practice patience continues long through truthfulness having first mentioned the patient endurance of wrongs inflicted by others to mention next fidelity to ones word to render them help in order to show that a bodhisattva who through patience does not vacillate in the face of abuse through truthful speech does not relinquish and to show the truthfulness of the knowledge developed through reflective acquiescence in the emptiness of beingsDetermination is stated immediately after truthfulness because truthfulness is perfected by determination since abstinence becomes perfect in one whose determination is unshakeable having first shown nondeception in speech to show next unshakeable commitment to ones word for a bodhisattva devoted to truth proceeds to fulfill his vows of giving etc without wavering and to show right after the veracity of knowledge the complete accumulation of the requisites of enlightenment for one who knows things as they really are determines upon the requisites of enlightenment and brings them to completion by refusing to vacillate in the face of their oppositesLovingkindness is mentioned immediately after determination because lovingkindness perfects the determination to undertake activity for the welfare of others in order to list the work of actually providing for the welfare of others right after stating the determination to do so for one determined upon the requisites of enlightenment abides in lovingkindness and because the undertaking proceeds imperturbably only when determination is unshakeableEquanimity is mentioned immediately after lovingkindness because equanimity purifies lovingkindness in order to show the indifference one must maintain toward the wrongs inflicted by others when one is providing for their welfare having mentioned the development of lovingkindness to state next the development of the quality which evolves from it and to show the bodhisattvas wonderful virtue of remaining impartial even toward those who wish him wellThus the sequence of the paaramiis should be understood as explainedFirstly all the paaramiis without exception have as their characteristic the benefiting of others as their function the rendering of help to others or not vacillating as their manifestation the wish for the welfare of others or Buddhahood and as their proximate cause great compassion or compassion and skillful meansTaken separately the perfection of giving is the volition of relinquishing oneself and ones belongings accompanied by compassion and skillful meansThe perfection of virtue is good conduct of body and speech accompanied by compassion and skillful means in denotation it is the abstinence from what should not be done the volition to do what should be done etcThe perfection of renunciation is the act of consciousness which occurs renouncing sense pleasures and existence preceded by the perception of their inherent unsatisfactoriness and accompanied by compassion and skillful meansThe perfection of wisdom is the comprehension of the general and particular characteristics of dhammas accompanied by compassion and skillful meansThe perfection of energy is bodily and mental work for the welfare of others accompanied by compassion and skillful meansThe perfection of patience is the endurance of harm imposed by beings and formations or the act of consciousness occurring in such a mode predominated by nonaversion and accompanied by compassion and skillful meansThe perfection of truthfulness is nondeceptiveness in speech analyzed into an abstinence a volition etc accompanied by compassion and skillful meansThe perfection of determination is the unshakeable determination to undertake accompanied by compassion and skillful means or it is the act of consciousness occurring in such a modeThe perfection of lovingkindness is the wish to provide for the welfare and happiness of the world accompanied by compassion and skillful means in denotation it is benevolenceThe perfection of equanimity is the attitude of impartiality toward desirable and undesirable beings and formations dispelling attraction and repulsion accompanied by compassion and skillful meansGiving has the characteristic of relinquishing its function is to dispel greed for things that can be given away its manifestation is nonattachment or the achievement of prosperity and a favorable state of existence an object that can be relinquished is its proximate causeVirtue has the characteristic of composing coordinating and establishing are also mentioned as its characteristicIts function is to dispel moral depravity or its function is blameless conduct its manifestation is moral purity shame and moral dread are its proximate causeRenunciation has the characteristic of departing from sense pleasures and existence its function is to verify their unsatisfactoriness its manifestation is the withdrawal from them a sense of spiritual urgency is its proximate causeWisdom has the characteristic of penetrating the real specific nature or the characteristic of sure penetration like the penetration of an arrow shot by a skillful archer its function is to illuminate the objective field like a lamp its manifestation is nonconfusion like a guide in a forest concentration or the Four Truths is its proximate causeEnergy has the characteristic of striving its function is to fortify its manifestation is indefatigability an occasion for the arousing of energy or a sense of spiritual urgency is its proximate causePatience has the characteristic of acceptance its function is to endure the desirable and undesirable its manifestation is tolerance or nonopposition seeing things as they really are is its proximate causeTruthfulness has the characteristic of nondeceptiveness in speech its function is to verify in accordance with fact its manifestation is excellence honesty is its proximate causeDetermination has the characteristic of determining upon the requisites of enlightenment its function is to overcome their opposites its manifestation is unshakeableness in that task the requisites of enlightenment are its proximate causeLovingkindness has the characteristic of promoting the welfare its function is to provide for their welfare or its function is to remove resentment its manifestation is kindliness seeing the agreeable side of beings is its proximate causeEquanimity has the characteristic of promoting the aspect of neutrality its function is to see things impartially its manifestation is the subsiding of attraction and repulsion reflection upon the fact that all beings inherit the results of their own kamma is its proximate causeAnd here it should be mentioned that accompaniment by compassion and skillful means is the distinguishing feature of the characteristic of each virtue  eg of relinquishing in the case of giving etcFor the virtues such as giving etc which occur in the mental continuities of bodhisattvas are always accompanied by compassion and skillful meansIt is this which makes them paaramiisThe condition of the paaramiis is firstly the great aspirationThis is the aspiration supported by the eight qualifications which occurs thus Crossed I would cross freed I would free tamed I would tame calmed I would calm comforted I would comfort attained to nibbaana I would lead to nibbaana purified I would purify enlightened I would enlighten This is the condition for all the paaramiis without exceptionThe eight qualifications through which the aspiration succeeds are the human state the male sex the cause the sight of the Master the going forth the achievement of noble qualities extreme dedication and strong desireThe human state The aspiration for Buddhahood only succeeds when made by one who has attained to the human state of existence not when made by one existing as a naaga supanna etcWhyBecause these other states do not correspond with the state of a BuddhaThe male sex For one who has attained to the human state the aspiration only succeeds when made by a man not when made by a woman eunuch neuter or hermaphroditeWhyFor the aforesaid reason and because there is no fulfillment of the required characteristicsAs it is said This is impossible bhikkhus this cannot come to pass that a woman might become a perfectly enlightened BuddhaThe cause the achievement of the necessary supporting conditionsEven for a man the aspiration only succeeds for one endowed with the necessary supporting conditions one who has achieved the requisite causal foundation not for anyone elseThe sight of the Master the personal presence of the MasterThe aspiration only succeeds when made by one aspiring in the presence of a living BuddhaWhen made after the Exalted One has passed into parinibbaana  before a shrine at the foot of the Bodhitree in front of an image or in the presence of paccekabuddhas or the Buddhas disciples  the aspiration does not succeedWhyBecause the recipient lacks the powerThe aspiration only succeeds when made in the presence of the Buddhas for they alone possess spiritual power adequate to the loftiness of the aspirationThe going forth The aspiration succeeds only when made in the presence of the Exalted Buddha by one who has gone forth either as a bhikkhu or as an ascetic who maintains the doctrine of kamma and the moral efficacy of action it does not succeed for one living in the household stateWhyBecause the household state does not correspond with that of a BuddhaThe great bodhisattvas attain the supreme enlightenment only after they have gone forth into homelessness not while they are still householdersTherefore at the time of making the resolution it is only one who has gone forth endowed with the appropriate qualities and determination who can succeedThe achievement of noble qualities the achievement of such noble qualities as the direct knowledges etcFor the aspiration only succeeds when made by one who has gone forth and gained the eight meditative attainments and the five mundane types of direct knowledge it does not succeed for one devoid of these qualitiesWhyBecause one devoid of them is incapable of investigating the paaramiisIt is because he possesses the necessary supporting conditions and the direct knowledges that the Great Man after he has made the aspiration is able to investigate the paaramiis by himselfExtreme dedication extreme devotionThe aspiration only succeeds for one endowed with the aforesaid qualities who at the time has such strong devotion for the Buddhas that he is prepared to relinquish his very life for themStrong desire wholesome desire the wish for accomplishmentOne possessed of the aforesaid qualities must have strong desire yearning and longing to practice the qualities issuing in BuddhahoodOnly then does his aspiration succeed not otherwiseThe following similes illustrate the magnitude of the desire requiredIf he were to hear He alone can attain Buddhahood who can cross a whole worldsystem filled with water and reach the further shore by the bare strength of his arms  he would not deem that difficult to do but would be filled with desire for the task and would not shrink awayIf he were to hear He alone can attain Buddhahood who can tread across a whole worldsystem filled with flameless smokeless redhot coals cross out and reach the other side etcIf he were to hear He alone can attain Buddhahood who can tread across a whole worldsystem that has become a solid mass of sharppointed swordstakes cross out and reach the other side etcIf he were to hear He alone can attain Buddhahood who can cut through a whole worldsystem that has become a jungle of thorny creepers covered by a solid thicket of bamboo cross out and reach the other side etcIf he were to hear Buddhahood can only be attained after being tortured in hell for four incalculables and a aeons  he would not deem that difficult to do but would be filled with desire for the task and would not shrink awaySuch is the magnitude of the desire requiredThe aspiration made by one endowed with these eight factors is in denotation the act of consciousness occurring together with the collection of these eight factorsIts characteristic is rightly resolving to attain the supreme enlightenmentIts function is to yearn Oh may I awaken to the supreme perfect enlightenment and bring wellbeing and happiness to all beings It is manifest as the rootcause for the requisites of enlightenmentIts proximate cause is great compassion or the achievement of the necessary supporting conditionsSince it has as its object the inconceivable plane of the Buddhas and the welfare of the whole immeasurable world of beings it should be seen as the loftiest most sublime and exalted distinction of merit endowed with immeasurable potency the rootcause of all the qualities issuing in BuddhahoodSimultaneous with its arising the Great Man enters upon the practice of the vehicle to great enlightenmentHe becomes fixed in his destiny irreversible and therefore properly gains the designation bodhisattva His mind becomes fully devoted to the supreme enlightenment in its completeness and his capacity to fulfill the training in the requisites of enlightenment becomes establishedFor when their aspiration succeeds the Great Men correctly investigate all the paaramiis with their selfevolved knowledge which prefigures their future attainment of omniscienceThen they undertake their practice and fulfill them in due order as was done by the wise Sumedha when he made his great aspirationLike the aspiration great compassion and skillful means are also conditions for the paaramiisTherein skillful means is the wisdom which transforms giving into requisites of enlightenmentThrough their great compassion and skillful means the Great Men devote themselves to working uninterruptedly for the welfare of others without any concern for their own happiness and without any fear of the extremely difficult course of conduct that great bodhisattvas must followAnd their nature is such that they are able to promote the welfare and happiness of beings even on occasions when they are merely seen heard of or recollected inspires confidenceThrough his wisdom the bodhisattva perfects within himself the character of a Buddha through his compassion the ability to perform the work of a BuddhaThrough wisdom he brings himself across through compassion he leads others acrossThrough wisdom he understands the suffering of others through compassion he strives to alleviate their sufferingThrough wisdom he becomes disenchanted with suffering through compassion he accepts sufferingThrough wisdom he aspires for nibbaana through compassion he remains in the round of existenceThrough compassion he enters samsaara through wisdom he does not delight in itThrough wisdom he destroys all attachments but because his wisdom is accompanied by compassion he never desists from activity that benefits othersThrough compassion he shakes with sympathy for all but because his compassion is accompanied by wisdom his mind is unattachedThrough wisdom he is free from Imaking and minemaking through compassion he is free from lethargy and depressionSo too through wisdom and compassion respectively he becomes his own protector and the protector of others a sage and a hero one who does not torment himself and one who does not torment others one who promotes his own welfare and the welfare of others fearless and a giver of fearlessness dominated by consideration for the Dhamma and by consideration for the world grateful for favors done and forward in doing favors for others devoid of delusion and devoid of craving accomplished in knowledge and accomplished in conduct possessed of the powers and possessed of the grounds of selfconfidenceThus wisdom and compassion as the means for attaining each of the specific fruits of the paaramiitaas is the condition for the paaramiisAnd the same pair is a condition for the resolution as wellThe four factors  zeal adroitness stability and beneficent conduct  are likewise conditions for the paaramiisBecause they serve as the basis for the arising of Buddhahood these factors are called grounds for BuddhahoodHerein zeal means energy in striving for the requisites of enlightenmentAdroitness is wisdom in applying skillful means to the requisites of enlightenmentStability is determination an unshakeable determination of the willBeneficent conduct is the development of lovingkindness and compassionAnother set of conditions is the six inclinations  the inclinations toward renunciation solitude nongreed nonhatred nondelusion and escapeFor bodhisattvas seeing the fault in sense pleasures and in household life incline to renunciationSeeing the fault in company they incline to solitudeSeeing the faults in greed hatred and delusion they incline to nongreed nonhatred and nondelusionSeeing the fault in all the realms of existence bodhisattvas incline to escapeTherefore these six inclinations of bodhisattvas are conditions for the paaramiisFor the paaramiis do not arise without seeing the danger in greed etc and the superiority of nongreed etcThe inclination to nongreed etc is the slanting of the mind toward relinquishing etc because of the superiority of nongreed etcSo too for bodhisattvas striving for enlightenment the inclination toward each of the ten paaramiis is a condition for the practice of eachFor bodhisattvas through their inclination toward giving see the fault in its opposite ie in stinginess and therefore fulfill the perfection of givingThrough their inclination toward virtue they see the fault in moral depravity and therefore fulfill the perfection of virtueThrough their inclination toward renunciation they see the fault in sense pleasures and in household life through their inclination toward knowing things as they really are they see the faults in ignorance and perplexity through their inclination toward energy they see the fault in laziness through their inclination toward patience they see the fault in impatience through their inclination toward truthfulness they see the fault in deceptive speech through their inclination toward determination they see the fault in lack of determination through their inclination toward lovingkindness they see the fault in illwill and through their inclination toward equanimity they see the danger in the vicissitudes of the worldThus they fulfill the perfection of renunciation and the other perfections down to equanimityIn this way the inclination toward giving and the other nine virtues by bringing about the achievement of all the paaramiis serves as their conditionReviewing the danger in their opposites and the benefit in their practice is another condition for the paaramiis eg in the case of the perfection of giving the danger in nonrelinquishing and the benefit in relinquishingThis is the method of reviewingThe perfection of giving should be reflected upon thus Possessions such as fields land bullion gold cattle buffaloes slaves children wives etc bring tremendous harm to those who become attached to themBecause they stimulate desire they are wanted by many people they can be confiscated by kings and thieves they spark off disputes and create enemies they are basically insubstantial to acquire and protect them one has to harass others when they are destroyed many kinds of calamities such as sorrow etc follow and because of attachment to these things the mind becomes obsessed with the stain of stinginess and as a result one is reborn in the plane of miseryOn the other hand one act of relinquishing these things is one step to safetyHence one should relinquish them with diligenceFurther when a suppliant asks for something a bodhisattva should reflect He is my intimate friend for he divulges his own secret to meHe is my teacher for he teaches me When you go you have to abandon allGoing to the world beyond you cannot even take your own possessions He is a companion helping me to remove my belongings from this world which like a blazing house is blazing with the fire of deathIn removing this he helps me to get rid of the worry it costs meHe is my best friend for by enabling me to perform this noble act of giving he helps me to accomplish the most eminent and difficult of all achievements the attainment of the plane of the BuddhasHe should further reflect He honors me with a lofty task therefore I should acknowledge that honor faithfully And Since life is bound to end I should give even when not asked much more when asked And Those with a lofty temperament search for someone to give to but he has come to me on his own accord because of my merit And Bestowing a gift upon a suppliant will be beneficial to me as well as to him And Just as I would benefit myself so should I benefit all the world And If there were no suppliants how would I fulfill the perfection of giving And Everything I acquire should be obtained only to give to others And When will beggars feel free to take my belongings on their own accord without asking And How can I be dear and agreeable to beggars and how can they be dear and agreeable to meHow can I give and after giving be elated exultant filled with rapture and joyAnd how can beggars be so on my accountHow can my inclination to giving be loftyHow can I give to beggars even without being asked knowing their hearts desire And Since there are goods and beggars have come not to give them something would be a great deception on my part And How can I relinquish my own life and limbs to those who ask for themHe should arouse a desire to give things away without concern by reflecting Good returns to the one who gives without his concern just as the boomerang returns to the one who threw it without his concern If a dear person asks for something he should arouse joy by reflecting One who is dear is asking me for something If an indifferent person asks for something he should arouse joy by reflecting Surely if I give him something he will become my friend since giving to those who ask wins their affection And if a hostile person asks for something he should be especially happy thinking My foe is asking me for something though he is hostile toward me by means of this gift he will surely become my dear friend Thus he should give to neutral and hostile people in the same way he gives to dear people having first aroused lovingkindness and compassionIf due to their cumulative force states of greed should arise for things which can be given away the bodhisattvaaspirant should reflect Well now good man when you made the aspiration for full enlightenment did you not surrender this body as well as the merit gained in relinquishing it for the sake of helping all beingsAttachment to external objects is like the bathing of an elephant therefore you should not be attached to anythingSuppose there is a great medicinetree and someone in need of its roots takes away its roots someone in need of its shoots bark trunk limbs heartwood branches foliage flowers or fruits takes away its shoots bark trunk etcThe tree would not be assailed by such thoughts as They are taking away my belongings In the same way when I have undertaken to exert myself for the welfare of all the world I should not arouse even the subtlest wrong thought over this wretched ungrateful impure body which I have entrusted to the service of othersAnd besides what distinction can be made between the internal material elements and the external material elementsThey are both subject to inevitable breakingup dispersal and dissolutionThis is only confused prattle the adherence to this body as This is mine this am I this is my self I should have no more concern over my own hands feet eyes and flesh than over external thingsInstead I should arouse the thought to surrender them to others Let those who need them take them away As he reflects in this way resolved upon full enlightenment without concern for his body or life his bodily vocal and mental actions will easily become fully purifiedWhen his bodily vocal and mental actions along with his livelihood become purified he abides in the practice of the true way and through his skillful means in regard to gain and loss he is able to benefit all beings to an even greater extent by relinquishing material gifts and by giving the gift of fearlessness and the gift of the true DhammaThis is the method of reflecting on the perfection of givingThe perfection of virtue should be reflected upon as follows Even the waters of the Ganges cannot wash away the stain of hatred yet the water of virtue is able to do soEven yellow sandalwood cannot cool the fever of lust yet virtue is able to remove itVirtue is the unique adornment of the good surpassing the adornments cherished by ordinary people such as necklaces diadems and earringsIt is a sweetscented fragrance superior to incense as it pervades all directions and is always in place a supreme magical spell which wins the homage of deities and of powerful khattiyas etc a staircase ascending to the world of the gods to the heaven of the Four Great Kings etc a means for achieving the jhaanas and the direct knowledges a highway leading to the great city of nibbaana the foundation for the enlightenment of disciples paccekabuddhas and perfectly enlightened BuddhasAnd as a means for the fulfillment of all ones wishes and desires it surpasses the tree of plenty and the wishfulfilling gemVirtue should be reflected upon as the basis for rapture and joy as granting immunity from fear of selfreproach the reproach of others temporal punishment and an evil destination after death as praised by the wise as the rootcause for freedom from remorse as the basis for security and as surpassing the achievements of high birth wealth sovereignty long life beauty status kinsmen and friendsFor great rapture and joy arise in the virtuous man when he reflects on his own accomplishment in virtue I have done what is wholesome I have done what is good I have built myself a shelter from fear The virtuous man does not blame himself and other wise men do not blame him and he does not encounter the dangers of temporal punishment or an evil destination after deathTo the contrary the wise praise the noble character of the virtuous man and the virtuous man is not subject to the remorse which arises in the immoral man when he thinks I have committed evil wicked sinful deeds And virtue is the supreme basis for security since it is the foundation for diligence a blessing and a means for achieving great benefits such as preventing the loss of wealth etcAccomplishment in virtue surpasses birth in a good family since a virtuous man of low birth deserves to be worshipped even by great powerful khattiyasVirtue surpasses material wealth for it cannot be confiscated by thieves follows one to the world beyond produces great fruit and acts as the foundation for such qualities as serenity etcBecause it enables one to achieve supreme sovereignty over ones own mind virtue surpasses the sovereignty of khattiyas etcAnd because of their virtue beings attain sovereignty in their respective ordersVirtue is superior even to life for it is said that a single day in the life of the virtuous is better than a hundred years of life devoid of virtue and there being life the disavowal of the training is called deathVirtue surpasses the achievement of beauty for it makes one beautiful even to ones enemies and it cannot be vanquished by the adversities of aging and sicknessAs the foundation for distinguished states of happiness virtue surpasses such distinguished dwellings as palaces mansions etc and such distinguished social positions as that of a king prince or generalBecause it promotes ones highest welfare and follows one to the world beyond virtue surpasses kinsmen and friends even those who are close and affectionateAgain in accomplishing the difficult task of selfprotection virtue is superior to troops of elephants horses chariots and infantry as well as to such devices as mantras spells and blessings for it depends on oneself does not depend on others and has a great sphere of influenceHence it is said Dhamma protects the one who lives by DhammaWhen one reflects in this way upon the numerous noble qualities of virtue ones unfulfilled achievement of virtue will become fulfilled and ones unpurified virtue will become purifiedIf due to their cumulative force states antithetical to virtue such as aversion should arise from time to time the aspirant should reflect Did you not make the resolution to win full enlightenmentOne defective in virtue cannot even succeed in mundane affairs much less in supramundane mattersYou should reach the peak of virtue for virtue is the foundation for supreme enlightenment the foremost of all achievementsYou should always be well behaved safeguarding your virtue perfectly more carefully than a hen safeguarding its eggsFurther by teaching the Dhamma you should help beings to enter and reach maturity in the three vehiclesBut the word of a morally dubious man is no more reliable than the remedy of a doctor who does not consider what is suitable for his patientsHow can I be trustworthy so that I can help beings to enter and reach maturity in the three vehiclesI must be pure in character and in virtueHow can I acquire the distinguished attainments such as the jhaanas etc so that I will be capable of helping others and of fulfilling the perfection of wisdom etcThe distinguished attainments such as the jhaanas etc are not possible without purification of virtueTherefore virtue should be made perfectly pureThe perfection of renunciation should be reflected upon by first discerning the dangers in household life according to the text household life is constricting a path for the dust of passions etc in sense pleasures according to the text sense pleasures are like a chain of bones etc and in sensual desire according to the text suppose a man borrowed a loan and undertook work etcThen in the opposite way one should reflect upon the benefits in going forth according to the text going forth is like open space etcThis is a brief statementFor details one should consult such suttas as The Great Mass of Suffering or The Simile of the Venomous SnakesFor the perfection of wisdom the noble qualities of wisdom should be considered as follows Without wisdom the virtues such as giving do not become purified and cannot perform their respective functionsJust as without life the bodily organism loses its luster and cannot perform its proper activities and as without consciousness the sense faculties cannot exercise their functions in their respective spheres just so without wisdom the faculties such as faith etc cannot perform their functionsWisdom is the chief cause for the practice of the other paaramiiFor when their wisdomeyes open up the great bodhisattvas give even their own limbs and organs without extolling themselves and disparaging othersLike medicinetrees they give devoid of discrimination filled with joy throughout the three timesBy means of wisdom the act of relinquishing exercised with skillful means and practiced for the welfare of others attains the status of a paaramii but giving for ones own benefit is like an investmentAgain without wisdom virtue cannot be severed from the defilements of craving etc and therefore cannot even reach purification much less serve as the foundation for the qualities of an omniscient BuddhaOnly the man of wisdom clearly recognizes the dangers in household life in the strands of sense pleasure and in samsaara and sees the benefits in going forth in attaining the jhaanas and in realizing nibbaana and he alone goes forth into homelessness develops the jhaanic attainments and directed toward nibbaana establishes others thereinEnergy devoid of wisdom does not accomplish the purpose desired since it is wrongly aroused and it is better not to arouse energy at all than to arouse it in the wrong wayBut when energy is conjoined with wisdom there is nothing it cannot accomplish if equipped with the proper meansAgain only the man of wisdom can patiently tolerate the wrongs of others not the dullwitted manIn the man lacking wisdom the wrongs of others only provoke impatience but for the wise they call his patience into play and make it grow even strongerThe wise man having understood as they really are three noble truths their causes and opposites never speaks deceptively to othersSo too having fortified himself with the power of wisdom the wise man in his fortitude forms an unshakeable determination to undertake all the paaramiisOnly the man of wisdom is skillful in providing for the welfare of all beings without discriminating between dear people neutrals and enemiesAnd only by means of wisdom can he remain indifferent to the vicissitudes of the world such as gain and loss without being affected by themIn this way one should reflect upon the noble qualities of wisdom recognizing it to be the cause for the purification of all the paaramiisFurthermore without wisdom there is no achievement of vision and without the achievement of vision there can be no accomplishment in virtueOne lacking virtue and vision cannot achieve concentration and without concentration one cannot even secure ones own welfare much less the lofty goal of providing for the welfare of othersTherefore a bodhisattva practicing for the welfare of others should admonish himself Have you made a thorough effort to purify your wisdom For it is by the spiritual power of wisdom that the Great Beings established in the four foundations benefit the world with the four bases of beneficence help beings enter the path to emancipation and bring their faculties to maturityThrough the power of wisdom again they are devoted to the investigation of the aggregates sense bases etc fully comprehend the processes of origination and cessation in accordance with actuality develop the qualities of giving etc to the stages of distinction and penetration and perfect the training of bodhisattvasThus the perfection of wisdom should be reinforced by determining the noble qualities of wisdom with their numerous modes and constituentsThe perfection of energy should be reflected upon thus Without energy a man cannot even achieve success in worldly works directed to visible endsBut there is nothing the energetic indefatigable man cannot achieveOne lacking energy cannot undertake to rescue all beings from the great flood of samsaara even if his energy is only moderate he will give up in the middleBut one bristling with energy can achieve perfection in all he undertakesThe noble qualities of energy should be further reviewed as follows One intent on rescuing himself alone from the mire of samsaara cannot fulfill his ideal if he relaxes his energy how much less one who aspires to rescue the entire world And Through the power of energy such wrong thoughts as the following are kept away It is quite right for you to escape from the suffering of samsaara by yourself alone for so long as you are a foolish worldling the host of defilements is as difficult to restrain as a herd of mad elephants the kamma caused by them is like a murderer with drawn sword the evil destinations based on these actions stand constantly before you with open doors and evil friends are always around to enjoin you in those actions and admonish you to practice them And If even full enlightenment can be achieved by ones own energy what can be difficultThe perfection of patience should be considered next Patience is the unimpeded weapon of the good in the development of noble qualities for it dispels anger the opposite of all such qualities without residueIt is the adornment of those capable of vanquishing the foe the strength of recluses and brahmans a stream of water extinguishing the fire of anger the basis for acquiring a good reputation a mantra for quelling the poisonous speech of evil people the supreme source of constancy in those established in restraintPatience is an ocean on account of its depth a shore bounding the great ocean of hatred a panel closing off the door to the plane of misery a staircase ascending to the worlds of the gods and Brahmaas the ground for the habitation of all noble qualities the supreme purification of body speech and mindPatience should be further fortified by reflection Those who lack patience are afflicted in this world and apply themselves to actions which will lead to their affliction in the life to come And Although this suffering arises through the wrong deeds of others this body of mine is the field for that suffering and the action which is its seed was sown by me alone And This suffering will release me from the debt of that kamma And If there were no wrongdoers how could I accomplish the perfection of patience And Although he is a wrongdoer now in the past he was my benefactor And A wrongdoer is also a benefactor for he is the basis for developing patience And All beings are like my own childrenWho becomes angry over the misdeeds of his own children And He wrongs me because of some residue of anger in myself this residue I should remove And I am just as much the cause as he for the wrong on account of which this suffering has arisen And All those phenomena by which wrong was done and those to whom it was done  all those at this very moment have ceasedWith whom then should you now be angry and by whom should anger be arousedWhen all phenomena are nonself who can do wrong to whomIf due to its cumulative force anger caused by the wrongs of others should continue to overpower the mind one should reflect Patience is the contributive cause for rendering help to others in return for their wrong And This wrong by causing me suffering is a condition for faith since suffering is said to be the decisive support for faith and it is also a condition for the perception of discontent with all the world And This is the nature of the sensefaculties  to encounter desirable and undesirable objectsHow then is it possible not to encounter undesirable objects And Under the control of anger a person becomes mad and distraught so why retaliate And All these beings are watched over by the Buddha as if they were his own dear childrenTherefore I should not be angry with them And When the wrongdoer is endowed with noble qualities I should not be angry with himAnd when he does not have any noble qualities then I should regard him with compassion And Because of anger my fame and noble qualities diminish and to the pleasure of my enemies I become ugly sleep in discomfort etc And Anger is the only real enemy for it is the agent of all harm and the destroyer of all good And When one has patience one has no enemies And Because of his wrong the wrongdoer will meet suffering in the future but so long as I remain patient I will not And Enemies are the consequence of my angry thoughtWhen I vanquish anger by patience my foe who is the byproduct of my anger will also be vanquished And I should not relinquish the noble quality of patience because of a little angerAnger is the antithesis and obstruction to all noble qualities so if I become angry how can my virtue etc reach fulfillmentAnd when those qualities are absent how can I devote myself to helping other beings and attain the ultimate goal in accordance with my vows And When there is patience the mind becomes concentrated free from external distractionWith the mind concentrated all formations appear to reflection as impermanent and suffering all phenomena as nonself nibbaana as unconditioned deathless peaceful and sublime and the Buddhaqualities as endowed with inconceivable and immeasurable potencyThen established in acquiescence in conformity the groundlessness of all Imaking and minemaking becomes evident to reflection thus Mere phenomena alone exist devoid of self or of anything pertaining to a selfThey arise and pass away in accordance with their conditionsThey do not come from anywhere they do not go anywhere they are not established anywhereThere is no agency in anything whatsoever In this way a bodhisattva becomes fixed in destiny bound for enlightenment irreversibleThis is the method of reflecting upon the perfection of patienceThe perfection of truthfulness should be reviewed thus Without truthfulness virtue etc is impossible and there can be no practice in accordance with ones vowsAll evil states converge upon the transgression of truthOne who is not devoted to truth is unreliable and his word cannot be accepted in the futureOn the other hand one devoted to truth secures the foundation of all noble qualitiesWith truthfulness as the foundation he is capable of purifying and fulfilling all the requisites of enlightenmentNot deceived about the true nature of phenomena he performs the functions of all the requisites of enlightenment and completes the practice of the bodhisattva pathThe perfection of determination should be reviewed thus Without firmly undertaking the practice of giving maintaining an unshakeable determination in the encounter with their opposites and practicing them with constancy and vigor the bases of enlightenment  ie the requisites such as giving etc do not ariseThe noble qualities of lovingkindness should be reflected upon as follows One resolved only upon his own welfare cannot achieve success in this world or a happy rebirth in the life to come without some concern for the welfare of others how then can one wishing to establish all beings in the attainment of nibbaana succeed without lovingkindnessAnd if you wish to ultimately lead all beings to the supramundane achievement of nibbaana you should begin by wishing for their mundane success here and now And I cannot provide for the welfare and happiness of others merely by wishing for itLet me put forth effort to accomplish it And Now I support them by promoting their welfare and happiness afterward they will be my companions in sharing the Dhamma And Without these beings I could not acquire the requisites of enlightenmentSince they are the cause for the manifestation and perfecting of all the Buddhaqualities these beings are for me a supreme field of merit the incomparable basis for planting wholesome roots the ultimate object of reverenceThus one should arouse an especially strong inclination toward promoting the welfare of all beingsAnd why should lovingkindness be developed toward all beingsBecause it is the foundation for compassionFor when one delights in providing for the welfare and happiness of other beings with an unbounded heart the desire to remove their affliction and suffering becomes powerful and firmly rootedAnd compassion is the first of all the qualities issuing in Buddhahood  their footing foundation root head and chiefThe perfection of equanimity should be considered thus When there is no equanimity the offensive actions performed by beings cause oscillation in the mindAnd when the mind oscillates it is impossible to practice the requisites of enlightenment And Even though the mind has been softened with the moisture of lovingkindness without equanimity one cannot purify the requisites of enlightenment and cannot dedicate ones requisites of merit along with their results to furthering the welfare of beingsMoreover the undertaking determination fulfillment and completion of all the requisites of enlightenment succeed through the power of equanimityFor without equanimity the aspirant cannot relinquish something without making false discriminations over gifts and recipientsWithout equanimity he cannot purify his virtue without always thinking about the obstacles to his life and to his vital needsEquanimity perfects the power of renunciation for by its means he overcomes discontent and delightIt perfects the functions of all the requisites to examine them according to their originWhen energy is aroused to excess because it has not been examined with equanimity it cannot perform its proper function of strivingForbearance and reflective acquiescence are possible only in one possessed of equanimityBecause of this quality he does not speak deceptively about beings or formationsBy looking upon the vicissitudes of worldly events with an equal mind his determination to fulfill the practices he has undertaken becomes completely unshakeableAnd because he is unconcerned over the wrongs done by others he perfects the abiding in lovingkindnessThus equanimity is indispensable to the practice of all the other paaramiisSuch is the reflection on the perfection of equanimityThus reviewing the danger in their opposites and the benefits in their practice is a condition for the paaramiisIn general being misapprehended by craving etc is the defilement of all the paaramiisTaken separately discriminating thoughts over gifts and recipients are the defilement of the perfection of givingDiscriminating thoughts over beings and times are the defilement of the perfection of virtueDiscriminating thoughts of delight in sense pleasures and existence and of discontent with their pacification are the defilement of the perfection of renunciationDiscriminating thoughts of I and mine are the defilement of the perfection of wisdom discriminating thoughts leaning to listlessness and restlessness of the perfection of energy discriminating thoughts of oneself and others of the perfection of patience discriminating thoughts of avowing to have seen what was not seen etc of the perfection of truthfulness discriminating thoughts perceiving flaws in the requisites of enlightenment and virtues in their opposites of the perfection of determination discriminating thoughts confusing what is harmful with what is beneficial of the perfection of lovingkindness and discriminating thoughts over the desirable and undesirable of the perfection of equanimityThus the defilements should be understoodTheir cleansing is the removal of the taints of craving etc and the absence of the aforementioned discriminationsFor the paaramiis become pure and luminous when untainted by such defilements as craving conceit views anger malice denigration domineering envy stinginess craftiness hypocrisy obstinacy presumption vanity and negligence and when devoid of the discriminating thoughts over gifts and recipients etcIn general all the defilements and all unwholesome qualities are their oppositesTaken separately stinginess is the opposite of giving and so on as mentioned earlierFurther giving is opposed to greed hatred and delusion since it applies the qualities of nongreed nonhatred and nondelusion to gifts recipients and the fruits of giving respectivelyVirtue is opposed to greed hatred and delusion since it removes crookedness and corruption in bodily conduct etcRenunciation is opposed to these three corruptions since it avoids indulgence in sense pleasures the affliction of others and selfmortificationWisdom opposes them in so far as greed etc create blindness while knowledge restores sightEnergy opposes them by arousing the true way free from both listlessness and restlessnessPatience opposes them by accepting the desirable the undesirable and emptinessTruthfulness is their opposite because it proceeds in accordance with fact whether others render help or inflict harmDetermination is the opposite of these three defilements since after vanquishing the vicissitudes of the world it remains unshakeable in fulfilling the requisites of enlightenment in the way they have been undertakenLovingkindness is the opposite of greed hatred and delusion through its seclusion from the hindrancesAnd equanimity is their opposite by dispelling attraction and repulsion toward desirable and undesirable objects respectively and by proceeding evenly under varying circumstancesThe perfection of giving firstly is to be practiced by benefiting beings in many ways  by relinquishing ones own happiness belongings body and life to others by dispelling their fear and by instructing them in the DhammaHerein giving is threefold by way of the object to be given the giving of material things the giving of fearlessness and the giving of the DhammaAmong these the object to be given can be twofold internal and externalThe external gift is tenfold food drink garments vehicles garlands scents unguents bedding dwellings and lampsThese gifts again become manifold by analyzing each into its constituents eg food into hard food soft food etcThe external gift can also become sixfold when analyzed by way of sense object visible forms sounds smells tastes tangibles and nonsensory objectsThe sense objects such as visible forms become manifold when analyzed into blue etcSo too the external gift is manifold by way of the divers valuables and belongings such as gems gold silver pearls coral etc fields lands parks etc slaves cows buffaloes etcWhen the Great Man gives an external object he gives whatever is needed to whomever stands in need of it and knowing by himself that someone is in need of something he gives it even unasked much more when askedHe gives generously not ungenerouslyHe gives sufficiently not insufficiently when there is something to be givenHe does not give because he expects something in returnAnd when there is not enough to give sufficiently to all he distributes evenly whatever can be sharedBut he does not give things that issue in affliction to others such as weapons poisons and intoxicantsNor does he give amusements which are harmful and lead to negligenceAnd he does not give unsuitable food or drink to a person who is sick even though he might ask for it and he does not give what is suitable beyond the proper measureAgain when asked he gives to householders things appropriate for householders and to monks things appropriate for monksHe gives to his mother and father kinsmen and relatives friends and colleagues children wife slaves and workers without causing pain to anyoneHaving promised an excellent gift he does not give something meanHe does not give because he desires gain honor or fame or because he expects something in return or out of expectation of some fruit other than the supreme enlightenmentHe does not give detesting the gift or those who askHe does not give a discarded object as a gift not even to unrestrained beggars who revile and abuse himInvariably he gives with care with a serene mind full of compassionHe does not give through belief in superstitious omens but he gives believing in kamma and its fruitWhen he gives he does not afflict those who ask by making them do homage to him etc but he gives without afflicting othersHe does not give a gift with the intention of deceiving others or with the intention of injuring he gives only with an undefiled mindHe does not give a gift with harsh words or a frown but with words of endearment congenial speech and a smile on his faceWhenever greed for a particular object becomes excessive due to its high value and beauty its antiquity or personal attachment the bodhisattva recognizes his greed quickly dispels it seeks out some recipients and gives it awayAnd if there should be an object of limited value that can be given and a suppliant expecting it without a second thought he bestirs himself and gives it to him honoring him as though he were an uncelebrated sageAsked for his own children wife slaves workers and servants the Great Man does not give them while they are as yet unwilling to go afflicted with griefBut when they are willing and joyful then he gives themBut if he knows that those who ask for them are demonic beings  ogres demons or goblins  or men of cruel disposition then he does not give them awaySo too he will not give his kingdom to those intent on the harm suffering and affliction of the world but he would give it away to righteous men who protect the world with DhammaThis firstly is the way to practice the giving of external giftsThe internal gift should be understood in two waysHowJust as a man for the sake of food and clothing surrenders himself to another and enters into servitude and slavery in the same way the Great Man wishing for the supreme welfare and happiness of all beings desiring to fulfill his own perfection of giving with a spirituallyoriented mind for the sake of enlightenment surrenders himself to another and enters into servitude placing himself at the disposal of othersWhatever limbs or organs of his might be needed by others  hands feet eyes etc he gives them away to those who need them without trembling and without coweringHe is no more attached to them and no more shrinks away than if they were external objectsThus the Great Man relinquishes an internal object in two ways for the enjoyment of others according to their pleasure or while fulfilling the wishes of those who ask for his own selfmasteryIn this matter he is completely generous and thinks I will attain enlightenment through nonattachment Thus the giving of the internal gift should be understoodHerein giving an internal gift he gives only what leads to the welfare of the recipient and nothing elseThe Great Man does not knowingly give his own body limbs and organs to Maara or to the malevolent deities in Maaras company thinking Let this not lead to their harm And likewise he does not give to those possessed by Maara or his deities or to madmenBut when asked for these things by others he gives immediately because of the rarity of such a request and the difficulty of making such a giftThe giving of fearlessness is the giving of protection to beings when they have become frightened on account of kings thieves fire water enemies lions tigers other wild beasts dragons ogres demons goblins etcThe giving of the Dhamma is an unperverted discourse on the Dhamma given with an undefiled mind that is methodical instruction conducive to good in the present life in the life to come and to ultimate deliveranceBy means of such discourses those who have not entered the Buddhas Dispensation enter it while those who have entered it reach maturity thereinThis is the method In brief he gives a talk on giving on virtue and on heaven on the unsatisfactoriness and defilement in sense pleasures and on the benefit in renouncing themIn detail to those whose minds are disposed toward the enlightenment of disciples he gives a discourse establishing and purifying them by elaborating upon the noble qualities of whichever among the following topics is appropriate going for refuge restraint by virtue guarding the doors of the sensefaculties moderation in eating application to wakefulness the seven good qualities application to serenity by practicing meditation on one of the thirtyeight objects application to insight by contemplating the objects of insightinterpretation such as the material body the progressive stages of purification the apprehension of the course of rightness the three kinds of clear knowledge the six direct knowledges the four discriminations and the enlightenment of a discipleSo too for beings whose minds are disposed toward the enlightenment of paccekabuddhas and of perfectly enlightened Buddhas he gives a discourse establishing and purifying them in the two vehicles by elaborating upon the greatness of the spiritual power of those Buddhas and by explaining the specific nature characteristic function etc of the ten paaramiis in their three stagesThus the Great Man gives the gift of the Dhamma to beingsWhen he gives a material gift the Great Man gives food thinking May I by this gift enable beings to achieve long life beauty happiness strength intelligence and the supreme fruit of unsullied bliss He gives drink wishing to allay the thirst of sensual defilements garments to gain the adornments of shame and moral dread and the golden complexion vehicles for attaining the modes of psychic potency and the bliss of nibbaana scents for producing the sweet scent of virtue garlands and unguents for producing the beauty of the Buddhaqualities seats for producing the seat on the terrace of enlightenment bedding for producing the bed of a Tathaagatas rest dwellings so he might become a refuge for beings lamps so he might obtain the fiveeyesHe gives visible forms for producing the fathomwide aura sounds for producing the Brahmaalike voice tastes for endearing himself to all the world and tangibles for acquiring a Buddhas eleganceHe gives medicines so he might later give the ageless and deathless state of nibbaanaHe gives slaves the gift of freedom so he might later emancipate beings from the slavery of the defilementsHe gives blameless amusements and enjoyments in order to produce delight in the true DhammaHe gives his own children as a gift in order that he might adopt all beings as his children by granting them a noble birthHe gives his wives as a gift in order that he might become master over the entire worldHe gives gifts of gold gems pearls coral etc in order to achieve the major marks of physical beauty and gifts of the diverse means of beautification in order to achieve the minor features of physical beautyHe gives his treasuries as a gift in order to obtain the treasury of the true Dhamma the gift of his kingdom in order to become the king of the Dhamma the gift of monasteries parks ponds and groves in order to achieve the jhaanas etc the gift of his feet in order that he might approach the terrace of enlightenment with feet marked with the auspicious wheels the gift of his hands in order that he might give to beings the rescuing hand of the true Dhamma to help them across the four floods the gift of his ears nose etc in order to obtain the spiritual faculties of faith etc the gift of his eyes in order to obtain the universal eye the gift of his flesh and blood with the thought May my body be the means of life for all the worldMay it bring welfare and happiness to all beings at all times even on occasions of merely seeing hearing recollecting or ministering to me And he gives the gift of his head in order to become supreme in all the worldGiving thus the Great Man does not give unwillingly nor by afflicting others nor out of fear moral shame or the scolding of those in need of giftsWhen there is something excellent he does not give what is meanHe does not give extolling himself and disparaging othersHe does not give out of desire for the fruit nor with loathing for those who ask nor with lack of considerationRather he gives thoroughly with his own hand at the proper time considerately without discrimination filled with joy throughout the three timesHaving given he does not become remorseful afterwardHe does not become either conceited or obsequious in relation to the recipients but behaves amiably toward themBountiful and liberal he gives things together with a bonusFor when he gives food thinking I will give this along with a bonus he gives garments etc as wellAnd when he gives garments thinking I will give this along with a bonus he gives food etc as wellThe same method with gifts of vehicles etcAnd when he gives a gift of one of the sense objects such as visible forms he gives the other sense objects also as a bonusThis entire accomplishment in giving he dedicates to the welfare and happiness of the whole world and to his own unshakeable emancipation through supreme enlightenmentHe dedicates it to the attainment of inexhaustible desire inexhaustible concentration ingenuity knowledge and emancipationIn practicing the perfection of giving the Great Being should apply the perception of impermanence to life and possessionsHe should consider them as shared in common with many and should constantly and continuously arouse great compassion toward beingsJust as when a house is blazing the owner removes all his property of essential value and himself as well without leaving anything important behind so does the Great Man invariably give without discrimination and without concernThis is the method of practicing the perfection of givingNow comes the method of practicing the perfection of virtueSince the Great Man desires to adorn beings with the adornment of the virtue of the omniscient at the beginning he must first purify his own virtueHerein virtue is purified in four modes by the purification of ones inclinations by the undertaking of precepts by nontransgression and by making amends for transgressionsFor someone who is dominated by personal ideals is naturally disgusted with evil through the purity of his own inclinations and purifies his conduct by arousing his inward sense of shameSomeone else who is dominated by a consideration for the world afraid of evil purifies his conduct by receiving precepts from another person and by arousing his sense of moral dreadBoth establish themselves in virtue through nontransgressionBut if due to forgetfulness they sometimes break a precept then through their sense of shame and moral dread respectively they quickly make amends for it by the proper means of rehabilitationVirtue is twofold as avoidance and performanceHerein this is the method by which virtue as avoidance should be practicedA bodhisattva should have such a heart of sympathy for all beings that he does not feel any resentment toward anyone even in a dreamBecause he is dedicated to helping others he would no more misappropriate the belongings of others than he would take hold of a poisonous water snakeIf he is a monk he should live remote from unchastity abstaining from the seven bonds of sexuality not to speak of adulteryIf he is a householder he should never arouse even an evil thought of lust for the wives of othersWhen he speaks his statements should be truthful beneficial and endearing and his talk measured timely and concerned with the DhammaHis mind should always be devoid of covetousness illwill and perverted viewsHe should possess the knowledge of the ownership of kamma and have settled faith and affection for recluses and brahmans who are faring and practicing rightlyBecause he abstains from unwholesome states and from the unwholesome courses of kamma leading to the four planes of misery and the suffering of the round and because he is established in the wholesome courses of kamma leading to heaven and liberation through the purity of his end and the purity of his means the Great Mans wishes for the welfare and happiness of beings succeed immediately exactly in the way they are formed and his paaramiis reach fulfillment for such is his natureSince he desists from injuring others he gives the gift of fearlessness to all beingsHe perfects the meditation on lovingkindness without trouble and enjoys the eleven benefits of lovingkindnessHe is healthy and robust attains longevity abundant happiness and distinguished characteristics and eradicates the mental impression of hatredSo too because he desists from taking what is not given his possessions cannot be confiscated by thieves etcHe is unsuspicious to others dear and agreeable trustworthy unattached to prosperity and success inclined to relinquishing and he eradicates the mental impression of greedBy desisting from unchastity he becomes unexcitable peaceful in body and mind dear and agreeable unsuspicious to beingsA good report circulates concerning himHe is without lust or attachment to women is devoted to renunciation achieves distinguished characteristics and eradicates the mental impression of greedBy desisting from false speech his word comes to be authoritative for othersHe is regarded as reliable and trustworthy one whose statements are always acceptedHe is dear and agreeable to deitiesHis mouth gives off a sweet fragrance and his bodily and vocal conduct are protectedHe achieves distinguished characteristics and eradicates the mental impression of defilementsBy desisting from slander he obtains a retinue and a following that cannot be divided by the attacks of othersHe possesses unbreakable faith in the true DhammaHe is a firm friend as exceedingly dear to beings as though they were acquainted with him in the last existenceAnd he is devoted to nondefilementBy desisting from harsh speech he becomes dear and agreeable to beings pleasant in character sweet in speech held in esteemAnd he develops a voice endowed with eight factorsBy desisting from idle chatter he becomes dear and agreeable to beings revered held in esteemHis statements are accepted and his talk measuredHe acquires great influence and power and becomes skillful in answering the questions of others with the ingenuity that creates opportunitiesAnd when he reaches the plane of Buddhahood he becomes capable of answering the numerous questions of beings speaking numerous languages all with a single replyThrough his freedom from covetousness he gains what he wishes and obtains whatever excellent possessions he needsHe is honored by powerful khattiyasHe can never be vanquished by his adversaries is never defective in his faculties and becomes the peerless individualThrough his freedom from illwill he gains a pleasant appearanceHe is esteemed by others and because he delights in the welfare of beings he automatically inspires their confidenceHe becomes lofty in character abides in lovingkindness and acquires great influence and powerThrough his freedom from wrong view he gains good companionsEven if he is threatened with a sharp sword he will not perform an evil deedBecause he holds to the ownership of kamma he does not believe in superstitious omensHis faith in the true Dhamma is established and firmly rootedHe has faith in the enlightenment of the Tathaagatas and no more delights in the diversity of outside creeds than a royal swan delights in a dung heapHe is skillful in fully understanding the three characteristics and in the end gains the unobstructed knowledge of omniscienceUntil he attains final enlightenment he becomes the foremost in whatever order of beings and acquires the most excellent achievementsThus esteeming virtue as the foundation for all achievements  as the soil for the origination of all the Buddhaqualities the beginning footing head and chief of all the qualities issuing in Buddhahood  and recognizing gain honor and fame as a foe in the guise of a friend a bodhisattva should diligently and thoroughly perfect his virtue as a hen guards its eggs through the power of mindfulness and clear comprehension in the control of bodily and vocal action in the taming of the sensefaculties in purification of livelihood and in the use of the requisitesThis firstly is the method of practicing virtue as avoidanceThe practice of virtue as performance should be understood as follows Herein at the appropriate time a bodhisattva practices salutation rising up respectful greetings and courteous conduct toward good friends worthy of reverenceAt the appropriate time he renders them service and he waits upon them when they are sickWhen he receives wellspoken advice he expresses his appreciationHe praises the noble qualities of the virtuous and patiently endures the abuse of antagonistsHe remembers help rendered to him by others rejoices in their merits dedicates his own merits to the supreme enlightenment and always abides diligently in the practice of wholesome statesWhen he commits a transgression he acknowledges it as such and confesses it to his coreligionistsAfterward he perfectly fulfills the right practiceHe is adroit and nimble in fulfilling his duties toward beings when these are conducive to their goodHe serves as their companionWhen beings are afflicted with the suffering of disease etc he prepares the appropriate remedyHe dispels the sorrow of those afflicted by the loss of wealth etcOf a helpful disposition he restrains with Dhamma those who need to be restrained rehabilitates them from unwholesome ways and establishes them in wholesome courses of conductHe inspires with Dhamma those in need of inspirationAnd when he hears about the loftiest most difficult inconceivably powerful deeds of the great bodhisattvas of the past issuing in the ultimate welfare and happiness of beings by means of which they reached perfect maturity in the requisites of enlightenment he does not become agitated and alarmed but reflects Those Great Beings were only human beingsBut by developing themselves through the orderly fulfillment of the training they attained the loftiest spiritual power and the highest perfection in the requisites of enlightenmentI too should practice the same training in virtue etcIn that way I too will gradually fulfill the training and in the end attain the same state Then with unflagging energy preceded by this faith he perfectly fulfills the training in virtue etcAgain he conceals his virtues and reveals his faultsHe is few in his wishes content fond of solitude aloof capable of enduring suffering and free from anxietyHe is not restless puffed up fickle scurrilous or scattered in speech but calm in his faculties and mindAvoiding such wrong means of livelihood as scheming etc he is endowed with proper conduct and a suitable resortHe sees danger in the slightest faults and having undertaken the rules of training trains himself in them energetic and resolute without regard for body or lifeHe does not tolerate even the slightest concern for his body or life but abandons and dispels it how much more then excessive concernHe abandons and dispels all the corruptions such as anger malice etc which are the cause for moral depravityHe does not become complacent over some minor achievement of distinction and does not shrink away but strives for successively higher achievementsIn this way the achievements he gains do not partake of diminution or stagnationThe Great Man serves as a guide for the blind explaining to them the right pathTo the deaf he gives signals with gestures of his hands and in that way benefits them with goodSo too for the dumbTo cripples he gives a chair or a vehicle or some other means of conveyanceHe strives that the faithless may gain faith that the lazy may generate zeal that those of confused mindfulness may develop mindfulness that those with wandering minds may become accomplished in concentration and that the dullwitted may acquire wisdomHe strives to dispel sensual desire illwill slothandtorpor restlessnessandworry and perplexity in those obsessed by these hindrances and to dispel wrong thoughts of sensuality illwill and aggression in those subjugated by these thoughtsOut of gratitude to those who have helped him he benefits and honors them with a similar or greater benefit in return congenial in speech and endearing in his wordsHe is a companion in misfortuneUnderstanding the nature and character of beings he associates with whatever beings need his presence in whatever way they need it and he practices together with whatever beings need to practice with him in whatever way of practice is necessary for themBut he proceeds only by rehabilitating them from the unwholesome and establishing them in the wholesome not in other waysFor in order to protect the minds of others bodhisattvas behave only in ways which increase the wholesomeSo too because his inclination is to benefit others he should never harm them abuse them humiliate them arouse remorse in them or incite them to act in ways which should be avoidedNor should he place himself in a higher position than those who are of inferior conductHe should be neither altogether inaccessible to others nor too easily accessible and he should not associate with others at the wrong timeHe associates with beings whom it is proper to associate with at the appropriate time and placeHe does not criticize those who are dear to others in front of them nor praise those who are resented by themHe is not intimate with those who are not trustworthyHe does not refuse a proper invitation or engage in persuasion or accept excessivelyHe encourages those endowed with faith with a discourse on the benefits of faith and he encourages as well those endowed with virtue learning generosity and wisdom with a discourse on the benefits of those qualitiesIf the bodhisattva has attained to the direct knowledges he may inspire a sense of spiritual urgency in the negligent by showing them the fate of those in hell etc as is fitThereby he establishes the faithless in faithHe makes them enter the Buddhas Dispensation and brings to maturity those already endowed with these qualitiesIn this way through his virtuous conduct the Great Mans immeasurable flood of merit and goodness ascends to ever increasing heightsThe detailed explanation of virtue is given in diverse ways in the Visuddhimagga in the passage beginning Virtue is the states beginning with volition present in one who abstains from the destruction of life etc or in one who fulfills the practice of the duties All that should be brought in hereOnly there is this distinction in that work the discussion of virtue has come down for beings who seek the enlightenment of disciples but here because the discussion is intended for great bodhisattvas it should be explained making compassion and skillful means the forerunnersJust as the Great Man does not dedicate the merits from his practice of virtue to his own release from affliction in the unfortunate destinations or to his own achievement of kingship in the fortunate destinations or to becoming a worldruling monarch a god Sakka Maara or Brahmaa so too he does not dedicate it to his own attainment of the threefold knowledge the six direct knowledges the four discriminations the enlightenment of a disciple or the enlightenment of a paccekabuddhaBut rather he dedicates it only for the purpose of becoming an omniscient Buddha in order to enable all beings to acquire the incomparable adornment of virtueThis is the method of practicing the perfection of virtueThe perfection of renunciation is the wholesome act of consciousness which occurs renouncing sense pleasures and existence preceded by the perception of their unsatisfactoriness and accompanied by compassion and skillful meansThe bodhisattva should practice the perfection of renunciation by first recognizing the unsatisfactoriness in sense pleasures etc according to the following method For one dwelling in a home there is no opportunity to enjoy the happiness of renunciation etc because the home life is the dwelling place of all the defilements because a wife and children impose restrictions and because the diverse crafts and occupations such as agriculture and trade lead to numerous entanglementsAnd sense pleasures like a drop of honey smeared over the blade of a sword give limited satisfaction and entail abundant harmThey are fleeting like a show perceived in a flash of lightning enjoyable only through a perversion of perception like the adornments of a madman a means of vengeance like a camouflaged pit of excrement unsatisfying like a thin drink or the water moistening the fingers afflictive like food which is inwardly rotten a cause for calamity like a baited hook the cause of suffering in the three times like a burning fire a basis for bondage like monkeys glue a camouflage for destruction like a murderers cloak a place of danger like a dwelling in an enemy village food for the Maara of the defilements like the supporter of ones foes subject to suffering through change like the enjoyment of a festival inwardly burning like the fire in the hollow of a tree fraught with danger like a ball of honey suspended from the bulrushes in an old pit intensifying thirst like a drink of salt water resorted to by the vulgar like liquor and wine and giving little satisfaction like a chain of bonesHaving recognized the unsatisfactoriness in sense pleasures in accordance with this method he should then by the reverse method contemplate the benefits in renunciation with a mind slanting sloping and inclining toward the happiness of renunciation solitude and peaceSince renunciation is rooted in the going forth the going forth should be undertakenIf the Great Being is living at a time when no Buddha has arisen in the world he should go forth under ascetics or wanderers who maintain the doctrine of kamma and the moral efficacy of actionBut when the perfectly enlightened Buddhas appear in the world he should go forth only in their DispensationHaving gone forth he should establish himself in virtue as described above and in order to cleanse his virtue should undertake the ascetic practicesFor Great Men who undertake the ascetic practices and maintain them properly become few in their wishes and contentThe stains of their defilements get washed off in the waters of such noble qualities as effacement solitude aloofness from society the arousal of energy and ease of maintenance and all their conduct becomes purified through their blameless rules observances and noble qualitiesEstablished in three of the ancient traditions of the ariyans they are able to achieve the fourth of the ariyan traditions ie delight in meditation entering and abiding in jhaana both access and absorption through whichever among the forty subjects of meditation are appropriateThus they completely fulfill the perfection of renunciationAt this point it would be proper to explain in detail the thirteen ascetic practices and the forty meditation subjects for the development of concentration  ie the ten kasinadevices the ten impurities the ten recollections the four Brahmavihaaras the four immaterial states the one perception and the one analysisBut since all these are explained in complete detail in the Visuddhimagga it should be understood in the way stated thereOnly there is this distinction in that work the subject is explained for beings who seek the enlightenment of disciplesBut here because it is intended for great bodhisattvas it should be explained making compassion and skillful means the forerunnersThis is the method of practicing the perfection of renunciationJust as light cannot coexist with darkness wisdom cannot coexist with delusionTherefore a bodhisattva wishing to accomplish the perfection of wisdom should avoid the causes of delusionThese are the causes of delusion discontent languor drowsiness lethargy delight in company attachment to sleep irresoluteness lack of enthusiasm for knowledge false overestimation of oneself noninterrogation not maintaining ones body properly lack of mental concentration association with dullwitted people not ministering to those possessed of wisdom selfcontempt false discrimination adherence to perverted views athleticism lack of a sense of spiritual urgency and the five hindrances or in brief any states which when indulged in prevent the unarisen wisdom from arising and cause the arisen wisdom to diminishAvoiding these causes of confusion one should apply effort to learning as well as to the jhaanas etcThis is an analysis of the sphere of learning the five aggregates the twelve sense bases the eighteen elements the four truths the twentytwo faculties the twelve factors of dependent origination the foundations of mindfulness etc the various classifications of phenomena such as the wholesome etc as well as any blameless secular fields of knowledge which may be suitable for promoting the welfare and happiness of beings particularly grammarThus with wisdom mindfulness and energy preceded by skillful means a bodhisattva should first thoroughly immerse himself in this entire sphere of learning  through study listening memorization learning and interrogation then he should establish others in learningIn this way the wisdom born of learning can be developedSo too out of his wish for the welfare of others the bodhisattva should develop the wisdom of ingenuity in creating opportunities to fulfill his various duties to his fellow beings and the skillful means in understanding their happiness and miseryThen he should develop wisdom born of reflection by first reflecting upon the specific nature of the phenomena such as the aggregates and then arousing reflective acquiescence in themNext he should perfect the preliminary portion of the wisdom born of meditation by developing the mundane kinds of full understanding through the discernment of the specific and general characteristics of the aggregates etcTo do so he should fully understand all internal and external phenomena without exception as follows This is mere mentalitymateriality which arises and ceases according to conditionsThere is here no agent or actorIt is impermanent in the sense of not being after having been suffering in the sense of oppression by rise and fall and nonself in the sense of being unsusceptible to the exercise of mastery Comprehending them in this way he abandons attachment to them and helps others to do so as wellEntirely out of compassion he continues to help his fellow beings enter and reach maturity in the three vehicles assists them to achieve mastery over the jhaanas deliverances concentrations attainments and mundane direct knowledges and does not desist until he reaches the very peak of wisdom and all the Buddhaqualities come within his graspThe wisdom born of meditation may be divided into two groupsThe first comprises the mundane direct knowledges together with their accessories namely the knowledge of the modes of psychic power the knowledge of the divine earelement the knowledge of penetrating other minds the knowledge of recollecting past lives the knowledge of the divine eye the knowledge of kammic retribution and the knowledge of the futureThe second comprises the five purifications  purification of view purification by overcoming doubt purification by knowledge and vision of what is and what is not the path purification by knowledge and vision of the way and purification by knowledge and visionThe first four of these are mundane the last is supramundaneAfter acquiring through study and interrogation a knowledge of the phenomena such as the aggregates etc constituting the soil of wisdom he should establish himself in the two purifications constituting its roots purification of virtue and purification of mind and then accomplish the five purifications just mentioned which constitute the trunk of wisdomSince the method for accomplishing these along with the analysis of their objective sphere is explained in complete detail in the Visuddhimagga it should be understood in the way given thereOnly in that work the explanation of wisdom has come down for beings seeking the enlightenment of disciplesBut here because it is intended for the great bodhisattvas it should be explained making compassion and skillful means the forerunnersOne further distinction must also be made here insight should be developed only as far as purification by knowledge and vision of the way without attaining purification by knowledge and visionA Great Being who has formed his aspiration for supreme enlightenment should for the sake of fulfilling his paaramiis always be devoted to what is proper and intent upon serviceThus he should be zealous in providing for the welfare of beings and from time to time day by day should reflect Have I accumulated any requisites of merit and of knowledge todayWhat have I done for the welfare of others In order to help all beings he should surrender some possession of his with a mind unconcerned with body or lifeWhatever action he does bodily or vocal all should be done with a mind slanting toward full enlightenment all should be dedicated to enlightenmentHe should turn his mind away from sense pleasures whether superior or inferior and should apply skillful means to the fulfillment of his various dutiesHe should work energetically for the welfare of beings be capable of enduring everything whether desirable or undesirable and should speak without deceptionHe should suffuse all beings with universal lovingkindness and compassionWhatever causes suffering for beings all that he should be ready to take upon himself and he should rejoice in the merits of all beingsHe should frequently reflect upon the greatness of the Buddhas and the greatness of their spiritual powerWhatever action he does by body or speech all should be preceded with a mind slanting toward full enlightenmentIn this way the Great Being the bodhisattva devoted to what is proper endowed with strength firm in striving day by day accumulates immeasurable requisites of merit and of knowledge through the practice of the paaramiisFurther having relinquished his own body and life for the use and protection of beings the bodhisattva should seek out and apply the antidotes to the various kinds of suffering to which beings are exposed  hunger thirst cold heat wind sun etcAnd whatever happiness he himself gains by alleviating these kinds of suffering and the happiness he gains when his own bodily and mental afflictions subside in delightful parks gardens mansions pools and forest abodes and the happiness of the blissful jhaanic attainments he hears are experienced by the Buddhas their enlightened disciples paccekabuddhas and great bodhisattvas established in the practice of renunciation  all that he seeks to procure universally for all beingsThis firstly is the method for a bodhisattva not yet established on the plane of concentrationOne established on the plane of concentration bestows upon beings the rapture tranquility happiness concentration and true knowledge produced in the achievements of distinction as they are experienced by himselfHe procures them and dedicates them to allSuch a bodhisattva should contemplate the whole world of sentient beings immersed in the great suffering of samsaara and in the sufferings of the defilements and kammaformations at its baseHe should see the beings in hell experiencing violent racking agonizing pains uninterruptedly over long periods produced as they are cut up dismembered split pulverized and roasted in scorching fires the great suffering of the animals due to their mutual hostility as they afflict harass and kill one another or fall into captivity at the hands of others and the suffering of the various classes of ghosts going about with their bodies aflame consumed and withered by hunger thirst wind and sun weeping and wailing as their food turns into vomit and spittleHe should contemplate as well the suffering experienced by human beings which is often indistinguishable from the suffering in the plane of misery the misery and ruin they encounter in their search the various punishments they may meet such as the cutting off of their hands etc ugliness deformity and poverty affliction by hunger and thirst being vanquished by the more powerful pressed into the service of others and made dependent upon others and when they pass away falling over into the hells the realm of ghosts and the animal kingdomHe should see the gods of the sensesphere being consumed by the fevers of lust as they enjoy their sense objects with scattered minds living with their fever unextinguished like a mass of fire stoked up with blasts of wind and fed with a stock of dry wood without peace dejected and dependent on othersAnd he should see the gods of the finematerial and immaterial spheres after so long a lifespan in the end succumb to the law of impermanence plunging from their heights back down into the round of birth aging and death like birds swooping swiftly down from the heights of the sky or like arrows shot by a strong archer descending in the distanceAnd having seen all this he should arouse a sense of spiritual urgency and suffuse all beings universally with lovingkindness and compassionAccumulating the requisites of enlightenment in this way by body speech and mind without interruption he should fulfill the perfection of energy arousing zeal while working thoroughly and perseveringly and acting without cowering in order that all the paaramiis may reach fulfillmentWhile striving for the state of Buddhahood  the store and repository of inconceivable immeasurable vast lofty stainless incomparable undefiled qualities  he should encourage the arising of energy for such energy is endowed with inconceivable spiritual power which common people cannot even hear about much less practiceIt is entirely through the spiritual power of energy that the practice of all the requisites of enlightenment succeeds  the threefold arising of the great aspiration the four grounds for Buddhahood the four bases of beneficence the single flavor of compassion the reflective acquiescence which is the specific condition for the realization of the Buddhaqualities being untainted amidst all things the perception of all beings as his own dear children not being fatigued by all the sufferings of samsaara the relinquishing of everything that may be given away delight in so giving the determination upon the higher virtue etc unshakeableness therein rapture and exultation in wholesome actions the inclination toward seclusion application to the jhaanas being insatiable in blameless states teaching the Dhamma to others as he has learned it out of the wish for their welfare firm initiative in setting beings upon the true path sagacity and heroism being imperturbable in the face of the abusive speech and wrongs of others the determination upon truth mastery over the meditative attainments the attainment of power through the direct knowledges the comprehension of the three characteristics the accumulation of the requisites for the supramundane path by practicing meditation in the foundations of mindfulness etc and the descent on to the nine supramundane statesThus from the time of forming the aspiration until the great enlightenment a bodhisattva should perfect his energy thoroughly and uninterruptedly without surrendering so that it might issue in higher and higher states of distinctionAnd when this energy succeeds all the requisites of enlightenment  patience truthfulness determination etc as well as giving virtue etc will succeed for all these occur in dependence on energyThe practice of patience and the rest should be understood in accordance with the same methodThus through giving relinquishing his own happiness and belongings to others he practices the benefiting of others in many ways through virtue the protection of their lives property and wives the nonbreach of his word endearing and beneficial speech noninjury etc through renunciation many kinds of beneficial conduct such as giving the gift of the Dhamma in return for their material gifts through wisdom skillful means in providing for their welfare through energy the arousing of zeal in his work without slacking off through patience the enduring of the wrongs of others through truthfulness not breaking his pledge to help others without deception through determination remaining unshakeable in rendering them help even when encountering difficulties through lovingkindness concern for their welfare and happiness and through equanimity remaining imperturbable whether others render help or inflict harmThis is the practice which the great bodhisattva compassionate for all beings undertakes for the sake of incalculable beings by means of which he accumulates immeasurable requisites of merit and knowledge not shared by worldlingsTheir condition has been statedThey should be accomplished thoroughlyThey are analyzed into thirty paaramiis ten paaramiis ten intermediate paaramiis and ten ultimate paaramiisHerein some teachers say that the ten basic paaramiis are the intermingled bright and dark qualities practiced by a bodhisattva who has just formed his aspiration whose end is the welfare of others and whose means are directed toward working for this end the intermediate paaramiis are the bright qualities untainted by any darkness and the ultimate paaramiis are the qualities which are neither dark nor brightOthers say that the basic paaramiis are being filled at the commencement the intermediate paaramiis are filled on the plane of bodhisattvahood and the ultimate paaramiis reach perfect fulfillment in all modes on the plane of BuddhahoodOr alternatively the basic paaramiis involve working for the welfare of others on the plane of bodhisattvahood the intermediate paaramiis working for ones own welfare and the ultimate paaramiis the fulfillment of the welfare of both oneself and others with the achievement of the Tathaagatas powers and grounds of selfconfidence on the plane of BuddhahoodThus they analyze the paaramiis according to the beginning middle and consummation by way of the resolution the undertaking and their completion respectivelyThe basic perfection of giving is the relinquishing of ones children wives and belongings such as wealth the intermediate perfection of giving the relinquishing of ones own limbs and the ultimate perfection of giving the relinquishing of ones own lifeThe three stages in the perfection of virtue should be understood as the nontransgression on account of the three  children and wife limbs and life the three stages in the perfection of renunciation as the renunciation of those three bases after cutting off attachment to them the three stages in the perfection of wisdom as the discrimination between what is beneficial and harmful to beings after rooting out craving for ones belongings limbs and life the three stages in the perfection of energy as striving for the relinquishing of the aforementioned things the three stages in the perfection of patience as the endurance of obstacles to ones belongings limbs and life the three stages in the perfection of truthfulness as the nonabandoning of truthfulness on account of ones belongings limbs and life the three stages in the perfection of determination as unshakeable determination despite the destruction of ones belongings limbs and life bearing in mind that the paaramiis ultimately succeed through unflinching determination the three stages in the perfection of lovingkindness as maintaining lovingkindness toward beings who destroy ones belongings etc and the three stages in the perfection of equanimity as maintaining an attitude of impartial neutrality toward beings and formations whether they are helpful or harmful in regard to the aforementioned three basesIn this way the analysis of the paaramiis should be understoodJust as the ten paaramiis become thirtyfold through analysis so they become sixfold through their specific nature as giving virtue patience energy meditation and wisdomWhen this set is considered the perfection of renunciation as the going forth into homelessness is included in the perfection of virtue as seclusion from the hindrances in the perfection of meditation and as a generally wholesome quality in all six paaramiisOne part of the perfection of truthfulness ie its aspect of truthful speech or abstinence from falsehood is included in the perfection of virtue and one part ie its aspect of truthful knowledge in the perfection of wisdomThe perfection of lovingkindness is included in the perfection of meditation and the perfection of equanimity in the perfections of meditation and wisdomThe perfection of determination is included in allThese six paaramiis fall into at least fifteen pairs of complementary qualities which perfect fifteen other pairs of qualitiesHowThe triad of giving virtue and patience perfects the abandoning of greed hatred and delusionThe triad of giving virtue and energy perfects the giving of wealth life and bodily vitalityThe triad of giving virtue and meditation perfects the three bases of meritorious deedsThe triad of giving virtue and wisdom perfects the triad of giving material gifts fearlessness and the DhammaIn the same way the other triads and tetrads may be applied to each other as is appropriate in each caseThese six paaramiis are also included in the four foundations which provide a synthesis of all the paaramiisWhat are theyThe foundation of truth the foundation of relinquishment the foundation of peace and the foundation of wisdomTherein taking them first without distinction after making his aspiration for the supramundane qualities the Great Being filled with compassion for all beings establishes the foundation of truth by acquiring all the paaramiis in conformity with his vow the foundation of relinquishment by relinquishing their opposites the foundation of peace by pacifying their opposites with all the qualities of the paaramiis and the foundation of wisdom by skillful means in promoting the welfare of others through those same qualitiesTaken separately giving is a proximate cause for the four foundations of wholesome qualities as follows since one vows to give to those who ask without deceiving them gives without violating ones vows and rejoices without deceiving them about the gift through the relinquishing of the opposite qualities such as stinginess etc through the pacification of greed hatred delusion and fear in regard to the objects to be given the recipients the act of giving and the loss of the objects to be given respectively through giving according to deserts at the proper time in the appropriate manner and through the preeminence of wisdomVirtue is a proximate cause for the four foundations thus through nontransgression of the restraint undertaken through the relinquishing of moral depravity through the pacification of misconduct and through the preeminence of wisdomPatience is a proximate cause for the four foundations thus through patient acceptance in accordance with ones vow through the relinquishing of discrimination against others on account of their wrongs through the pacification of the obsession of anger and through the preeminence of wisdomEnergy is a proximate cause for the four foundations through working for the welfare of others in accordance with ones vows through the relinquishing of dejection through the pacification of unwholesome qualities and through the preeminence of wisdomMeditation is a proximate cause for the four foundations through concern for the welfare of the world in accordance with ones vow through the relinquishing of the hindrances through the pacification of the mind and through the preeminence of wisdomAnd wisdom is a proximate cause for the four foundations through skillful means in promoting the welfare of others in accordance with ones vow through the relinquishing of unskillful activity through the pacification of the fevers springing from delusion and through the attainment of omniscienceThe foundation of truth is practiced by acting in accordance with ones vow and understanding the foundation of relinquishment by relinquishing objects of sense enjoyment and the defilement of sensuality the foundation of peace by the pacification of hatred and suffering and the foundation of wisdom by understanding and penetrationThe foundation of truth is embraced by the threefold truth and opposed to the three corruptionsThe foundation of relinquishing is embraced by the threefold relinquishment and opposed to the three corruptionsThe foundation of peace is embraced by the threefold pacification and opposed to the three corruptionsAnd the foundation of wisdom is embraced by the threefold knowledge and opposed to the three corruptionsThe foundation of truth embraces the foundations of relinquishment peace and wisdom through nondeceptiveness and through acting in accordance with ones vowThe foundation of relinquishment embraces the foundations of truth peace and wisdom through the relinquishing of their opposites and as the fruit of relinquishing everythingThe foundation of peace embraces the foundations of truth relinquishment and wisdom through the pacification of the fever of defilement and the fever of kammaAnd the foundation of wisdom embraces the foundations of truth relinquishment and peace since they are all preceded and accompanied by knowledgeThus all the paaramiis are grounded in truth clarified by relinquishment intensified by peace and purified by wisdomFor truth is the cause for their genesis relinquishment the cause for their acquisition peace the cause for their growth and wisdom the cause for their purificationIn the beginning truth is the foundation since his vow is made in accordance with truthIn the middle relinquishment is the foundation since after forming his aspiration the bodhisattva relinquishes himself for the welfare of othersIn the end peace is the foundation since the consummation is the attainment of perfect peaceAnd in every phase  the beginning the middle and the end  wisdom is the foundation since the entire career originates when wisdom is present does not exist when it is absent and because the nature accords with the vowThus it should be understood how the aggregation of the paaramiis is included in the four foundations which are adorned with numerous noble qualitiesAnd just as the paaramiis are all included in the four foundations they are also included in wisdom and compassionFor all the requisites of enlightenment can be included in wisdom and compassion and the noble qualities such as giving accompanied by wisdom and compassion are the requisites for the great enlightenment culminating in the perfection of BuddhahoodThe means by which the paaramiis are accomplished is the fourfactored method the accumulation without omission of all the requisites of merit etc for the sake of supreme enlightenment by performing them without deficiency performing them thoroughly with respect and high esteem performing them perseveringly without interruption and enduring effort over a long period without coming to a halt halfwayWe will explain the length of time laterFor the sake of the supreme enlightenment the Great Being striving for enlightenment should first of all surrender himself to the Buddhas thus I offer myself up to the Buddhas And whenever he obtains any possession he should first of all resolve upon it as a potential gift Whatever requisite of life comes my way that I will give to those who need it and I myself will only use what remains over from this giftWhen he has made a mental determination to completely relinquish whatever possessions come his way whether animate or inanimate there are four shackles to giving namely not being accustomed to giving in the past the inferiority of the object to be given the excellence and beauty of the object and worry over the loss of the objectWhen the bodhisattva possesses objects that can be given and suppliants are present but his mind does not leap up at the thought of giving and he does not want to give he should conclude Surely I have not been accustomed to giving in the past therefore a desire to give does not arise now in my mindSo that my mind will delight in giving in the future I will give a giftWith an eye for the future let me now relinquish what I have to those in need Thus he gives a gift  generous openhanded delighting in relinquishing one who gives when asked delighting in giving and in sharingIn this way the Great Being destroys shatters and eradicates the first shackle to givingAgain when the object to be given is inferior or defective the Great Being reflects Because I was not inclined to giving in the past at present my requisites are defectiveTherefore though it pains me let me give whatever I have as a gift even if the object is low and inferiorIn that way I will in the future reach the peak in the perfection of giving Thus he gives whatever kind of gift he can  generous openhanded delighting in relinquishing one who gives when asked delighting in giving and in sharingIn this way the Great Being destroys shatters and eradicates the second shackle to givingWhen a reluctance to give arises due to the excellence or beauty of the object to be given the Great Being admonishes himself Good man havent you made the aspiration for the supreme enlightenment the loftiest and most superior of all statesWell then for the sake of enlightenment it is proper for you to give excellent and beautiful objects as gifts Thus he gives what is excellent and beautiful  generous openhanded delighting in relinquishing one who gives when asked delighting in giving and in sharingIn this way the Great Man destroys shatters and eradicates the third shackle to givingWhen the Great Being is giving a gift and he sees the loss of the object being given he reflects thus This is the nature of material possessions that they are subject to loss and to passing awayMoreover it is because I did not give such gifts in the past that my possessions are now depletedLet me then give whatever I have as a gift whether it be limited or abundantIn that way in the future I shall reach the peak in the perfection of giving Thus he gives whatever he has as a gift  generous openhanded delighting in relinquishing one who gives when asked delighting in giving and in sharingIn this way the Great Being destroys shatters and eradicates the fourth shackle to givingReflecting upon them thus in whatever way is appropriate is the means for dispelling the harmful shackles to the perfection of givingThe same method used for the perfection of giving also applies to the perfection of virtue and the other perfectionsFurther selfsurrender to the Buddhas is also a means for the complete accomplishment of the paaramiisFor when the Great Man straining and striving for the fulfillment of the requisites of enlightenment encounters troubles difficult to endure depriving him of happiness and his means of support or when he encounters injuries imposed by beings and formations  difficult to overcome violent sapping the vitality  then since he has surrendered himself to the Buddhas he reflects I have relinquished my very self to the BuddhasWhatever comes let it come For this reason he does not waver does not quake does not undergo the least vacillation but remains absolutely unshaken in his determination to undertake the goodIn brief the destruction of selflove and the development of love for others are the means for the accomplishing of the paaramiisFor by fully understanding all things in accordance with their nature the Great Being who has formed the resolution to attain the supreme enlightenment remains untainted by them and his selflove thereby becomes eliminated and exhaustedThen since through the repeated practice of great compassion he has come to regard all beings as his dear children his lovingkindness compassion and affection for them increaseIn conformity with this stage the Great Man having expelled the defilements such as stinginess etc that are opposed to the requisites of enlightenment and having dispelled greed hatred and delusion in regard to himself and others further causes people to enter and reach maturity in the three vehicles by benefiting them to the utmost with the four bases of beneficence which accompany the four foundations namely giving loving speech beneficent conduct and equality of treatmentFor the great compassion and the great wisdom of the Great Beings are adorned by givingTheir giving is adorned and accompanied by loving speech loving speech by beneficent conduct and beneficent conduct by equality of treatmentWhen the bodhisattvas are practicing the requisites of enlightenment they treat all beings without exception as equal to themselves and perfect their sense of equality by remaining the same under all circumstances pleasant or painfulAnd when they become Buddhas their ability to train people is perfected by benefiting them to the utmost with these same four bases of beneficence brought to fulfillment by the four foundationsFor the perfectly enlightened Buddhas the base of giving is brought to fulfillment by the foundation of relinquishment the base of loving speech by the foundation of truth the base of beneficent conduct by the foundation of wisdom and the base of equal treatment by the foundation of peaceFor in regard to parinibbaana all the disciples and paccekabuddhas are completely equal to the Tathaagatas they are identical without any distinctionThus it is said There is no diversity among them in regard to emancipationAs a minimum four incalculables and a hundred thousand great aeons as a middle figure eight incalculables and a hundred thousand great aeons and as a maximum sixteen incalculables and a hundred thousand great aeonsThis threefold division obtains by way of those in whom wisdom is predominant those in whom faith is predominant and those in whom energy is predominant respectivelyFor those in whom wisdom is predominant faith is weakest and wisdom keenest for those in whom faith is predominant wisdom is middling and for those in whom energy is predominant wisdom is weakestBut supreme enlightenment must be achieved by the power of wisdom so it is said in the commentaryBut others say that the classification of the time required for bodhisattvas obtains by way of the keen middling and tender quality of their energyStill others say that without distinction the three divisions of time correspond to the time required for their requisites of enlightenment to reach fulfillment which in turn is determined by the keen middling and tender quality of their factors maturing toward emancipationBodhisattvas also become threefold at the moment they form the aspiration according to their division into those who comprehend through a condensed teaching those who comprehend through an elaborated teaching and those who are capable of trainingAmong these one who comprehends through a condensed teaching has such supporting conditions that if he were disposed toward the enlightenment of a disciple he could attain arahatship together with the four discriminations and the six direct knowledges while listening to a fourline stanza from the lips of a perfectly enlightened Buddha even while the third line is as yet unconcludedThe second has such supporting conditions that if he were disposed toward the enlightenment of a disciple he could attain arahatship together with the six direct knowledges while listening to a fourline stanza from the lips of the Exalted One even while the fourth line is as yet unconcludedAnd the third has the supporting conditions to attain arahatship together with the six direct knowledges when the fourline stanza he hears from the Exalted One is concludedThese three types who form their aspirations without any allotted division of time receive predictions directly from the BuddhasThen they fulfill the paaramiis in order and reach the supreme enlightenment according to the aforementioned time allotted to each typeBut that these Great Beings day by day giving great gifts like those given by Vessantara accumulating all the other paaramiis in the same way making the five great relinquishings reaching the summit in conduct for the good of kinsmen conduct for the good of the world and conduct developing intelligence  that they should become perfectly enlightened Buddhas before the time allotted to their respective types is fulfilled this is not possibleWhyBecause their knowledge is not yet mature enough and their accumulation of the factors issuing in Buddhahood not yet completeFor just as grain ripens only after the lapse of the time required so too the supreme enlightenment is perfected only after the lapse of the aforementioned periods of timeBefore then even though striving with all his might the bodhisattva cannot attain enlightenmentThe paaramiis are fulfilled according to the aforementioned distinction of timeThus it should be understoodThe benefits obtained by bodhisattvas who have formed their aspirations are explained thusSome other benefits of the paaramiis are the following The sixteen wonderful and marvelous qualities that begin Mindful and clearly comprehending AAnanda the bodhisattva passes away from the Tusita heaven and descends into his mothers womb the thirtytwo portents such as cold disappears and heat is allayed and when the bodhisattva is born this ten thousandfold worldsystem shakes trembles and quakes etc and the other qualities shown here and there in the Jaatakas the Buddhavamsa etc such as the fulfillment of the bodhisattvas wishes his mastery over kamma and so forthOther benefits are the pairs of complementary qualities such as nongreed and nonhatred already discussedMoreover from the time that he makes the aspiration the bodhisattva becomes like a father to all beings wishing for their welfareBy reason of his distinguished qualities he is worthy of offerings worthy of reverence worthy of esteem a supreme field of meritHe is generally dear to humans and to nonhumans alike and is protected by deitiesBecause his mind is grounded in lovingkindness and compassion he cannot be harmed by wild beasts etcWhatever order of beings he is reborn in on account of his distinguished merit he surpasses the other beings there in his superior beauty fame happiness strength and dominionHe is healthy and robustHis faith is very pure and lucidHis energy mindfulness concentration and wisdom are also very pure and lucidHis defilements disturbances and passions are weakBecause his defilements are weak he is easy to admonish adroit patient meek congenial and hospitableHe is free from anger malice denigration domineering envy stinginess craftiness hypocrisy obstinacy pride presumption and negligenceHe endures torments at the hands of others but never torments anyone himselfWhenever he enters a village area the unarisen dangers and calamities facing the beings there generally do not arise and those which have arisen subsideAnd whenever he is reborn in the planes of misery unlike the common inhabitants there he is not oppressed by excessive suffering but acquires an even greater sense of spiritual urgencyTherefore these distinguished qualities of the Great Man  such as being like a father to beings being worthy of offerings etc found in this or that state of existence are the benefits of the paaramiisFurther the accomplishment of lifespan the accomplishment of form the accomplishment of family the accomplishment of sovereignty credibility and greatness of spiritual power are also benefits of the Great Mans paaramiisTherein the accomplishment of lifespan is length of life or longevity in whatever state of existence he takes rebirth in by this means he concludes whatever wholesome undertakings he began and accumulates many wholesome qualitiesThe accomplishment of form is beauty of form comeliness or loveliness by this means he inspires confidence and esteem in beings who take physical form as their standardThe accomplishment of family is rebirth in excellent families by this means he is to be worth approaching and ministering to by beings who are intoxicated with the vanity of birth etcThe accomplishment of sovereignty is greatness of power greatness of influence and greatness of retinue by means of these he is able to benefit with the four bases of beneficence those who need to be benefited and to restrain with Dhamma those who need to be restrainedCredibility means trustworthiness reliability by this means he becomes an authority for beings and his command cannot be disregardedGreatness of spiritual power means magnitude of spiritual power by this means he cannot be vanquished by others but he himself invariably vanquishes them  by Dhamma by righteousness and by his genuine noble qualitiesThus the accomplishment of lifespan and so forth are benefits of the Great Mans paaramiisThese are the causes for the growth of his own boundless requisites of merit and the means by which he leads other beings to enter and reach maturity in the three vehiclesTheir fruit is in brief the state of perfect BuddhahoodIn detail it is the acquisition of the formbody resplendent with the multitude of meritorious qualities such as the thirtytwo characteristics of a Great Man the eighty minor marks of physical beauty the fathomwide aura etc and founded upon this the glorious Dhammabody radiant with its collection of infinite and boundless meritorious qualities  the ten powers the four grounds of selfconfidence the six kinds of knowledge not held in common with others the eighteen unique Buddhaqualities and so forthAnd so numerous are the Buddhaqualities that even a perfectly enlightened Buddha could not finish describing them even after many aeonsThis is their fruitAnd it is saidThe Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creedsFounded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topicsIts publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddhas discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practiceThese works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first aroseParts of this analysis of the Triple Gem were originally used to teach new monks here at the temple and have been printed twice in book formNow that a group of people who feel that the book would be beneficial to Buddhists at large have pooled their resources and asked permission to print it a third time I have decided to expand it into a handbook for all Buddhist adherents  ie for all who have declared the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha to be their refugeOnce we have made such a declaration we are dutybound to learn exactly what the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha areOtherwise we will follow our religion blindly without realizing its aims or the benefits  called puñña or merit  that come from its practice inasmuch as Buddhism is a religion of selfhelpFurthermore we as Thai people are known throughout the world as Buddhists but my feeling is that there are very few of us who know the standards of the Buddha Dhamma and SanghaAlthough many of us are Buddhist we are Buddhist mostly through custom not through informed awarenessAltogether there are two ways of adhering to the religion rationally and irrationallyTo adhere to the religion irrationally means to adhere to it blindly following ones teachers or companions holding to whatever they say is good without showing any interest as to whether it really is good or notThis is like a person of no discernment who uses whatever paper money comes his way If it turns out to be counterfeit hell be punished and fined in a variety of waysThis is what it means to adhere to the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha irrationallyTo adhere to the religion rationally means not to follow ones own prejudices or those of ones teachers or companions but to follow the principles of the texts holding to the DhammaVinaya as ones standard like a legal document affixed with the government seal carrying the force of law throughout the land making exceptions for no oneWhoever then transgresses the law cant be regarded as a good citizenSo it is with the religion If we want to know if a practice is good or bad right or wrong worthy of respect or not we should check it against the standards established by the Buddha which are eight in number Any behavior that None of these eight forms of behavior qualify as the doctrine or discipline of BuddhismOnce we know that these forms of behavior are not what the Buddha intended we should abandon them completelyThus all of us who respect the Buddhas teachings should  instead of working at crosspurposes  join our hearts to cleanse and correct the practice of the religionMonks novices lay men and lay women should make a point of helping one another in the area of reformWhatever is already good we should maintain with respectWhatever isnt we should exert pressure to improveWell then meet with whats truly good like rice If you cook good clean husked white rice youll eat with pleasureIf you cook unhusked rice or a potful of husks theyll stick in your own throatIf we let any bad factions go uncorrected they will burden the hearts of their supporters who will become like people who cook rice husks to eatAre we going to let one another be so stupid as to eat rice husksBy and large though most lay people dont see this as their dutyAs for the monks and novices they throw the responsibility on the lay people and so we do nothing but keep throwing it back and forth like thisWhen things have a bearing on all of us we should by all means unite our hearts and accept joint responsibilityOnly things that have no bearing on us should we leave to othersUnless we act in this way what is good  the religion  will fall from our graspAnd when the religion falls from our grasp lay men will become obstacles ie theyll keep creating obstacles in the way of finding meritLay women will become the color of crows ie dark and evil in their behaviorNovices will become sham novices careless spattered and filthy and monks will become goats missing out on the flavor of the Dhamma like the nanny goat who has to go hungry because her milk has been taken and drunk by people more intelligent than sheIn India for instance there are hardly any monks left to make merit withMonks are the important faction because they are the frontline troops or standardbearers in the fight with the enemy  evilOrdinarily soldiers have to adhere to the code of their army and to be sincere in performing their dutiesAs for the duties enjoined by the religion they are twoVipassanadhura the practice of tranquillity and insight meditationThese two practices are our primary duties as monks and novicesIf we dont devote ourselves to these two lines of practice well become a fifth column within the religion enemies of the good standards of the Dhamma and VinayaMonks will become political monks warmaking monks loudspeaker monks  loudspeaker monks are those who can teach others but cant teach themselvesThey can speak Dhamma but their hearts have no Dhamma and so they become the enemies of those who practice the Dhamma and Vinaya rightly and wellThus I ask all Buddhists not to turn a deaf ear or a blind eye to these problemsIf we hold that its none of our business the consequences could well flare up and spread to burn usFor this reason I ask that we all help one another to look after the religionActually all human beings born need a set of customs and traditions  called religion  to which they give special respectOtherwise we will have no principles of good and evil or of moral virtueWhatever religion this may be is up to the individual adherentsI ask only that they respect their religion sincerely and rightly for the sake of true purityIf we were to use only worldly knowledge to keep order it would work only in public placesIn private or secret places order wouldnt lastBut as for religion once people have studied so that they really know good and evil they wouldnt dare do evil either in public or in privateReligion is thus one of the important mainstays of the worldIf we human beings had no moral virtue imbedded in our hearts even the greatest power on earth would be able to keep us in line only temporarily and even then it wouldnt be able to influence our minds the way the moral virtue that comes from religion canFor this reason the practice of moral virtue is one way of helping the religion and the worldNow Im not claiming to be a heavenly being or anyone specialIm simply a person who wishes the religion wellSo if anything in this book is defective  in terms of the expression or the Pali  I hope that knowledgeable people will forgive me for its not the case that Im expert in a wide range of mattersOrdinarily for the world to experience happiness and harmony there has to be a teaching or tradition generally respected as goodThis being the case Bodhisattvas arise  people who develop goodness on the grand scale for the sake of attaining right selfawakeningOnce they have reached this goal they are termed Buddhas Awakened OnesFor Bodhisattvas to succeed in this direction they have to devote themselves to perfecting ten virtues These ten perfections are the factors that enable a Bodhisattva to succeed in becoming an arahant a Pure OneOnce he attains this state three qualities  called actualized virtues  arise in his heartThese qualities enable the Buddha to teach the Dhamma in a beneficial wayHis conduct in this area is of three sorts Having achieved his own purposes he acts for the benefit of living beings throughout the world and teaches the Dhamma to his own circle of relativesThere are three aspects to the Buddha The good practices he followed  such as virtue concentration and discernment which are aspects of his activityThese are called dhammanimitta of the Buddha symbols of his inner quality Vimutti  release from ignorance craving attachment and kamma attaining nibbana the supreme quality a quality that does not dieA person of little intelligence will use bark to build himself a home a person of medium intelligence will use sapwood while a person of sharp intelligence will build his home of heartwoodSo it is with those of us who take refuge in the BuddhaBut in any case were better off than people without a homeLike rats or lizards who have to live in the hollows of trees and are in for trouble if people set the trees on fire If we place our trust in our life our bodies or our worldly possessions well have no refuge when the fires of death reach usOr as when a boat sinks in the middle of the ocean A person without a lifevest is in serious dangerFor this reason we should educate ourselves so as to find a refuge that will benefit us both in this life and in lives to comeAnother comparison The sages of the past used the term Buddharatana comparing the Buddha to a jewelNow there are three sorts of jewels artificial gems gemstones such as rubies or sapphires and diamonds which are held to be the highestThe aspects of the Buddha might be compared to these three sorts of jewelsTo place confidence in the external aspect  the body of the Buddha or images made to represent him  is like dressing up with artificial gemsTo show respect for the practices followed by the Buddha by giving rise to them within ourselves is like dressing up with rubies and sapphiresTo reach the quality of deathlessness is like dressing in diamonds from head to toeBut no matter what sort of jewels we use to dress up in were better off than savages who go around hanging bones from their necks who look unkempt and  whats more  are bound to be haunted by the bones they wearThe bones here stand for the body ie our attachment to the body as really being oursActually our body comes for the most part from the bodies of other animals  the food weve eaten  so how can we seriously take it to be our ownWhoever insists on regarding the body as his or her own is like a savage or a swindler  and as a swindler is bound to receive punishment in proportion to the crimeThus we should regard the body as money borrowed for the span of a lifetime to be used as capitalAnd we should search for profits so as to release ourselves from our debts by searching for another better form of goodness the qualities of the Buddha that he left as teachings for all of his followersThese qualities briefly put are Pañña the intuitive discernment that comes from developing mental concentrationVimutti release from defilementThese are qualities that all Buddhists should develop within themselves so as to gain Awakening following the example of the Buddha becoming Savaka Buddhas an opportunity open  without exception and with no restrictions of time or place  to all who follow his teachingsBuddhists who revere the Buddha in the full sense of the word should have two sorts of symbols with them to serve as reminders of their tradition Buddhaguna the qualities that form the inner symbol of the Buddha ie the proper practice of his teachingsWhoever takes a stand in this manner is bound to be victorious both within and without safe from such enemies as temptation and mortalityOur nations flag and the people of our nation are two different thingsJust as our flag will have value only if the people of our nation are good and preserve the fullness of the nations qualities so too we Buddhists have to respect both our flag  images of the Buddha  and the qualities of the Buddha if we are to be good BuddhistsOtherwise we will suffer from not having fulfilled our responsibilitiesTo take an example we Thai people in order to be Thai in the full sense have to possess a number of qualifications the ability to speak and to read Thai acquaintance with Thai customs and traditions the ability to benefit ourselves and to spread those benefits to help care for the needs of our parents spouses and childrenAnd not only that If we have the ability and the energy  physical mental financial or the energy of our virtues  we should expand those benefits to help our fellow human beings in general throughout the nationThis is what it means to be Thai in the full sense of the wordIn the same way we who revere the image of the Buddha and the Buddhas good qualities should have them with us at all times if we are to receive the full benefits that come from being Buddhist and to maintain the peace and wellbeing of Buddhists at largeThere are three levels to the Dhamma the teachings of the Buddha BPatipatti following the practice of moral virtue concentration and discernment as derived from ones study of the CanonPativedha LiberationAThe study of the Dhamma can be done in any of three ways Nissaranatthapariyatti studying for the sake of emancipationBhandagarikapariyatti studying to be a storehouse keeperStudying like a water viper means to study the words of the Buddha without then putting them into practice having no sense of shame at doing evil disobeying the monastic code making oneself like a poisonous snakehead full of the fires of greed anger and delusionStudying for the sake of emancipation means to study the Buddhas teachings out of a desire for merit and wisdom with a sense of conviction and high regard for their worth  and then once we have reached an understanding bringing our thoughts words and deeds into line with those teachings with a high sense of reverence and respectTo try to bring the Buddhas teachings into line with ourselves is the wrong approach  because for the most part we are full of defilements cravings views and conceitsIf we act in this way we are bound to be more at fault than those who try to bring themselves into line with the teachings Such people are very hard to find fault withStudying to be a storehouse keeper refers to the education of people who no longer have to be trained ie of arahants the highest level of the Noble OnesSome arahants when they were still ordinary runofthemill people heard the Dhamma directly from the Buddha once or twice and were able immediately to reach the highest attainmentThis being the case they lacked a wideranging knowledge of worldly conventions and traditions and so with an eye to the benefit of other Buddhists they were willing to undergo a certain amount of further educationThis way of studying the Dhamma is called sikkhagaravata respect for the trainingBThe practice of the Dhamma means to conduct oneself in line with the words of the Buddha as gathered under three headings Concentration intentness of mind centered on one of the themes of meditation such as the breath Discernment insight and circumspection with regard to all fashioned things ie physical properties aggregates and sense mediaTo conduct oneself in this manner is termed practicing the DhammaBy and large though Buddhists tend to practice the Dhamma in a variety of ways that arent in line with the true path of practiceIf we were to classify their ways of practice there would be threeTo put the world first means to practice for the sake of such worldly rewards as prestige material gains praise and sensual pleasuresWhen we practice this way we are actually torturing ourselves because undesirable things are bound to occur Having attained prestige we can lose itHaving acquired material gains we can lose themHaving received praise we can receive censureHaving experienced pleasure we can see it disintegrateFar from the paths fruitions and nibbana we torture ourselves by clinging to these things as our ownTo put the self first means to practice in accordance with our own opinions acting in line with whatever those opinions may beMost of us tend to side with ourselves getting stuck on our own views and conceits because our study of the Dhamma hasnt reached the truth of the Dhamma and so we take as our standard our own notions composed of four forms of personal bias b Bhayagati fearing certain forms of power or authority and thus not daring to practice the Dhamma as we truly shouldc Dosagati acting under the power of anger defilement craving conceits and viewsd Mohagati practicing misguidedly not studying or searching for what is truly good assuming that were already smart enough or else that were too stupid to learn staying buried in our habits with no thought of extracting ourselves from our sensual pleasuresAll of these ways of practice are called putting the self firstTo put the Dhamma first means to follow the Noble Eightfold Path bRight Resolve thinking of how to rid ourselves of whatever qualities we know to be wrong and immoral ie seeing the harm in sensual desires in that they bring on suffering and stresscRight Speech speaking the truth not saying anything divisive or inciteful not saying anything coarse or vulgar in situations where such words would not be proper not saying anything uselessEven though what we say may be worthwhile if our listener isnt interested then our words would still count as uselessdRight Action being true to our duties not acting in ways that would be corrupt or bring harm to ourselves or otherseRight Livelihood obtaining wealth in ways that are honest searching for it in a moral way and using it in a moral wayfRight Effort persisting in ridding ourselves of all that is wrong and harmful in our thoughts words and deeds persisting in giving rise to what would be good and useful to ourselves and others in our thoughts words and deeds without a thought for the difficulty or weariness involved acting persistently so as to be a mainstay to othersgRight Mindfulness being mindful and deliberate making sure not to act or speak through the power of inattention or forgetfulness making sure to be constantly mindful in our thoughtshRight Concentration keeping the mind centered and resilientNo matter what we do or say no matter what moods may strike the heart the heart keeps its poise firm and unflinching in the four levels of jhanaThese eight factors can be reduced to three  virtue concentration and discernment  called the middle way the heart of the Buddhas teachingsThe middleness of virtue means to be pure in thought word and deed acting out of compassion seeing that the life of others is like your own that their possessions are like your own feeling benevolence loving others as much as yourselfWhen you and they are equal in this way you are bound to be upright in your behavior like a wellbalanced burden that when placed on your shoulders doesnt cause you to tip to one side or the otherBut even then you are still in a position of having to shoulder a burdenSo you are taught to focus the mind on a single preoccupation This can be called holding in your hands  ie holding the mind in the middle  or concentrationThe middleness of concentration means focusing on the present not sending your thoughts into the past or future holding fast to a single preoccupationAs for the middleness of discernment No matter what preoccupations may come passing by you are able to rid yourself of all feelings of liking or disliking approval or rejectionYou dont cling even to the one preoccupation that has arisen as a result of your own actionsYou put down what you have been holding in your hands you dont fasten onto the past present or futureThis is releaseWhen our virtue concentration and discernment are all in the middle this way were safeJust as a boat going down the middle of a channel or a car that doesnt run off the side of the road can reach its destination without beaching or running into a tree so too people who practice in this way are bound to reach the qualities they aspire to culminating in the paths and fruitions leading to nibbana which is the main point of the Buddhas teachingsSo in short putting the Dhamma first means to search solely for purity of heartThe attainment of the Dhamma refers to the attainment of the highest quality nibbanaIf we refer to the people who reach this attainment there are four sorts Tevijjo those who attain the three skillsChalabhiñño those who attain the six intuitive powersCatuppatisambhidappatto those who attain the four forms of acumenTo explain sukhavipassako Vipassana and asavakkhayañana differ only in nameIn actuality they refer to the same thing the only difference being that vipassana refers to the beginning stage of insight and asavakkhayañana to the final stage clear and true comprehension of the four Noble TruthsTo explain tevijjo The three skills are b Cutupapatañana knowledge of where living beings are reborn  on refined levels or base  after they diec Asavakkhayañana the awareness that enables one to do away with the fermentations in ones characterTo explain chalabhiñño The six intuitive powers are b Dibbasota clairaudience the ability to hear far distant sounds beyond ordinary human powersc Cetopariyañana the ability to know the thoughts of othersd Pubbenivasanussatiñana the ability to remember previous livese Dibbacakkhu clairvoyance the ability to see far distant objects beyond ordinary human powersSome people can even see other levels of being with their clairvoyant powersf Asavakkhayañana the awareness that does away with the fermentation of defilementTo explain catuppatisambhidappatto The four forms of acumen are b Dhammapatisambhida acumen with regard to all mental qualitiesc Niruttipatisambhida acumen with regard to linguistic conventionsd Patibhanapatisambhida acumen in speaking on the spur of the moment knowing how to answer any question so as to clear up the doubts of the person askingThis ends the discussion of the virtues of the four classes of people  called arahants  who have reached the ultimate quality nibbanaAs for the essence of what it means to be an arahant though there is only one point  freedom from defilement This is what it means to attain the Dhamma the other virtues being simply adornmentThe three levels of Dhamma we have discussed are like the Buddha compared to jewels There are many kinds of jewels to choose from depending on how much wealth  discernment  we haveAll of the qualities we have mentioned so far to put them briefly so as to be of use come down to this Practice so as to give rise to virtue concentration and discernment within yourselfOtherwise you wont have a refuge or shelterA person without the qualities that provide refuge and shelter is like a person without a home  a delinquent or a vagrant  who is bound to wander shiftlessly aboutSuch people are hollow inside like a clock without any workings Even though it has a face and hands it cant tell anyone where it is what time it is or whether its morning noon or nightPeople who arent acquainted with the Dhamma within themselves are like people blind from birth Even though they are born in the world of human beings they dont know the light of the sun and moon that enables human beings to seeThey get no benefit from the light of the sun and moon or the light of fire and being blind they then go about proclaiming to those who can see that there is no sun no moon and no brightness to the worldAs a result they mislead those whose eyes are already a little blearyIn other words some groups say that the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha dont exist that they were invented to fool the gullibleNow the Dhamma is something subtle and fine like the firepotential that exists in the air or in various elements and that if we have enough common sense can be drawn out and put to useBut if were fools we can sit staring at a bamboo tube from dawn to dusk without ever seeing fire at allAnyone who believes that there is no Buddha Dhamma or Sangha no series of paths or fruitions leading to nibbana no consciousness that experiences death and rebirth is like the fool sitting and staring at the bamboo tubeHere I would like to tell a story as an allegory of those who arent acquainted with the DhammaThere once was a man living in the woods who with his five sons started growing crops in a clearing about a mile from their home villageHe built a small shack at the clearing and would often take his sons to stay thereOne morning he started a fire in the shack and told his sons to look after the fire for he was going out to hunt for food in the forestIf the fire goes out he told them get some fire from my bamboo tube and start it up again Then he set out to search for food for his sonsAfter he had left his sons got so wrapped up in their play that when they finally took a look at the fire they found that it was completely outSo they had the first son go get some fire to start it up againThe first son walked over and tried knocking on the bamboo tube but didnt see any fireSo they had the second son get some fire from the tube He opened it up but didnt see any fire insideAll he saw were two bamboo chips but he didnt know what to do with themSo the third son came over for a look and since he didnt see any fire he took a knife to cut the tube in half but still didnt see any fireThe fourth son went over and seeing the two halves lying there shaved them down into thin strips to find the fire in them but didnt see any fire at allFinally the fifth son went over to look for fire but before he went he said to his brothers Whats the matter with you guys that you cant get any fire from the bamboo tubeWhat a bunch of fools you areIll go get it myself With that he went to look at the bamboo tube and found it split into strips lying in pileRealizing what his brothers had done and thinking What a bunch of harebrains he reached for a mortar and pestle and ground up the bamboo strips to find the fire in themBy the time he ran out of strength he had ground them into a powder but he still hadnt found any fireSo he snuck off to play by himselfEventually toward noon the father returned from the forest and found that the fire had gone outSo he asked his sons about it and they told him how they had looked for fire in the bamboo tube without finding anyIdiots he thought theyve taken my firestarter and pounded it to bitsFor that I wont fix them any foodLet em starve As a result the boys didnt get anything to eat the entire dayThose of us who arent acquainted with the brightness of the Dhamma  Dhammo padipo  lying within us who dont believe that the Dhamma has value for ourselves and others are lacking in discernment like the boys looking for fire in the bamboo tubeThus we bring about our own ruin in various ways wasting our lives born in darkness living in darkness dying in darkness and then reborn in more darkness all over againEven though the Dhamma lies within us we cant get any use from it and thus will suffer for a long time to come like the boys who ruined their fathers firestarter and so had to go without foodThe Dhamma lies within us but we dont look for itIf we hope for goodness whether on a low or a high level well have to look here inside if we are to find what is truly goodBut before we can know ourselves in this way we first have to know  through study and practice  the principles taught by the BuddhaRecorded Dhamma is simply one of the symbols of the Buddhas teachingsThe important point is to actualize the Dhamma through the complete practice of virtue concentration and discernmentThis is an essential part of the religion the part that forms the inner symbol of all those who practice rightly and wellWhether the religion will be good or bad whether it will prosper or decline depends on our practice not on the recorded doctrine because the recorded doctrine is merely a symbolSo if we aim at goodness we should focus on developing our inner quality through the Dhamma of practiceAs for the main point of Buddhism thats the Dhamma of attainment the transcendent quality nibbanaThe word Sangha if translated as a substantive refers to those who have ordained and are wearing the yellow robeTranslated as a quality it refers to all people in general who have practiced correctly in line with the Buddhas teachingsMembers of the monastic order however are of all sorts and so we have two groups Membership in the conventional Sangha is attained through consent of the Order in a formal ceremony with witnesses following the procedures set out in the VinayaMembership in the Noble Sangha is attained when the quality of transcendence appears in ones heart as a result of ones own behavior and practice with no formalities of any sort whatsoeverAll Buddhists  whether formally ordained or not no matter what their sex color or social position  can become members of this SanghaThis is termed being ordained by the Dhamma or being selfordained in a way that cannot be faultedTo speak in abstract terms the qualities of transcendence stable and sure that appear in the hearts of those who practice  leading them solely to the higher realms and closing off the four states of destitution  are taken together called the Noble SanghaAMembers of the conventional Sangha with regard to the way they conduct themselves fall into four groups Upakilika those who become ordained without any respect for the training looking simply for pastimes for their own enjoyment  collecting plants playing chess gambling buying lottery tickets betting on horses  looking for gain in ways forbidden by the Vinaya disobeying the words of the Buddha disregarding the virtues set out in the scriptures undermining the religionUpamuyuhika those who are closeminded and misguided unwilling to train themselves in heightened virtue concentration or discernmentEven though they may have some education and knowledge they still keep themselves closedminded making excuses based on their teachers the time the place and their accustomed beliefs and practicesStuck where they are such people are unwilling to change their ways so as to accord with the principles of the doctrineUpanissarana those who desire merit and wisdom who search for the true principles of the Dhamma and Vinaya who set their hearts on studying with reverence and respect and conduct themselves in line with what they have learned who aim for the merit and wisdom offered by Buddhism for the path leading to release from suffering who rightly follow the Lord Buddhas teachings ie b Anupaghato They arent vindictivec Patimokkhe ca samvaro They stay well within the precepts of the Patimokkha and dont disobey the injunctions of the Vinaya  like good citizens desired by the nation who stay within the bounds of the governments lawsd Mattaññuta ca bhattasmim They have a sense of moderation in searching for and using the four necessities of lifeThey understand how to make the best use of things  knowing whats beneficial and whats harmful what is and what isnt of use to the body considering things carefully before making use of theme Pantañca sayanasanam They favor quiet secluded places to stayTo quote from the Canon these include Suññagaragato va or to uninhabited dwellings in places far off the beaten track Rukkhamulagato va or living under the shade of a tree in a cave or under an overhanging cliff face so as to aid the heart in attaining concentrationf Adhicitte ca ayogo They make a persistent effort through the practice of concentration to cleanse the heart freeing it from such Hindrances as sensual desireEtam buddhana sasanam All of these factors are the teachings of the BuddhasHow can a person who harms himself and others be a good monkThese then are the attributes of the SanghaIn broad terms they come down to two sortsGunasampatti the inner qualifications  virtue and truth  of those worthy meditators who are held to be the field of merit for the worldThose with the necessary resources  ie discernment  will obtain a good fieldWhatever seed they plant will give a yield well worth the effort involved just as an intelligent person who puts his savings in a safe national bank will protect his capital from loss and even earn a profitJust as a good rice field has four characteristics  the ground is level and even the dike has a water gate that is easy to open and close the soil is rich in nutrients the rainfall comes at the proper season  in the same way members of the Sangha who are to be a field of merit for the world have to be endowed with the four following qualitiesb Dosagati  or under the power of ill will or anger towards othersc Mohagati  or under the power of delusiond Bhayagati  or under the power of fear or apprehension of any sort whatsoeverThey aim at what is right and true as their major concern both in the presence of others and in private keeping themselves always on a par with their principlesAs for the analogy of a water gate that is easy to open and close closing refers to exercising restraint so that evil doesnt arise within usRestraint has four aspects b Indriyasamvarasila exercising restraint over our senses of sight hearing smell taste feeling and ideation so as to keep the mind quiet unagitated and in good orderc Ajivaparisuddhisila searching for the necessities of life  food clothing shelter and medicine  only in ways that are properd Paccayapaccavekkhanaparisuddhisila considering the necessities of life before using them so as not to use them out of desire or cravingTo exercise restraint in these ways is called closing Closing however can be understood in another way ie exercising restraint so that corruption doesnt arise in the three areas of our thoughts words and deedsbTo close our words means not to tell lies either to others peoples faces or behind their backs not to speak divisively ie in a way that would lead to a needless fallingout between people not to speak coarsely or abusively not cursing swearing or being vulgar and not to engage in useless chatter saying things that are of no real use to ourselves or our listenersTo be intent on restraining ourselves in this way is called closing off evil words so that they dont have a chance to arisecTo close off evil thoughts means Abyapada not storing up feelings of ill will to the point where anger takes over and we let jealousy and displeasure show Sammaditthi keeping our views correct in line with right principles eliminating views that arise from the minds being clouded and untrained  ie overpowered by ignorance and delusion  to the point of believing that there is no good or evil and from there to deeply ingrained unwise mental statesIf we take care to ward off these unwise mental qualities so that they cant arise in our hearts they will give way to Right View seeing that there really is good there really is evil that virtue generosity and meditation really give results that the paths and fruitions leading to nibbana really existWhen we see things in this way we have in effect closed off evil preventing it from penetrating our hearts just as rice farmers close their dykes to prevent salt water from flowing into their fieldsAs for opening it refers to practicing the five forms of unselfishness b Kulamacchariya not being possessive of our familiesOn the external level this refers to the families who support usWe dont prevent them from making offerings to other individuals and we dont prevent capable individuals from teaching and advising themSome monks stand in the way of such interchanges creating barriers with their thoughts words and deedsSometimes if their supporters make merit with other individuals they even make reprisals such as refusing to allow that family to make merit with their own groups or factionsThese worthless attitudes shouldnt be allowed to arise in our heartsOn the internal level being possessive of our family refers to the hearts attachment to sensations and mental acts which form the family line of unawakened peopleWe should abandon this attachment so that we can enter the lineage of the Noble Onesc Labhamacchariya not being possessive of the material gains we have attained through proper means not regarding them as being our ownMaterial gains as classified by the Vinaya are of four sorts food clothing shelter and medicineWe should see that when people present us with offerings of this sort they have abandoned an enemy  their own stinginess and selfishness  and have gained in worth and wisdom through the power of their sacrificeAnyone who receives such an offering and clings to it as really being his own is like a person who collects coconut pulp or sugar cane pulp from which others have already squeezed and drunk the juiceFor this reason people of wisdom and discernment arent possessive of their belongingsThey are always willing to relinquish and share their gains  in proportion to the amount they have received  so that others can make use of themThis is external relinquishmentAs for internal relinquishment Whereas we once ate as we liked many times a day we now eat less only one meal a dayWe use only one set of robesWe relinquish our comfortable lodgings and undertake the ascetic practice of living in the forest or under the shade of a treeIf we become ill we search for medicine and treat our disease with moderation in a way that doesnt create burdens for othersIn other words we relinquish ourselves as an offering to the religion by putting it into practiceThis is classed as the internal relinquishment of material gain through the power of our practice and conductd Vannamacchariya not being possessive of our colorVanna here can be interpreted in two waysIn one sense it refers to social caste or classFor example the ruling class the religious elite property owners and laborers are held to be unequal in status and the members of one group are unwilling to let other groups mix with theirsIf such mixing occurs they regard it as something base and disgraceful and so they continually put up barriers to prevent it from happeningIn this case we can infer that we shouldnt make distinctions based on faction nationality color or race because the Buddha taught that a persons worth comes not from his or her birth but from the goodness of his or her own actions or as we say Those who do good will meet with good those who do evil will meet with evil For example we worship and respect the Buddha even though he wasnt Thai as we areWe respect him through the power of his goodnessIf we were to be closeminded and nationalistic we Thais wouldnt have any religion to worship at all aside from the religion of spirits and ghostsThe second sense of vanna refers to the complexion of our skinThis too we cling to unwilling to sacrifice it for what is worthy and goodWe hesitate to observe the precepts to meditate or to undertake the ascetic practices for fear that well spoil our looks and complexione Dhammamacchariya not being possessive of the Buddhas teachings we have learnedPossessiveness in this case can mean not wanting to teach unless we are reimbursed not wanting to preach unless there is an offering or complaining if the offering is smallOn another level being possessive of the dhamma can refer to holding on to the unskillful qualities within us being unwilling to rid ourselves of such evils as greed anger delusion pride conceit or any of the other fermentations of defilement clinging to these things without searching for the techniques called the Path for relinquishing them ie the practice of concentration that when it is developed in our hearts can eliminate intermediate defilements ie such Hindrances as sensual desire the discernment that when it arises within us can eliminate such subtle defilements from our hearts as avijja  mental murkiness tanha  craving and upadana  attachment to false assumptionsWhen we develop these five forms of unselfishness we can be classed as open  and our eyes will be open to perceiving the highest quality the transcendentThe analogy of soil rich in nutrients refers to our putting four qualities into practice b Karuna compassion for ourselves and others which induces us to be helpful in various waysc Mudita appreciation for ourselves for having cultivated goodness appreciation for the goodness cultivated by othersd Upekkha equanimity in cases beyond our controlFor instance when death has come to a person we know we see that it is beyond our help and so we keep our hearts neutral not allowing feelings of sadness or gladness to ariseFor these four qualities to arise in fully mature form they have to appear in our thoughts words and deedsWhatever we may do in thought word or deed should not be done through the power of angerWe should regard anger as an ogre  and when anger takes over our body becomes an ogres tool his bludgeonTo see the drawbacks of anger in this way can give rise to good will in thought word and deed extending without partiality to all people and living beings throughout the worldEven with our enemies we should try to develop these same thoughts of good will by looking for their good side in one way or another instead of looking just at their bad side which can cause hatred to invade and consume our heartsAnger is a fire that cant burn other people it burns only ourselvesThis is why we should develop good will within our heartsThe power of good will brings good to everyone  just as food that contains the nutrients needed by people brings health and contentment to all who eat it or as fertilizer with the proper nutrients can cause plants and trees to grow give fruit and so be of use to people and other living beingsGood will is thus a form of goodness that can be classed as nourishmentThe analogy of seasonable rain refers to our establishing ourselves in the four bases of success b Viriya being persistent audacious and persevering in cultivating goodness within ourselvesc Citta being intent on whatever we set about to dod Vimansa being discriminating and circumspect at all times in whatever we set about to doThese four qualities can lead to two kinds of success iddhiriddhi  success through the power of thought and puññariddhi  success that comes on its ownBoth of these forms of success on the level of the world or the Dhamma have to be based on the four qualities mentioned aboveThese four qualities are like preservatives Whoever is saturated with them wont go sour or staleAnd when were free from going stale our work is bound not to stagnate and so is sure to succeedAnother comparison These four qualities are saccakamma  actions that give rise to truth achieving our purposesThose who bring these qualities into themselves will become true peopleTruth can be compared to salt If we try to keep food like vegetables or fish without salting it it soon turns rotten and wormy making it unfit for human consumptionBut if we salt it it can keep for a long timeA good example of this is our Lord Buddha whose actions gave rise to truth and who thus was able to establish the religion so as to benefit people at largeEven the body he left behind still serves a purpose for human and divine beingsFor instance his bones which have become relics are still with us even though he gained total liberation a long time agoAs for his teachings they have lasted for more than yearsAnd he himself is deathless ie he has entered total nibbanaAll of this was achieved by means of truth ie the four bases of successThose of us who have no truth though are like unsalted fish or meat and are bound to go wormyThe worms here refer to our various defilements and are of three main species The first species is composed of affection anger and delusion these feed on us from our feet to our waistsThe second species  sensual desire illwill torpor restlessness and uncertainty  latch on and bore into us from our waists to our necksAnd the third species  the fermentation of sensuality states of being views and ignorance  eats us up whole ears eyes nose mouth body and mindWhoever is all wormy like this is classed as a person gone rotten and stale who hasnt reached any qualities of substanceAnd for this reason the bones of such a person after death are no match for the bones of chickens and pigs for no one wants themIf the bones and meat of such a person were put up for sale no one would buyAnd furthermore such a person will have to come back as an angry ghost lolling its tongue and rolling its eyes to frighten its children and grandchildrenThus whoever develops the four qualities mentioned above will reach deathlessness  amata dhamma  which is like a crystalline shower that comes from distilling away all impurities just as rain water which is distilled from the sea rises into the air and returns to the earth nourishing the grasses crops and trees giving refreshment to people and other living beingsThese then are some of the characteristics of those who form the field of merit for the world both on the mundane and on the transcendent levels who conduct themselves in keeping with the phrase in the chant of the virtues of the SanghaThe field of merit for the worldNow we will discuss the chant of the virtues of the Sangha further as a path to practice because the virtues of the Sangha are open to all Buddhists in general without excluding any individual race or social class at allWhoever puts these principles into practice is capable of becoming a member of the Noble Sangha without having to go through the formalities of the VinayaIn other words this is a community and a state of worthiness open to all who put the following principles into practice bWhen a meeting of the group disperses we should all disperse at the same time and not act at variance with the groupOn the internal level we should all as a group disperse shoddiness from our thoughts words and deedscWe should neither establish new rules that were not established by the Buddha nor abandon those that wereFor example dont make a practice of doing things the Buddha declared to be worthless evil or wrong develop within yourself the things he taught to be good right and worthwhiledBe respectful of your elders teachers parents etceWhatever you do in thought word or deed dont act under the influence of craving anger or delusionfMake a point of searching out virtuous peoplegTake pleasure in solitudeThis is what is meant by good conductUjupatipanno being a person whose conduct is straightforward firmly established in the threefold training  virtue concentration and discernment  which leads straight to nibbana being fair and just unswayed by any of the four forms of personal biasThis is what is meant by straightforward conductayapatipanno being a person whose conduct leads to higher knowledgeThis refers to following fifteen procedures b Indriyasamvara keeping watch over your senses of sight hearing smell taste feeling and ideation so as to keep the mind collected and at peacec Bhojane mattaññuta knowing moderation in the requisites of life ie eating only just enough foodd Jagariyanuyoga being persistent in cleansing the mind so that it is pure and bright not allowing lapses in mindfulness or alertness to occure Saddha conviction ie being convinced of the truth of good and evil of the paths and their fruitions having conviction in people who merit itf Hiri feeling shame at the thought of doing evil not doing evil either in public or in privateg Ottappa having a sense of dread at the thought of doing evilh Bahusacca being welleducated and always willing to learni Viriya being persistent unflagging and courageous in performing your dutiesj Sati being mindful before doing anything

thought evaluation rapture pleasure and singleness of preoccupationm Dutiyajhana the second jhana composed of three factors  rapture pleasure and singleness of preoccupationn Tatiyajhana the third jhana composed of two factors  pleasure and singleness of preoccupationo Catutthajhana the fourth jhana composed of two factors  equanimity and pure mindfulness which is the single preoccupation of your concentrationThis is what is meant by conduct leading to higher knowledgeHere we will discuss how to give rise to the first jhanaDirected thought Think of the breath until you can recognize it both as it comes in and as it goes outSingleness of preoccupation Let the mind become one at rest with the breath not straying away to other objectsWatch over your thoughts so that they deal only with the breath until the breath becomes comfortableEvaluation Focus exclusively on issues connected with the breath and acquaint yourself with how to let this comfortable breathsensation spread and coordinate with the other breathsensations in the bodyLet these breathsensations spread until they all mergeOnce the body has been soothed by the breath feelings of pain will grow calmThe body will be filled with good breath energyFor jhana to arise these three factors have to be brought to bear on the same breath sensationThis breath sensation can lead all the way to the fourth jhana the level of refinement depending on the act of focusing through the power of mindfulness Sometimes the focus is broad sometimes narrow in accordance with the different factors on the different levelsBut to be really beneficial you should let the breath spread as broadly as possible being constantly aware throughout the body of the various aspects of the breathYou will then get excellent results from your practice of jhanaYou might even gain liberating insight on this level because the first jhana is what constitutes threshold concentrationIf you want to go on to fixed penetration you should keep practicing this level until you are skilled ie skilled at fixing the mind on a single object at adjusting and expanding the object and at staying in placeWhen you want your concentration to have energy make the breath light and refined  but keep your mindfulness broadOtherwise the mind might go into arupa jhana where it has no sense of the form of the body or you might sit absolutely still without any awareness of the body at all while the mind pays attention to another area such as simple awareness completely disregarding the body or sitting unconscious like a logThis is bahirajhana concentration outside of the Buddhas teachings incapable of giving rise to liberating insightSo when you begin you should develop the three abovementioned factors as much as possible and the mind will then be able to go on to the second jhanaWhen you fix the mind on the breath repeatedly using these three beginning factors they give rise to two more factorsRapture a sense of fullness and refreshment of body and mind going straight to the heart independent of all elsePleasure a sense of ease arising from the bodys being still and undisturbed and from the minds being at rest on its own placid and sereneThe factors of the first jhana then are of two sorts cause and resultThe causes are directed thought evaluation and singleness of preoccupation the results rapture and pleasureAs for the second jhana with its three factors of rapture pleasure and singleness of preoccupation This refers to the state of mind that has tasted the results coming from the first jhanaThe sense of fullness becomes more powerful as does the sense of pleasure allowing the mind to abandon its thinking and evaluating so that the singleness of the preoccupation takes the lead from here on inMake the mind still in the refined sense of the breathBody and mind are full and at ease the mind is more firmly implanted in its object than beforeAfter a while as you keep focusing in the sense of fullness and pleasure begins to moveFocus the mind down to a more refined level and you will enter the third jhanaThe third jhana has two factors  pleasure and singleness of preoccupation The mind is solitary the body solitary and stillThe breath is refined and broad with a white glow like cottonwool throughout the body stilling all painful feelings in body and mindNot a single Hindrance arises to interfereThe four properties  earth water fire and wind  are at peace with one another in every part You could almost say that theyre pure throughout the entire bodyThe mind is completely still  steady solid and sure  reaching oneness in a solitary sense of easeBody and mind are in solitudeEven if youre with a group of people you feel as if you were aloneThe mind is strong ardent and expansiveMindfulness is broad  spreading throughout the body focused exclusively on the present not affected by any allusions to past or futureThe breath gives rise to an energy that is pure whiteThe mind has powerThe focus is strong and the light brilliantEnergy is unwavering so that you are no longer concerned with your sense of pleasure which dilates somewhatThis causes the mind to focus on into the fourth jhanaThe fourth jhana has two factors  equanimity and singleness of preoccupationThe breath energy is still with no ripples or gapsThe properties of the body are undisturbedAs for the mind it is undisturbed with regard to all three time periods uninvolved with the past uninvolved with the future undisturbed by the presentWhen the mind stays with this undisturbed sense of equanimity this is the true meaning of singleness of preoccupation The breath is at peace the body at peace in every partThere is no need to use the inandout breathThe breath energy has reached saturation pointThe four properties are equal all with the same characteristicsThe mind is completely at peace with a brilliance streaming in all directionsThe brilliance of the breath at peace reaches full strengthThe brilliance of the mind arises from the power of mindfulness focused on all four of the great frames of reference body feelings mind and mental qualitiesThe question of their being four doesnt arise for in this mental moment they coalesce in perfect unityThe brilliance of the mind and of the body which arises from the power of their solitary stillness shines as jagariyanuyoga the purifying inner fire that can dispel darkness thoroughlyThe bright light of the mind reaches full strengthThe purity of the different parts of the breath energy keeps the other properties in good orderThe body is completely at peace like a factory at restIn other words you dont have to use the inandout breathThe body develops potency the mind resilient powerWhen these reach saturation point if you then want to give rise to knowledge shift your awareness so that it dilates slightly and the important skills that arise from the power of the mind  such as the Eight Skills  will appear ieManomayiddhi the ability to achieve ones aims through the power of thoughtIddhividhi the ability to display a variety of supranormal powersDibbasota clairaudience the ability to hear far distant soundsCetopariyañana the ability to know the mental states of other peoplePubbenivasanussatiñana the ability to remember past livesDibbacakkhu clairvoyance the inner eye that arises from the power of the mind relying to some extent on the optic nervesAsavakkhayañana knowing how to eliminate the fermentations of defilement as they relate to your various forms of knowledgeIf you want to give rise to supernormal powers formulate an intention at that point and it will appear openly so that ordinary people will be able to see itBoth of these aspects  knowledge and power  can lead to mastery on the level of the world and of the DhammaThe properties in the body acquire potency the mind becomes a potent center of consciousnessThis is the science of the mind on an advanced level giving rise to an advanced form of Buddhist learning lokavidu wideranging knowledge of the cosmosTo develop the factors discussed here is to warrant the name ñayapatipanno one whose conduct leads to higher knowledgeSamicipatipanno being a person whose conduct is masterfulThis refers to our conduct in developing two qualities tranquillity and insightbThe practice of insight means seeing clearly and truly into the nature of all conditioned things eg seeing that they are inconstant stressful and notself gaining discernment that sees distinctly in terms of the four Noble Truths seeing conditioned things from both sides ie the side that is inconstant stressful and notself and the side that is constant pleasant and self giving rise to the state of pure knowledge and vision termed gotarabhuñana escaping from the assumption that things are either constant or inconstant knowing both the side that arises and disbands as well as the side that doesnt arise and doesnt disband without making assumptions about or being attached to either sideTheories views and conceits disappearThe mind doesnt fasten onto anything past present or futureThis is termed asesaviraganirodha utter disbanding and dispassionThis is the way of insightInsight analyzed in detail in terms of the Doctrine in line with the conventions of the sages of the past means knowledge of the four Noble Truths Samudaya the cause of stress  ie tanha craving or thirst  which includes kamatanha insatiable craving for sensual pleasures bhavatanha the desire to be or have certain states of being and vibhavatanha the desire not to be or have certain states of being Nirodha the disbanding of stress the extinguishing of the fires of defilement Magga the path of practice that puts an end to craving the cause of stressAll four of these Noble Truths already exist in the world but ordinarily are hard to perceive because they show us only their images or reflectionsOn this level we cant yet see them for what they really areBut for the Buddha to know them he had to start out with the reflections that appear before he was able to trace them back to the real thingThis is why they are termed Noble Truths They are the possessions of noble people only those who search and explore can know themThus the Noble Truths have two aspects their first aspect which is the way they are found in the experience of ordinary people in general and their second aspect which is more subtle and can be known only by people of wisdom who explore in the area of the heart and mindAn example of the four Truths on the ordinary level as experienced by ordinary people Physical discomfort such as illness or disease can be called the truth of stressKnowing enough to buy the right medicine or being a doctor who knows the medicine for curing that particular kind of disease is the truth of the pathAs the symptoms of the disease disappear that is termed conditional disbandingWhen the disease is cured that is the truth of disbandingIf however we suffer from a disease such as a wound but dont know how to treat it  simply wanting it to heal and using whatever medicine we can lay our hands on without knowing whether its right or wrong  the wound will only worsen for the medicine we take isnt right for the diseaseThis is the truth of the cause of stressIf we want to go deeper than the ordinary level we have to practice correctly in line with the way of the Path developing our virtue concentration and discernment before we will be able to perceive the four Truths on the noble levelThe essence of the Dhamma by its nature lies mixed with its outer accretionsIf we dont have the right knowledge and skill we wont get very much use from the DhammaWhatever benefits we do get will be only on the mundane levelWe can make a comparison with diamond or gold ore buried in the ground If a person doesnt have enough knowledge to extract the ore he will get only the traces that come flowing out in spring water or that adhere to rocks along the surface of the groundThese will earn him only a meager profit which wont be enough for a livingA person with knowledge and skill though can use the gold to make a living without having to search for any other occupations but hell have to follow the traces down into the earth until he meets with the real thing ie the genuine oreEven just a single hunk  if its large and of high quality weighing a ton  will enable him to rest secure for the rest of his lifeIn the same way those who are wise in Buddhism see stress as a noble treasure and so go digging down into stress they see the cause of stress as a noble treasure and so dig down into it they see the Path as a noble treasure they see disbanding and liberation as noble treasures and so dig on down until they meet with the genuine oreOnly then can they be called noble sagesThose of us who are dauntless enough to unearth our inner resources in this way will be able to use those resources to protect ourselves throughout time gaining release from the cycle of rebirth the jail for imprisoning foolish and ignorant peopleWe who like to explore in general should be glad that weve come across a good mine with genuine ore whose traces lie scattered about for us to seeIf we dont disregard the things we see well meet the four Truths mentioned aboveIf we were to summarize the four Noble Truths briefly we could do so as follows The objects or preoccupations of the mind that arise and disappear are the truth of stressThe mental act that enters into and takes possession of those objects is the truth of the cause of stressThe mental act that focuses in on those objects and examines them as they arise and disappear is the truth of the Path and the mental act that lets go of those objects as they arise and disappear is the truth of disbanding or release  ie that which knows the reality that doesnt arise and doesnt disappearThese then are the four Noble TruthsThose who see these four Truths directly for themselves will give rise to the noble path and fruition termed streamentry Such people are a field of merit for the world worthy of respect worthy of welcome worthy of offerings and venerationWhoever possesses the qualities mentioned here qualifies rightly as a member of the Sangha in line with the Doctrine and Discipline taught by the Buddha and may be called samicipatipanno one whose conduct is masterful reaching the apex of the mundane level and becoming transcendentBNow we will discuss the second main heading the Noble Sangha the family of the Noble Ones which may be joined by virtue of having developed ones inner qualities with no need to go through the formalities of the VinayaThe Noble Sangha like the conventional Sangha is composed of four groupsb Vicikiccha doubt and uncertainty about the practices one is followingStreamwinners have no such doubts because they have reached the quality attained by the Buddhac Silabbataparamasa attachment to customs or traditions that are held to be good in this way or thatStreamwinners are not attached to any external practices dealing with actions or mannersThese three Fetters streamwinners have cut absolutely once and for allThey have attained the noble quality of having closed off completely the four states of deprivationIn other words they are destined never again to be born in hell on the level of the angry demons the level of the hungry ghosts or the level of common animalsThis is what it means to close off all four states of deprivationOncereturners those who have gained the second level of Awakening who will attain nibbana after being born once more in the worldOncereturners have cut three Fetters like streamwinners but have also reduced the amount of desire anger and delusion in their heartsNonreturners those who have awakened to the third level and who will never again return to the human worldAfter they die they will be born in the Brahma worlds on the levels of the Pure Abodes there to attain nibbanaThey have absolutely abandoned five of the Fetters b Vicikicchac Silabbataparamasad Kamaraga passion and delight caused by the power of sensual desires and sensual objectse Patigha irritation and displeasure caused by the power of angerArahants those who have awakened to the ultimate level of the four Noble Truths and have reached the quality of deathlessness free from all the fermentations of defilement whose ignorance craving attachments and kamma have endedArahants have abandoned their Fetters by means of the factors of the highest of the noble pathsThe Fetters they have abandoned are tenb Vicikicchac Silabbataparamasad Kamaragaf Ruparaga passion for the sense of form that can act as the object of rupa jhanag Aruparaga passion for formless phenomena such as the feeling of pleasure that comes from seclusionh Mana conceiving or construing oneself to be like this or thati Uddhacca restlessness and distraction being carried away with ones thoughtsThe thoughts on this level deal with the activity of discernment which is something good but they go out of boundsj Avijja ignorance ie not recognizing stress its cause its disbanding and the path to its disbanding  in short not being acquainted with the conditioned phenomena that exist within each of us not being acquainted with the unconditioned which is a genuine property existing naturallyThis briefly is what avijja meansAnother meaning for avijja is not being acquainted with the way we are  eg not recognizing our concepts of the past and thus becoming immersed in them not recognizing our concepts of the future not recognizing the present which is the important aspect of all physical and mental phenomenaThus delusion with regard to all three time periods is called avijja counterfeit knowledge falling short of the four genuine TruthsThese ten Fetters arahants  both men and women  have cut absolutely freeing themselves from every sort of bond or domination so that their hearts are brilliant and dazzling like the full moon in a cloudless skyThis is samicipatipanno  one whose conduct is masterful  on the transcendent levelThe four groups mentioned here are termed the Ariya Sangha the Noble Community which can be found only in BuddhismTherefore all Buddhists who daily pay homage to the Sangha should make themselves aware of what the Sangha is of how genuine or counterfeit the members of the Sangha areOtherwise our respect will be blind and misguided ignorant of the true nature of the Buddha Dhamma and SanghaWe should use our judgment and reason to be selective so that we can help one another look after the state of the religion bringing it into proper line with the principles of the Buddhas teachingsThe Sangha can be compared to a tree Some members are like the heartwood others are like the sapwood others are like the outer bark and still others are like parasitic creepersAnother popular analogy is to compare the Sangha to a jewelNow there are many kinds of jewels just as there are many parts to a tree artificial gems zircons rubies amethysts sapphires emeralds and diamondsJust as all of these are called jewels and are all of differing value so it is with the members of the SanghaWhoever is rich in discernment will obtain a valuable jewel as an adornmentWhoever is poor in discernment will end up with nothing but artificial gems or bits of gravel Some people believe that all who wear the yellow robe are alikeThey make donations to the yellow robe or pay respect to the yellow robe or make donations to the virtuous Thus I ask that all Buddhists make a point of learning where the gems of the religion that we as a nation revere may be foundA person who doesnt know what the Sangha is is like a child who doesnt know his family and relatives  who doesnt know who his father is who his mother is who his elder brothers and sisters areWhen this is the case he has no one to rely onIf he tries to rely on others he can do so only as long as he has money in his pocketsAs soon as he runs out of money hes in for trouble His friends and companions are sure to act as if they dont recognize him and he cant turn to his family and relatives because he doesnt know who they areSo in the end hell meet with nothing but sufferingThis is why were taught that as long as we still have life we shouldnt rest complacentWe should urgently make the virtues of the Sangha our guardians  because our friend the body can be relied on only as long as it doesnt dieAnd when the time comes who will care for us aside from our guardians the virtues of the SanghaWe shouldnt waste our time engrossed simply with the life of the body for as far as I can see theres nothing to the life of the body but eating and then sleeping sleeping and then eating againIf we let ourselves get stuck simply on the level of sleeping and eating were headed for troubleThis can be illustrated with a storyOnce in a village by the seaside there came a time of unbalance in the natural elements and large numbers of the livestock  the water buffaloes  died of the plagueThe men of the village fearing that the disease would spread took the buffalo carcasses and threw them into the seaAs the carcasses floated away from shore a flock of crows came to feed on them for many daysEach day when the crows had eaten their fill they would fly back to spend the night in the trees by the shore and then would fly out the following dawn to continue eatingAs days passed and the carcasses floated further and further out to sea some of the crows  seeing the hardships in flying back to shore  decided to spend the night floating on the carcasses others of the flock though didnt mind the hardships and continued flying back to shore every eveningFinally when the carcasses had floated so far out to sea that flying back and forth was no longer possible the flock decided to abandon that source of food and to search for a new source of food on landOne of the crows though had stayed with the carcasses when he saw that his fellows were no longer coming to claim a share of the food he became overjoyed thinking that the food he had would last him a long timeHe became so engrossed in his eating that he never thought of looking back to shoreAs the carcasses went floating further and further out swarms of fish came from below to devour them until there was nothing left to eatFinally the remains of the carcasses sank deep into the sea and at that point the crow decided that the time had come to fly back to shoreWith this in mind he flew to the north but didnt see landHe flew to the south to the east and west but didnt see landFinally he ran out of strength and could fly no further and so lowered his wings and dropped into the sea where he became food for the fishesThis is human lifeIf we let ourselves become engrossed only with eating and sleeping and physical pleasures without searching for virtue  ie if we dont practice the virtues of the Sangha as weve been taught  were sure to reap the rewards  suffering  just like the crow who fell to his death in the seaThis story is about us The sea stands for the world the flood of rebirth the buffalo carcasses stand for the body the trees on the shore stand for the Dhamma and the crows stand for the heart  ie sometimes we feel like practicing the Dhamma and sometimes we dontThe virtues of the Sangha are subtle deep and hard to perceiveIf we dont have knowledge of ourselves we wont be able to see them just as a mute person doesnt know how to speak his native tongueHere I would like to tell another story to illustrate what it means not to know the virtues of the SanghaOnce there was a mute person who made his living by playing a conch shell trumpetNow the way he played the conch shell was to make it sound like human voices or animal callsWhen he had perfected his skill he wandered about the cities and country towns playing his conchOne day he went to play in a village deep in the countrysideAs he was about to reach the village he stopped to rest under the shade of a tree and picked up his conch to practice for a momentWithin minutes a swarm of people hearing the sound of the conch came bursting from the village to see what it wasThey came across the mute man sitting under the tree and so asked him What was that beautiful sound we heard a moment ago The mute man pointed to the conch shell lying nearbyThe people thinking that they had heard the cry of the conch ran over to tap on it to make it cry again but it didnt make a soundSome of them picked it up and tried shaking it but still no sound so they put it back downOthers turned it over to see exactly where its cry came from but no matter what they did the sound of the conch wouldnt come outSo they ran back to the mute personThe mute person didnt know what to say but he could tell from their actions that they wanted to know what made the sound of the conch come out in such a variety of calls so he pointed to his mouthThe villagers ran to take a lookThey had him open his mouth and looked up and down inside but didnt see how it could be made to soundSo the mute man flickered his tongue for them to seeWith this they realized that the sound came from the mute mans tongue and so they tried flickering their own tongues but no beautiful sounds came outSo they ran back to the mute man who blew air out of his mouth meaning that the sound came from the breathThey tried blowing air from their own mouths but still no beautiful soundsFinally the mute man reached for the conch put it to his lips  and out came the beautiful sounds the sounds of people crying people laughing people wailing and mourning the sounds of birds mice and forest beastsSo it is with us If we dont know how to train ourselves so as to attain the virtues of the Sangha we wont know how beneficial to us the Sangha can beWell become uncivilized savages not knowing whether the Sangha is good or bad and well end up like the villagers who didnt know where the sound of the conch came fromThis story doesnt refer to anything distant The mute man producing various sounds from his conch shell stands for preaching monksFor example sometimes they try to be correct proper and principled in their preaching sometimes they preach like animals ie using a songlike voice or cracking jokes that go beyond the bounds of the Dhamma and VinayaIn this way they are like the man blowing the conchAs for the villagers who came running wideeyed to hear the sound of the conch they stand for Buddhist lay people who dont understand the virtues of the Sangha and thus are destined not to find the Sangha just as the villagers couldnt find the sound of the conchWhen this is the case they will simply shell out money to hear the sound of conch trumpets without any thought of the practices taught by the BuddhaMonks will be deluded into blowing conch shells for their living without any thought of the qualities of the Sangha and so our religion will degenerate day by day becoming ultimately a theater or playhouse for the worldThis has been an extended discussion of the Triple GemIf we were to put it briefly there wouldnt be a great deal to sayWeve kept the discussion drawnout in this way so as to show the general usefulness of the Triple Gem for those who revere itIf you want to go for refuge in the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha in a way that will reach their genuine benefits then you should gather their main points into yourself training yourself so as to give rise to the virtues of the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha in your heartThis is where the value of the Triple Gem liesThe gist of our discussion of the Triple Gem comes down simply to thisABuddha can be divided into a number of levelsThe Buddha of his physical representatives refers to Buddha images stupas and places worthy of veneration such as his birthplace the place of his Awakening the place where he delivered his first sermon and the place where he entered total nibbana which at present lie within the boundaries of India and NepalAll of these things qualify on the physical level as symbols of the Buddha for those who revere them but they may be disqualified if the people who revere them lack the necessary inner qualificationsTake Buddha images as an example You should understand Buddha images as having three characteristic types In other words Buddha images can be beneficial or harmful depending on how they are used by those who revere themEven people who use them as charms in committing robbery casting spells or performing black magic may get results because of the power of their convictionBut if we can be selective and use these images in ways that are right the potency they contain will benefit us bringing us blessings and protecting us from dangerThus the symbols of the Buddha can function in various waysThere is much more to this topic but if we were to discuss it here it would draw things out even furtherThese images can either qualify or be disqualified as symbols of the Buddha depending on the people who revere them but the images in themselves are neutralThe important point for people who hope for true welfare though is to invest themselves with the qualities that serve on the inner level as symbols of reverence for the BuddhaThese qualities are three Pañña the intuitive discernment and cognitive skill that come from concentrating the mindVimutti purity and release from mental defilement This is the essence of Buddharatanam the gem of the BuddhaBDhamma Good Dhamma is of three sorts But if we revere the Dhamma and make use of it through the power of our conviction memorizing passages of Pali for the sake of what is good and pure and then putting them into use they will give rise to meritFor example if we repeat the phrase Dhammam saranam gacchami or Namo buddhaya with heartfelt conviction giving rise to a sense of joy this mental state can then serve to protect us from certain kinds of accidents and harmWe may reap real benefits from the phrase we repeatThis is something that people who have respect for the Dhamma should investigate carefullyThese passages then can qualify as symbols of the Dhamma  or be disqualified if we dont know their true aimsPatipatti This refers to behaving sincerely in line with the Buddhas teachingsb Samadhi keeping the mind firmly intent in the four levels of jhana free from the mental HindrancesPativedha This refers to extinguishing defilement completely releasing the mind from all suffering and stressThis qualifies as the essence of the DhammaAll three of the levels mentioned here form the inner qualifications of those who truly revere and follow the DhammaSangha If we translate this as a substantive it refers to those who shave their heads and wear the yellow robe as a sign of having been ordainedThese people can qualify on the external level as symbols of the Sangha or they may be disqualifiedTo qualify they have to meet three criteriaSanghasampatti The monks who gather to witness the ordination constitute a legitimate quorumSimasampatti The place in which the ordination is held has had its boundaries properly definedWhen an individual ordains in line with these criteria he qualifies as a symbol of the SanghaBut viewed from another angle if the individual has met these criteria and becomes a monk but doesnt behave in line with the Dhamma and Vinaya  disobeying the training rules established by the Buddha committing major and minor offenses with no sense of shame  he becomes disqualified on the personal level just as a Buddha image that has been properly consecrated but is then put to improper uses by evil or lowminded people is bound to lead to harmA monk with no sense of conscience or shame is like a Buddha image inhabited by an angry demonNormally when an angry demon takes possession of a person it reveals itself by its behaviorFor example when some angry demons take possession they like to run around naked harassing other peopleIf a person has no sense of conscience or shame its as if he were possessed by an angry demonIn other words if he doesnt have any moral restraint its as if he lacked the clothing needed to hide his nakednessAnd when this is the case he is disqualified as a symbol of the SanghaA person who meets the three external qualifications mentioned above has to behave in line with the inner virtues of the Sangha bSila keeping ones words and deeds in proper orderTo have these two qualities is to qualify as a human beingbOttappa having a sense of dread at the thought of the results of doing evilIf a monk has these qualities its as if he were inhabited by a celestial beingPañña vijja vimutti gaining release from the mundane level abandoning the three Fetters beginning with selfidentification reaching the Dhamma of the Buddha attaining the state where we are guaranteed by the Buddha as being upright dependable honest and sincere toward the Dhamma and Vinaya gaining Awakening following his example becoming a reliable member of the SanghaSuch people are termed ariya sotapanna  Noble Ones who have reached the stream  and deserve to be called visuddhideva divinities through purity whose virtues are higher than those of human beings deities Indra or BrahmaEven though such people are still subject to death and rebirth they are not like other human beingsThe pure aspect of their heart will never again become defiledThus they deserve to be called in a partial sense divinities through purityAll four of these qualities form the inner qualifications of the SanghaSpeaking in terms of these inner qualifications every person can become a member of the SanghaBut if we dont develop these qualities within ourselves and then take refuge in the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha only on the external level how will we get the full benefitsWere taught that if we cant depend on ourselves there is no way we can hope to depend on othersFor example if an evil person breaks the law commits robbery and then asks the government to give him help you can rest assured that the only help the government will give him will be to build a place for him to live in discomfort  a jailIn the same way if we dont behave in line with the virtues of the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha how can we go around taking refuge in the Buddha Dhamma and SanghaThe Buddha taughtThus we should develop the inner qualifications of the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha within ourselvesThen we will belong to the company of the Buddhas followersIf we belong to the religion as lay women we are called upasika If we belong as lay men we are called upasaka If we observe the ten precepts and are endowed with the virtues of the Sangha we are termed samanera If we take a vow to join the community of those who fully observe the precepts we are termed bhikkhu When we join the company of the Buddhas followers in this way all people in general who practice and revere the teachings will benefit  just as when we meet the qualifications of a good citizen as set out by the government If we are trained and educated to be good we are bound to help the nation progress and prosperBut if we dont view ourselves as part of the nation and dont think of making a living to support ourselves and instead simply go around looking for pleasure or for help from others the results are bound to be badTherefore we as Buddhists have to study and practice before we can be Buddhists of virtue and valueWe will then reap rewards in the visible presentAnd even if we are no longer able to live in this world then when our bodies die and we head for another world we have a good bourn awaiting us as in the verse from the Mahasamaya SuttaThose who reach the refuge of the Buddha will close off all four of the lower realmsWhen they leave this life they are bound for a good bourn there to fill the ranks of the godsI go to the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha as my life and refuge till reaching nibbanaThe Theragaathaa the Verses of the Elders is a work found in the Khuddaka Nikaaya of the Sutta Pitaka of the Paali CanonAs its name indicates this is a collection of verses ascribed to various elder monks mostly celebrating their attainment of arahantshipAs with a number of other works in the Paali Canon such as the Anguttara Nikaaya and the Itivuttaka the Theragaathaa is divided into sections with progressively increasing numbers of versesIt begins with a section of single verses then continues with pairs triplets and so forthIn the later sections this system breaks down and the number of verses which the poems actually contain only approximate to the number of the sectionThe present work is a translation accompanying the original Paali text of the final and longest section of the Theragaathaa the Mahaanipaata or Great Section This is a selfcontained anthology of fourteen poems with seventyone verses composed by a single elder the Venerable VangiisaAlthough not indicated in the text the various occasions for the composition and recitation of these poems is to be found in the commentaryThese in turn are a summary of the information supplied by the Vangiisasamyutta of the Samyutta Nikaaya where we find a parallel version of these poems embedded in a series of short suttas giving the circumstances of their compositionInterestingly the two versions of the poems are not identical though the differences are mostly slightThey consist mainly of dialectical variants from a time when Paali was an oral literature being collected from the several dialects of Maagadhii the actual spoken language of that region of Northern India in which the Buddha and his early followers lived and preached the DhammaThe author of these poems the Venerable Vangiisa was designated by the Buddha as the foremost of his disciples with respect to spontaneity of speechThis gift is evidently a reference to the Parosahassa Sutta where after reciting a poem the Buddha asked Vangiisa whether it had been devised by him beforehand or had occurred to him on the spotWhen Vangiisa affirmed the latter the Buddha invited him to compose some more verses and the result was the next poemApart from what we can glean from the poems themselves and the suttas of the Vangiisasamyutta we know very little about the Venerable Vangiisa himselfThe commentary says he was a brahmin by birth and that prior to meeting the Buddha he made a living by tapping the skulls of deceased people and telling thereby where the owners had been rebornThe Buddha tested him by presenting him with several skulls including that of an arahantHe was successful with his first few guesses but when he came to the arahants skull he was mystified for an arahant is not reborn anywhereHe decided to enter the Order to discover the secretHe was ordained by the Elder Nigrodhakappa and later became an arahantThe commentary adds that after composing some verses in praise of the Buddha he gained a reputation as a poetAccording to the Apadaana Vangiisa was so called both because he was born in the country of Vanga and also because he was a master of the spoken word In Buddhist Sanskrit works such as the Mahaavastu his name appears unambiguously as Vaagiisa Lord of Speech This is of course an assumed name and we do not know his actual personal name as is common with individuals in this early Buddhist literatureLord of Speech or perhaps better Master of Words is an apt title for a poetThe poems themselves give us the picture of a man of sensitive and artistic temperament who found it difficult to control his innate sensuality manifest in his attachment to the opposite sexHe would have appreciated this passage from the Anguttara Nikaaya They fetter him who has forgotten mindfulness with gaze and smile disordered dress sweet blandishmentsFurthermore he was proud of his gift of poetic invention but recognized this pride as a fault to be overcomeThe sole reference in the poems to his life before he met the Buddha says only that he was obsessed by the poetic artAll of this tends to cast doubt on the authenticity of the bizarre tale of the skulltapping brahminIn the absence of any evidence to the contrary it is perhaps best to be noted as a curiosityThe importance of Vangiisa lies in his talent as a poet a gift that must have been nurtured and developed over a period of time before the present poems were composedWe might also conclude that for someone able to compose verse spontaneously as Vangiisa could his output might well have been enormousThe few religious poems that have survived may be only a small fraction of an opus that is now lost foreverAfter these preliminary remarks I ought to discuss some points arising from the poems themselves but first I wish to make a general observation concerning the translationMy aim has been to convey the exact verbal meaning of the poems and for this purpose I felt a literal prose translation would be more suitable than one in verseMoreover a verse translation could be positively misleading if it made a pretense of conveying the feel of the original poems hence also the decision to reproduce the Paali text alongside the translationIn recent decades much scholarly work has been done in restoring and correcting the text of the Theragaathaa and I took the opportunity to incorporate the results of such research into this edited version of Vangiisas versesI leave the assessment of Vangiisa as a poet to those better qualified to judgePaali meter and Indian poetics in general are difficult subjects of which the present translator has little knowledgeMy aim in both the text and the translation has been to adhere as closely as possible to what was originally intended by the poet and to the meaning understood by his contemporariesWith this in view the translation occasionally departs from the interpretations of particular words and phrases proposed by the commentariesFor instance in vwe find the term maggajinaThe commentary interprets this as a pathvictor or conqueror of the path In the Cunda Sutta maggajina is the first of the four kinds of samana listed thereAccording to the commentary One who has overcome all defilements by means of the path is called a pathvictorHowever as KRNorman has pointed out the suffix jina is unlikely to mean conqueror here but was a dialect form from SktjnaaHence it is probable that the commentary is mistaken and that the word originally meant a pathknower I have translated it in this way on the assumption that this was what Vangiisa himself intended by the expressionAnother innovation is my translation of the term puthujjana as outsidersThis term is usually translated ordinary persons worldlings manyfolk etc taking puthu in its sense of numerous variousHowever another meaning of puthu is separate apartAlthough this sense was deemed inappropriate for puthujjana by earlier translators and the PTS Dictionary there is no real reason why it could not be so understoodThe term refers to those people who are apart from separate from those in possession of the Dhamma of the noble ones the Buddha and his disciplesThe commentaries use puthujjana to refer to anyone and everyone who has not yet reached at least the path of streamentry thereafter they become noble disciples and lose their designation as puthujjanaIt is possible however that the term was originally used in a still more restricted sense as referring to those incapable of understanding the Dhamma in contrast to the vinnuu who could do so when it was taught to themBeing apart from Dhamma the puthujjana are established in what is notDhammaThey are unable to relate to the Buddhas Teaching because they are attached to and blinded by the many wrong and speculative views that are at variance with the DhammaI decided to use Fortunate One as a translation of bhagavaaThis seems to be closer to what was intended than the common rendering Blessed One which could give rise to the query Blessed by whom Again Lord or even Exalted One is suggestive of dominance over others by a godlike being which is surely not intended hereAll such renderings have strong theistic overtones and so can be misleadingIn Hinduism Bhagavaan is used as a term for God and thus in that context Lord egLord Krishna is appropriateIn translating Vangiisas verses my guiding principle has been to leave as few words as possible untranslatedWith this aim monk is used for bhikkhu and god for deva words which I had left in the original Paali in an earlier translated workI decided to retain Dhamma and Tathaagata which are generally held to elude satisfactory rendering into EnglishBut the occurrence of the word naaga in vbecame an exception to the ruleOne meaning of naaga is bull elephant Naaga is used as an epithet of the Buddha and his arahant disciples and I had first thought to translate vthus You are called an elephant Fortunate One However in English instead of suggesting the intended feelings of reverence and awe on initial encounter this might well be taken in a pejorative sense hence I decided to leave it untranslatedIn Thag  various attributes of the Buddha are equated with parts of the elephant  feet tusks trunk and so forthThe word naaga is also used for the serpent and a class of semidivine beings depicted in art as halfhuman and halfsnake perhaps it originally referred to certain indigenous tribal peoples who worshipped the cobraA naaga cult still exists in India todayThe subject matter of the poems is diverseThe first four poems show Vangiisa articulating his inner struggle to overcome various failings and elementary obstacles sensual thoughts doubt attachment views pride and conceit ways of thinking not to be entertained by one who has gone forth into homelessnessForemost among these failings is sensual desire which arises through unguarded contact with desirable sights sounds etcIn the first poem these objects of desire are conceived as devices of Maara the Evil One to overpower the mind and prevent progress upon the pathThe fourth poem shows how arisen sensual desires can be extinguished and dispelled by appropriate attitudes and meditation practicesIn this latter poem it may be questioned whether it is actually the Venerable AAnanda who is here addressed as Gotama or the Buddha himselfHowever there is no problem if we understand that Vangiisas query is being answered by the Buddha whose word was memorized and transmitted through his disciple AAnandaThe fifth poem is unique in being a verse summary of a sermon by the Buddha on truth as the wellspoken word This poem is also to be found in the Suttanipaata and the fact that the three versions hardly differ may indicate that it enjoyed wide popularityThe sixth is the first of three sketches of the Buddhas disciplesHere it is Saariputta the others are Kondanna and MahaamoggallaanaThis poem gives a rare glimpse of Saariputta as a skilled teacher and speaker able to captivate the monks with his pleasant voiceAll are the Fortunate Ones sons that the Buddhas arahant disciples are regarded as his sons is a recurrent idea in the Theragaathaa and elsewhereIn the Itivuttaka the Buddha says Monks you are my own legitimate sons born from my mouth born of Dhamma fashioned by Dhamma heirs of Dhamma not heirs of material thingsIn vVangiisa calls the Elder Kondanna the Awakened Ones heir and Nigrodhakappa in va true son of the naagaThe idea is extended in Thag where Kaaludaayin actually addresses Suddhodana the Buddhas natural father as his grandfatherIt is the tradition that the Buddha had a son named Raahula who became a monkBut the Venerable Raahula found in the Sutta Pitaka when called the Buddhas son has no special claim to that position over and above that of any other discipleIn the suttas Raahula is portrayed as the ideal novice monk eager for instruction in the TeachingPoems VIII and IX extol the Buddha and his Teaching and in vthe poet actually refers to himself by nameNoXII consists of just a single verse praising the BuddhaNoXIII is Vangiisas declaration of annaa the attainment of final knowledge or arahantshipUp to this point the differences between the versions of the poems in the Theragaathaa and the Vangiisasamyutta have been quite minorBut the verses of this poem are so different from those of the Vangiisa Sutta in the Samyutta Nikaaya that it should be regarded as a separate poemIt is therefore inserted here as Poem XIV for the sake of completeness and for purposes of comparisonAlthough the subject matter of both poems is the same the Samyutta version is half the length of the other with only five stanzas in contrast to the ten of the Theragaathaa versionCircumstantial evidence suggests the shorter poem was the original which was later expanded either by Vangiisa himself or someone else to create the longer poemThe Vangiisa Sutta concludes the Samyutta collection and is in keeping with what has gone before in as much as none of the poems exceed five stanzas in lengthAlso the Vangiisasamyutta is found in the first and probably the most ancient division of the Samyutta Nikaaya the SagaathaavaggaIn contrast the longer poem comes almost at the end of the Theragaathaa and is followed by yet one more the final and inordinately long Nigrodhakappa poem of seventeen stanzas which concludes this entire collectionIt is known that the Theragaathaa grew over a long period of time and received additional material even up to the time of Emperor AsokaIt is therefore more than likely that these final two poems came into existence after the Samyutta anthology was finalizedHow the longer poem was constructed from the shorter is best seen by analyzing each of the Paali gaathaa into their constituent four paadaThus the first three stanzas of the shorter poem were expanded to five by the insertion of extra paadaAll the original paada were retained but not in the same orderStanzas six and seven of the longer poem referring to the Four Noble Truths have nothing corresponding to them in the shorter poem and are therefore new materialThree paada from the last two stanzas of the shorter poem were discarded but the rest utilized to make the final three stanzas of the longer poemThe final poem in this anthology as already indicated is missing from the Samyutta collectionHowever a corresponding version is found at Sn  called there variously the Vangiisa Sutta Kappa Sutta or Nigrodhakappa SuttaApart from its much greater length this poem differs from the preceding poems in a number of other waysThe fact that it directly addresses the Buddha and is in a more ornate even extravagant style sets it apart from the simpler unvarnished verse of the earlier poemsExpressions such as that in vreferring to the thousandeyed Sakka are characteristic of a late period of Paali compositionAnd indeed the comparison of the Buddhas voice to the honking of a goose is a device suggestive of the highly ornate poetry of a much later ageThat the elder is variously called Nigrodhakappa Kappa Kappiya Kappaayana is of course to conform to the requirements of the meterAlthough the Nigrodhakappa poem is ostensibly a request to the Buddha for information about the attainment of the deceased elder Vangiisas teacher the manner and persistence of the urge to speak Dhamma and other such expressions point to a deeper meaningAn underlying idea is that the Buddha alone when proclaiming the Dhamma is capable of producing a profound effect upon his hearersHe is able to establish them on the noble path of the sotaapanna etc at least those who are ready to receive it by the Dhammawords issuing forth through his speech and apparently without any prior practice on the part of the recipientsThis is a special gift exercised by the Buddha alone and not by his disciplesAlthough this idea is not taken up to any extent by the Theravaada which stresses the human side of the Buddha it was a factor affecting other Indian schools of Buddhism and the socalled Mahaayaana which tended to emphasize the Buddhas transcendental natureBoth the Theragaathaa and the first volume of the Samyutta Nikaaya where these verses are found were first translated by MrsRhys Davids under the respective titles Psalms of the Brethren and Kindred Sayings IThe Theragaathaa was retranslated more recently by KRNorman as Elders Verses IThe present translator has relied heavily upon Normans erudite translation and his copious notes to the original Paali textAs a new monk recently gone forth lustful passion was aroused in the Venerable Vangiisa when he saw a number of women adorned in all their finery who had come to visit the monasteryHe dispelled this lust recording the experience in these versesAlasNow that I have departed from home to the homeless state these reckless thoughts from the Dark One come upon meMighty warriors great archers trained steady bowmen one thousand fearless men might surround me on all sidesEven if more women than these will come they will not cause me to waver for I am firmly established in the teachingIn his presence I heard from the Awakened One the Kinsman of the Sun of this path leading to nibbaana it is there that my mind is attachedEvil One while I am living thus if you assail me so shall I act O Death that you will not see my pathWhile staying at Alavi the Venerable Vangiisas teacher the Elder Nigrodhakappa after returning from the alms round remained in seclusion for long periodsOn one occasion when discontent arose in the mind of the Venerable Vangiisa and his mind was tormented by lust he composed these verses to reprove himself and to dispel the conflicting emotions that harassed himEntirely giving up disliking and liking and the thinking associated with the life of a householder one should not have craving for anythingHe indeed is a monk who is wholly without cravingWhatever there is here of form inhabiting the earth and the sky immersed in the world all is impermanent and decayingSo understanding the wise live their livesRegarding objects of attachment people are greedy for what is to be seen and heard and touched and otherwise experiencedBeing unmoved dispel desire for them for they call him a sage who does not cling to themThen caught in the sixty full of thoughts because of being outsiders they are established in wrong teachingBut one who is a monk would not take up a sectarian viewpoint much less seize upon what is badIntelligent for a long time composed not deceitful wise not envious the sage has experienced the peaceful state depending on which attained to quenching he awaits his timeOn another occasion full of conceit because of his gift for composing extemporaneous verse the Venerable Vangiisa caught himself despising the other monks who were not so giftedRepenting these thoughts he composed the following poemAbandon conceit Gotama get rid of the way of conceit completelyBecause of being infatuated by the way of conceit for a long time you have been remorsefulSoiled by contempt destroyed by conceit people fall into hellPersons destroyed by conceit grieve for a long time upon being reborn in hellA monk never grieves who is a knower of the path one who has practiced it properlyHe experiences fame and happiness truthfully they call him a seer of DhammaTherefore be without barrenness here energetic purified by abandoning the hindrancesHaving completely abandoned conceit be an ender through knowledge and become one who dwells at peaceOnce soon after his ordination Vangiisa accompanied the Venerable AAnanda on a visit to the house of one of the kings ministersA number of women of the household came and paid reverence to the elder asked questions and listened to his preachingBut at the sight of these women sensual desire was aroused in Venerable Vangiisa which he immediately confessed to the Venerable AAnandaHe recorded the incident in this poemI burn with sensual desire my mind is enflamedOut of pity please tell me Gotama the effective extinguishing of itYour mind is enflamed because of distorted perceptionShun the aspect of beauty associated with passionSee constructions as other as painful not as self extinguish strong passion do not burn again and againDevote the mind onepointed and wellcomposed to the contemplation of foulnessLet mindfulness be directed towards the body and be full of disenchantment for itContemplate the signless and cast out the underlying tendency to conceitThen by the penetration of conceit you will go about at peaceThese verses came to the Venerable Vangiisa while he was listening to a talk delivered by the Buddha on the wellspoken word Having received permission from the Teacher he then recited this poem in his presenceOne should speak only that word by which one would not torment oneself nor harm othersThat word is indeed well spokenOne should speak only pleasant words words which are acceptableWhat one speaks without bringing evils to others is pleasantTruth is indeed the undying word this is an ancient verityUpon truth the good say the goal and the teaching are foundedThe sure word the Awakened One speaks for the attainment of nibbaana for making an end of suffering is truly the best of wordsVerses spoken in praise of the Venerable SaariputtaOf profound wisdom intelligent skilled in knowledge of the right and wrong path Saariputta of great wisdom teaches Dhamma to the monksHe teaches in brief he speaks with detailed explanation his voice is like that of the mynah bird he demonstrates readiness of speechListening to his sweet utterance while he is teaching with a voice that is captivating pleasing and lovely the monks give ear with minds elated and joyfulVerses spoken in praise of the Buddha on an occasion of the Invitation CeremonyToday on the fifteenth five hundred monks have gathered for the ceremony of purification cutters of fetters and bonds untroubled seers finished with renewed existenceAs a wheelturning monarch surrounded by his ministers tours all around this oceangirt earth so do the disciples with the threefold knowledge who have left death behind attend upon the victor in battle the unsurpassed caravan leaderAll are the Fortunate Ones sons there is no chaff found hereI pay homage to the destroyer of the dart of craving the Kinsman of the SunA poem composed on the occasion of a Dhammatalk concerning nibbaana delivered by the Buddha to a large company of monksMore than a thousand monks attend upon the Happy One as he is teaching the stainless Dhamma concerning nibbaana where no fear can come from any quarterThey hear the taintless Dhamma taught by the Fully Awakened OneThe Awakened One is truly resplendent as he is revered by the community of monksYou are called a naaga Fortunate One of seers you are the best of seersLike a great raincloud you rain down upon the disciplesLeaving his daytime abode wishing to see the Teacher your disciple Vangiisa pays homage at your feet Great HeroFurther verses composed by the Venerable Vangiisa when the Buddha after hearing the previous poem invited him to speak more extemporaneous versesOvercoming the devious ways and range of Maara he walks having broken up the things that make for barrenness of mindSee him producing release from bonds unattached separating into its constituent partsHe has shown the path in a variety of ways with the aim of guiding us across the floodSince the undying has been shown the Dhammaseers stand immovableThe lightmaker having penetrated saw the overcoming of all standpointsHaving understood and experienced it he taught the topmost to the fiveWhen the Dhamma has been thus well taught what indolence could there be in those who know the DhammaTherefore vigilant and ever revering one should follow the training in the Fortunate Ones dispensationVerses composed on an occasion when the Elder Annaata Kondanna came to pay his respects to the TeacherThe Elder Kondanna strong in energy who was enlightened after the Awakened One is repeatedly the obtainer of pleasurable abidings and seclusionsWhatever is to be attained by a disciple who does the instruction of the Teacher all that has been attained by him vigilant and disciplinedHaving great power and the threefold knowledge skilled in knowing the thoughts of others Kondanna the Awakened Ones heir pays homage at the Teachers feetVerses in praise of the Elder MahaamoggallaanaDisciples possessors of the threefold knowledge who have left death behind attend upon the sage seated on the mountain side who has gone to the far shore beyond sufferingMoggallaana of great supernormal powers encompasses with his mind seeking their minds completely freed without attachmentsThus do they attend upon Gotama endowed with so many virtuous qualities the sage possessed of all the attributes and gone to the far shore beyond sufferingOnce when the Buddha was seated by the Gaggaraa Lotuspond near the town of Campaa surrounded by a large assembly the Venerable Vangiisa composed this verse in his praiseAs the moon shines in the sky free from clouds as also the spotless sun even so Resplendent One Great Sage do you outshine the whole world with your fameThis the Venerable Vangiisas autobiographical poem was composed shortly after he attained arahantshipIntoxicated with skill in the poetic art formerly we wandered from village to village from town to townThen we saw the Awakened One gone to the far shore beyond all phenomenaThe sage gone to the far shore beyond suffering taught me the DhammaOn hearing the Dhamma we gained confidence in him faith arose in usHaving heard his word and learnt of the aggregates bases and elements I went forth into homelessnessIndeed Tathaagatas appear for the good of the many men and women who practice their teachingIndeed the sage attained enlightenment for the good of those monks and nuns who see the course to be undergoneWell taught are the Four Noble Truths by the Seeing One the Awakened One the Kinsman of the Sun out of compassion for living beingsSuffering the origin of suffering the overcoming of suffering and the noble eightfold path leading to the allaying of sufferingThus these things thus spoken of have been seen by me as they really areThe true goal has been reached by me the Awakened Ones instruction has been doneIt was good indeed for me my coming into the presence of the Awakened OneAmong things shared out I obtained the bestI have attained the perfection of the direct knowledges I have purified the element of hearing I have the threefold knowledge and obtained supernormal powers and am skilled in knowing the minds of othersThe shorter version of the previous poemIntoxicated with skill in the poetic art formerly we wandered from village to village from town to townThen we saw the Awakened One and faith arose in usHe taught me the Dhamma concerning the aggregates bases and elementsHaving heard his Dhamma I went forth into homelessnessIndeed the sage attained enlightenment for the good of the many monks and nuns who see the course to be undergoneIt was good indeed for me my coming into the presence of the Awakened OneThe three knowledges have been attained the Awakened Ones instruction has been doneI know my former abodes the purified divine eye I have the threefold knowledge and obtained supernormal powers and am skilled in knowing the minds of othersIn this the longest of the poems the Venerable Vangiisa asks the Buddha whether his deceased preceptor the Elder Nigrodhakappa had attained final nibbaanaThis provides an opportunity for Vangiisa to sing the praises of the Buddha himselfI ask the teacher of superior wisdom one who in this very life is the cutteroff of doubts The monk well known and famous who has died at Aggaalava was he completely quenched in mindNigrodhakappa was the name given to that brahmin by you Fortunate OneLooking for release strenuously energetic he went about revering you O seer of the secure stateSakka Allseeing One we all wish to know concerning that discipleOur ears are ready to hearYou are the teacher you are unsurpassedSever our doubtTell me this you of extensive wisdom that he experienced quenchingSpeak in our very midst Allseeing One like the thousandeyed Sakka in the midst of the godsWhatever bonds exist here ways of delusion on the side of ignorance bases for doubt they no longer exist on reaching the Tathaagata for that vision of his is supreme among menIf no man were ever to disperse the defilements as the wind disperses a mass of clouds the whole world enveloped would surely be darkness and even illustrious men would not shine forthBut the wise are lightmakersO Wise One I think you are just such a oneWe have come upon him who knows and is gifted with insightMake evident to us within the companies the fate of KappaQuickly enunciate your beautiful utterance O beautiful oneLike a goose stretching forth honk gently with your melodious and wellmodulated voice we are all listening to you attentivelyPressing the one who has completely abandoned birth and death I shall urge the purified one to speak DhammaFor among outsiders there is no acting as they wish but among Tathaagatas there is acting with discretionThis full explanation of yours one with upright wisdom is well learntThis last salutation is proferredYou of superior wisdom knowing do not keep us in ignoranceHaving known the noble Dhamma in its full extent you of superior energy knowing do not keep us in ignoranceI long for your word as one overcome by heat in the hot season longs for waterRain down on our earsSurely the purpose for which Kappaayana practiced the holy life was not in vainWas he quenched or had he a residue remainingLet us hear in what way he was releasedHe cut off craving here for mindandmateriality said the Fortunate One the stream of craving which for a long time had lain latent within himHe has crossed beyond birth and death completely So spoke the Fortunate One the foremost of the fiveOn hearing your word O best of seers I believeMy question was truly not in vain the brahmin did not deceive meAs he spoke so he actedHe was a disciple of the Awakened OneHe cut through the strong spreadout net of Death the deceiverKappiya saw the starting point of grasping O Fortunate OneKappaayana has certainly gone beyond the realm of Death so difficult to crossI pay homage to you the god of gods and to your son O best of bipeds to the great hero born in your tracks a naaga a true son of the naagaThe Theragaathaa with the Vangiisasamyutta and the Suttanipaata does not exhaust the verses ascribed to the Venerable VangiisaAnother pair of verses is attributed to him in the postcanonical Milindapanha The Questions of King MilindaThis work also contains verses ascribed to other elders such as Saariputta and Anuruddha that are not to be found elsewhereThe Milindapanha records a dialogue between the Elder Naagasena and King Milinda the Indic form of the Greek name MenanderHe is identified with a GrecoBactrian king of the nd century Bwho exercised rule in Northwest IndiaThe work was probably composed originally in Prakrit or Sanskrit  even Greek has been suggested  and was subsequently translated into PaaliIt is therefore possible that these verses came from the Tipitaka of another Buddhist school possibly the SarvaastivaadaThere are also some verses extolling the virtues of the Buddha attributed to Vangiisa in the Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit work the Mahaavastu which formed part of the Vinaya of the Lokuttaravaadin schoolAmong these is the followingAs the glorious sun shines in the sky and the full moon when the sky is clear so dost thou O Man firm in concentration shine forth like burnished goldThis is reminiscent of ThagThen we findSince through thine own understanding thou has apprehended the truth and knowledge unheard of before O Foremost Man who shinest like thousandeyed Maghavan pray give utterance to itThis may be compared with ThagIn the Mahaavastu itself the words pray give utterance to it have no obvious connection with what has gone before or what follows but they do have a significance in the Theragaathaa context where the poet questions the Buddha about the fate of NigrodhakappaAnother reference to Vangiisa is found in the Mahaavastu when the Buddha addresses him thus Let there come to your mind Vaagiisa the recollection of a former association of yours with the Tathaagata Vaagiisa then proceeds to tell in verse a story of a former life when the bodhisattva or Buddhatobe as a wise brahmin was his teacherThe Vimaanavatthu of the Khuddaka Nikaaya is a collection of stories in verse describing the vimaana  a kind of personal heavenly mansion  inhabited by beings reborn as gods or goddesses as a reward for meritorious deeds performed by them as human beingsAll the stories follow a similar patternThey begin with an introductory verse in which the god or goddess is asked about the cause for his or her rebirth within that particular mansionThe deva thereupon relates his or her previous good deedsUsually the Venerable Mahaamoggallaana is the questioner but occasionally another elder plays this roleGenerally it is only in the commentary that the questioner is named and the background supplied otherwise the verses are anonymousIn four stories Vangiisa is identified as the interlocutor No No No and NoIn Noit is Sakka the ruler of the gods who questions the goddessHowever at the conclusion the commentary states that Sakka related it to Vangiisa who in turn told it to the compilers of the CanonWe cannot be certain whether the ascription of these verses to Vangiisa is authenticThere is nothing notable in the verses of the two Naaga mansion stories that can link them to the poetIf Vangiisa did recite the verses of No although allegedly receiving them from Sakka could they be regarded as his own compositionThe introductory verses of Sesavatii are interestingly enough unique in the Vimaanavatthu as constituting a sevenverse descriptive poem in its own rightThere is none other comparable to it in length and as it is ascribed to Vangiisa a translation of it is appended hereHowever it is the Sirimaa poem that is the most interesting of all the mansion stories for it has a doctrinal content lacking elsewhere in the workIn it Sirimaa describes how she became a disciple of the Buddha and a sotaapanna one who has entered the stream leading to final emancipationA translation of it is therefore presented as possibly a poetical work of VangiisaI see this delightful and beautiful mansion its surface of many a color ablaze with crystal and roofed with silver and goldA wellproportioned palace possessing gateways and strewn with golden sandAs the thousandrayed sun in the autumn shines in the sky in the ten directions dispelling the dark so does this your mansion glow like a blazing

water and trees that are on land those known in the human world and heavens all exist in your abodeOf what calming and selfrestraint is this the resultBy the fruit of what deed have you arisen hereHow did this mansion come to be possessed by youTell it in full O lady with thick eyelashesHow it come to be possessed by me this mansion with its flocks of herons peacocks and partridges and frequented by heavenly waterfowl and royal geese resounding with the cries of birds of ducks and cuckooscontaining divers varieties of creepers flowers and trees with trumpetflower roseapple and asoka trees  now how this mansion came to be possessed by me I will tell youListen venerable sirIn the eastern region of the excellent country of Magadha there is a village called Naalaka venerable sirThere I lived formerly as a daughterinlaw and they knew me there as SesavatiiScattering flowerblossoms joyfully I honored him skilled in deeds and worshipped by gods and men the great Upatissa who has attained the immeasurable quenchingHaving worshipped him gone to the ultimate bourn the eminent seer bearing his last body on leaving my human shape I came to the thirty and inhabit this placeYour yoked and finely caparisoned horses strong and swift are heading downward through the skyAnd these five hundred chariots magically created are following the horses urged on by charioteersYou stand in this excellent chariot adorned radiant and shining like a blazing starI ask you of lovely slender form and exquisite beauty from which company of gods have you come to visit the Unrivalled OneFrom those who have reached the heights of sensual pleasures said to be unsurpassed the gods who delight in magical transformation and creationA nymph from that company able to assume any desired appearance has come here to worship the Unrivalled OneWhat good conduct did you formerly practice hereHow is it that you live in immeasurable glory and have gained such pleasuresDue to what have you acquired the unrivalled power to travel through the skyWhy does your beauty radiate in the ten directionsYou are surrounded and honored by the godsFrom where did you decease before you came to a heavenly bourn goddessOr of what teaching were you able to follow the word of instructionTell me if you were a disciple of the Awakened OneIn a fine wellbuilt city situated between hills an attendant of a noble king endowed with good fortune I was highly accomplished in dancing and singingAs Sirimaa I was known in RaajagahaBut then the Awakened One the leader among seers the guide taught me of origination of suffering and impermanence of the unconditioned of the cessation of suffering that is everlasting and of this path not crooked straight auspiciousWhen I had learnt of the undying state the unconditioned through the instruction of the Tathaagata the Unrivalled One I was highly and well restrained in the precepts and established in the Dhamma taught by the most excellent of men the Awakened OneWhen I knew the undefiled place the unconditioned taught by the Tathaagata the Unrivalled One I then and there experienced the calm concentrationThat supreme certainty of release was mineWhen I gained the distinctive undying assured eminent in penetrative insight not doubting I was revered by many people and experienced much pleasure and enjoymentThus I am a goddess knowing the undying a disciple of the Tathaagata the Unrivalled One a knower of Dhamma established in the first fruit a streamentererHenceforth there is no bad bourn for meI came to revere the Unrivalled One and the virtuous monks who delight in what is skilled to worship the auspicious assembly of ascetics and the respectworthy Fortunate One the DhammakingI am joyful and gladdened on seeing the sage the Tathaagata the outstanding trainer of men capable of being trained who has cut off craving who delights in what is skilled the guideI worship the supremely merciful Compassionate OneReferences are by verse number and paadaPage numbers in

of all creedsFounded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topicsIts publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddhas discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practiceThese works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first aroseThe Tipitaka the Buddhist canon is replete with references to the factors of enlightenment expounded by the Enlightened One on different occasions under different circumstancesIn the Book of the Kindred Sayings V we find a special section under the title Bojjhanga Samyutta wherein the Buddha discourses on the bojjhangas in diverse waysIn this section we read a series of three discourses or sermons recited by Buddhists since the time of the Buddha as a protection against pain disease and adversityThe term bojjhanga is composed of bodhi  angaBodh denotes enlightenment  to be exact insight concerned with the realization of the four Noble Truths namely the Noble Truth of suffering the Noble Truth of the origin of suffering the Noble Truth of the cessation of suffering and the Noble Truth of the path leading to the cessation of sufferingAnga means factors or limbsBodhi  anga therefore means the factors of enlightenment or the factors for insight wisdomBojjhangaBojjhangaIs the saying LordPray Lord how far is this name applicable queried a monk of the BuddhaBodhaya samvattantiti kho bhikkhu tasma bojjhanga ti vuccanti  They conduce to enlightenment monk that is why they are so called was the succinct reply of the MasterFurther says the Buddha Just as monks in a peaked house all rafters whatsoever go together to the peak slope to the peak join in the peak and of them all the peak is reckoned chief even so monks the monk who cultivates and makes much of the seven factors of wisdom slopes to Nibbana inclines to Nibbana tends to NibbanaThe seven factors areOne of the discourses on the Bojjhangas may be mentioned hereIt beginsThus I heard At one time the Buddha was living at Rajagaha at Veluvana in the squirrels feedinggroundAt that time the Venerable Maha Kassapa who was living in Pipphali Cave was sick stricken with a severe illnessThen the Buddha rising from his solitude at eventide visited the Venerable Maha Kassapa took his seat and spoke to the Venerable Maha Kassapa in this wiseWell Kassapa how is it with youAre you bearing up are you enduringDo your pains lessen or increaseAre there signs of your pains lessening and not increasingNo Lord I am not bearing up I am not enduringThe pain is very greatThere is a sign not of the pains lessening but of their increasingKassapa these seven factors of enlightenment are well expounded by me cultivated and much developed by me and when cultivated and much developed they conduce to full realization perfect wisdom to NibbanaWhat are the sevenMindfulnessThis O Kassapa is well expounded by me cultivated and much developed by me and when cultivated and much developed it conduces to full realization perfect wisdom to NibbanaInvestigation of the dhammaRaptureConcentrationEquanimity O Kassapa is well expounded by meThese seven factors of enlightenment verily Kassapa are well expounded by me cultivated and much developed by me and when cultivated and much developed they conduce to full realization perfect wisdom to NibbanaVerily Blessed One they are factors of enlightenmentVerily O Welcome One they are factors of enlightenment uttered Maha KassapaThus spoke the Buddha and the Venerable Maha Kassapa rejoicing welcomed the utterances of the Worthy OneAnd the Venerable Maha Kassapa rose from that illnessThere and then that ailment of the Venerable Maha Kassapa vanishedAnother discourse of the three mentioned above reveals that once when the Buddha himself was ill the Venerable Maha Cunda recited the bojjhangas factors of enlightenment and the Buddhas grievous illness vanishedMans mind tremendously and profoundly influences and affects the bodyIf allowed to function viciously and entertain unwholesome and harmful thoughts mind can cause disaster nay even kill a being but mind also can cure a sick bodyWhen concentrated on right thoughts with right understanding the effects mind can produce are immenseMind not only makes sick it also curesAn optimistic patient has more chance of getting well than a patient who is worried and unhappyThe recorded instances of faith healing include cases in which even organic diseases were cured almost instantaneously Aldous Huxley Ends and Means pBuddhism is the teaching of enlightenmentOne who is keen on attaining enlightenment should first know clearly the impediments that block the path to enlightenmentLife according to the right understanding of a Buddha is suffering and that suffering is based on ignorance or avijjaIgnorance is the experiencing of that which is unworthy of experiencing  namely evilFurther it is the nonperception of the conglomerate nature of the aggregates nonperception of senseorgan and object in their respective and objective natures nonperception of the emptiness or the relativity of the elements nonperception of the dominant nature of the sensecontrolling faculties nonperception of the thusness  the infallibility  of the four TruthsAnd the five hindrances are the nutriment of this ignoranceThey are called hindrances because they completely close in cut off and obstructThey hinder the understanding of the way to release from sufferingThese five hindrances are sensuality illwill obduracy of mind and mental factors restlessness and flurry and doubtAnd what is the nutriment of these hindrancesThe three evil modes of life bodily vocal and mental wrongdoingThis threefold nutriment is in turn nourished by nonrestraint of the senses which is explained by the commentator as the admittance of lust and hate into the six senseorgans of eye ear nose tongue body and mindThe nutriment of nonrestraint is shown to be lack of mindfulness and of complete awarenessIn the context of nutriment the drifting away of the object  the lapsing from the mind of the knowledge of the lakkhanas or characteristics of existence and forgetfulness of the true nature of things  is the reason for nonrestraintIt is when one does not bear in mind the transience and the other characteristics of things that one allows oneself all kinds of liberties in speech and deed and gives rein to full thought imagery of an unskillful kindLack of complete awareness is lack of these four complete awareness of purpose of suitability of resort and of nondelusionWhen one does a thing without a right purpose when one looks at things or does actions which do not help the growth of the good when one does things inimical to improvement when one forgets the dhamma which is the true resort of one who strives when one deludedly lays hold of things believing them to be pleasant beautiful permanent and substantial  when one behaves thus then too nonrestraint is nourishedAnd below this lack of mindfulness and complete awareness lies unsystematic reflectionThe books say unsystematic reflection is reflection that is off the right course that is taking the impermanent as permanent the painful as pleasure the soulless as a soul the bad as goodThe constant rollingon that is samsara is rooted in unsystematic thinkingWhen unsystematic thinking increases it fulfils two things nescience and lust for becomingIgnorance being present the origination of the entire mass of suffering comes to beThus a person who is a shallow thinker like a ship drifting at the winds will like a herd of cattle swept into the whirl pools of a river like an ox yoked to a wheelcontraption goes on revolving in the cycle of existence samsaraAnd it is said that imperfect confidence in the Buddha the Dhamma and the Sangha is the condition that develops unsystematic reflection and imperfect confidence is due to nonhearing of the True Law the dhammaFinally one does not hear the dhamma through lack of contact with the wise through not consorting with the goodThus want of kalyanamittata good friendship appears to be the basic reason for the ills of the worldAnd conversely the basis and nutriment of all good is shown to be good friendshipThat furnishes one with the food of the sublime dhamma which in turn produces confidence in the Triple Gem the Buddha Dhamma and the SanghaWhen one has confidence in the Triple Gem there come into existence profound or systematic thinking mindfulness and complete awareness restraint of the senses the three good modes of life the four arousings of mindfulness the seven factors of enlightenment and deliverance through wisdom one after another in due orderLet us now deal with the enlightenment factors one by oneThe first is sati mindfulnessIt is the instrument most efficacious in selfmastery and whosoever practices it has found the path to deliveranceIt is fourfold mindfulness consisting in contemplation of the body feeling mind and mental objectsThe man lacking in this allimportant quality of mindfulness cannot achieve anything worthwhileThe Buddhas final admonition to his disciples on his death bed is this Transient are all component thingsWork out your deliverance with heedfulnessAnd the last words of the Venerable Sariputta the foremost disciple of the Buddha who predeceased the Master were this Strive on with HeedfulnessThis is my advice to youIn both these injunctions the most significant and pregnant word is appamada which literally means incessant heedfulnessMan cannot be heedful unless he is aware of his actions  whether they are mental verbal or physical  at every moment of his waking lifeOnly when a man is fully awake to and mindful of his activities can he distinguish good from bad and right from wrongIt is in the light of mindfulness that he will see the beauty or the ugliness of his deedsThe word appamada throughout the Tipitaka is used to denote sati mindfulness pamada is defined as absence of mindfulnessSays the Buddha in the Anguttara NikayaMonks I know not of any other single thing of such power to cause the arising of good thoughts if not yet arisen or to cause the waning of evil thoughts if already arisen as heedfulnessIn him who is heedful good thoughts not yet arisen do arise and evil thoughts if arisen do waneConstant mindfulness and vigilance are necessary to avoid ill and perform goodThe man with presence of mind who surrounds himself with watchfulness of mind the man of courage and earnestness gets ahead of the lethargic the heedless as a racehorse outstrips a decrepit hackThe importance of sati mindfulness in all our dealings is clearly indicated by the following striking words of the BuddhaMindfulness O disciples I declare is essential in all things everywhereIt is as salt is to the curry MA Satipatthana commentaryThe Buddhas life is one integral picture of mindfulnessHe is the sada sato the evermindful the evervigilantHe is the very embodiment of mindfulnessThere was never an occasion when the Buddha manifested signs of sluggish inactivity or thoughtlessnessRight mindfulness or complete awareness in a way is superior to knowledge because in the absence of mindfulness it is just impossible for a man to make the best of his learningIntelligence devoid of mindfulness tends to lead man astray and entice him from the path of rectitude and dutyEven people who are well informed and intelligent fail to see a thing in its proper perspective when they lack this allimportant quality of mindfulnessMen of good standing owing to deeds done and words spoken thoughtlessly and without due consideration to their consequences are often subjected to severe and justified criticismMindfulness is the chief characteristic of all wholesome actions tending to ones own and others profitAppamado mahato atthaya sanvattati Mindfulness is conducive to great profit  that is highest mental development  and it is through such attainment that deliverance from the sufferings of samsara is possibleThe man who delights in mindfulness and regards heedlessness with dread is not liable to fall awayHe is in the vicinity of NibbanaThe second enlightenment factor is dhammavicaya keen investigation of the DhammaIt is the sharp analytical knowledge of understanding the true nature of all constituent things animate or inanimate human or divineIt is seeing things as they really are seeing things in their proper perspectiveIt is the analysis of all component things into their fundamental elements right down to their ultimatesThrough keen investigation one understands that all compounded things pass through the inconceivably rapid moments of uppada thiti and bhanga or of arising reaching a peak and ceasing just as a river in flood sweeps to a climax and fades awayThe whole universe is constantly changing not remaining the same for two consecutive momentsAll things in fact are subjected to causes conditions and effectsSystematic reflection comes naturally through right mindfulness and it urges one to discriminate to reason and investigateShallow thinking unsystematic investigation makes men muddleheaded and then they fail to investigate the nature of thingsSuch people cannot see cause and effect seed and fruit the rise and fall of compounded thingsSays the Buddha This doctrine is for the wise and not for the unwiseBuddhism is free from compulsion and coercion and does not demand of the follower blind faithAt the very outset the skeptic will be pleased to hear of its call for investigationBuddhism from beginning to end is open to all those who have eyes to see and minds to understandThe Buddha never endeavored to wring out of his followers blind and submissive faith in him and his teachingHe tutors his disciples in the ways of discrimination and intelligent inquiryTo the inquiring Kalamas the Buddha answered Right is it to doubt right is it to question what is doubtful and what is not clearIn a doubtful matter wavering does ariseWe find this dialogue between the Master and his disciplesIf now knowing this and perceiving this would you say We honor our Master and through respect for him we respect what he teaches Nay LordThat which you affirm O disciples is it not only that which you yourselves have recognized seen and graspedYes LordAnd in conformity with this thoroughly correct attitude of true inquiry the philosophers of later times observed As the wise test the purity of gold by burning cutting and examining it by means of a piece of touchstone so should you accept my words after examining them and not merely out of regard and reverence for me Thus blind belief is condemned in the analytic teaching of the BuddhaThe truth of the dhamma can be grasped only through calm concentrative thought and insight and never through blind faithOne who goes in quest of truth is never satisfied with surface knowledgeHe wants to delve deep and see what is beneathThat is the sort of search encouraged in BuddhismThat type of search yields right understandingWe read in the texts the following story On one occasion Upali a fervent follower of Nigantha Nathaputta the Jain visited the Buddha thoughtfully listened to the dhamma gained saddha and forthwith manifested his readiness to become a follower of the MasterNevertheless the Master said Of a truth Upali make thorough investigation and thus discouraged himThis clearly shows that the Buddha was not keen on converting people to his way of thinking and to his foldHe did not interfere with another mans freedom of thought for freedom of thought is the birthright of every individualIt is wrong to force someone out of the way of life which accords with his outlook and character spiritual inclinations and tendencies compulsion in every form is badIt is coercion of the blackest kind to make a man gulp down beliefs for which he has no relishSuch forced feeding cannot be good for anybody anywhereHe that cultivates dhammavicaya investigation of the dhamma focuses his mind on the five aggregates of grasping the pañcupadanakkhandha and endeavors to realize the rise and fall or the arising and passing away of this conglomeration of bare forces this conflux of mind and matterIt is only when he fully realizes the evanescent nature of his own mind and body that he experiences happiness joyous anticipationTherefore it is saidWhenever he reflects on the rise and fall of the aggregates he experiences unalloyed joy and happinessTo the discerning one that is deathless NibbanaWhat is impermanent and not lasting he sees as sorrowfraughtWhat is impermanent and sorrowfraught he understands as void of a permanent and everlasting soul self or ego entityIt is this grasping this realization of the three characteristics or laws of transience sorrow and nonself  anicca dukkha and anatta  that is known to Buddhists as vipassanañana or penetrative insight which like the razoredged sword entirely eradicates all the latent tendencies and with it all the varied ramifications of sorrows cause are finally destroyedA man who ascends to this summit of vision is an arahat a perfect one whose clarity of vision whose depth of insight penetrates into the deepest recesses of life and cognizes the true nature that underlies all appearanceNo more can he be swept off his feet by the glamour of things ephemeralNo more can he be confused by fearful and terrible appearancesNo more is it possible for him to have a clouded view of phenomena for he has transcended all capacity for error through the perfect immunity which penetrative insight alone can giveThe third enlightenment factor is viriya energyIt is a mental property and the sixth limb of the Noble Eightfold Path there called sammavayama right effortThe life of the Buddha clearly reveals that he was never subjected to moral or spiritual fatigueFrom the hour of his enlightenment to the end of his life he strove tirelessly to elevate mankind regardless of the bodily fatigue involved and oblivious to the many obstacles and handicaps that hampered his wayHe never relaxed in his exertion for the common wealThough physically he was not always fit mentally he was ever vigilant and energeticOf him it is saidBuddhism is for the sincerely zealous strong and firm in purpose and not for the indolentThe Buddha has not proclaimed himself a savior willing and able to take upon himself the evil of mankindOn the contrary he declares that each person has to bear the burden of his ill deedsIn the words of the Buddha each individual has himself to put forth the necessary effort and work out his own deliverance with diligenceThe Buddha is only a pathrevealer and not a savior who endeavors to save souls by means of a revealed religionThe idea that another raises a man from lower to higher levels of life and ultimately rescues him tends to make a man indolent and weak supine and foolishOthers may lend us a helping hand indirectly but deliverance from suffering must be wrought out and fashioned by each one for himself upon the anvil of his own actionsBe ye islands unto yourselves be ye your own refuge Thus did the Master exhort his followers to acquire selfrelianceA follower of the Buddha should not under any circumstances relinquish hope and effort for the Buddha was one who never gave up hope and courage even as a BodhisattaAs an aspirant for Buddhahood he had as his motto the following inspiring words ma nivatta abhikkhama  Falter not advance The man who is mindful and cultivates keen investigation should next put forth the necessary effort to fight his way outThe function of energy is fourfold the effort to eradicate evils that have arisen in the mind the effort to prevent the arising of unarisen evil the effort to develop unarisen good the effort to promote the further growth of good already arisenJust says the Vitakka Santhana Suttanta of the Majjhima Nikaya as a competent carpenter or carpenters apprentice with a slender pin will knock out remove and dispose of a thicker one so also when through dwelling on some idea that has come to him evil unsalutary considerations connected with desire hate and delusion arise in the monk then he should engender in his mind an idea other than that former idea and connected with salutary things whereupon the evil unsalutary considerations will disappear and with their disappearing his mind will become settled subdued unified concentratedThus the path of purification is impossible for an indolent personThe aspirant for enlightenment should possess unflinching energy coupled with fixed determinationEnlightenment and deliverance lie absolutely and entirely in his own handsMan must himself by his own resolute efforts rise and make his way to the portals of liberty and it is always in every moment in his power so to doNeither are those portals locked and the key in possession of someone else from whom it must be obtained by prayer and entreatyThat door is free of all bolts and bars save those the man himself has madeBy precept and example the Buddha was an exponent of the strenuous lifeHear these words of the Buddha The idler who does not strive who though young and strong is full of sloth who is weak in resolution that lazy and idle man will not find the way to wisdom the way to enlightenmentFollowing in the footsteps of the Buddha the disciple thinks Though only my skin sinews and bones remain and my blood and flesh dry up and wither away yet never will I give up my quest and swerve from the path of rectitude and enlightenmentThe fourth enlightenment factor is piti rapture or happinessThis too is a mental property and is a quality which suffuses both the body and mindThe man lacking in this quality cannot proceed along the path to enlightenmentThere will arise in him a sullen indifference to the dhamma an aversion to the practice of meditation and morbid manifestationsIt is therefore very necessary that a man striving to attain enlightenment and final deliverance from the fetters of samsara that repeated wandering should endeavor to cultivate the allimportant factor of happinessNo one can bestow on another the gift of happiness each one has to build it up by effort reflection and concentrated activityAs happiness is a thing of the mind it should be sought not in external and material things though they may in a small way be instrumentalContentment is a characteristic of the really happy individualThe ordinary worldling seems to think that it is difficult to cultivate and develop contentment but by dint of courage determination systematic attention and thought about the things one meets with in everyday life by controlling ones evil inclinations and by curbing the impulses  the sudden tendencies to act without reflection  one can keep the mind from being soiled and experience happiness through contentmentIn mans mind arise conflicts of diverse kinds and if these conflicts are to be controlled while still not eliminated man must give less rein to inclinations and longings  in other words he must cultivate contentmentHard it is to give up what lures and holds us in thrall and hard it is to exorcise the evil spirits that haunt the human heart in the shape of ugly and unwholesome thoughtsThese evils are the manifestations of lust hate and delusionUntil one attains to the very crest of purity and peace by constant training of the mind one cannot defeat these hosts completelyThe mere abandoning of outward things fasting bathing in rivers and hot springs and so forth these do not tend to purify a man these things do not make a man happy holy and harmlessHence the need to develop the Buddhas path of purification morality meditation and insightWhen discussing happiness in the context of sambojjhangas we must bear in mind the vast difference between pleasure and happinessPleasure  pleasant feeling  is something very momentary and fleetingIs it wrong to say that pleasant feelings are the prelude to painWhat people hug in great glee this moment turns to be a source of pain in the next momentThe desired is no longer there when the outstretched hand would grasp it or being there and grasped it vanishes like a flake of snowIn the words of Robert BurnsSeeing a form hearing a sound perceiving an odor tasting a flavor feeling some tangible thing cognizing an idea people are moved and from those sense objects and mental objects they experience a certain degree of pleasureBut it is all a passing show of phenomenaUnlike the animal whose sole purpose is to derive a feeling of pleasure from any source at any cost man should endeavor to gain real piti or happinessReal happiness or rapture comes not through grasping or clinging to things animate or inanimate but by giving upIt is the detached attitude toward the world that brings about true happinessThe Satipatthana Sutta the Discourse on the Foundations of Mindfulness speaks of pleasant worldly feeling and pleasant unworldly feelingNiramisa sukha is far superior to samisasukhaOnce the Buddha did not receive even a single morsel of food when he went on his alms round and an intruder remarked that the Master was apparently afflicted with hungerThereupon the Supreme Buddha breathed forth the following verseUnalloyed joy comes to a man who ponders thus Others may harm but I will become harmless others may slay living beings but I will become a nonslayer others may live unchaste but I will live pureOthers may utter falsehood I however will speak the truthOthers may slander talk harshly indulge in gossip but I will talk only words that promote concord harmless words agreeable to the ear full of love heartpleasing courteous worthy of being borne in mind timely fit and to the pointOthers may be covetous I will not covetEnergetic steeped in modesty of heart unswerving as regards truth and rectitude peaceful honest contented generous and truthful in all things will I be Thus conducive to full realization perfect wisdom to Nibbana is this fourth enlightenment factor piti happinessPassaddhi  calm or tranquility  is the fifth factor of enlightenmentPassaddhi is twofoldKaya passaddhi is calm of bodyKaya here means all the mental properties rather than the physical body in other words calm of the aggregates of feeling perception and the volitional activities or conformationsCitta passaddhi is the calm of the mind  that is the aggregate of consciousnessPassaddhi is compared to the happy experience of a weary walker who sits down under a tree in a shade or the cooling of a hot place by rainHard it is to tranquillize the mind it trembles and it is unsteady difficult to guard and hold back it quivers like a fish taken from its watery home and thrown on the dry groundIt wanders at willSuch is the nature of this ultrasubtle mindIt is systematic reflection that helps the aspirant for enlightenment to quieten the fickle mindUnless a man cultivates tranquility of mind concentration cannot be successfully developedA tranquillized mind keeps away all superficialities and futilitiesMany a man today thinks that freedom and unrestraint are synonyms and that the taming of the self is a hindrance to selfdevelopmentIn the teaching of the Buddha however it is quite differentThe self must be subdued and tamed on right lines if it is to become truly wellThe Tathagata the Tamed teaches the Dhamma for the purpose of taming the human heartIt is only when the mind is tranquillized and is kept to the right road of orderly progress that it becomes useful for the individual possessor of it and for societyA disorderly mind is a liability both to the owner of it and for othersAll the havoc wrought in the world is wrought by men who have not learned the way of mental calm balance and poiseCalmness is not weaknessThe calm attitude at all times shows a man of cultureIt is not too hard a task for a man to be calm when all things around him are favorableBut to be composed in mind in the midst of unfavorable circumstances is hard indeed and it is this difficult quality that is worth achieving for by such control one builds up strength of characterThe most deceptive thing in the world is to imagine that they alone are strong who are noisy or that they alone possess power who are fussily busyThe man who cultivates calm of the mind does not get upset confused or excited when confronted with the eight vicissitudes of the worldHe endeavors to see the rise and fall of all things conditioned how things come into being and pass awayFree from anxiety and restlessness he will see the fragility of the fragileA story in our books tells us how when a mother was asked why she did not lament and feel pain over the death of her beloved son said Uninvited he came uninvited he passed away as he came so he went what use is there in lamenting weeping and wailing Such is the advantage of a tranquillized mindIt is unshaken by loss or gain blame and praise and undisturbed by adversityThis frame of mind is brought about by viewing the sentient world in its proper perspectiveThus calm or passaddhi leads man to enlightenment and deliverance from sufferingThe sixth enlightenment factor is samadhi concentrationIt is only the tranquillized mind that can easily concentrate on a subject of meditationThe calm concentrated mind sees things as they really areThe unified mind brings the five hindrances under subjugationConcentration is the intensified steadiness of the mind comparable to an unflickering flame of a lamp in a windless placeIt is concentration that fixes the mind aright and causes it to be unmoved and undisturbedCorrect practice of samadhi maintains the mind and the mental properties in a state of balance like a steady hand holding a pair of scalesRight concentration dispels passions that disturb the mind and brings purity and placidity of mindThe concentrated mind is not distracted by sense objects concentration of the highest type cannot be disturbed under the most adverse circumstancesOne who is intent on samadhi should develop a love of virtue sila for it is virtue that nourishes mental life and makes it coherent and calm equable and full of rich contentThe unrestrained mind dissipates itself in frivolous activityMany are the impediments that confront a yogi an aspirant for enlightenment but there are five particular hindrances that hinder concentrative thought samadhi and obstruct the way to deliveranceIn the teaching of the Buddha they are known as pañca nivarana the five hindrancesThe Pali term nivarana denotes that which hinders or obstructs mental developmentThey are called hindrances because they completely close in cut off and obstructThey close the doors to deliveranceThe five hindrances areKamacchanda or sensual desires or intense thirst for either possessions or the satisfaction of base desires is the first that binds man to samsara repeated wandering and closes the door to final deliveranceWhat is sensualityWhere does this craving arise and take rootAccording to the Discourse on the Foundations of Mindfulness where there is the delightful and the pleasurable there this craving arises and takes root Forms sounds smell taste bodily contacts and ideas are delightful and pleasurable there this craving arises and takes rootCraving when obstructed by some cause is transformed to frustration and wrathAs the Dhammapada saysThe next hindrance is vyapada illwill hatred or aversionMan naturally revolts against the unpleasant and the disagreeable and also is depressed by themTo be separated from the loved is painful and equally painful is the union with the loathedEven a disagreeable dish an unpleasant drink an unlovely demeanor and a hundred other trifles may cause indignationIt is wrong thinking unsystematic reflection that brings about hatredHatred on the other hand breeds hatred and clouds the vision it distorts the entire mind and its properties and thus hinders awakening to truth blocks the way to freedomThis lust and hatred based on ignorance the crowning corruption of all our madness indeed are the root causes of strife and dissension between man and man and nation and nationThe third hindrance consists of a pair of evils thina and middhaThina is lassitude or morbid state of the mind and middha is a morbid state of the mental propertiesThinamiddha as some are inclined to think is certainly not sluggishness of the body for even the arahats the perfect ones who are free from this pair of evils also experience bodily fatigueThinamiddha retards mental development under its influence mind is inert like butter too stiff to spread or like molasses sticking to a spoonLaxity is a dangerous enemy of mental developmentLaxity leads to greater laxity until finally there arises a state of callous indifferenceThis flabbiness of character is a fatal block to righteousness and freedomIt is through viriya or mental effort that one overcomes this pair of evilsThe fourth hindrance also comprises twin drawbacks uddhacca and kukkucca restlessness and brooding or flurry and worryAs a rule anyone who commits evil is mentally excited and restless the guilty and the impatient suffer from this hindranceThe minds of men who are restless and unstable are like flustered bees in a shaken hiveThis mental agitation impedes meditation and blocks the upward pathEqually baneful is mental worryOften people repent over the evil actions they have committedThis is not praised by the Buddha for it is useless to cry over spilt milkInstead of brooding over such shortcomings one should endeavor not to repeat such unwholesome deedsThere are others who worry over the good deeds omitted and duties left undoneThis too serves no purposeIt is as futile as to ask the further bank of a river to come over that we may get to the other sideInstead of uselessly worrying over what good one has failed to do one should endeavor to perform wholesome deedsThis mental unsteadiness also hinders mental progressThe fifth and the last hindrance is vicikiccha doubtThe Pali term vi  cikiccha literally means medicinelessOne who suffers from perplexity is really suffering from a dire disease and until and unless one sheds ones doubts one will continue to suffer from itSo long as man is subject to this mental itching so long will he continue to take a cynical view of things which is most detrimental to mental developmentThe commentators explain this hindrance as the inability to decide anything definitely it also comprises doubt with regard to the possibility of attaining the jhanas concentrative thoughtIn this connection one may add that even nonBuddhists and yogis who are not concerned with the BuddhaDhamma and the Sangha at all can inhibit doubt and gain the jhanasThe yogi who attains the jhanas inhibits all five hindrances by the five jhanangas characteristics or factors of jhanas kamacchanda is inhibited by ekaggata vyapada by piti thinamiddha by vitakka uddhaccakukkucca by sukha and vicikiccha by vicaraThe attainment of jhanas however is not the end aimed atJhanas should be made to lead to vipassana intuitional insightIt is through insight that the yogi eradicates the latent corruptions and attains perfect puritySo long as impurities or taints exist in mans mind latent so long will the arising of papa in him continueThe practitioner of jhana whose purpose is to attain vipassana commits no ill action because the hindrances are inhibited but he has the impurities latent in his makeup and therefore he is not yet in a state of absolute securityBut the Arahat the perfect one wipes out all the latent impurities with their rootlets and brings this repetitive wandering samsara to a standstillHe is one whose samsara is indubitably ended for by him the noble life has been perfected and the task doneFor him there is no more rebirthA sincere student who is bent on deep study cuts himself off from sense attractions and retiring to a congenial atmosphere holds fast to his studiesThus steering through all disturbing factors he attains success in his examinationsIn the same way seated in a cloistercell or some other suitable place far from the madding crowds ignoble strife the yogi the meditator fixes his mind on a subject of meditation and by struggle and unceasing effort inhibits the five hindrances and washing out the impurities of his mindflux gradually reaches the first the second the third and the fourth jhanaThen by the power of samadhi concentrative thought thus won he turns his mind to the understanding of reality in the highest senseIt is at this stage that the yogi cultivates vipassana intuitional insightIt is through vipassana that one understands the real nature of all component and conditioned thingsVipassana aids one to see things as they truly areOne sees truth face to face and comprehends that all tones are just variations struck on the one chord that runs through all life  the chord which is made up of anicca dukkha and anatta impermanence sorrow and soullessnessThe yogi gains insight into the true nature of the world he has clung to for so longHe breaks through the egg shell of ignorance to the HypercosmicWith that final catharsis he reaches the state where dawns for him the Light of Nibbana the Calm beyond words the unshakable deliverance of the mind and the world holds nothing more for himSays the Dhammapada To the bhikkhu who has retired to a secluded spot whose mind is calmed and who clearly discerns the dhamma there comes unalloyed joy and happiness transcending that of humansThe seventh and the last factor of enlightenment is upekkha equanimityIn the Abhidhamma upekkha is indicated by the term tatramajjhattata neutralityIt is mental equipoise and not hedonic indifferenceEquanimity is the result of a calm concentrative mindIt is hard indeed to be undisturbed when touched by the vicissitudes of life but the man who cultivates this difficult quality of equanimity is not upsetAmidst the welter of experience  gain and loss goodrepute and illrepute praise and censure pain and happiness  he never waversHe is firm as a solid rockOf course this is the attitude of the Arahat the perfect oneOf him it is said Truly the good give up longing for everythingThe good prattle not with thoughts of cravingTouched by happiness or by pain the wise show neither elation nor depressionRefraining from intoxicants and becoming heedful establishing themselves in patience and purity the wise train their minds it is through such training that a quiet mind is achievedCan we also achieve itLord Horder answers the question thus Yes But howWell not by doing some great thing Why were the saints saints someone askedAnd the answer came Because they were cheerful when it was difficult to be cheerful and patient when it was difficult to be patientThey pushed on when they wanted to stand still and kept silent when they wanted to talk That was allSo simple but so difficultA matter of mental hygiene The poet saysMention is made in our books of four wrong pathsThe path of greed of hate of cowardice of delusionPeople commit evil being enticed along one or more of these wrong paths but the man who has reached perfect neutrality through the cultivation of equanimity always avoids such wrong pathsHis serene neutrality enables him to see all beings impartiallyA certain understanding of the working of kamma and how kamma comes into fruition is very necessary for one who is genuinely bent on cultivating equanimityIn the light of kamma one will be able to have a detached attitude toward all beings nay even inanimate thingsThe proximate cause of equanimity is the understanding that all beings are the result of their actionsSantideva writes in BodhicaryavataraI have here made an attempt to give a glimpse of the seven enlightenment factors expounded over years ago by the Supreme Buddha for the attaining of full realization and perfect wisdom of Nibbana the DeathlessThe cultivation or the neglect of these factors of enlightenment is left to each one of usWith the aid of the teaching of the Buddha each one of us has the power to detect and destroy the cause of sufferingEach one individually can put forth the necessary effort to work out his deliveranceThe Buddha has taught us the way to know life as it is and has furnished the directions for such research by each of us individuallyTherefore we owe it to ourselves to find out for ourselves the truth about life and to make the best of itWe cannot say justifiably that we do not know how to proceedThere is nothing vague in the teaching of the BuddhaAll the necessary indications are clear as clear could beBuddhism from beginning to end is open to all those who have eyes to see and minds to understandSo clear is his teaching that it can never be misunderstood The only thing necessary on our part for the full realization of the truth is firm determination endeavor and earnestness to study and apply the teaching each working it out for himself to the best of his abilityThe dhamma yet beckons the weary pilgrim to the happy haven of Nibbanas security and peaceLet us therefore cultivate the seven enlightenment factors with zest and unflagging devotion and advance Psalms of the Brethren The Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creedsFounded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topicsIts publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddhas discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practiceThese works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first aroseEach time you choose one course of action over another youre making a wager as to the consequences of your choiceThis is especially true if the choice is between something easy that promises pleasant shortterm rewards and something hard that promises great rewards but only after a long timeWill the harder choice be worth the effortWill the easier one be irresponsible in the long runAs a person embedded in time theres no way you can know for sureTo begin with there are the particulars of your own personal future Will you or those you love live long enough to experience the results of your choicesWill disaster interfere to wipe out everything youve doneThen there are the larger uncertainties of life in general Do we even have choices in our actions or are all our choices predetermined by some past or outside power beyond our controlIf we do have choices is it worthwhile to struggle over difficult onesDo they really matterAnd even if our choices do matter how far into the future should we calculate the consequencesDo they shape only this life or can they shape lives after deathArguments based on logic or reason have never been able to settle these issues conclusively the worlds great religions dont agree on their answers and the empirical sciences have no way of answering these questions at allYet we all keep having to grapple with these questionsWe dont leave it at I dont know and refuse to entertain them for even the refusal to think about these things is a wager that ultimately they wont matterThe Buddha taught however that they do matter a great deal and that awakening  in going beyond the dimensions of space and time  gives perspective on how choices operate within those dimensionsYou see that choices are real that they do make a difference and that the consequences of your choices can shape not only this life but also many lifetimes in the future  as long as the mind still has the craving that leads to rebirth after deathPrior to awakening you cant know these things for sure but as the Buddha states if you want to gain awakening and to minimize suffering in the meantime its wisest to assume these principles as working hypothesesOf course thats taking the Buddha at his word  which as long as you havent gained awakening is a wager tooThe purpose of this small book on the Buddhas teachings about rebirth is to show why as you engage repeatedly in the wagers of action the wisest course is to place your bets with himRebirth has always been a central teaching in the Buddhist traditionThe earliest records in the Pali Canon indicate that the Buddha prior to his awakening searched for a happiness not subject to the vagaries of repeated birth aging illness and deathOne of the reasons he left his early teachers was because he recognized that their teachings led not to the goal he sought but to rebirth on a refined levelOn the night of his awakening two of the three knowledges leading to his release from suffering focused on the topic of rebirthThe first showed his own many previous lives the second depicting the general pattern of beings dying and being reborn throughout the cosmos showed the connection between rebirth and karma or actionWhen he did finally attain release from suffering he recognized that he had achieved his goal because he had touched a dimension that not only was free from birth but also had freed him from ever being reborn againAfter he had attained release his newfound freedom from rebirth was the first realization that occurred spontaneously to his mindWhen teaching the path to awakening to others he defined the four stages of awakening achieved by the path in terms of how many rebirths remained for those who reached them up to seven for those reaching the first stage one return to the human world for those reaching the second rebirth followed by total liberation in the Pure Abodes for those reaching the third and no rebirth for those reaching the fourthOn occasion when one of his disciples who had not reached full awakening passed away he would comment on the disciples rebirth  as when Anathapindika the householder after his passing appeared to the Buddha as a heavenly beingWhen any of the Buddhas fully awakened disciples passed away he would state that one of the amazing features of their passing was that their consciousness could no longer be found in the cosmosRebirth he said happened to those who still had clinging but not to those who didntAnd one of his own amazing attainments as Buddha he said was that after the end of this life the world would see him no moreWhen discussing more mundane topics such as the rewards of generosity and virtue he would cite the rewards they brought not only in this life but also in future onesEven in cases where he was asked specifically to confine his discussion to the present life he would end the discussion by referring to the rewards of these skillful actions after deathSo the theme of rebirth is woven inextricably throughout the Buddhas teachingsAnd freedom from rebirth has been a central feature of the Buddhist goal from the very beginning of the traditionAll of the various Buddhist religions that later developed in Asia despite their other differences were unanimous in teaching rebirthEven those that didnt aim at putting an end to rebirth still taught rebirth as a factYet as these Buddhist religions have come to the West they have run into a barrier from modern Western culture Of all the Buddhas teachings rebirth has been one of the hardest for modern Westerners to acceptPart of this resistance comes from the fact that none of the dominant worldviews of Western culture religious or materialistic contain anything corresponding to the idea of repeated rebirthPlato taught it but  aside from an esoteric fringe  few in the modern West have treated this side of his teaching as anything more than a mythFor people who have felt burned or repelled by the faith demands of Western religion there is the added barrier that the teaching on rebirth is something that  for the unawakened  has to be taken on faithThey would prefer a Buddhism that makes no faith demands focusing its attention solely on the benefits it can bring in this lifeSo for many Westerners who have profited from the Buddhas psychological insights and meditational tools the question arises Can we strip the Buddhas teachings of any mention of rebirth and still get the full benefits of what he had to teachIn other words can we drop the Buddhas worldview while keeping his psychology and still realize everything it has to offerWe in the West have done this sort of thing beforeIn the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries many European Romantics and American Transcendentalists found that they couldnt accept the worldview of the Bible because they were born in an era of new scientific discoveries  of geological deep time and astronomical deep space  that called the biblical worldview into questionNevertheless they valued many of the psychological teachings the Bible containedSo they developed an historical approach to the Bible stating that its worldview may have fit in with the cultural presuppositions of the time when it was written but that that worldview had to be discarded as science advancedOnly then could the Bibles psychological insights survive in the modern worldAnd not only survive actually develop to a higher levelBy dropping its outofdate worldview and leaving cosmology to the scientists the JudeoChristian tradition could focus more precisely and effectively on the proper sphere of all religions the development of the human psycheThis approach formed the basis of liberal Christianity and Reform JudaismInspired by this approach many modern Buddhist teachers have argued that the teaching on rebirth should be treated in the same wayIn their eyes rebirth was simply a cultural presupposition of the Buddhas time and  because it no longer fits in with our cultural presuppositions and scientific beliefs  the time has come to discard it so as to help the Buddhist tradition advanceTo support their argument these teachers cite the works of historical scholars who state that everyone in India in the Buddhas time believed in the idea of rebirth and in the metaphysical assumptions about karma and personal identity on which the idea is based that theres something within each of us that survives the death of the body and that our actions shape where that something will be rebornThus they argue the Buddha in teaching karma and rebirth was simply going along with the crowdA stronger version of this argument holds that the teaching on rebirth was not merely irrelevant to the Buddhas essential message it was actually antitheticalJust as all great thinkers have their lapses he  or whoever in compiling the Pali Canon put the teaching on rebirth into his mouth  didnt realize that his cultures assumptions about karma rebirth and personal identity were at odds with his central teachings on notself and the four noble truthsNow that we no longer hold to those assumptions  and have replaced them with more reliable scientific notions of human action and the metaphysics of personal identity  were in a better position to drop the idea of rebirth and reshape the Buddhist tradition so that it focuses more clearly on the Buddhas central insight and the main purpose of his teaching the ending of suffering in the hereandnowThe irony of this argument is that when we check it against the actual historical evidence we find that it has everything backwardsThe actual facts are these The idea of rebirth was far from universally accepted in India during the Buddhas timeSome schools of thought actively rejected it others affirmed itAnd thinkers on both sides offered widely differing metaphysical ideas about personal identity in support of their positionsIn other words even those who agreed that rebirth did or didnt happen disagreed as to what was or wasnt rebornAt the same time those who did agree in teaching rebirth disagreed on the role played by karma or action in the process of rebirthSome maintained that action influenced the course of ones lives after death others that it played no role at all Thus the Buddha in teaching rebirth and its relation to karma was actually addressing one of the hot topics of the timeBecause he didnt always take up controversial topics he must have seen that the issue passed the criterion he set for which topics he would address that it be conducive to putting an end to sufferingAnd in fact he made rebirth an integral part of his explanation of mundane right view  the level of right view that provides an understanding of the powers and consequences of human action that allows for the possibility that human action can put an end to suffering He also made rebirth an integral part of his explanation of the four noble truths and the understanding of causality  dependent coarising  on which those truths are basedBecause dependent coarising contains many feedback loops  in which one factor reproduces the factors that feed it  its a selfsustaining process with the potential to maintain itself indefinitelyThis is why birth has the potential to keep repeating as rebirth until something is actively done to cut the feedback loops that keep the process goingAt the same time because dependent coarising operates on many scales  from the micro level of events in the mind to the macro level of lifetimes across time in the cosmos  it shows how micro events can lead to rebirth on the macro scale and conversely how the practice of training the mind can put an end to all forms of suffering  including rebirth  on every levelWhat this means in practice is that no matter how much you observe the events of dependent coarising in the present moment if you dont appreciate their potential to sustain one another indefinitely you dont fully comprehend themAnd if you dont fully comprehend them you cant gain full release from them In discussing rebirth the Buddha differed from the other schools of the time in that he didnt base his position on a metaphysical view of personal identity  that is on defining what it is that gets rebornBy placing rebirth in the context of dependent coarising he was presenting it in a phenomenological context  ie one that focused on phenomena as they can be directly experienced and that refused to take a stand on whether there is a reality of things underlying themHis purpose in taking this sort of position was pragmatic and strategic By focusing on events and processes as theyre directly experienced you can redirect them  through the power of attention and intention  away from the suffering they normally cause and toward a deathless happinessIn this way the Buddhas approach instead of being metaphysical bears similarities to modern schools of philosophy  phenomenology and pragmatism  that avoid getting involved in metaphysical assumptions about a reality behind direct experience The fact that the Buddha suggested that his contemporaries drop their metaphysical assumptions about personal identity if they wanted to practice the path suggests that he would make the same suggestion to people in the modern worldTo get the most out of his teachings its necessary to recognize that we have metaphysical assumptions about personal identity and the world and that  unless we put them aside  those assumptions will prevent us from looking deeply enough at immediate experience in the terms described in dependent coarisingTo see experience in terms of dependent coarising means identifying the mental events and choices that lead to rebirth and other forms of suffering and developing the knowledge that can put them to an endIn other words part of the practice even today lies in confirming that the Buddha was right about the connection between karma and rebirth and that his rightness was timeless These teachings are integral to the four noble truths and in particular to the path of practice leading to the end of sufferingTo discard these teachings wont help Buddhism to advanceIt will prevent the teachings from fulfilling their purposeAlthough its possible to gain some benefit from the Buddhas teachings without accepting what he said about rebirth if we want to get the most out of his teachings we owe it to ourselves to give his statements on rebirth a fair hearingBecause rebirth is such an important working hypothesis in following the path all the way to the end of suffering and because misinformation on these points is so widespread its necessary to discuss the Buddhas actual teachings and their context in some detailIn addition because Buddhist thinkers in the centuries after the Buddhas passing often abandoned the Buddhas position on point number four  they let themselves get drawn into metaphysical discussions about what does or doesnt take birth  we have to focus on the early Pali discourses to gain an accurate picture of the Buddhas own position on these issuesIts hard to understand why modern scholars keep repeating the idea that everyone in India during the Buddhas time believed in rebirthActually the Pali discourses provide clear evidence to the contrary evidence that has been available in Western languages for more than a centuryThe Buddha frequently referred to two extremes of wrong view that blocked progress on the path eternalism and annihilationismAnnihilationism is the term he used to describe those who denied rebirthApparently he didnt invent the term himself as MN reports that other teachers sometimes accused him of being an annihilationist as wellOther passages in the Canon depict some of the more colorful ways in which annihilationism was taught in his timeIn particular they mention two people who were famous for their annihilationist viewsOne was Ajita Kesakambalin the leader of a materialist sectDN reports him saying thisThere is nothing given nothing offered nothing sacrificedThere is no fruit or result of good or bad actionsThere is no this world no next world no mother no father no spontaneously reborn beings no contemplatives or brahmans who faring rightly and practicing rightly proclaim this world and the next after having directly known and realized it for themselvesA person is a composite of four primary elementsAt death the earth returns to and merges with the earthsubstanceThe fire returns to and merges with the external firesubstanceThe liquid returns to and merges with the external liquidsubstanceThe wind returns to and merges with the external windsubstanceThe sensefaculties scatter into spaceFour men with the bier as the fifth carry the corpseIts eulogies are sounded only as far as the charnel groundThe bones turn pigeoncoloredThe offerings end in ashesGenerosity is taught by idiotsThe words of those who speak of existence after death are false empty chatterWith the breakup of the body the wise and the foolish alike are annihilated destroyedThey do not exist after deathAnother famous annihilationist was a prince named PayasiDN states that he held a materialist view similar to Ajita Kesakambalin and that he used his power to execute criminals as an opportunity to conduct gruesome quasiscientific experiments to test whether any part of a human being survived deathHe reported these experiments to one of the Buddhas followers a monk named Kumara Kassapa and two of the experiments were theseThere is the case Master Kassapa where my men  having caught a thief a wrongdoer  present him to me Here is a thief a wrongdoer for you lordDecree for him whatever punishment you wish And I say Very well then masters having placed this man while still alive in a clay jar having sealed the mouth having covered it with a damp skin having plastered it with a thick layer of damp clay having set it in a furnace light the fireThey  responding Very well to me  having placed the man while still alive in a clay jar having sealed the mouth having covered it with a damp skin having plastered it with a thick layer of damp clay having set it in a furnace light the fireWhen we know The man has died then  removing the jar breaking through the seal opening the mouth  we look carefully Maybe well see his soul escaping But we dont see his soul escapingThere is the case Master Kassapa where my men  having caught a thief a wrongdoer  present him to me Here is a thief a wrongdoer for you lordDecree for him whatever punishment you wish And I say Very well then masters having weighed this man with a scale while still alive having strangled him to death with a bowstring weigh him with the scale againThey  responding Very well to me  having weighed the man with a scale while still alive having strangled him to death with a bowstring weigh him with the scale againWhen he is alive he is lighter more flexible and more malleableBut when he has died he is heavier stiffer and less malleableThis is the reason Master Kassapa for which I believe There is no other world there are no spontaneously reborn beings there is no fruit or result of good or bad actionsDN gives a more comprehensive picture of annihilationist views current at the time classifying them by how they define the self annihilated at deathThere were seven types in allThree of them defined the self as a body either the physical body composed of the four material elements a divine physical body or an astral bodyThe view espoused by Ajita Kesakambalin and Prince Payasi would fall under the first of the threeFour other annihilationist views however defined the self as formless experiencing the dimension of infinite space of infinite consciousness of nothingness or of neither perception nor nonperceptionIn each of the seven cases these doctrines state that the self however defined perishes and is annihilated at deathAs for the nonBuddhist schools that affirmed the idea of rebirth the Pali Canon explicitly names at least four Brahmans Jains and two contemplative schools  one led by Makkhali Gosala and the other by Pakudha KaccayanaWe know from other sources that the Jains and some Brahmans affirmed that action played a role in shaping rebirth the Canon shows however that the other two teachers denied that action played any role in rebirth at all Though one might think Through this morality this practice this austerity or this holy life I will ripen unripened karma and eliminate ripened karma whenever touched by it  that is impossiblePleasure and pain are measured out the wanderingon is fixed in its limitsThere is no shortening or lengthening no accelerating or deceleratingJust as a ball of string when thrown comes to its end simply by unwinding in the same way having transmigrated and wandered on the wise and the foolish alike will put an end to pain There are these seven substances  unmade irreducible uncreated without a creator barren stable as a mountainpeak standing firm like a pillar  that do not alter do not change do not interfere with one another are incapable of causing one another pleasure pain or both pleasure and painWhich sevenThe earthsubstance the liquidsubstance the firesubstance the windsubstance pleasure pain and the soul as the seventhThese are the seven substances  unmade irreducible uncreated without a creator barren stable as a mountainpeak standing firm like a pillar  that do not alter do not change do not interfere with one another and are incapable of causing one another pleasure pain or both pleasure and painIn addition to these named exponents of rebirth DN provides an overview of the different types of views it attributes to eternalists and partial eternalists Eternalists like Pakudha Kaccayana maintained that the soul was not changed in the least as it went through the round of rebirthPartial eternalists held that some souls changed their position in the cosmos  and thus their experience of pleasure and pain as they went through different lives  whereas others never changed their position in the cosmos at allAlthough the Pali Canon doesnt discuss these rebirth theories in great detail we know from other contemporary sources that the Jains and Brahmans took great pains to define what sort of self or essence was reborn  and its likely that Makkhali Gosala and Pakudha Kaccayana did as well for their theories of rebirth require a soul or substance in a person that takes birth after deathThe most detailed discussions of what a soul might be are the Brahmanical Upanisads which advance many theories about what is reborn The self becomes consciousness and leaves the body the self is bodiless immortal breathenergy and is identical with Brahman the underlying force of the cosmos ones supreme self is an astral body that can be detected by the faculty of the mindThe Upanisads also record many different descriptions of the souls progress after death the most interesting being the account in ChU V which divides living beings into three classesThose in the most developed class gain union with Brahman after deathThose in the intermediate class go stage by stage to the moon on which they feedThen they return to earth as rain becoming plants and then being reborn as the sort of animal that eats the plants Those with good karma get to be eaten by human beings those with worse karma by lower sorts of animalsThe lowest class of beings  which includes tiny insects  suffers a fate that the Upanisad doesnt even describeSo its clear that when discussing rebirth both sides of the issue felt called upon to take a stand on two issuesThe first was the nature of what a person is and from there an explanation of how that person is or is not annihilated at deathIn other words both sides assumed that they had to explain their positions by taking a stand on the metaphysics of personal identityThe second issue  among those who accepted rebirth  was the relationship between human action and rebirth whether the course of rebirth was affected by human action or notGiven such a wide variety of views on both sides of these questions its obvious that the idea of rebirth was not an unexamined assumption in Indian cultureIt was one of the most controversial issues of the Buddhas timeAnd the controversy wasnt confined only to the philosophersIn one of his most famous discourses the Buddha addresses the Kalamas a skeptical group of villagers telling them that by avoiding unskillful actions and developing a mind free from ill will a person gains four assurances in the hereandnowIf there is a world after death if there is the fruit of actions rightly  wrongly done then this is the basis by which with the breakup of the body after death I will reappear in a good destination a heavenly world This is the first assurance one acquiresBut if there is no world after death if there is no fruit of actions rightly  wrongly done then here in the present life I look after myself with ease  free from hostility free from ill will free from trouble This is the second assurance one acquiresIf evil is done through acting still I have willed no evil for anyoneHaving done no evil action from where will suffering touch me This is the third assurance one acquiresBut if no evil is done through acting then I can assume myself pure in both respects This is the fourth assurance one acquiresIf the idea of rebirth  and its connection with karma  had been universally accepted in ancient India the Buddha wouldnt have had to offer these assurances to the Kalama villagersThis means that we cant write off the Buddhas teachings on karma and rebirth simply as an undigested remnant from his cultureIn teaching rebirth he was consciously addressing an issue that was hotly debated in a culture that expected him to articulate clearly his explanation for how and why rebirth did or didnt happenThere is still the question though of why the Buddha felt compelled to discuss the issue of karma and rebirthWe know that he refused to take a position on other issues that were hotly contested at the time  such as whether the cosmos was eternal or not  so what led him to take a position hereThe first part of the answer is that knowledge of rebirth formed an integral part of his awakening experience playing a role in all three knowledges that led to his attainment of total releaseKnowledge about karma played a role in the second and thirdIn the first knowledge he recollected many eons of his own previous livesWhen the mind was thus concentrated purified bright unblemished rid of defilement pliant malleable steady  attained to imperturbability I directed it to the knowledge of recollecting my past livesI recollected my manifold past lives ie one birth two five ten fifty a hundred a thousand a hundred thousand many eons of cosmic contraction many eons of cosmic expansion many eons of cosmic contraction  expansion There I had such a name belonged to such a clan had such an appearanceSuch was my food such my experience of pleasure  pain such the end of my lifePassing away from that state I reappeared thereThere too I had such a name belonged to such a clan had such an appearanceSuch was my food such my experience of pleasure  pain such the end of my lifePassing away from that state I reappeared here Thus I remembered my manifold past lives in their modes  detailsThis was the first knowledge I attained in the first watch of the nightIgnorance was destroyed knowledge arose darkness was destroyed light arose  as happens in one who is heedful ardent  resoluteIn the second watch of the night he gained his second knowledge vision of how living beings at large are reborn after deathWhen the mind was thus concentrated purified bright unblemished rid of defilement pliant malleable steady  attained to imperturbability I directed it to the knowledge of the passing away  reappearance of beingsI saw  by means of the divine eye purified  surpassing the human  beings passing away  reappearing and I discerned how they are inferior  superior beautiful  ugly fortunate  unfortunate in accordance with their karma These beings  who were endowed with bad conduct of body speech  mind who reviled the noble ones held wrong views and undertook actions under the influence of wrong views  with the breakup of the body after death have reappeared in a plane of deprivation a bad destination a lower realm hellBut these beings  who were endowed with good conduct of body speech  mind who did not revile the noble ones who held right views and undertook actions under the influence of right views  with the breakup of the body after death have reappeared in a good destination a heavenly world Thus  by means of the divine eye purified  surpassing the human  I saw beings passing away  reappearing and I discerned how they are inferior  superior beautiful  ugly fortunate  unfortunate in accordance with their karmaThis was the second knowledge I attained in the second watch of the nightIgnorance was destroyed knowledge arose darkness was destroyed light arose  as happens in one who is heedful ardent  resoluteIn the third knowledge of the night the Buddha took the insights gained from the second knowledge on the macro level of experience  concerning the role of actions and views in shaping events throughout the cosmos over time  and applied them to the micro level events immediately present in his own mindHe found that the same causal pattern operated on both levels  one of the most important insights leading to his awakeningHe investigated the micro level even further to discover which intentions and views might lead to an end of intentions and an end of views and so to an end of rebirthAnd he discovered his answer in views that were expressed in terms of the four noble truths about stressWhen the mind was thus concentrated purified bright unblemished rid of defilement pliant malleable steady  attained to imperturbability I directed it to the knowledge of the ending of the effluentsI discerned as it had come to be that This is stress This is the origination of stress This is the cessation of stress This is the way leading to the cessation of stress These are effluents This is the origination of effluents This is the cessation of effluents This is the way leading to the cessation of effluentsMy heart thus knowing thus seeing was released from the effluent of sensuality released from the effluent of becoming released from the effluent of ignoranceWith release there was the knowledge Released I discerned that Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task doneThere is nothing further for this worldThis was the third knowledge I attained in the third watch of the nightIgnorance was destroyed knowledge arose darkness was destroyed light arose  as happens in one who is heedful ardent  resoluteIn this way the ending of birth realized through the third knowledge affirmed the truth of the first two knowledgesBy employing the right view that leads to actions that put an end to birth the third knowledge showed that the act of intention is what fuels the process of repeated birth to begin withThis means that knowledge about rebirth and its connection with action was an integral part of the knowledge that precipitated and followed his full releaseStill the fact that his awakening included knowledge about rebirth doesnt fully explain why when he began teaching he addressed the topicAfter all on his own testimony there were many other things he learned in the course of his awakening that he didnt see fit to include in his teaching because they werent conducive in leading his listeners to their own releaseHe limited himself to teaching the four noble truths because they are connected with the goal relate to the rudiments of the holy life and lead to disenchantment to dispassion to cessation to calm to direct knowledge to selfawakening to UnbindingThis suggests that he saw an intimate connection between the topic of rebirth and the four noble truthsAnd it turns out that when we examine these truths we find that rebirth does play a prominent role in the understanding of stress that forms the first noble truth in the understanding of the causes of stress  craving and clinging  that form the second noble truth and in the transcendent right view that guides the path of practice to the end of stress the fourth noble truthIt also plays a prominent role in the mundane level of right view that provides the context for understanding the meaning and purpose of the four noble truthsThe relationship between the two levels of right view  mundane and transcendent  parallels the relationship between the first and second knowledges on the night of his awakening on the one hand and the third knowledge on the otherBoth serve a strategic purposeMundane right view framed in terms of beings and worlds asserts the efficacy of action the principle that actions really do have resultsThis principle opens the possibility that transcendent right view as a guide to action can put an end to sufferingTranscendent right view then drops terms of beings and worlds to focus directly on the actions within the mind that cause suffering so that those actions can be abandonedThis brings suffering to an end  at which point all views are put aside as wellTo assert the efficacy of action mundane right view makes the point that there is such a thing as action and that it actually engenders resultsBecause the four noble truths teach that suffering and stress are the results of actions and can be brought to an end through actions this understanding of action is necessary to explain why the four noble truths offer a realistic picture of what a human being can do to bring suffering to an endIn a direct negation of the annihilationist view that Ajita Kesakambalin expounded the standard definition of mundane right view statesThere is what is given what is offered what is sacrificedThere are fruits  results of good  bad actionsThere is this world  the next worldThere is mother  fatherThere are spontaneously reborn beings there are contemplatives  brahmans who faring rightly  practicing rightly proclaim this world  the next after having directly known  realized it for themselvesThe phrase next world in this passage refers to life after deathThe reference to what is given etc asserts that these actions actually are the results of conscious choices and do bear fruit as wellbeing and happinessThe reference to contemplatives and brahmans who know both worlds is a statement of conviction One may not know the next world on ones own but one is convinced that there are those who have trained their minds to the point where they know it directlyBecause contemplatives and brahmans  in the context of this passage  are those who have successfully followed the path to awakening and because anyone is potentially capable of doing the same this statement of conviction functions as a working hypothesisYou take these matters on faith until you can confirm them for yourselfOne reason the Buddha recommended conviction in rebirth as a useful working hypothesis is that as we have noted he had to teach that skillful human action was powerful and reliable enough to put an end to suffering and his teaching on the consequences of skillful and unskillful action would be incomplete  and therefore indefensible  without reference to rebirthThis is because the distinction he draws between skillful and unskillful is based on the consequences of the actions The workingout of karma may be complex but skillful actions always lead in the direction of happiness and wellbeing unskillful actions always lead in the direction of suffering and harmThis distinction provides not only the definition of these concepts but also the motivation for abandoning unskillful actions and developing skillful ones in their placeThis motivation is necessary for while people are not innately bad they are also not innately goodWhen heedless of the consequences of their actions they behave unskillfullyThis is why as the Buddha noted heedfulness lies at the root of all skillfulnessTo develop skillful qualities people need to see the dangers of unskillful behavior and the advantages of skillful behaviorBecause actions can sometimes take many lifetimes to yield their results a complete and convincing case that unskillful actions should always be avoided and skillful ones always developed requires the perspective that comes only from seeing the results of actions over many lifetimesOf course some of the results of actions often do appear in this lifetimeAs VenAnanda was sitting there the Blessed One said to him I say categorically Ananda that bodily misconduct verbal misconduct  mental misconduct should not be doneGiven that the Blessed One has declared that bodily misconduct verbal misconduct  mental misconduct should not be done what drawbacks can one expect when doing what should not be done One can fault oneself observant people on close examination criticize one ones bad reputation gets spread about one dies confused and  with the breakup of the body after death  one reappears in a plane of deprivation a bad destination a lower realm hellI say categorically Ananda that good bodily conduct good verbal conduct  good mental conduct should be doneGiven that the Blessed One has declared that good bodily conduct good verbal conduct  good mental conduct should be done what rewards can one expect when doing what should be done One doesnt fault oneself observant people on close examination praise one ones good reputation gets spread about one dies unconfused and  with the breakup of the body after death  one reappears in a good destination a heavenly worldFor people who have trouble assuming a life after death the consequences of action that are visible in this lifetime might seem enough to engender heedfulnessHowever the Buddha notes that misconduct often leads to rewards in the present life and he heaps ridicule on those who insist that the results of good and bad actions always appear in the hereandnowThere are headman some contemplatives  brahmans who hold a doctrine  view like this All those who kill living beings experience pain  distress in the herenowAll those who take what is not given who engage in illicit sex who tell lies experience pain  distress in the herenowNow there is the case where a certain person is seen garlanded  adorned freshly bathed  groomed with hair  beard trimmed enjoying the sensualities of women as if he were a kingThey ask about him My good man what has this man done that he has been garlanded  adorned as if he were a king They answer My good man this man attacked the kings enemy and took his lifeThe king gratified with him rewarded himThat is why he is garlanded  adorned as if he were a kingThen there is the case where a certain person is seen bound with a stout rope with his arms pinned tightly against his back his head shaved bald marched to a harshsounding drum from street to street crossroads to crossroads evicted through the south gate and beheaded to the south of the cityThey ask about him My good man what has this man done that he is bound with a stout rope and beheaded to the south of the city They answer My good man this man an enemy of the king has taken the life of a man or a womanThat is why the rulers having had him seized inflicted such a punishment upon himNow what do you think headman Have you ever seen or heard of such a caseI have seen this lord have heard of it and will hear of itSo headman when those contemplatives  brahmans who hold a doctrine  view like this say All those who kill living beings experience pain  distress in the herenow do they speak truthfully or falselyFalsely lordAnd those who babble empty falsehood Are they moral or immoralImmoral lordAnd those who are immoral and of evil character Are they practicing wrongly or rightlyWrongly lordAnd those who are practicing wrongly Do they hold wrong view or right viewWrong view lordAnd is it proper to place confidence in those who hold wrong viewNo lordTo avoid wrong view  and the ridicule it deserves  the Buddha found it necessary to disclose his knowledge that there are lives after deathAnd he had to include the perspective not just of one lifetime after death but of manyThis is because there are cases where a person behaves unskillfully in this lifetime but gains a pleasant rebirth immediately after death and others where a person behaves skillfully in this lifetime but immediately after death gains a painful rebirthA meditator capable of seeing only one lifetime after death seeing cases like these would misunderstand the consequences of actionOnly when we take into account the overall picture of the complexity of karma  and the length of time sometimes needed for actions to bear fruit  can we accept that the Buddhas categorical assertions about skillful and unskillful actions might possibly be accurateSo from the perspective of his awakening the Buddha saw that the only true understanding of the consequences of actions had to include a full perspective of lives after deathThis is why he used this perspective when trying to induce a sense of heedfulness in others so that they would be motivated to adopt the skillful pathIn some cases this involved describing how skillful and unskillful actions bring comforts and discomforts in future human livesIn other cases it involved describing the pleasures of heaven and the horrors of hellSometimes he would add the observation that rebirth in the lower realms is much more common than rebirth in the higher realmsIn all cases he would state that his descriptions and observations came not from hearsay but his own direct experienceHe knew however that  until they had gained experience for themselves through the practice  his listeners could take his statements on the efficacy of action and the truth of rebirth only on faithBut faith for him was not an insistence that you knew what you couldnt really know or that you accepted unreasonable ideasIt was an admission of ignorance about issues for which you dont have empirical proof combined with a willingness to adopt the assumptions needed to follow a path to happiness that seems reasonably likely to offer resultsThis is why the Buddha never claimed to offer proof for either the efficacy of action or for rebirth for he knew that the evidence for these teachings lay beyond the ken of most of his listenersConcerning the efficacy of action the best he could do was to point out that those who denied that present action had a role in shaping present experience  because they attributed all experience to past action to the act of a creator god or to total randomness  were undercutting any rationale they might claim for teaching others or for following a path of practiceIn other words if present experience is not at least partly due to present actions there is no way that a path of practice could have any effectTeaching a path of practice would be a futile activityThe Buddhas argument here was no proof that skillful and unskillful actions actually have consequences both in the present and on into the futureIt simply pointed out the contradiction in teaching otherwiseOn the other hand when you assume both the efficacy of action and its effect on rebirth you are more likely to behave skillfullyTo assume otherwise makes it easy to find excuses for lying killing or stealing when faced with poverty or deathAnd from there its easy to extend the excuses to cover times when its simply more convenient to lie etc than to notBut if you assume that your actions have results and those results will reverberate through many lifetimes its easier to stick to your principles not to lie kill or steal even under severe duressAnd even though you may not know whether these assumptions are true you cannot plan an action without implicitly wagering on the issueThis is why simply stating I dont know is not an adequate response to the questions of rebirth and the efficacy of karmaThe attitude behind it may be honest on one level but its dishonest in thinking that this is all that needs to be said for it ignores the fact that you have to make assumptions about the possible results of your actions every time you actIts like having money Regardless of what you do with it  spending it investing it or just stashing it away  youre making an implicit wager on how to get the best use of it now and into the futureYour investment strategy cant stop with I dont know If you have any wisdom at all you have to consider future possibilities and take your chances with what seems to be the safest and most productive use of the resources youve gotSo it is with all of our actionsGiven that we have to wager one way or another all the time on how to find happiness the Buddha stated that its a safer wager to assume that actions bear results that can affect not only this lifetime but also lifetimes after this than it is to assume the oppositeIn MN for instance he pointed out that anyone who adheres to the annihilationist view espoused by Ajita Kesakambalin would not be expected to avoid unskillful behavior whereas those who hold to the opposite  mundane right view  would be expected to avoid unskillful behaviorThen he said of the first groupWith regard to this an observant person considers thus If there is no next world then  with the breakup of the body after death  this venerable person has made himself safeBut if there is the next world then this venerable person  with the breakup of the body after death  will reappear in a plane of deprivation a bad destination a lower realm hellEven if we didnt speak of the next world and there werent the true statement of those venerable contemplatives  brahmans this venerable person is still criticized in the herenow by the observant as a person of bad habits  wrong view one who holds to a doctrine of nonexistence If there really is a next world then this venerable person has made a bad throw twice in that he is criticized by the observant herenow and in that  with the breakup of the body after death  he will reappear in a plane of deprivation a bad destination a lower realm hellThus this safebet teaching when poorly grasped  poorly adopted by him covers one side and leaves behind the possibility of the skillfulAs for the second group  those who hold to mundane right view and act on it  he said thisWith regard to this an observant person considers thus If there is the next world then this venerable person  with the breakup of the body after death  will reappear in a good destination a heavenly worldEven if we didnt speak of the next world and there werent the true statement of those venerable contemplatives  brahmans this venerable person is still praised in the herenow by the observant as a person of good habits  right view one who holds to a doctrine of existence If there really is a next world then this venerable person has made a good throw twice in that he is praised by the observant herenow and in that  with the breakup of the body after death  he will reappear in a good destination a heavenly worldThus this safebet teaching when well grasped  well adopted by him covers both sides and leaves behind the possibility of the unskillfulThese arguments dont prove the efficacy of action or the truth of rebirth but they do show that it is a safer more reasonable and more honorable policy to assume the truth of these teachings than it would be to assume otherwiseThe Buddha didnt press these arguments beyond that pointIn other words he left it to his listeners to decide whether they wanted to recognize that action is an investment that like all investments incurs risksAnd he left it to them to decide how they wanted to calculate the risks and potentials that action might involve now and into the futureHe didnt ask that his listeners all commit themselves to an unquestioning belief in the possibility that their actions might lead to rebirth but he wasnt interested in teaching anyone who rejected that possibility outrightAs weve already noted he saw that heedfulness lay at the root of all skillful qualitiesIf a listener couldnt be persuaded to develop an appropriate level of heedfulness around the risks of action any further teaching would be a waste of timeTo move his listeners from mundane right view to transcendent right view the Buddha used the teaching on rebirth to inspire not only a sense of heedfulness in his listeners but also a sense of samvega dismay and terror at the prospect of not gaining release from rebirthLong have you experienced the death of a motherThe tears you have shed over the death of a mother while transmigrating  wandering this long long time  crying  weeping from being joined with what is displeasing being separated from what is pleasing  are greater than the water in the four great oceansLong have you experienced the death of a father the death of a brother the death of a sister the death of a son the death of a daughter loss with regard to relatives loss with regard to wealth loss with regard to diseaseThe tears you have shed over loss with regard to disease while transmigrating  wandering this long long time  crying  weeping from being joined with what is displeasing being separated from what is pleasing  are greater than the water in the four great oceansWhy is thatFrom an inconceivable beginning comes transmigrationA beginning point is not evident though beings hindered by ignorance and fettered by craving are transmigrating  wandering onLong have you thus experienced stress experienced pain experienced loss swelling the cemeteries  enough to become disenchanted with all fabricated things enough to become dispassionate enough to be releasedThe relationship between heedfulness and samvega parallels the relationship between the second knowledge of the night of the Buddhas awakening and the thirdSeeing the way in which rebirth depends on ones views and actions he saw the need for heedfulness in ones thoughts words and deedsSeeing the precarious complexity and pointlessness of the whole process of repeated death and rebirth he developed the sense of samvega that inspired him to look for a way outThe way he chose  and that gave results  was to take the lessons about rebirth obtained in his first two knowledges and to apply them to the actions of the mind in the present moment and to their effects both in the present and over timeIn doing so he arrived at the four noble truths as the form of right view that would lead to total release and the end of rebirthThe connection between rebirth and the first noble truth is reflected in the fact that this truth lists birth as one of the forms of suffering that the fourth noble truth brings to an endIn fact birth stands at the beginning of the listNow this monks is the noble truth of stress Birth is stressful aging is stressful death is stressful sorrow lamentation pain distress  despair are stressful association with the unbeloved is stressful separation from the loved is stressful not getting what is wanted is stressfulIn short the five clingingaggregates are stressfulThe connection between rebirth and the second noble truth is reflected in the fact that this truth defines the cause of suffering as any form of craving or clinging that leads to further becoming which is the condition for further birthAnd this monks is the noble truth of the origination of stress the craving that makes for further becoming  accompanied by passion  delight relishing now here  now there  ie craving for sensuality craving for becoming craving for nonbecomingWriters who reject the idea that the Buddha is talking about the rebirth of a person in these two noble truths tend to argue in one of two ways Either that the references to birth dont imply rebirth or that they refer to rebirth on the micro level of momentary mindstates and not on the macro level of beings or persons over timeNeither interpretation however does full justice to what the Buddha had to sayWriters in the first group have made much of the fact that the Buddha used the word birth rather than rebirth in the first noble truth concluding that rebirth is not necessarily meant hereThis conclusion though ignores the relationship of the first truth to the othersAll the forms of suffering listed in the first truth are caused by the second truth and brought to an end by the fourthIf birth were a oneshot affair there would be  for a person already born  no point in looking for the causes of the suffering of birth and no way that the fourth truth could put an end to themThis point is especially clear when we look at the Buddhas own account of how he explored the causes of suffering after having seen in his first two knowledges the sufferings caused by repeated birthHe looked into the possible causes of birth and traced them deep into the mindMonks before my awakening when I was still just an unawakened bodhisatta the realization came to me How this world has fallen on difficultyIt is born it ages it dies it falls away  rearises but it does not discern the escape from this stress from this aging  deathO when will it discern the escape from this stress from this aging  deathThen the thought occurred to me Aging  death exist when what existsFrom what as a requisite condition come aging  death From my appropriate attention there came the breakthrough of discernment Aging  death exist when birth existsFrom birth as a requisite condition comes aging  deathThen the thought occurred to me Birth exists when what existsFrom what as a requisite condition comes birth From my appropriate attention there came the breakthrough of discernment Birth exists when becoming existsFrom becoming as a requisite condition comes birthBecoming exists when what existsClingingsustenance exists when what existsCraving exists when what existsFeeling exists when what existsContact exists when what existsThe six sense media exist when what existsNameform exists when what existsFrom what as a requisite condition is there nameform From my appropriate attention there came the breakthrough of discernment Nameform exists when consciousness existsFrom consciousness as a requisite condition comes nameform Then the thought occurred to me Consciousness exists when what existsFrom what as a requisite condition comes consciousness From my appropriate attention there came the breakthrough of discernment Consciousness exists when nameform existsFrom nameform as a requisite condition comes consciousnessThen the thought occurred to me This consciousness turns back at nameform and goes no fartherIt is to this extent that there is birth aging death falling away  reappearing ie from nameform as a requisite condition comes consciousness from consciousness as a requisite condition comes nameformFrom nameform as a requisite condition come the six sense media Thus is the origination of this entire mass of stressOrigination origination Vision arose clear knowing arose discernment arose knowledge arose illumination arose within me with regard to things never heard beforeHad the Buddha assumed that birth were a onetime affair he wouldnt have explored its causes through becoming clinging and on down to nameformHe would have stopped his analysis of the causes of suffering at the realization Aging  death exist when birth existsFrom birth as a requisite condition comes aging  death He thus would have limited his analysis of the origination of suffering to what happens after birthOnly because he saw that birth was a repeated process did he probe into the causes of birth and trace them through the factors that he later taught in his description of dependent coarisingIn other words if the Buddha hadnt assumed rebirth he never would have discovered or taught the central tenets of his teaching the four noble truths and dependent coarisingHis analysis of suffering and its causes would have been much more limited in scopeAnd as we will see the Buddha discovered that the processes leading to suffering are selfsustaining meaning that unless they are deliberately starved they will continue repeating indefinitelyIn this way not only birth but also every factor in dependent coarising is prefixed with an implicit re from reignorance to redeathAs for the argument that the birth mentioned in the first noble truth could be a repeated process but only on the micro scale of the momentary arising of mental states The fact that the Buddha discovered the four noble truths and the factors of dependent coarising by examining mental events in the present moment would seem to lend credence to this interpretationBut it ignores two important pointsThe first is that when the Buddha himself explained birth aging and death in the context of these teachings he did so with reference to birth on the macro scale  ie the birth aging and death of a personNow which aging and deathWhatever aging decrepitude brokenness graying wrinkling decline of lifeforce weakening of the faculties of the various beings in this or that group of beings that is called agingWhatever deceasing passing away breaking up disappearance dying death completion of time breakup of the aggregates casting off of the body interruption in the life faculty of the various beings in this or that group of beings that is called deathAnd which birthWhatever birth taking birth descent comingtobe comingforth appearance of aggregates  acquisition of media of the various beings in this or that group of beings that is called birthThe second point is that to insist on limiting the four noble truths and the factors of dependent coarising to one scale or the other is to miss a crucial feature of these teachingsRemember that the Buddhas third knowledge came from applying to the micro level lessons learned on the macro level in the first two knowledgesThe lesson he learned as a result is that the level of scale is a relative affair The process is the constantTo compare this to modern physics it was like Einsteins proposal that the dimensions of space and time are not constants the constant is the speed of lightThe fact that the Buddha gained release by discovering a process that held constant across many levels of scale was reflected in the way he taught often switching scales in the course of his discussions and refusing to be pinned down to one scale or anotherSometimes he talked about beings in the standard sense of the word and sometimes as attachments ie as processes on the mental levelAnd in particular with dependent coarising The teaching is always presented as a process without a fixed reference to where  on the level of scale in the world or in the individual  the factors of the process are playing outIn this way its like a photograph of erosion patternsWithout an extraneous object such as a tree or an insect to indicate scale its difficult to know whether the range of the photograph covers two miles or two inches whether the erosion runs through a vast plateau or a small patch of sand by the side of a road and whether the eroded bits in the photograph are boulders or grains of sandEither way the photograph can be studied to understand the complex causal patterns underlying erosion and  more to the point  we can learn more about the processes of erosion by studying it on multiple levels than by limiting ourselves to just oneIn the same way its a mistake to limit the Buddhas teachings on birthrebirth to just one level of scaleTo limit them just to the micro level is to underestimate the potential for mental events in the present to create longterm suffering and the radical nature of the cure needed to put an end to that sufferingTo limit his teachings just to the macro level makes it impossible to observe directly in the present how birth and its attendant sufferings come about and can be brought to an endTo get the most out of these teachings its best to drop any insistence in line with ones metaphysical assumptions that they apply to one level and not anotherInstead its better to look at the processes as processes  true across many scales  and use this way of framing the issue as part of the strategy to put an end to sufferingAs part of his policy of not getting pinned down on issues of scale when presenting the process of rebirth the Buddha was careful to avoid an issue that animated his contemporaries when they discussed rebirth the metaphysics of what a person is and what does or doesnt get reborn after deathIn other words he refused to explain whether any what underlay the experience of rebirthHe simply talked about how the experience happened and what could be done to end itIn modern philosophy this approach is called phenomenology talking about the phenomena of experience simply in terms of direct experience without making reference to any underlying reality that may or may not stand behind that experienceThe Buddha was a radical phenomenologist in that he dealt with experience on its own termsHe was a pragmatist in that he adopted this approach because he saw that it worked in bringing suffering to an endThe Canon reports that the members of the other schools  and even some of his own monks  often expressed frustration over this aspect of the Buddhas approachIn their eyes the whole question of rebirth revolved around the what that did or didnt get rebornEither the life force was identical with the body thus allowing no way for rebirth to occur after the body dies or else there was a soul or life force separate from the body which either died along with the body or else survived deathYet when the Buddhas contemporaries pressed him to take sides on this question and related questions he consistently put them asideThe Blessed One said From ignorance as a requisite condition come fabrications From becoming as a requisite condition comes birthWhen this was said a certain monk said to the Blessed One Which is the birth lord and whose is the birthNot a valid question the Blessed One saidIf one were to ask Which is the birth and whose is the birth and if one were to say Birth is one thing and the birth is that of somethingsomeone else both of them would have the same meaning even though their words would differWhen there is the view that the soul is the same as the body there is no leading the holy lifeAnd when there is the view that the soul is one thing and the body another there is no leading the holy lifeAvoiding these two extremes the Tathagata teaches the Dhamma via the middle From becoming as a requisite condition comes birthMonks there are these four nutriments for the maintenance of beings who have come into being or for the support of those in search of a place to be bornWhich fourPhysical food gross or refined contact as the second intellectual intention the third and consciousness the fourthThese are the four nutriments for the maintenance of beings who have come into being or for the support of those in search of a place to be bornWhen this was said VenMoliya Phagguna said to the Blessed One Lord who feeds on the consciousnessnutrimentNot a valid question the Blessed One saidI dont say feeds If I were to say feeds then Who feeds on the consciousnessnutriment would be a valid questionBut I dont say thatWhen I dont say that the valid question is Consciousnessnutriment for what And the valid answer is Consciousnessnutriment for the production of future comingintobeingWhen that has come into being and exists then the six sense mediaFrom the six sense media as a requisite condition comes contactThe tendency to read a thing or no thing behind the processes of dependent coarising is still alive with us todayMany people have assumed that the Buddha taught that there is no self  which means that there would be no thing behind the process of dependent coarising and nothing to be rebornMany others have assumed that he taught a True Self underlying our false sense of an individual self and therefore underlying the processBoth assumptions however are misinformedThe Buddha actually refused to state whether a self of any kind does or doesnt existThe one recorded time he was asked pointblank whether the self exists he declined to answerThis was because he saw that questions of this sort interfere with the path of practice leading to the end of sufferingAs he said in MN to focus on such questions as  Am IAm I notWhat am IWhat was I in the pastWhat will I be in the future  is a form of inappropriate attention the kind of attention that ignores the four noble truths and actually leads to further sufferingSo if a worldview demands an explanation of the what behind rebirth  as we find not only in the worldviews of ancient India but also in many modern worldviews as well  its simply a form of inappropriate attention that perpetuates sufferingIf you want to put an end to suffering you have to put the metaphysical demands of your worldview asideThe Buddha found it more appropriate and fruitful to focus instead on the process of how birth is repeatedly generated by factors immediately present to awareness throughout life and directly experienced by factors in the present momentThis is because these factors lie enough under your control to turn them toward the ending of repeated rebirthAn understanding of the process as process  and in particular as an example of the process of dependent coarising  can actually contribute to the end of sufferingIt gives guidance in how to apply the tasks appropriate for the four noble truths to the process of birth ie comprehending suffering abandoning its cause realizing its cessation and developing the path to its cessationWhen these duties have been completely mastered they can bring birth to an end by abandoning its causes thus opening the way to the ultimate happiness that comes when the mind is no longer entangled in the process of birthThe Buddha used several models for explaining the process of dependent coarising with each model listing a sequence of interdependent factorsIn the most standard model the factors are thesefabricationsconsciousnessnameformthe six sense mediabecoming and followed by the suffering of aging illness and deathThis list has many complications with certain factors appearing at several points in the sequenceFor example the factor of ignorance is identical with the subfactor of inappropriate attention under nameformThe list also contains many feedback loops sequences where an effect returns to influence the next instance of its causeAs we will see the existence of feedback loops in the process is what makes it selfsustaining and gives it the potential to continue indefinitelyFor the moment however we can focus on one of dependent coarisings most obvious features its lack of outside contextIt avoids any reference to the presence or absence of a self or a world around the processes it describesInstead it forms the context for understanding selves and worlds In other words it shows how ideas of such metaphysical contexts are created and clung to and what happens as a resultIn particular it shows in detail how the acts of creating and clinging to metaphysical assumptions about the existence or nonexistence of the self or the world actually lead to birth and sufferingThis means that dependent coarising instead of existing in a metaphysical context provides the phenomenological context for showing why metaphysical contexts are best put asideThe important factors leading from metaphysical assumptions to rebirth are name contact clinging and becomingUnder name is the subfactor of attention which MN  as we have seen  depicts as the act of choosing which questions to askWhen attention is inappropriately directed to questions of the metaphysics of identity  about what you are or whether you exist  it entangles you in a thicket of views a writhing of views that keep you trapped in suffering and stressAs for views of what the world is and where it came from the Buddha shows that these all derive from contact at the six sensesThese views about self and world then become objects of clinging which in turn gives rise to becoming the act of taking on an identity within a particular world of experience defined around the craving underlying that clingingBecoming in turn is the condition for repeated birthThe antidote to this process is to direct attention appropriately to identifying the four noble truths as theyre experiencedThis form of attention enables you to see the act of viewformation as a process to see the drawbacks of the process and so to abandon any clinging to the content of those viewsThis removes the conditions for further becoming and birthEven though the four noble truths count as a type of view their ability to see all views  even themselves  as part of this process means that they contain the seeds for their own transcendenceSo if you want to get the most use out of dependent coarising then rather than viewing dependent coarising as occurring within the context of self and world youd do better to view ideas of self and world as occurring within the context of dependent coarisingThe advantage of adopting this approach is that it focuses attention away from things for which you arent responsible  metaphysical entities that may or may not underlie experience  and points instead to events for which you are acts of attention and the various forms of intention under fabrications and name This is why even though the Buddha didnt take a stand on the issues of the metaphysics of rebirth he devoted a lot of time to explaining the connection between rebirth and actionAction is what leads to rebirth but action  skillful action  can also bring it to an endWhen you adopt this perspective you focus directly on actions as they are experienced as factors parts of a causal sequenceAnd this in turn makes it easier to apply the duties of the four noble truths with greater precisionIn other words it helps you notice which factors  such as ignorance  cause suffering and so should be abandoned by replacing them with right view which ones  such as attention and intention under name  can be converted to the path to the end of suffering and so should be developed before they too are abandoned and which ones  such as clinging becoming and birth  constitute suffering and so should be comprehended to the point of disenchantment and dispassion leading to the realization of the end of suffering releaseWhat does it mean to comprehend birth as an instance of sufferingAnd what is accomplished by viewing it in that wayThe Buddha often compared all suffering to the acts of clinging and feeding acts inherently stressful not only for those clung to and fed upon but also for those who through the disease of hunger keep needing to cling and feedIn fact for the Buddha feeding and clinging are virtually one and the sameThe Pali word for clinging  upadana  also means fuel or sustenance and the act of taking sustenance from fuelIn his explanation of how a fire burns for instance the fire feeds itself by clinging to its fuel  an image he also used to illustrate how rebirth happens through the process of clinging to cravingBut Master Gotama at the moment a flame is being swept on by the wind and goes a far distance what do you designate as its clingingsustenance thenVaccha when a flame is being swept on by the wind and goes a far distance I designate it as windsustained for the wind is its clingingsustenance at that timeAnd at the moment when a being sets this body aside and is not yet born in another body what do you designate as its clingingsustenance thenVaccha when a being sets this body aside and is not yet born in another body I designate it as cravingsustained for craving is its clingingsustenance at that timeBy introducing a being into this passage the Buddha might be suspected of introducing a what into his discussion of birthAnd this is not the only place where he talks about a beingtobeborn in this contextMonks the descent of the embryo occurs with the union of three thingsThere is the case where there is no union of the mother  father the mother is not in her season and a gandhabba is not present nor is there a descent of an embryoThere is the case where there is a union of the mother  father and the mother is in her season but a gandhabba is not present nor is there a descent of an embryoBut when there is a union of the mother  father the mother is in her season and a gandhabba is present then with this union of three things the descent of the embryo occursHowever on the level of dependent coarising the Buddha did not treat the concept of a being as a what His definition of a being shows that he recommended that it too be regarded as a processAs he was sitting there VenRadha said to the Blessed One A being lordA being its saidTo what extent is one said to be a beingAny desire passion delight or craving for form Radha When one is caught up there tied up there one is said to be a beingAny desire passion delight or craving for feeling perception fabricationsAny desire passion delight or craving for consciousness Radha When one is caught up there tied up there one is said to be a beingSo the Buddha advocated viewing a being simply as a process of attachment to desire passion delight and cravingA being in this sense can take birth die and be reborn many times in the course of a day  as attachment develops for one desire ends and then develops for another one  to say nothing of how often it occurs during the lifetime of a physical bodyThis is why the processes leading to rebirth can be observed and redirected in the present moment for  as we have already noted  the mental processes that move from moment to moment on the micro level are identical with the mental processes that move from body to body on the macro levelOnce born on either the micro or the macro level the beingprocess is maintained by the four nutriments of consciousness physical food sensory contact sensory consciousness and the intentions of the mindWhere there is passion delight  craving for the nutriment of physical food consciousness lands there and increasesWhere consciousness lands and increases there is the alighting of nameformWhere there is the alighting of nameform there is the growth of fabricationsWhere there is the growth of fabrications there is the production of renewed becoming in the futureWhere there is the production of renewed becoming in the future there is future birth aging  death together I tell you with sorrow affliction  despairThere is a complex relationship between craving and nutriment in sustaining this processOn the one hand as the above passage shows craving has to be actively present before consciousness will land on any of the forms of nutrimentOn the other hand had there been no past craving none of these forms of nutriment would even existThese four nutriments have craving as their cause craving as their origination are born from craving are brought into being from cravingThis means that craving produces the food that it then feeds on  a fact that allows for the processes leading to birth to lead to repeated rebirthThe role of craving here is closely connected with that of consciousness which  like craving  produces the food on which it feedsBecause these processes are selfsustaining any attempt to map them has to be complexOne of the primary complaints about dependent coarising is that it is overwhelmingly complicatedThis however is like complaining about the complexity of a city map that shows all the streetsYou put up with the complexity so that you can find precisely the street you wantIn the same way once you accept the fact that the processes leading to suffering are complex you appreciate the usefulness of the maps provided by dependent coarising They point out precisely where in the processes you can make a difference so that causal patterns can be directed away from suffering and toward its endWe can see this clearly in the way the two prime models of dependent coarising depict the selfsustaining pattern by which consciousness produces the food on which consciousness can then continue to feedThis pattern is most obvious in the model that traces the causes of birth back to a mutual causality between consciousness on the one hand and nameform  the mental and physical dimensions of experience  on the otherFrom consciousness as a requisite condition comes nameform Thus it has been saidAnd this is the way to understand how from consciousness as a requisite condition comes nameformIf consciousness were not to descend into the mothers womb would nameform take shape in the wombNo lordIf after descending into the womb consciousness were to depart would nameform be produced for this worldNo lordIf the consciousness of the young boy or girl were to be cut off would nameform ripen grow and reach maturityNo lordThus this is a cause this is a reason this is an origination this is a requisite condition for nameform ie consciousnessIn playing a part in the process of birth and growth consciousness also depends on the phenomena it sustainsIf consciousness were not to gain a foothold in nameform would a comingintoplay of the origination of birth aging death and stress in the future be discernedNo lordThus this is a cause this is a reason this is an origination this is a requisite condition for consciousness ie nameformIn this way consciousness directly feeds the factors that it in turn feeds uponSo this model for mapping dependent coarising focuses on one place to break the sequence the mutual dependence between consciousness and nameformIts as if two sheaves of reeds were to stand leaning against one anotherIn the same way from nameform as a requisite condition comes consciousness from consciousness as a requisite condition comes nameformIf one were to pull away one of those sheaves of reeds the other would fall if one were to pull away the other the first one would fallIn the same way from the cessation of nameform comes the cessation of consciousness from the cessation of consciousness comes the cessation of nameformThe more standard model for dependent coarising gives a more precise picture of what it means to pull away consciousness and nameformThis model  whose factors we listed in the preceding chapter  traces the causes of suffering back to ignorance and in so doing provides a more complex picture of the way in which consciousness produces its own foodAt first glance the pattern of a selfsustaining consciousnessprocess is less obvious in this model because consciousness appears as a factor only onceHowever it functions as a subfactor at two other points in the process where it feeds off the factors it sustainsBecause the picture here is more complex its more explicit in showing where to focus your attempts to deprive the process of foodConsciousness first appears in the process as the factor of consciousness itselfThis factor follows on ignorance and fabrication and acts as the condition for nameformThe fact that consciousness occurs immediately after fabrication emphasizes that it is driven by intentionAs SNnotes the element of intention is what turns the potential for sensory consciousness into an actual experience of sensory consciousnessFor the sake of consciousnesshood fabrications fabricate consciousness as a fabricated thingThus every act of sensory consciousness is purposefulAs long as ignorance drives fabrication there is no such thing as a totally passive or pure state of consciousnessEvery act of consciousness is colored by the intentional element that shapes itThe fact that the factor of consciousness appears before nameform emphasizes the fact that consciousness has to be present for all the remaining factors  including intention under name  to occurAnd because both consciousness and nameform depend on fabrication which in turn depends on ignorance of the stressful nature of fabrication this model shows that one way to deprive the consciousnessprocess of food is to develop right view about the intentional element of fabrication underlying that processThe second point where consciousness appears in the process of dependent coarising is as a component of the factor of contact at the six sensesIts role here carries over from its dependence on fabrication emphasizing the fact that sensory contact is never purely passiveEven the barest contact already contains an element of intentional fabrication that colors it with ignoranceIts in dependence on a pair that consciousness comes into playAnd how does consciousness come into play in dependence on a pairIn dependence on the eye  forms there arises eyeconsciousnessThe eye is inconstant changeable of a nature to become otherwiseForms are inconstant changeable of a nature to become otherwiseThus this pair is both wavering  fluctuating  inconstant changeable of a nature to become otherwiseEyeconsciousness is inconstant changeable of a nature to become otherwiseWhatever is the cause the requisite condition for the arising of eyeconsciousness that is inconstant changeable of a nature to become otherwiseHaving arisen in dependence on an inconstant factor how could eyeconsciousness be constantThe coming together the meeting the convergence of these three phenomena is eyecontactWhat this shows is that to starve the consciousnessprocess of food you have to focus less on how you react to sensory contact and more on what you bring to sensory contact  the habits of ignorant fabrication that shape what you senseAt the third point in the series consciousness together with its nutriment plays the role of feeding and clinging building on craving and leading to becoming  a sense of ones identity in a particular world of experience  which is the prerequisite for birthIn this case the Buddha said consciousness plays the role of a seed that  when watered by craving and delight  blooms into becoming on the level of sensuality form or formlessnessKarma is the field consciousness the seed and craving the moistureThe consciousness of living beings hindered by ignorance  fettered by craving is established in a lower property a middling property a refined propertyThus there is the production of renewed becoming in the futureThis is how there is becomingLike the earth property monks is how the four standingpoints for consciousness should be seenLike the liquid property is how delight  passion should be seenLike the five types of plant propagation is how consciousness together with its nutriment should be seenTo view consciousness and its nutriment here as a seed watered by craving delight and passion helps focus attention on the role played by these three latter mindstates in producing food for endlessly repeated suffering and birthThese are the mindstates that sustain the consciousnessprocess as it moves from one standingpoint to anotherPerhaps the Buddha switched from the feeding analogy to the seed analogy here because the implications of the food analogy at this point would have been too harsh to state explicitly in polite company We keep feeding off the byproducts of our earlier feedingThe seed analogy however makes this point more indirectlyJust as seeds when watered grow into plants that both produce seeds and when they die add fertilizer to the soil that feeds those seeds in the same way consciousness nourished with karma and craving keeps producing more standingpoints  the aggregates of form feeling perception fabrication and consciousness  for future acts of consciousness to feed onShould consciousness when standing stand attached to form supported by form landing on form watered with delight it would exhibit growth increase  proliferationShould consciousness when standing stand attached to feeling supported by feeling landing on feeling watered with delight it would exhibit growth increase  proliferationShould consciousness when standing stand attached to perception supported by perception landing on perception watered with delight it would exhibit growth increase  proliferationShould consciousness when standing stand attached to fabrications supported by fabrications landing on fabrications watered with delight it would exhibit growth increase  proliferationWere someone to say I will describe a coming a going a passing away an arising a growth an increase or a proliferation of consciousness apart from form from feeling from perception from fabrications that would be impossibleIn other words as long as delight and passion  this phrase is a synonym for clinging  nourishes the consciousnessprocess consciousness in turn keeps creating the food to keep the process going indefinitely even after the form of this body is cast asideThis is why repeated birthasprocess will not end until its deprived of the water of craving and clingingAnd the only way to deprive the process of its water and food is to develop dispassion for activities that sustain itThis is where this model for dependent coarising shows it pragmatic valueIt demonstrates not only that the food and water for rebirth can be directly experienced but also that these processes are the direct consequence of choices made in the mind the intentional activity of fabrication based on ignoranceIn this way it points to the possibility that the suffering of repeated rebirth can be ended by choice choosing to develop appropriate attention  right view concerning the four noble truths  which puts an end to craving and ignoranceThat way instead of getting entangled in trying to destroy the conditions of birth  which would lead to taking on a destroyeridentity which would merely continue the process of becoming  you choose simply to starve the process of its sustenance allowing it to end on its ownThat choice is where the path the fourth noble truth beginsGiven that passion is something we habitually enjoy its not easy to choose a path leading toward total dispassionYou have to be strongly motivated to take it up and to stick with itAt the same time you have to hold yourself to high standards all along the way for its all too easy to fall for subtle levels of passion that can pull you back into the processes leading to renewed suffering and rebirthThis is one of the reasons why right view comes at the beginning of the path  to provide motivation for and guidance to all the other path factors right resolve right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness and right concentrationAs a part of right view conviction in rebirth  and of the influence of action in leading to rebirth  plays an important role in performing both of these functions motivating the initial choice to follow the path and guiding choices made along the wayWe have already noted in chapter four how the Buddha used belief in rebirth to inspire a general desire to escape the rounds of suffering here the specifics of right view about rebirth help focus that desire specifically on the pathSome people claim that belief in rebirth breeds complacency  you have many lifetimes to follow the path so you can take your time  but the Buddhas descriptions of the dangers of rebirth present a very different picture You could die at any moment and there are plenty of miserable places  realms where it would be impossible to practice  where you could easily be rebornAnd even if you do manage to reach a good level of rebirth the next time around the chances of a good rebirth after that are very slimSo you have to get started on mastering the path while you canThen the Blessed One picking up a little bit of dust with the tip of his fingernail said to the monks What do you think monksWhich is greater the little bit of dust I have picked up with the tip of my fingernail or the great earthThe great earth is far greater lordThe little bit of dust the Blessed One has picked up with the tip of his fingernail is next to nothingIt doesnt even countIts no comparisonIts not even a fraction this little bit of dust the Blessed One has picked up with the tip of his fingernail when compared with the great earthIn the same way monks few are the beings who on passing away from the human realm are reborn among human beingsFar more are the beings who on passing away from the human realm are reborn in hell in the animal womb in the domain of the hungry ghosts In the same way monks few are the beings who on passing away from the human realm are reborn among devasFar more are the beings who on passing away from the human realm are reborn in hell in the animal womb in the domain of the hungry ghosts In the same way monks few are the beings who on passing away from the deva realm are reborn among devasFar more are the beings who on passing away from the deva realm are reborn in hell in the animal womb in the domain of the hungry ghosts In the same way monks few are the beings who on passing away from the deva realm are reborn among human beingsFar more are the beings who on passing away from the deva realm are reborn in hell in the animal womb in the domain of the hungry ghostsTherefore your duty is the contemplation This is stress This is the origination of stress This is the cessation of stress Your duty is the contemplation This is the path of practice leading to the cessation of stressThe Buddha also used conviction in rebirth to encourage his listeners not to be deterred by difficulties faced along the pathCompared to the sufferings of repeated rebirth those difficulties count for nothingMonks suppose there was a man whose life span was years who would live toSomeone would say to him Look here fellowThey will stab you at dawn with spears at noon with spears  again at evening with spearsYou thus stabbed day after day with spears will have a lifespan of years will live to be and at the end of years you will realize the four noble truths that you have never realized beforeMonks a person who desired his own true benefit would do well to take upWhy is thatFrom an inconceivable beginning comes transmigrationA beginning point is not evident for the blows from spears swords  axesEven if this were to occur I tell you that the realization of the four noble truths would not be accompanied by pain  distressInstead I tell you the realization of the four noble truths would be accompanied by pleasure  happinessWhich fourThe noble truth of stress the noble truth of the origination of stress the noble truth of the cessation of stress and the noble truth of the path of practice leading to the cessation of stressTherefore your duty is the contemplation This is stress This is the origination of stress This is the cessation of stress This is the path of practice leading to the cessation of stressIn principle the path to the end of suffering can be completed in one lifetimeThe Canon contains many stories of people who gained full awakening after hearing only one of the Buddhas discourses and MN among other discourses states that in some cases even just seven days determined practice can be enough to complete the pathBut thats in principleEach persons awakening though is a specific case and the Buddha knew that for most of his listeners the path would be a multilifetime affairAnd its hard not to imagine that many of his listeners  just like many people today  looked at the entanglements of their lives and realized that they would never have enough free time in this lifetime to devote fully to the practiceSo instead of trying to please them by paring the path down to what they might reasonably accomplish within the limitations of this lifetime the Buddha encouraged them with a multilifetime perspective on the path to convince them that whatever efforts they made in the direction of awakening wouldnt come to naughtHe kept the bar high and with good reason Only when you have a realistic view of what the path to the end of suffering actually entails will you be able to follow it and gain the full resultsAt the same time the Buddha encouraged people on their deathbed to make an effort to develop dispassion for the various realms of rebirthHe even stated that they might actually achieve full awakening while doing soIn this way they would be able to prevent huge amounts of future pain and sufferingA person assuming only a single lifetime would not see the value of these sorts of efforts  which means that the singlelifetime perspective would underestimate what a dying person can do and would instead favor drugging the person even to the point of losing mindfulness to reduce his or her present painBecause a drugged state of mind is in no position to withstand craving this means that a singlelifetime perspective would place the dying person at a severe disadvantage  and would actually be the more complacent and irresponsible viewIn addition to providing motivation in practicing the path the assumptions of karma and rebirth play an important role in ferreting out attachments to fabrications and other processes that you might otherwise overlook as you follow the pathIf you dont believe for instance that a particular instance of passion or delight could have huge repercussions in the future and if it seems enjoyable right now you can easily regard it as insignificant and allow it to keep bubbling away in the mindThere is monks an intergalactic void an unrestrained darkness a pitchblack darkness where even the light of the sun  moon  so mighty so powerful  doesnt reachWhen this was said one of the monks said to the Blessed One Wow what a great darknessWhat a really great darknessIs there any darkness greater  more frightening than thatThere is monk a darkness greater  more frightening than thatAnd which darkness lord is greater  more frightening than thatAny contemplatives or brahmans who do not know as it has come to be that This is stress who do not know as it has come to be that This is the origination of stress This is the cessation of stress This is the path of practice leading to the cessation of stress They revel in fabrications leading to birth they revel in fabrications

totally released from birth aging death sorrows lamentations pains distresses  despairsThey are not totally released I tell you from suffering  stressOnly when you appreciate the potential for even the most natural or innocuousseeming attachment to lead to longterm suffering will you be willing to take it seriously and work to abandon itAnd only then will you really be following the pathWeve already noted in chapter three that a multilifetime perspective helps to keep you on track in the area of virtue a point that applies to the path factors of right speech right action and right livelihoodThe same principle also applies to the factors more directly connected to meditationThis can be illustrated with two examples from the Buddhas twostep meditative strategy for developing dispassion for clinging and cravingIn the first step he has you focus on the drawbacks of craving for sensuality the minds tendency to get obsessed with plans for sensual pleasuresIf youre limited to an exclusively onelife view of the practice its hard to fully appreciate the power and drawbacks of sensual cravingAfter all the evolution of life has depended on this craving and for many people it provides the only pleasure and excitement they know so its easy to justify sensuality as a good thingEven when you consider the many drawbacks of sensuality visible in this life it remains simply a matter of taste as to whether you feel the drawbacks are enough to deter you from sensual pursuits Some people prefer peace and safety others the thrills of danger and riskIf everything ends in oblivion and annihilation whos to say that harmful pleasures are worse than harmlessBut when you take seriously the longterm consequences of sensuality over many lifetimes it changes the equation entirelyYou find it easier to see that the pleasures and thrills offered by sensuality are not worth the priceIts with sensuality for the reason sensuality for the source that engage in bodily misconduct verbal misconduct mental misconductHaving engaged in bodily verbal and mental misconduct they  with the breakup of the body after death  reappear in a plane of deprivation a bad destination a lower realm hellOnly when you can see sensuality in this light are you genuinely ready to follow the path to fully undercut the sensual craving that acts as one of the causes of suffering and stressHowever even this understanding is not enough to uproot sensual cravingThe mind needs an alternate source of pleasure to sustain it on the pathThis pleasure is provided by jhana the path factor of right concentrationEven though a disciple of the noble ones has clearly seen with right discernment as it has come to be that sensuality is of much stress much despair  greater drawbacks still  if he has not attained a rapture  pleasure apart from sensuality apart from unskillful mental qualities or something more peaceful than that  he can be tempted by sensualityBut when he has clearly seen with right discernment as it has come to be that sensuality is of much stress much despair  greater drawbacks and he has attained a rapture  pleasure apart from sensuality apart from unskillful qualities or something more peaceful than that he cannot be tempted by sensualityStill even though the pleasures of jhana are a necessary part of the path they arent totally safeTo enter jhana is to take on a state of becoming and so it too can be an object of cravingAnd because some of the higher jhanas touch dimensions of nothingness and neither perception nor nonperception they are easy to mistake for states of nonbecomingThis means that even though the practice of jhana can help you overcome sensual craving on its own its not enough to overcome the two remaining types of craving  for becoming and nonbecoming  that lead to further suffering and stressHere again a multilifetime perspective is helpful in detecting these subtle attachments  attachments that even the contemplation of notself if its not informed by this perspective can easily missAs MN states its possible to develop the perception of notself applying it to all phenomena and arrive at a refined formless level of jhana the dimension of nothingnessAt that point you experience a subtle level of equanimity so subtle that you can easily miss the fact that youre clinging to itIf you dont see that even this equanimity can lead to future dangers you wont feel inclined to investigate itThis may be why many meditators with a onelifetime perspective equate equanimity with nibbana They dont see that theres any need to question their attainment of refined equanimity for they feel its enough to maintain them in good stead through the remainder of this lifetimeAnd if they hold to the materialist view that all we can know is known through the senses then equanimity in the face of sensory experience would be the greatest peace they could imagineBut as the Buddha points out in SN there is a dimension of experience beyond the senses where an even greater peace can be found through the total end of fabricationAnd as he states in MN if  with the possibility of this more peaceful dimension in mind  you see that even subtle levels of equanimity can lead to long lifetimes but that those lifetimes will end youre more inclined to investigate those levels of equanimity to see how theyre fabricatedOnly through this sort of investigation can you develop dispassion for the last traces of seemingly innocuous fabrication that stand in the way of full releaseThis is the second step in the Buddhas strategyIn one of the standard descriptions for how to develop dispassion for jhana the Buddha first has you master jhana  you cant overcome attachment to it by not doing itThen he has you contemplate the mental events sustaining jhana as processes  aggregates which play a role in dependent coarising under the factors of fabrication consciousness and name  to see that they too have their drawbacksThis focuses attention directly on the factors that dependent coarising  in its various models  highlights as the spots where the selfsustaining processes leading to suffering can be starvedThis is also where we most clearly see why the Buddha discussed all the factors leading to rebirth as processesIf youre looking for your inner essence or the ground of being for the world its all too easy  when reaching a state of jhana  to mistake that state for what youre looking forThis however leads simply to more ignorance and attachmentBut if you view jhana as the result of actions and processes then when you reach this stage you find it easier to develop dispassion for jhana without feeling that anything substantial is being lostSuppose that an archer or archers apprentice were to practice on a straw man or mound of clay so that after a while he would become able to shoot long distances to fire accurate shots in rapid succession and to pierce great massesIn the same way there is the case where a monk enters  remains in the first jhana rapture  pleasure born of seclusion accompanied by directed thought  evaluationHe regards whatever phenomena there that are connected with form feeling perception fabrications  consciousness as inconstant stressful a disease a cancer an arrow painful an affliction alien a disintegration an emptiness notselfHe turns his mind away from those phenomena and having done so inclines his mind to the property of deathlessness This is peace this is exquisite  the resolution of all fabrications the relinquishment of all acquisitions the ending of craving dispassion cessation UnbindingIn line with the Buddhas approach of seeing how these processes manifest on many levels he advises that you view even the being doing jhana as a process composed of aggregatesWhen this contemplation yields a sense of dispassion for all aggregates past present and future  even those used on the path  it starves the process by which craving can lead to further rebirthWhere there is no passion for the nutriment of physical food where there is no delight no craving then consciousness does not land there or increaseWhere consciousness does not land or increase there is no alighting of nameformWhere there is no alighting of nameform there is no growth of fabricationsWhere there is no growth of fabrications there is no production of renewed becoming in the futureWhere there is no production of renewed becoming in the future there is no future birth aging  deathThat I tell you has no sorrow affliction or despairIf a monk abandons passion for the property of form the property of feeling the property of perception the property of fabrications the property of consciousness then owing to the abandonment of passion the support is cut off and there is no landing of consciousnessConsciousness thus not having landed not increasing not concocting is releasedOwing to its release it is steadyOwing to its steadiness it is contentedOwing to its contentment it is not agitatedNot agitated one is totally unbound right withinOne discerns that Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task doneThere is nothing further for the sake of this worldWhat remains is a dimension free of birth and deathThere is monks an unborn  unbecome  unmade  unfabricatedIf there were not that unborn  unbecome  unmade  unfabricated there would not be the case that emancipation from the born  become  made  fabricated would be discernedBut precisely because there is an unborn  unbecome  unmade  unfabricated emancipation from the born  become  made  fabricated is discernedThis dimension is characterized by a type of consciousness that lies outside of the range of the sensory consciousness involved in dependent coarising and the realm of the six senses  a realm the Buddha calls the all Thus its totally free from sufferingConsciousness without surface endless radiant all around has not been experienced through the earthness of earth the liquidity of liquid the fieriness of fire the windiness of wind the allness of the allThe canonical image for this sort of consciousness totally independent of nutriment is of a ray of light that doesnt land anywhereJust as if there were a roofed house or a roofed hall having windows on the north the south or the eastWhen the sun rises and a ray has entered by way of the window where does it landOn the western wall lordAnd if there is no western wall where does it landOn the ground lordAnd if there is no ground where does it landOn the water lordAnd if there is no water where does it landIt does not land lordIn the same way where there is no passion for the nutriment of physical food contact intellectual intention consciousness where there is no delight no craving then consciousness does not land there or growWhere consciousness does not land or grow nameform does not alightWhere nameform does not alight there is no growth of fabricationsWhere there is no growth of fabrications there is no production of renewed becoming in the futureWhere there is no production of renewed becoming in the future there is no future birth aging  deathThat I tell you has no sorrow affliction or despairIn line with his discussion of rebirth the Buddha never offered a metaphysical explanation of what this consciousness is or how it might beAfter all it would be a mistake to justify the reality of the unconditioned with reference to the conditioned as its not dependent on any thing or any how in any wayHowever the Buddha did show how to get there Thats why his image for the practice is a pathA path to a mountain doesnt cause the mountain but it does provide the opportunity for walking thereThe path of practice doesnt cause the unconditioned but it does provide the opening for attaining itThe Canon when describing a persons full awakening never depicts the accompanying knowledge as touching on what or how this unconditioned consciousness isInstead the knowledge is said to begin with a realization of release from the asavas of sensuality becoming and ignorance along with the realization that that release is once and for allThen it proceeds to a realization of the future implications of that release starting with the fact that it has put an end to any future rebirthIn the Buddhas own case he expressed the knowledge like thisKnowledge  vision arose in me Unprovoked is my releaseThis is the last birthThere is now no further becomingThe two most frequently used descriptions of the knowledge accompanying the attainment of arahantship make the same point like thisWith release there is the knowledge Released One discerns that Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task doneThere is nothing further for the sake of this worldDwelling alone  secluded heedful ardent  resolute  VenAnuruddha in no long time reached  remained in the supreme goal of the holy life for which clansmen rightly go forth from home into homelessness knowing  realizing it for himself in the herenowHe knew Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task doneThere is nothing further for the sake of this world And thus VenAnuruddha became another one of the arahantsIn other words when the mind returns to the fabricated dimension after its total encounter with the unfabricated dimension and has realized its release the realization that its through with birthrebirth  on both the macro and the micro levels  is the first thing that spontaneously occurs to itThis realization of the ending of birth leads to the further realization that all suffering has been ended as wellPeople who hold to a modern materialist view of the world and the self tend to react to these canonical descriptions of what is known in awakening by offering three main reasons for resisting themThe first is that these descriptions in their eyes go beyond what a human being could possibly knowSometimes this argument is supported by the claim that the Canons descriptions violate the Buddhas own criteria stated elsewhere in the discourses for what can and cannot be knownThe passage most commonly cited in this argument is thisWhat is the allSimply the eye  forms ear  sounds nose  aromas tongue  flavors body  tactile sensations intellect  ideasThis monks is termed the allAnyone who would say Repudiating this all I will describe another if questioned on what exactly might be the grounds for his statement would be unable to explain and furthermore would be put to griefWhyBecause it lies beyond rangeThe argument maintains that beyond range here means beyond the range of possible knowledge Therefore the existence of a dimension lying beyond the six senses  such as that of consciousness without surface described in MN  is impossible to knowThis would invalidate any claim that one has known such things  and by implication the freedom from rebirth that such a knowledge would implyHowever there is clear evidence that beyond range here simply means beyond the range of adequate description for there are other canonical passages indicating that even though the dimension beyond the six senses cannot be adequately described it can still be knownMahaKotthita With the remainderless ceasing  fading of the six spheres of contact is it the case that there is anything elseSariputta Dont say that my friendMahaKotthita With the remainderless ceasing  fading of the six spheres of contact is it the case that there is not anything elseSariputta Dont say that my friendMahaKotthita is it the case that there both is  is not anything elseSariputta Dont say that my friendMahaKotthita is it the case that there neither is nor is not anything elseSariputta Dont say that my friendMahaKotthita Being asked if there is anything else you say Dont say that my friend Being asked if there is not anything else if there both is  is not anything else if there neither is nor is not anything else you say Dont say that my friend Now how is the meaning of this statement to be understoodSariputta Saying is it the case that there is anything else is it the case that there is not anything else is it the case that there both is  is not anything else is it the case the there neither is nor is not anything else one is objectifying the nonobjectifiedHowever far the six spheres of contact go that is how far objectification goesHowever far objectification goes that is how far the six spheres of contact goWith the remainderless ceasing  fading of the six spheres of contact there comes to be the ceasing the allaying of objectificationMonks that dimension should be experienced where the eye ceases and the perception of form fadesThat dimension should be experienced where the ear ceases and the perception of sound fades where the nose ceases and the perception of aroma fades where the tongue ceases and the perception of flavor fades where the body ceases and the perception of tactile sensation fades where the intellect ceases and the perception of ideaphenomenon fades That dimension should be experiencedSo theres nothing in the Pali discourses to indicate that the Buddha would have agreed with a modern materialist view that experience is limited to the six sensesAnd its doubtful that he would have tried to justify his claims in terms that a modern materialist would acceptAfter all he noted that the Buddharange of a Buddha and the jhanarange of a person in jhana are inconceivables that are not to be conjectured about that would bring madness and vexation to anyone who conjectured about themThis means that he wouldnt encourage the sort of conjecture that a materialist  or anyone else  might make about what a mind trained to master jhana or attain the supreme level of awakening could or couldnt knowA second modern argument against accepting the canonical accounts of whats known in awakening  and in particular the knowledge of rebirth achieved in awakening  is that one can still obtain all the results of the practice without having to accept the possibility of rebirthAfter all all the factors leading to suffering are all immediately present to awareness so there should be no need when trying to abandon them to accept any premises about where they may or may not lead in the futureThis objection however ignores the role of appropriate attention on the pathAs we noted above one of its roles is to examine and abandon the assumptions that underlie ones views on the metaphysics of personal identityUnless youre willing to step back from your own views  such as those concerning what a person is and why that makes rebirth impossible  and subject them to this sort of examination theres something lacking in your pathYoull remain entangled in the questions of inappropriate attention which will prevent you from actually identifying and abandoning the causes of suffering and achieving the full results of the practiceIn addition the terms of appropriate attention  the four noble truths  are not concerned simply with events arising and passing away in the present momentThey also focus on the causal connections among those events connections that occur both in the immediate present and over timeIf you limit your focus solely to connections in the present while ignoring those over time you cant fully comprehend the ways in which craving causes suffering not only by latching on to the four kinds of nutriment but also giving rise to the four kinds of nutriment as wellThis narrow focus places an obstacle in your ability to develop right view  and in particular your ability to see dependent coarising as a selfsustaining processIf in line with the standard materialist view you regard consciousness as a mere byproduct of material processes then theres no way you can appreciate the full power of consciousness and craving to generate the food that can sustain the processes of suffering indefinitelyAnd if you dont fully appreciate this power theres no way that you can effectively bring it to an endA third argument against accepting the knowledge of rebirth as a necessary part of awakening is that many modern people who claim to have experienced the levels of awakening described in the Canon gained no knowledge of rebirth or of the end of rebirth as part of those experiencesThe fact that people in the Buddhas time claimed to gain this sort of knowledge in the course of their awakening can thus be written off as a cultural artifact They were primed to see it because of their cultural background and so it wasnt really an essential part of the experienceThere are however two problems with this argumentThe first is that as we have seen rebirth was not a universally accepted assumption in the Buddhas timeAn important part of any persons experience of awakening  then as now  would be to prove for oneself whether the Buddha was right on the topicThe second more telling problem with this third argument is that it actually defeats itselfIf ones experiences of awakening dont agree with the Canons descriptions of the levels of awakening why would one want to claim the Canons labels for those experiencesAn essential part of even the first level of awakening described in the Canon  stream entry  confirms the rightness of right view which includes the understanding that there is a deathless birthless dimension and that there is a level of craving that if not abandoned will lead to repeated birthThe distinguishing mark of the attainment of arahantship  as opposed to the lower levels of awakening recognized in the Canon  is that it has put an end to that craving thus putting an end to birthIf the Canon is wrong on these points then the terms it uses to describe the levels of awakening are bogus as wellThis means that if ones experience of awakening doesnt match the descriptions in the Canon one would do well to examine ones motivation for wanting to claim a canonical label for that experienceIf ones teacher has certified that experience with a canonical name the teachers knowledge and motivation should be examined tooAnd if one seriously wants to put an end to suffering one would do well to take to heart the Canons insistence that if ones awakening has not put an end to becoming and birth the possibility for continued suffering remainsThe irony in all three of these arguments against the teaching on rebirth is that the people who make them all assume that the Buddha was incapable of questioning the views of his time and yet the fact is that they themselves are unwilling to accept the Buddhas challenge to step back and question their ownWe know how the Buddha responded to materialism in his own time and theres no reason to assume that he would respond any differently to materialism todaySome people might object that modern materialism is much more sophisticated now than it was in the time of the Buddha and so it deserves a more serious hearingBut is that really the caseThe questions that neurobiologists presently bring to issues of consciousness  What is personal identityWhat sort of thing is consciousnessHow can consciousness be measured in material terms  are precisely the questions that the Buddha listed under inappropriate attentionEven though modern scientific experiments may be more sophisticated than Prince Payasis experiments on criminals the scientists who conduct them are just as wrongheaded in thinking that a phenomenological process  consciousness and mental events as experienced from within  can be captured and measured in physical termsAlthough rebirth is often presented as an unscientific view the material sciences actually have no way at all of proving the issue one way or the otherAs for the efficacy of human action the scientific method can never prove whether the scientists applying it are actually exercising free will in designing their experimentsIt also cant prove whether their actions in designing and running an experiment actually have an impact on the experiments resultsScientific inquiry and peer review certainly act as if these assumptions are true  the idea of criticizing a poorly designed experiment would make no sense if scientists had no free will in designing their experimentsAnd if we can judge by appearances the assumption of free will and the responsibilities it carries have been crucial in enabling scientific knowledge to advanceBut the scientific method itself cant prove whether the appearance of free will and efficacious action is anything more than an appearanceAnd of course theres the irony that many scientists assume that the phenomena they observe operate under strict deterministic laws while the method they employ assumes that they themselves are not driven by such laws in applying that methodThis means that science is in no position to prove or disprove the Buddhas teachings on the range and powers of human actionFinally theres the whole question of how valid it is to divorce the Buddhas psychological insights from his cosmological teachingsAs we noted in chapter one we in the West  beginning with the European Romantics and American Transcendentalists  have long assumed that cosmology is the rightful sphere of the physical sciences while religion should limit itself to the care of the human psycheBut one of the central insights of the Buddhas awakening is that events on the micro scale in the mind actually shape experiences on the macro scale in time and spaceIf we cant question the clear line our culture draws between psychology and cosmology we wont be in a position to appreciate the ways in which the Buddhas insight on this issue can actually help bring suffering to an endSo were faced with a choiceIf were sincere about wanting to end suffering and to give the Buddhas teachings a fair test then  instead of assuming that he was a prisoner of his own time and place unable to question his cultural assumptions  we have to examine the extent to which in adhering to our own cultural assumptions were imprisoning ourselvesIf we dont want to drop our selfimposed restrictions we can still benefit from any of the Buddhas teachings that fit within those limitations but well have to accept the consequences that the results well get will be limited as wellOnly if were willing to submit to the test of appropriate attention abandoning the presuppositions that distort our thinking about issues like karma and rebirth will we be able to make full use of the Canons tools for gaining total releasePali Buddhist TextsVedic TextsReferences to DN and MN are to discourseThe reference to Mv is to chapter section and subsectionReferences to other Pali texts are to section and discourseAll translations from the Pali Canon are the authors own and are based on the Royal Thai EditionAccording to the teachings of the Buddha the human personality comprises five aggregates of grasping called in Pali pañcupadanakkhandhaThey are enumerated asWe may wonder why the Buddha mentions only five aggregates no more and no lessWe can attempt to answer this question by analyzing any unit of experience in our daytoday lifeSuppose for instance we hear a big noise on the road and we rush to the spot and recognize that a motorcycle accident has taken place we feel sorry for the victim and want to rush him to the hospitalIf we look at this experience and analyze the physical and mental phenomena involved we will notice that they can be accommodated within the five aggregates of graspingOf course we all know the body or the material aspect of our personalityIt is this body which approached the site of the accidentWe heard the noise and saw the scene of the accident that means we have had auditory and visual consciousnessWe recognized that it is a motorcycle accident that is the aggregate of perception and ideationWe felt sorry for the victim and our sorrow is the feeling aspect of our personalityWe wanted to take the victim to hospital and that is the volitional aspectThus we have found all five aggregates of grasping in this unit of experienceThe physical and mental phenomena involved in all our varied experiences can be included within these five aggregatesIt is very likely that the Buddha too discovered these five aggregates of grasping by analyzing experience through objective awareness and intuitive wisdomWhy are they called aggregates khandhaKhandha means heap or accumulation It is easy to understand that the body is a heap of material elementsWe maintain its process of growth by heaping it up with gross material foodIn the mental sphere too through our experiences we accumulate feelings perceptions and ideas volitions and consciousnessTherefore all five aspects of the personality are called heaps accumulations or aggregatesSince they are intimately interconnected and act on one another the processes are extremely complex and complicatedAccording to one commentarial simile they are like the waters at a confluence where five rivers meetOne cannot take a handful of water and say that it came from such and such a riverThe aggregates are everchanging and are constantly in a state of fluxThey are so volatile and dynamic that they give rise to the notion of I and mine Just as a fast revolving firebrand gives the illusion of a circle of fire these dynamic processes of physical and mental energy give rise to the illusion of I self ego soulThey are called aggregates of grasping because we cling to them passionately as I and mine Just as an animal tied with a strap to a firm post runs round and round the post stands sits and lies down beside the post so the person who regards the five aggregates as his self cannot escape from the aggregates and the suffering disappointment and anxiety which invariably accompany themThe five aggregates constitute a real private prison for usWe suffer a great deal due to our attachment to this prison and our expectations of what the prison should beAs our perception of the external world and our relations with our fellow human beings are conditioned by the nature of this prison interpersonal relations and communication become extremely complex tricky and problematicProblems become more and more complicated to the extent that we identify ourselves with this private prisonNow let us try to supplement our understanding of the canonical teachings in terms of our daily experience and see how we cling to each and every one of these aggregates as I and mine and continue to suffer in the private prison that we make for ourselvesIf someone were to ask us the question Who are you we would immediately respond by stating I am so and so The name is but a label and it can be anythingWe can also say I am a human being By that we have only stated the species to which we belongI am a man or woman This only affirms the sex of the personI am so and sos daughter sister wife mother etcThese describe relationships but we have still not answered the question Who are you We produce the identity card to prove our identity but the identity card shows only a picture of the body with the name labelNow we believe that we have satisfactorily answered the question Who are you Thus we identify ourselves with our bodiesWhen we say I am tall I am fat I am fair etc we really mean that the body is tall or fat or fair but what we do is identify the body as What is more we decorate it in various ways and regard it as our beautiful self Am I not beautiful in this sari We regard the body as our precious possession  my face my hair my teeth etcThus it is very clear that we cling to the material body as our very own selfThis identification is so widely accepted and thorough that it has crept in linguistic usages as wellIn words such as somebody everybody and nobody body is used in the sense of personNow the Buddha who analyzed the body objectively under the microscope of mindfulness realized the true nature of the body and found that there is nothing in it that can be called beautifulIt is made up of flesh phlegm saliva blood urine and feces all very repulsiveEven what is generally considered beautiful such as hair teeth and nails if found out of context say for instance in ones food becomes extremely repulsiveSo too the face of a beauty queen if closely looked at before an early morning washIt is not necessary to dwell at length on the ravages of old age and the decomposition of the body at deathTherefore the Buddha says that this body is a bag of filth a burden to be discarded rather than clung to as I and mineThe body is composed of the material elements of solidity cohesion heat and motionThere is nothing worth grasping in any of these elementsThey are found abundantly in the external world too but we cling to this fathomlong blob of matter as I and mineThe Buddha defines the body or form as that which gets reformed and deformed it is afflicted with heat cold and insectsThe body is but a bodybuilding activityModern medical science informs us that the body is composed of billions and billions of cells which are continually in a process of growth and decayWhat is meant here can be explained with the help of a simileWe say that there is rain and use the noun rain But in actuality there is no thing called rain apart from the activity of rainingThe process of drops of water falling from the sky  that we call rainThough we use the noun rain there is in reality only the activity of raining which can be better described with a verbSimilarly what we call the body is but a process of body building therefore the Buddha defines the noun form with its corresponding verb formingThis process of bodybuilding is going on all the time and thus is always in a state of unrestTherefore form is looked upon as impermanentIn this changing process of bodybuilding activity there is absolutely nothing that can be regarded as a self an unchanging ego an I a permanent soulThus our identification with the body as self is a big delusionDuring its lifetime the body passes through the stages of infancy childhood adolescence youth middle age and old ageThroughout this process there is a type of suffering which is characteristic of each particular ageTeething learning skills in locomotion communication add much frustration to infancyChildhood is comparatively free of suffering if one is fortunate to have a healthy body but coping with the growing body can become frustrating if energy is not channeled towards healthy play and creative workAdolescence when an individual is neither small enough to be a child nor mature enough to be an adult is particularly troublesomeIn youth the body can be quite problematic as sexual energy is at its peakUnless it is wisely channeled indulged in lawfully accepted ways restrained with understanding and sublimated youth can lead to much miseryIn middle age the body is prone to pressurerelated diseases for many it is a period of much anxietySuffering in old age is manifold the body becomes too big a burden to carryThus at no stage in life does the body remain troublefree it is a source of suffering throughout lifeHowever much we pamper the body with all five strands of sense pleasures the body is never gratefulIt never behaves the way we would like it to behaveHowever much we wash it it gets dirtyHowever much we feed it it gets hungry and tiredIt falls ill it gets old it loses its beauty and strengthIt never stays within our controlTherefore it is not worth hankering after calling it I and mineIn the private prison of the five aggregates the body is the most tangible shapely wallThe body of each person is a unique combination of elements having particular biochemical and bioelectrical propertiesEach body has strengths and weaknesses peculiar to itselfEach one is prone to certain types of diseases in a particular wayThere is no individual who is completely healthy all through lifeOne person may be asthmatic another diabeticOne may have a weak respiratory system another a weak digestive systemEach one suffers individually privately by the body he has inheritedOur bodies vary in size shape color and appearance and because of these differences we suffer various complexitiesOur bodies may not be what we would like them to beThen we get disappointed and depressedA woman who had lost her sight in early childhood regained her sight after about thirty years as a result of the shock of a sudden fallShe was overjoyed to regain her sight but her joy was shortlived for she discovered through the mirror that she was not beautifulSuch is the disappointment the body brings when it does not come up to our expectationsThe body also changes from age to age the once beautiful strong body becomes the haggard and infirm and we suffer on account of thatWe resort to various methods of making it beautiful and strong  we paint the face dye the hair use dentures and wigs we take vitamins tonics and elixirsYet all the same the body defies our expectations and we continue to suffer within the confines of the private prison of our bodyOnce a friend of mine related how he saw a child meddling with the rear bumper of a parked carThe owner started driving the car and the child clinging to the rear bumper was yelling as he got dragged alongIf only the child let go of his hold on the car his suffering would have ceasedSimilarly we cling to our body and we grieve and lament when it goes according to its natureIf only we would learn to let go of it our suffering would ceaseTherefore the Buddha says Give up that which does not belong to youThe five aggregates of grasping do not belong to youFeelings demarcate the body from the rest of the environment and give the body the sense of selfThe Khandhasamyutta says that the uninstructed man being impressed by feelings which are produced through contact with ignorance thinks I am this The body is strewn with an intricately woven network of nerve fibers and there is no part of the body which is not sensitive to touchThe entire sensitive volume constitutes the I the self the egoWhen we say I am comfortable or happy or sad we identify ourselves with feelingsStatements such as He does not care for my happiness he hurt my feelings also show how we establish a sense of possession for our feelingsThere are three kinds of feelings namely pleasurable or happy feelings unpleasant or painful feelings and neutral feelingsNo two types ever occur concurrently at any single momentWhen pleasurable feelings are present the other two are absent when painful feelings are there pleasant and neutral feelings are absent similarly with neutral feelingsThe Mahanidana Sutta asks the question when feelings are so complex in this manner which feeling would one accept as ones selfAccording to the Vedanasamyutta innumerable feelings arise in the body just as all kinds of winds blow in different directions in the atmosphereWe are hardly aware of these feelings for the simple reason that we do not pay enough attention to themIf we observe for a couple of minutes how often we adjust our bodies and change the position of our limbs we will be surprised to note that we hardly keep still even for a few secondsWhat is the reason for this constant change of position and postureMonotony of position causes discomfort and we change position and posture in search for comfortWe react to feelings yearning for more and more pleasurable feelings revolting against unpleasant feelings and being generally unaware of neutral feelingsTherefore pleasurable feelings have desire as their latent tendency unpleasant feelings have aversion as their latent tendency and neutral feelings have ignorance as their latent tendencyThus all feelings generate unskillful motivational roots and they partake of the nature of sufferingThough the search for comfort and pleasure goes on constantly throughout life pleasure always eludes us like a mirageOur feelings are extremely private and personalOne may have a splitting headache but the one next to him may not know anything about his painful sensationsWe only infer the pain of another by his facial expressions behavior and words but we certainly do not know the feelings of anotherWe are so unique in the experiences of feelings one may be sensitive to heat another to cold mosquitoes or fleas another to certain kinds of pollenOne may have a low threshold for pain another a high thresholdThus each one is so unique in the totality of his sensitivity that we are utterly and absolutely alone in our private prison of feelingsThe Buddha defines feeling as the act of feelingThere is no thing called feeling apart from the act of feelingTherefore feelings are dynamic everchanging impermanentThey do not remain within our control either for we cannot say Let me have or not have such and such feelings They come and go as they please we have no control or right of ownership over themTherefore the Buddha exhorts us Give up that which does not belong to you Trying to possess that which is fleeting and defies ownership causes griefGiving up spells the end of sorrowSañña in Pali is translated as perception or ideationPerception is nothing but the act of perceivingThus it is a dynamic process an activityWhat does it perceiveIt perceives colors such as blue yellow red white etcThis definition of sañña seems to imply that the linguistic ability of man is associated with saññaThe word sañña also means symbol and symbolization is closely associated with languageIt is language that helps us to form ideas and that is the reason why sañña is sometimes translated as ideationAccording to ones perception one forms a point of view an ideaWe identify ourselves with our ideas too This is my point of view this is my idea this is my opinion this is what I meant  these are all expressions identifying ourselves with ideation and perceptionSometimes this identification is so strong that we are ready to sacrifice our lives for the sake of an ideaMany wars are waged in the world propagating or defending ideasAs this is such a dominant form of clinging it has been singled out by the Buddha as ditthupadana clinging to a particular view one chooses to believe inIdentifying ourselves with various points of view we call ourselves democrats socialists eternalists annihilationists positivistsOur ideas change due to changing emotions and circumstancesA friend becomes a foe an enemy becomes an ally a stranger becomes a spouseTherefore in ideation too there is nothing constant and permanent it is not possible to hold them fast as I and mine without coming to griefMemory is also associated with saññaThat is why we are able to recognize a person we have met beforeThrough the faculty of memory we recall having existed in the past experiencing such and such eventsBy projecting the same kind of experience into the future we anticipate that we will exist in the futureThus through the memory aspect of sañña we posit the illusion of a self continuing through the three periods of past present and futureBut we little realize that the retrospection of the past and the anticipation of the future are both in fact done in the present moment itselfHow does sañña form a wall in our private prisonEach one of us perceives the world around us through our own preconceived ideasLet us take a very gross exampleA doctors perception of the world will be quite different from the perception of a politician or a businessmanA doctor looking at an apple might think of its nutritional value a politician of the advantages and disadvantages permitting importation the businessman of the commercial valueThus we are so much conditioned by our interests and ideologies  some absorbed from upbringing some from the culture we are exposed to some from the academic and professional training we have acquired  that no two people can have identical perceptionsThere are sufficient common factors in these aspects to allow us to form general superficial agreements with other individuals but when we take into account all ramifications we have to conclude that as regards perception too each one of us lives in a private prisonIf we wish to experience wisdom and happiness welling within ourselves we have to give up clinging to our ideas unlearn what we have spent years to learn decondition ourselves and empty our mindsThere are three types of volitional activities physical verbal and mentalWe identify ourselves so much with these volitional activities that we posit an agent behind them as the doer the speaker and the thinkerTherefore we say I do I speak I think Because this egocentricity in activities is so much emphasized we want to perform not only at our maximum efficiency but we also try to outdo othersRecord breaking is a mania todayThere are so many competitors vying with one another at the international level eager to earn a place in the Guinness Book of RecordsBecause of our volitional activities we are involved in an endless process of preparation from womb to tombAs infants we prepare ourselves for childhood struggling and learning skills of locomotion and speechAs children we prepare ourselves for youth and then we study various skills arts and sciences trying to become successful adultsAdults prepare for parenthoodAt last in our old age too we do not give up preparationWe turn to religion in our old age to prepare for heavenThis same aspect of our personalities is expressed in different words as cetana intention which in turn is said to constitute the moral force of kamma which propels life from birth to birthRepeated action has the cumulative effect of transforming character and thus through repeated volitional activities we can shape our destiniesA little story taken from an Indian classical text illustrates how our destiny is affected by our behaviorOne day two young men who were lost in a forest chanced to meet a hermit living there who was able to predict the futureBefore departing the young men requested the hermit to tell their fortunesThe hermit was reluctant but the men pleadedThen the hermit observed them closely and predicted that Vipul would be a king within a year and Vijan would die in the hands of an assassinVipul was very much elated and Vijan was naturally very sadThey went back to their homes and Vipul became very arrogant in his behavior towards others thinking he would soon be kingVijan was a teacher and he performed his duties conscientiously he became very virtuous and led a humble meditative lifeAfter about six months Vipul called his friend to go in search of a place to build a palace and they went into a deserted areaWhen they were searching Vipul found a pot of gold and was very happy that his fortune was unfoldingWhen the two friends were examining the gold in great happiness and excitement a bandit rushed in and snatched the potVijan fought with the bandit and rescued the gold but had to suffer a cut on the shoulder from the bandits weaponVipul invited Vijan to share the gold but Vijan declined the offer as he would die in a few monthsVipul took the gold and spent it in eating drinking and enjoying himself in anticipation of becoming kingVijan spent the time in meditation and humilityA year passed but the prediction did not come trueThey revisited the hermit and asked why his prediction had not come to passThe hermit explained that by the arrogant behavior of Vipul his fortune was reduced to a mere pot of gold while the virtuous behavior of Vijan was powerful enough to mitigate his misfortune to a mere wound in the hands of a banditThe noun sankhara is defined by its verbal counterpart thus Volitional activities are those which construct form shape or prepare the physical body into what it is the feelings into what they are perceptions volitional activities and consciousness into what they are This is a process that is going on all the timeWhat is meant can be understood in the following manner the distinctive physical and mental characteristic features of each individual are determined by these volitional activitiesTo this category belong all our hopes aspirations ambitions and determinations and we identify ourselves with them as my hopes my ambitions etcNo two people will be identical in this respect tooWhat one person will treasure and strive for another may consider a trifleWhen one person prefers to hoard money another would prefer to spend it on educationStill another may consider both of these as insignificant and run after power honor and prestigeWe shape our destinies alone imprisoned as we are within the wall of volitional activitiesIf we want to free ourselves we have to give up identification with this prison wall tooConsciousness is defined as the act of becoming conscious of objects through the instrumentality of the sense facultiesTherefore there is eyeconsciousness earconsciousness noseconsciousness tongueconsciousness bodyconsciousness and mindconsciousnessThis cognitive process takes place so rapidly and so continuously that we identify ourselves with the function of the sense faculties as I see I hear I smell I taste I feel I think and imagine According to the Buddha there is no I ego self or soul who cognizes and enjoys these sense objectsSense consciousness is but a causally produce phenomenon dependent on sense faculties and sense objectsEach persons sense faculties are differently constitutedSome are blind some have weak eyes some have keen vision some are deaf some are short of hearing and some have sharp hearingBecause of the differences in the very constitution of the sense faculties our cognitive capacity too has to be different however slight the differences may beMoreover our sense experiences are conditioned by our likes and dislikes by our previous experiences and memories by our aspirations and ambitionsAs such however much we value sense experience as authentic no two people will experience the same sense object in exactly the same wayFor example suppose that three people are watching a fight between two boysIf the three people happen to be a friend an enemy and a parent of one of those involved in the fight the three people will have entirely different views regarding itOur senses communicate to us what we prefer to seeVolitions condition consciousness throughout our daytoday experiencesFor instance if we are looking for a pen on a crowded table we may see the pen and take it awayWe may have failed to see the glass that was next to it and we may have to make a fresh search for the glass rather than look straight at the place where the pen wasThis is because what we look for is predetermined by our will which to a certain extent excludes from our field of attention and vision things irrelevant to our purposesIf we gaze at a scene vacantly only a few items which kindled our interest are registered in our memoryInterests are divergent therefore different people see different things in the same situationThus it is extremely difficult to acquire impartial objective experience of sense objects as each one of us is psychologically conditioned in a unique wayTherefore in sense experience too we lead a lonely private life imprisoned in a private cellBecause each one of us is leading a secluded life within the confines of our individual personalities interpersonal relations become extremely difficult and complicatedThe way to be released from this selfimprisonment is to stop regarding the five constituents of personality individually or collectively as I and mineAccording to the Khandhasamyutta a man carried down by the strong current of a river grabs at the grasses and leaves overhanging the river but they give him no support as they are easily uprootedSimilarly the uninstructed man grabs at the five aggregates as his self or ego but as they are themselves evanescent and unstable they cannot support himBeing dependent on them the man only comes to grief and delusionWe have to realize the impermanent everchanging conditional nature of these five factors of personality and become detached from themIt is only with this detachment that we can make ourselves free from the selfmade private prison of our personalityLily de Silva is Professor of Pali and Buddhist Studies at the University of Peradeniya in Sri LankaA regular contributor to Buddhist scholarly and popular journals she is also the editor of the subcommentary to the Digha Nikaya published by the Pali Text Society of LondonHer collection of essays One Foot in the World is published by BPSThe Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creedsFounded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topicsIts publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddhas discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practiceThese works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first aroseThe Samyutta Nikaaya is one of the five great divisions of the Sutta Pitaka of the Paali canon the Tipitaka or Three Baskets of doctrine constituting the Buddhaword for Theravaada BuddhismThe meaning of Samyutta Nikaaya is The Collection of Grouped Discourses and it is so called because its material is arranged into groups according to subject of which there are fiftysixThese again are placed into five vaggas sections or chapters corresponding to the five divisions of this anthologyIn the Paali Text Societys complete edition the whole work is contained in five volumes covering over pages so it will be realized that this anthology is a very small selection indeed of the complete Samyutta NikaayaThe present anthology differs from others that have appeared in that it is not arranged in any special order merely following the order of the text itself and that it is confined to just one part of the Paali TipitakaAs regards the choice of material an attempt was made to make it as representative as possible of the whole collection but personal preference could not be ignoredChoice tended to fall upon the more striking discourses the avoidance of passages that were too repetitive and the inclusion of those that contained similes and parables so profoundly illuminating and easily remembered John DIrelandThus have I heardAt one time the Lord was staying near Saavatthi at the Jeta Grove in Anaathapindikas monasteryNow when night was passing a certain devataa lighting up the whole Jeta Grove with her surpassing beauty approached the LordHaving drawn near and prostrated herself she stood to one sideStanding there the devataa saidThe Lord repliedOnce bhikkhus a certain devataa of the Heaven of the ThirtyThree while wandering in the Nandana Grove surrounded by a group of celestial nymphs and possessing and enjoying the fivefold heavenly sense pleasures recited at that time this verseTo these words another devataa retorted with this verseStanding at one side Kaamada devaputta said to the LordIt is difficult to do Lord very difficult to doIt is difficult to attain Lord this contentmentIt is difficult Lord to concentrate the mindIt is difficult Lord going on an uneven pathThus have I heardAt one time the Lord was staying near Saavatthi at the Jeta Grove in Anaathapindikas monasteryThen the king Pasenadi of Kosala approached the LordHaving drawn near and prostrated himself he sat down to one sideAs he was sitting there king Pasenadi said to the LordWhen Sir I had retired and was alone this was the reflection that arose in my mind Who loves himselfWho does not love himselfAnd then Sir I thought Those who practice wrong conduct by body speech and thought they do not love themselvesEven though they should say We love ourselves yet they do not love themselvesWhat is the reasonThey do to themselves what a hater would do to someone he hatesTherefore they do not love themselvesBut those who practice good conduct by body speech and thought they love themselvesEven though they should say We do not love ourselves yet they do love themselvesWhat is the reasonThey do to themselves what a friend would do to a friendTherefore they love themselvesSo it is O King so it isWhat do you think O KingSuppose a loyal and reliable man were to come from the east and approaching you should say Your majesty you should know I have come from the east and there saw a great mountain as tall as the sky moving forward and crushing all living creatures in its pathDo whatever you deem right sireAnd then a second man were to come from the west a third from the north a fourth from the south and approaching you should say Your majesty you should know I have come from the south and there saw a great mountain as tall as the sky moving forward and crushing all living creatures in its pathDo whatever you deem right sireAnd in such a situation O King when a great danger of terrible destruction to human life has arisen and when considering that a human birth is so difficult to obtain what is it you could doIn such a situation Sir a great danger of terrible destruction to human life having arisen and a human birth being so difficult to obtain what else could be done but to practice Dhamma to live calmly to do good and to make meritI tell you O King I put it to you old age and death will come upon youSince old age and death are coming what is it you can doSince old age and death are coming upon me what else can be done but to practice Dhamma to live calmly to do good and to make meritThus have I heardAt one time the Lord was stating among the Sakyas at Silaavati and a large number of bhikkhus were dwelling close by diligent and energetic devoting themselvesNow Maara the evil one assuming the appearance of a braahmana with a great pile of matted hair on his head and wearing a leopardskin cloak an old man bent like a roofbeam breathing heavily and grasping an udumbarawood staff approached those bhikkhus and saidYou ascetics are still boysYoung and blackhaired in the flush of youthYou are in the prime of life and have not yet amused yourselves with pleasuresEnjoy human pleasures goods sirsDo not abandon what is visible here and now and run after distant thingsWe have not abandoned what is visible here and now braahmana nor are we running after distant thingsWe have abandoned what is distant and run towards what is visible here and nowThe Lord has said pleasures are distant produce much suffering and despair and are a continual disappointmentBut this Dhamma is visible here and now immediate inviting one to come and see guiding one onward and capable of being experienced by the wiseWhen they had so spoken Maara the evil one departed shaking his head lolling out his tongue frowning and leaning on his staffThen those bhikkhus approached the Lord That was no braahmana bhikkhus that was Maara the evil one come to cloud your clarity of visionThen the Lord having realized the meaning of it spoke at that time this verseAt SaavatthiiNow the bhikkhunii Vajiraa having robed herself and taken her bowl and upper robe entered Saavatthii before noon to collect foodHaving wandered through Saavatthii and returned after her meal she entered the Andha Grove and sat down at the foot of a certain tree to rest during the heat of middayThen Maara the evil one approached the bhikkhunii Vajiraa and desiring to cause fear and consternation to make her hair stand on end and cause her to fall away from concentration of mind addressed her with this verseThen the bhikkhunii Vajiraa thought Who is this human or nonhuman being who speaks this verse And then she thought It is Maara the evil one desiring to cause me fear and consternation to make my hair stand on end and cause me to fall away from concentration of mind So the bhikkhunii Vajiraa realizing that it was Maara the evil one replied to him in verseAnd Maara the evil one thinking The bhikkhunii Vajiraa recognizes me vanished away grieved and dejectedFormerly bhikkhus when Sakka Lord of the devas was a human being he undertook to practice unremittingly seven rules of conduct by reason of which he attained his position of honorWhat sevenAs long as I live may I support my mother and fatherAs long as I live may I respect the elders of my familyAs long as I live may I speak kindly and gentlyAs long as I live may I not speak maliciouslyAs long as I live may I dwell in my house with my mind free from the taint of selfishness generous openhanded pleased to relinquish accessible to entreaties enjoying giving and sharing with othersAs long as I live may I speak truthfullyAs long as I live may I control my anger and if anger arises in me may I quickly dispel itThe Lord said Bhikkhus I will teach you Dependent Arising listen attend carefully and I will speakYes Sir those bhikkhus replied to the LordThe Lord said Now what bhikkhus is Dependent ArisingWith ignorance as condition bhikkhus volitional activities come to be with volitional activities as condition consciousness comes to be with consciousness as condition mindandbody come to be with mindandbody as condition the sixfold sensefield comes to be with the sixfold sensefield as condition contact comes to be with contact as condition feeling comes to be with feeling as condition craving comes to be with craving as condition grasping comes to be with grasping as condition becoming comes to be with becoming as condition birth comes to be with birth as condition aging and death sorrow lamentation pain grief and despair come to beThat is how there is an origin to this whole mass of sufferingAnd this bhikkhus is called Dependent ArisingBut from the complete disappearance and cessation of ignorance volitional activities cease from the cessation of volitional activities consciousness ceases from the cessation of consciousness mindandbody ceases from the cessation of mindandbody the sixfold sensefield ceases from the cessation of the sixfold sensefield contact ceases from the cessation of contact feeling ceases from the cessation of feeling craving ceases from the cessation of craving grasping ceases from the cessation of grasping becoming ceases from the cessation of becoming birth ceases from the cessation of birth aginganddeath sorrow lamentation pain grief and despair ceaseThat is how there is a ceasing of this whole mass of sufferingNow what bhikkhus is aginganddeathThat which for these and those beings in this and that group of beings is aging becoming old decayedness graying of the hair wrinkling of the skin drawing to an end of the lifespan failing of the sensefaculties this is called agingThat which for these and those beings in this and that group of beings is passing away breaking up disappearance mortality and dying making an end the separation of the aggregates the casting away of the body this is called deathThis is aging and this is death and these bhikkhus are called aginganddeathAnd what bhikkhus is birthThat which for these and those beings in this and that group of beings is birth being born conception reproduction the appearing of the aggregates the acquiring of the bases this bhikkhus is called birthAnd what bhikkhus is becomingThere are these three becomings sensuous becoming form becoming and formless becomingThis bhikkhus is called becomingAnd what bhikkhus is graspingThere are these four grasping grasping at sense objects grasping at views grasping at rituals and observances and grasping at a soultheoryThis bhikkhus is called graspingAnd what bhikkhus is cravingThere are these six groups of craving craving for visible objects sounds scents tastes tangible objects and objects of mindThis bhikkhus is called cravingAnd what bhikkhus is feelingThere are these six groups of feeling born of eyecontact and mindcontact earcontact nosecontact tonguecontact bodilycontact

mindThese bhikkhus are called volitional activitiesAnd what bhikkhus is ignoranceWhatever is absence of knowledge into suffering the origin of suffering the cessation of suffering and the way leading to cessation of sufferingThis bhikkhus is called ignoranceI will teach you dependent arising bhikkhus and phenomena that are dependently arisenNow what bhikkhus is Dependent ArisingWith birth as condition aginganddeath comes to beWhether Tathaagatas appear or do not appear this nature of things continues this relatedness of phenomena this regularity of phenomena this law of conditionalityA Tathaagata fully awakens and penetrates to itHaving fully awakened and penetrated to it he announces it teaches it makes it known presents it discloses it analyzes it and explains itSee he says with birth as condition aginganddeath comes to beWith becoming as condition birth comes to be Whether Tathaagatas appear or do not appearSee he says With ignorance as condition volitional activities come to beSo bhikkhus that which herein is a reality and not an unreality and not otherwise this law of conditionality  this bhikkhus is called Dependent ArisingNow what bhikkhus are dependently arisen phenomenaAginganddeath bhikkhus is impermanent conditioned dependently arisen of a nature to decay to pass away to be destroyed and to ceaseBirth becoming grasping ignorance bhikkhus is impermanent conditioned dependently arisen of a nature to decay to pass away to be destroyed and to ceaseThese bhikkhus are called dependently arisen phenomenaWhen a noble disciple has well seen this dependent arising and those dependently arisen phenomena according to actuality with perfect wisdom it does not occur to him that he should run back to the past saying Did I exist in the past Did I not exist in the past What was I in the past What was I like in the past Having been what what did I become in the pastNor that he should run ahead to the future saying Shall I exist in the future Shall I not exist in the future What shall I be in the future What shall I be like in the future Being what what shall I become in the futureNor that he should now in the present have doubts within himself saying Am I Am I not What am I What am I like This being where did it come from where will it go toWhat is the reasonIt is because the noble disciple has well seen this dependent arising and these dependently arisen phenomena according to actuality with perfect wisdomBhikkhus when it is raining heavily on a mountaintop the water flowing down the slope fills the mountain grottos clefts and gullies these being filled the small hollows are filled these being filled the lakes are filled these being filled the streams are filled these being filled the large rivers are filled these being filled the great sea the ocean is filledSimilarly bhikkhus ignorance is the condition for volitional activities volitional activities are the condition for consciousness consciousness is the condition for mindandbody mindandbody is the condition for the sixfold sensefield the sixfold sensefield is the condition for contact contact is the condition for feeling feeling is the condition for craving craving is the condition for grasping grasping is the condition for becoming becoming is the condition for birth birth is the condition for suffering suffering is the condition for faith faith is the condition for gladness gladness is the condition for joy joy is the condition for tranquility tranquility is the condition for bliss bliss is the condition for concentration concentration is the condition for knowledge and clearseeing according to actuality knowledge and clearseeing according to actuality is the condition for disenchantment disenchantment is the condition for detachment detachment is the condition for liberation and liberation is the condition for knowledge of exhaustionBhikkhus I will teach you the seventyseven sources of knowledge Now what bhikkhus are the seventysevenThe knowledge that aginganddeath is conditioned by birth the knowledge that there being no birth there is no aginganddeath the knowledge that in the past aginganddeath was conditioned by birth the knowledge that had there been no birth there would have been no aginganddeath the knowledge that in the future aginganddeath will be conditioned by birth the knowledge that if there is no birth there will be no aginganddeath the knowledge that whatever there is of knowledge concerning the relatedness of phenomena this is also of a nature to decay to pass away to be destroyed and to ceaseAn uninstructed ordinary person bhikkhus might well be dispassionate towards this body made of the four great elements might well detach himself and be released from itFor what reasonIt is seen how this body grows and decays is taken up and laid asideTherefore an uninstructed ordinary person might well be dispassionate toward it might well detach himself and be released from itBut this bhikkhus which is called mind is called thought is called consciousness  towards this an uninstructed ordinary person is not able to be dispassionate is not able to be detached and releasedWhat is the reasonFor a long time this has been that with which he identifies himself to which he has been attached and has held on to thinking This is mine I am this This is myself Therefore an uninstructed ordinary person is not able to be dispassionate towards it to be detached and released from itIt would be better bhikkhus if an uninstructed ordinary person regarded this body made of the four great elements as himself rather than the mindFor what reasonThis body is seen to continue for a year for two years five years ten years twenty years fifty years a hundred years and even moreBut of that which is called mind is called thought is called consciousness one moment arises as another ceases continually both day and nightJust as a monkey wandering in a big forest seizes a branch and letting go of it seizes another similarly bhikkhus of that which is called mind is called thought is called consciousness one moment arises as another ceases continually both day and nightNow as to this bhikkhus the instructed noble disciple gives well reasoned attention to the dependent arising thus this being that is from the arising of this that arises this not being that is not from the ceasing of this that ceasesThat is to say with ignorance as condition volitional activities come to be with volitional activities as condition consciousness comes to be That is how there is an origin of this whole mass of sufferingBut from the complete disappearance and cessation of ignorance volitional activities cease That is how there is the ceasing of this whole mass of sufferingSo seeing bhikkhus the instructed noble disciple is dispassionate towards body feeling perception mental activities and consciousnessBeing dispassionate he detaches himself being detached he is released and in release is the knowledge of being released and he knows Finished is birth lived is the holy life done is what had to be done there is no more of this or that stateBhikkhus it is just as if a person wandering through the jungle the great forest should see an ancient path an ancient road traveled along by men of former timesAnd as if he should go along it and going along it should see an ancient town an ancient royal city inhabited by men of former times having parks groves ponds and walls  a delightful placeAnd then that person should inform the King or the Kings chief minister saying My lord you should know that when wandering through the jungle the great forest I saw an ancient path an ancient road traveled along by men of former timesI went along it and saw an ancient town an ancient royal city inhabited by men of former times having parks groves ponds and walls  a delightful placeSire rebuild that city And then the king or the kings chief minister were to rebuild that city so that in time it became rich prosperous and well populated expanded and developedSo also bhikkhus have I seen an ancient path an ancient road traveled along by fully Enlightened Ones of former timesAnd what bhikkhus is that ancient path that ancient road traveled along by fully Enlightened Ones of former timesIt is just this Noble Eightfold Path that is to say right view right thought right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness and right concentrationThis is that ancient path that ancient road traveled along by fully Enlightened Ones of former times and going along it I came to know aginganddeath I came to know the origin of aginganddeath I came to know the cessation of aginganddeath I came to know the way leading to cessation of aginganddeathGoing along it I came to know birth becoming grasping craving I came to know volitional activities I came to know the origin of volitional activities I came to know the cessation of volitional activities I came to know the line of conduct leading to cessation of volitional activitiesHaving understood it I have taught it to the bhikkhus the bhikkhuniis the male and female layfollowers so that this holy life has become rich prosperous and widespread known to many widely known and announced by devas and menThus have I heardAt one time the Lord was staying near Saavatthii at the Jeta Grove in Anaathapindikas monasteryThen the Lord taking up a little dust on the tip of his nail said What do you think bhikkhus which is greaterThis little dust on the tip of my nail or the great earthThis great earth is surely greater sirCompared with it the little dust on the tip of the Lords nail is insignificant it does not amount to a hundredth part a thousandth part a hundred thousandth part set beside the great earthEven so bhikkhus for a noble disciple who has view for a person possessing realization this is the greater suffering that which is completely finished and exhaustedInsignificant is what is left over set beside the former heap of suffering that is completely finished and exhausted it does not amount to a hundredth part a thousandth part a hundred thousandth part  seven times at the mostSo great a gain bhikkhus is realization of the Dhamma so great a gain is to it to obtain DhammavisionIt is through having likequalities bhikkhus that beings associate and meet togetherBeings of inferior disposition associate and meet with beings of inferior dispositionBeings of virtuous disposition associate and meet with beings of virtuous dispositionIt was so in the past it will be so in the future and it is so nowJust as a stick thrown up into the air sometimes falls on its butt sometimes on its side and sometimes on its tip similarly bhikkhus do beings obstructed by ignorance and fettered by craving migrate and go the round of birthsAt one time going from this world to another world and at another time coming from another world to this worldWhat is the reasonUnimaginable bhikkhus is a beginning to the round of birthsFor beings obstructed by ignorance and fettered by craving migrating and going the round of births a starting point is not evidentThus for a long time bhikkhus have you experienced suffering pain and destruction and the cemeteries have grownLong enough for you to have become dispassionate towards all conditioned things long enough for you to have become detached and released from themUnimaginable bhikkhus is a beginning to the round of birthsFor beings obstructed by ignorance and fettered by craving migrating and going the round of births a starting point is not evidentIt is not easy bhikkhus to find a being who has not formerly been ones mother been ones father ones brother sister son daughter during this long long timeTherefore Kassapa you should train yourself thus Keen shame and dread should be present among elders new bhikkhus and those of middlestandingWhatever Dhammateaching I should hear bearing upon what is skillful and good I will listen to all of it with interest and attention and with concentrated mind give ear to itMindfulness of the body giving ease and comfort should not be forsaken by meThus should you train yourself KassapaDisastrous bhikkhus are gain honor and fame a bitter severe danger to the attainment of unsurpassed security from bondageTherefore bhikkhus you should train yourselves thusWhen gain honor and fame have arisen we will renounce them and will not let them establish a hold over our heartsJust as the beams of a house with a peakedroof all go to the peak meet at the peak are joined at the peak similarly bhikkhus whatever unskilled bad states there are are all rooted in ignorance meet in ignorance are conjoined with ignoranceTherefore bhikkhus you should train yourselves thus We will live diligentlyJust as whatever families having many women and few men are easily plundered by robbers and thieves similarly bhikkhus a bhikkhu who has not developed and often practiced liberation of the heart by love is easily attacked by nonhuman beingsJust as whatever families having few women and many men are difficult to plunder by robbers and thieves similarly bhikkhus a bhikkhu who has developed and often practiced liberation of the heart by love is not easily attacked by nonhuman beingsTherefore bhikkhus I say you should train yourselves thusWe will develop the liberation of the heart by love will often practice it make a habit of it an objective of it will establish it and make a thorough effort to become well acquainted with itFormerly bhikkhus the Dasaarahas had a summoningdrumAs the drum began to split the Dasaarahas inserted one peg and then another peg until in time the summoningdrums old drumhead had disappeared and only a framework of pegs remainedEven so bhikkhus will the bhikkhus become in the futureAnd those discourses spoken by the Tathaagata profound in meaning transcendental dealing with voidness to these they will not listen when they are recited they will not lend an ear they will not set the heart upon final knowledge and will not consider that those things should be learned and masteredBut those discourses made by poets poetry mere beautiful words and phrases spoken by outsiders and disciples to these they will listen they will consider that these things should be learned and masteredTherefore bhikkhus I say you should train yourselves thusThose discourses spoken by the Tathaagata profound in meaning transcendental dealing with voidness to these we will listen when they are recited we will lend an ear we will set the heart upon final knowledge and we will consider that these things should be learned and masteredThe Venerable Saariputta said When friends I had gone into seclusion this thought arose in my mind Is there anything in the world a change and alteration in which would cause sorrow lamentation suffering grief and despair to arise in me And then friends I thought Nothere is nothing Thereupon the Venerable AAnanda said But a change and alteration in the Teacher friend SaariputtaWould not that cause sorrow lamentation suffering grief and despair to ariseEven a change and alteration in the Teacher friend AAnanda would not cause sorrow to arise in meNevertheless I would think in this manner May the Teacher so influential of so great supernormal potency and power not departIf the Lord were to stay for a long time it would surely be for the welfare and happiness of many people out of compassion for the world for the good welfare and happiness of devas and men Certainly for a long time Iness mineness and the underlying tendency to conceit have been thoroughly eradicated from the venerable Saariputta in as much as even a change and alteration in the Teacher would not cause sorrow lamentation suffering grief and despair to arise In the Venerable SaariputtaThus have I heardAt one time the Lord was staying near Saavatthii and there he addressed the bhikkhus as followsDevelop concentration bhikkhus a bhikkhu who is concentrated understands according to actualityAnd what does he understand according to actualityThe origin and extinction of body the origin and extinction of feeling the origin and extinction of perception the origin and extinction of mental activities the origin and extinction of consciousnessThe body bhikkhus is impermanentWhat is impermanent that is sufferingWhat is suffering that is notselfWhat is notself This is not mine I am not this This is not myself in this manner it should be seen according to actuality with perfect wisdomFeeling is impermanent Perception Mental activities Consciousness is impermanentWhat is impermanent that is sufferingWhat is suffering that is notselfWhat is notself should be considered This is not mine I am not this This is not myself in this manner it should be seen according to actuality with perfect wisdomThe body bhikkhus is impermanentThat which is the cause that which is the condition for the appearing of body that is also impermanentHow could the body produced by what is impermanent ever be permanentFeeling is impermanent Perception Mental activities Consciousness is impermanentThat which is the cause that which is the condition for the appearing of consciousness that is also impermanentHow could consciousness produced by what is impermanent ever be permanentSo seeing bhikkhus the instructed noble disciple is dispassionate towards the body dispassionate towards feeling dispassionate towards perception dispassionate towards mental activities dispassionate towards consciousnessBeing dispassionate he detaches himself being detached he is released and in release is the knowledge of being released and he knows finished is birth lived is the holy life done is what had to be done there is no more of this or that stateBhikkhus I will teach you the things which should be fully understood and what is full understandingNow what bhikkhus are the things which should be fully understoodThe body is a thing which should be fully understoodFeeling Perception Mental activities Consciousness is a thing which should be fully understoodAnd what bhikkhus is full understandingThe extinction of greed aversion and delusionBefore my Enlightenment bhikkhus when I was not completely enlightened when I was a Bodhisatta I thought What is the satisfaction and misery in regard to the body and the release from itWhat is the satisfaction and misery in regard to feeling perception mental activities consciousness and the release from themAnd then bhikkhus this occurred to me Whatever happiness and pleasure arises dependent upon the body this is the satisfaction of the bodyWhatever there is of impermanence suffering and changeability in the body this is the misery of the bodyWhatever there is of being rid of desire and attachment the abandoning of desire and attachment in regard to the body this is the release from the bodyWhatever happiness and pleasure arises dependent upon feeling perception mental activities consciousness this is the satisfaction of consciousnessWhatever there is of impermanence suffering and changeability in consciousness this is the misery of consciousnessWhatever there is of being rid of desire and attachment the abandoning of desire and attachment in regard to consciousness this is the release from consciousnessAs long bhikkhus as I did not know satisfaction as satisfaction misery as misery and release from the five aggregates of grasping as release from them according to actuality so long did I not acknowledge that in the world with its devas maaras and braahmas with its recluses and braahmanas and mankind with its princes and men I was completely enlightened with unequaled and perfect enlightenmentBut when bhikkhus I knew satisfaction as satisfaction misery as misery and release from the five aggregates of grasping as release from them according to actuality  I then acknowledged thatI was completely enlightened with unequaled and perfect EnlightenmentAnd the knowledge and vision arose in me Unshakable is my liberation of the heart this is the final birth there is now no further becomingAt one time the Lord was staying near Saavatthii and said What is not yours bhikkhus renounce itRenouncing it will be to your good to your happinessAnd what bhikkhus is not yoursThe body bhikkhus is not yours Feeling Perception Mental activities Consciousness bhikkhus is not yours renounce itRenouncing it will be to your good to your happinessIt is as if a person were to carry away burn or do as he pleased with the grass twigs branches and foliage in this Jeta GroveWould it occur to you to say The person is carrying us away is burning us is doing as he pleases with usCertainly not SirFor what reasonBecause Lord this is not ourselves nor what belongs to ourselvesSo also bhikkhus the body is not yours renounce itRenouncing it will be to your good to your happinessFeeling is not yours Perception is not yours Mental activities are not yours Consciousness is not yours renounce itRenouncing it will be to your good to your happinessA Tathaagata bhikkhus being a Perfected One is fully enlightenedBecause of dispassion for the body detachment from the body cessation of the body he is called liberated without grasping fully enlightened And a bhikkhu liberated by wisdom because of dispassion for the body detachment from the body cessation of the body is called liberated without grasping liberated by wisdomA Tathaagata being a Perfected One is fully enlightenedBecause of dispassion for feeling perception mental activities consciousness He is called liberated without grasping fully enlightened And a bhikkhu liberated by wisdom because of dispassion for feeling consciousness is called liberated without grasping liberated by wisdom Now bhikkhus what is the distinction what is the divergence what is the difference between a Tathaagata a Perfected One a Fully Enlightened One and a bhikkhu liberated by wisdomFor us Sir such things originate from the Lord we have the Lord as our guide the Lord as our resortIt would indeed be good Sir if the Lord were to explain the meaning of this utteranceHaving heard the Lord the bhikkhus would then remember itThen listen bhikkhus attend carefully and I will speakYes Sir those bhikkhus replied to the LordThe Lord said A Tathaagata bhikkhus a Perfected One a fully Enlightened One makes manifest an unmanifest path he recognizes an unrecognized path he proclaims an unproclaimed path he is the knower of the path the discoverer of the path is skilled in the pathAnd now bhikkhus his disciples coming afterwards live following the pathNow the Venerable Raadha approached the LordHaving approached and prostrated himself he sat down to one sideAs he was sitting there the venerable Raadha said to the LordHow can we know Sir how can we see that in this consciousnessendowed body and externally among all outer objects there is no Iness no mineness no underlying tendency to conceitWhatsoever body feeling perception mental activities consciousness Raadha past future or present internal or external gross or subtle inferior or superior far or near is looked upon as This is not mine I am not this This is not myself  in this manner it is seen according to actuality with perfect wisdomThus knowing thus seeing in this consciousnessendowed body and externally among all outer objects there is no Iness no mineness no underlying tendency to conceitThen the venerable Raadha living alone secluded diligent ardent and resolute soon realized here and now through his own direct knowledge that unequaled quest of the holy life for which sons of good family rightly go forth from home to the homeless state and entering into it abide in itAnd he knew finished is birth lived is the holy life done is what had to be done there is no more of this or that stateAnd the venerable Raadha became one of the Perfect OnesThose recluses or braahmanas bhikkhus who remember a number of former lives they all remember one or another of these five aggregates of graspingIn the past I had this sort of body thus remembering it is just body he remembersIn the past I had this sort of feeling thus remembering it is just feeling he remembersIn the past I had this sort of perception thus remembering it is just perception he remembersIn the past I had this sort of mental activity thus remembering it is just mental activity he remembersIn the past I had this sort of consciousness thus remembering it is just consciousness he remembersAnd why bhikkhus do you say bodyIt is afflicted bhikkhus therefore it is called bodyAfflicted by whatAfflicted by cold and heat hunger and thirst afflicted by coming into contact with gnats mosquitoes wind sun and snakesIt is afflicted bhikkhus therefore it is called bodyAnd why bhikkhus do you say feelingIt is felt bhikkhus therefore it is called feelingWhat is feltPleasure is felt pain is felt neutral feeling is feltIt is felt bhikkhus therefore it is called feelingAnd why bhikkhus do you say perceptionIt is perceived bhikkhus therefore it is called perceptionWhat is perceivedBlue is perceived yellow is perceived red is perceived white is perceivedIt is perceived bhikkhus therefore it is called perceptionAnd why bhikkhus do you say mental activitiesThey activate that which is formed and conditioned bhikkhus therefore they are called mental activitiesWhat is the formed and conditioned that they activateThey activate body in its corporeal nature feeling in its nature of feeling perception in its perceptual nature mental activities in their activating nature consciousness in its cognitive natureThey activate that which is formed and conditioned bhikkhus therefore they are called mental activitiesAnd why bhikkhus do you say consciousnessIt cognizes bhikkhus therefore it is called consciousnessWhat does it cognizeIt cognizes sour and bitter acid and sweet alkaline and nonalkaline salty and nonsaltyIt cognizes bhikkhus therefore it is called consciousnessAs to this bhikkhus the instructed noble disciple reflects thus I am being consumed by the body nowJust as in the past I was consumed by the bodyAnd if in the future I should have an expectation of pleasure from the body so in the future would I be consumed by the body just as I am now in the present Thus reflecting he has no yearning for a past body he has no expectation of pleasure from a future body and towards the present body he cultivates dispassion detachment cessationWhat do you think bhikkhus is the body permanent or impermanentImpermanent SirWhat is impermanent is that dissatisfying or satisfyingDissatisfying SirWhat is impermanent dissatisfying of a nature to change is it suitable to regard as This is mine I am this This is myselfNo SirIs feeling perception mental activities consciousness permanent or impermanentImpermanent SirWhat is impermanent dissatisfying of a nature to change is it suitable to regard as This is mine I am this This is myselfNo SirTherefore bhikkhus I say whatsoever body feeling perception mental activities consciousness past future or present internal or external gross or subtle inferior or superior far or near should be looked upon as This is not mine I am not this This is not myself In this manner it should be seen according to actuality with perfect wisdomI do not dispute with the world bhikkhusThe world disputes with meA proclaimer of Dhamma does not dispute with anyone in the worldWhat is not believed by the wise in the world of that I say It is not so What is believed by the wise in the world of that I say It is soAnd what is it bhikkhus that is not believed by the wise in the world and of which I say It is not soThat the body feeling perception mental activities consciousness is permanent stable eternal not liable to change is not believed by the wise in the world and I also say it is not soAnd what is it bhikkhus that is believed by the wise in the world and of which I say It is soThat the body feeling perception mental activities consciousness is impermanent unsatisfactory liable to change is believed by the wise in the world and I also say it is soThere is bhikkhus in the world a worldcondition which the Tathaagata has fully awakened to has fully realizedHaving fully awakened to it and fully realized it he declares it teaches it makes it known establishes it discloses it analyzes it makes it clearAnd what bhikkhus in the world is the worldcondition which the Tathaagata has fully awakened to has fully realizedThe body bhikkhus feeling perception mental activities consciousness bhikkhus in the world is that worldcondition the Tathaagata has fully awakened to has fully realizedAnd whosoever bhikkhus when it is being declared taught made known established disclosed analyzed made clear by the Tathaagata thus does not understand does not see him a foolish worldly person blind without vision not understanding not seeing I can do nothing forJust as a waterlily or a blue lotus or a white lotus born in water growing in water having arisen above the water stands unwetted by the water similarly bhikkhus the Tathaagata brought up in the world and conquering the world lives unsullied by the worldAt one time the Lord was staying at Ayojjhaaya on the bank of the river GangesThere the Lord addressed the bhikkhus as follows Suppose bhikkhus a large lump of froth was floating on this river Ganges and a clearsighted man were to see it observe it and properly examine itSeeing it observing it properly examining it it would appear to him to be empty unsubstantial without essenceWhat essence bhikkhus could there be in a lump of frothIn the same way bhikkhus whatsoever body past future or present internal or external gross or subtle inferior or superior far or near that a bhikkhu sees observes and properly examines it would appear to him to be empty unsubstantial without essenceWhat essence bhikkhus could there be in bodySuppose bhikkhus in autumn when it is raining in large drops a bubble arises and disappears on the water and a clearsighted man were to see it observe it and properly examine itSeeing it observing it properly examining it it would appear to him to be empty unsubstantial without essenceWhat essence bhikkhus could there be in a waterbubbleIn the same way bhikkhus whatsoever feeling past future or present that a bhikkhus sees observes and properly examines it would appear to him to be empty unsubstantial without essenceWhat essence bhikkhus could there be in feelingSuppose bhikkhus in the last month of the hot season at midday a mirage appeared and a clearsighted man were to see it observe it and properly examine itSeeing it observing it properly examining it it would appear to him to be empty unsubstantial without essenceWhat essence bhikkhus could there be in a mirageIn the same way bhikkhus whatsoever perception that a bhikkhu sees observes and properly examines it would appear to him to be empty unsubstantial without essenceWhat essence bhikkhus could there be in perceptionSuppose bhikkhus a man needing sound timber going about seeking looking for sound limber and taking a sharp axe should enter a forest and there see a large plantain tree straighttrunked young of great heightAnd he were to cut it down at the rootHaving cut it down at the root he were to chop off the top and remove the outer skinOn removing the outer skin he would find no soft wood not to speak of sound timberThen a clearsighted man were to see it observe it and properly examine itSeeing it observing it properly examining it it would appear to him to be empty unsubstantial without essenceWhat essence bhikkhus could there be in a plantain treeIn the same way bhikkhus whatsoever mental activities a bhikkhu sees observes and properly examines they would appear to him to be empty unsubstantial without essenceWhat essence bhikkhus could there be in mental activitiesSuppose bhikkhus a magician or a magicians assistant should produce an illusion on the high road and a clearsighted man were to see it observe it and properly examine itSeeing it observing it properly examining it it would appear to him to be empty unsubstantial without essenceWhat essence bhikkhus could there be in a magical illusionIn the same way bhikkhus whatsoever consciousness a bhikkhu sees observes and properly examines it would appear to him to be empty unsubstantial without essenceWhat essence bhikkhus could there be in consciousnessSo seeing the instructed noble disciple is dispassionate towards the body towards feeling perception mental activities and consciousnessBeing dispassionate he detaches himself being detached he is released and in release is the knowledge of being released and he knows Finished is birth lived is the holy life done is what had to be done there is no more of this or that state So spoke the Lord and when he had so spoken the Happy One the Teacher added furtherUnimaginable bhikkhus is a beginning to the round of birthsFor beings obstructed by ignorance and fettered by craving migrating and going the round of births a starting point is not evidentJust as a dog bhikkhus tied with a leash to a strong stake or post if he moves he moves towards that stake or post if he stands still he stands close to that stake or post if he sits down he sits close to that stake or post if he lies down he lies close to that stake or postSimilarly bhikkhus the uninstructed ordinary person looks upon the body as This is mine I am this This is myself He looks upon feeling perception mental activities consciousness as This is mine I am this This is myself If he moves he moves towards these five aggregates of grasping if he stands still he stands close to these five aggregates of grasping if he sits down he sits close to these five aggregates of grasping if he lies down he lies close to these five aggregates of graspingHence bhikkhus I say one should constantly reflect upon ones own mind thus For a long time this mind has been corrupted by greed aversion and delusion Through a corrupt mind bhikkhus beings are corrupted from purity of mind beings become pureHave you seen bhikkhus an elaborate paintingYes SirNow that elaborate painting bhikkhus was devised by mindTherefore mind is even more intricate than that elaborate paintingHence bhikkhus I say one should constantly reflect upon ones own mind thus For a long time this mind has been corrupted by greed aversion and delusion Through a corrupt mind bhikkhus beings are corrupted from purity of mind beings become pureI perceive no other single group bhikkhus so diverse as the creatures of the animal worldThese creatures of the animal world are diversified by mindTherefore mind is even more diverse than the creatures of the animal worldHence bhikkhus I say a bhikkhu should constantly reflect upon his own mind thus For a long time this mind has been corrupted by greed aversion and delusion Through a corrupt mind bhikkhus beings are corrupted from purity of mind beings become pureJust as a dyer or a painter with dye or lac or turmeric or indigo or madder and a wellsmoothed wooden panel or wall or piece of cloth can reproduce the form of a woman or a man complete in every detail  similarly bhikkhus the uninstructed ordinary person brings body into existence too brings feeling perception mental activities brings consciousness into existence tooJust as a carpenter or a carpenters assistant sees on his adzehandle the marks made by his fingers and thumb but does not thereby have the knowledgeSo much of the adzehandle was worn away by me today so much yesterday so much at another time but merely has the knowledge that it is being worn away by its wearing awayIn the same way bhikkhus a bhikkhu living devoted to the practice of minddevelopment does not have the knowledge So much of the taints was worn away today so much yesterday so much at another time But he has the knowledge they are being worn away by their wearing awayJust as a seagoing boat stranded for six months on the shore by the tide in the winter has its rigging spoilt by wind and sun and then warped by a shower of rain in the rainy season easily weakens and rots away in the same way bhikkhus for a bhikkhu living devoted to the practice of minddevelopment the fetters easily weaken and rot awayThe perceiving of impermanence bhikkhus developed and frequently practiced removes all sensual passion removes all passion for material existence removes all passion for becoming removes all ignorance removes and abolishes all conceit of I amJust as in the autumn a farmer plowing with a large plow cuts through all a spreading rootlets as he plows in the same way bhikkhus the perceiving of impermanence developed and frequently practiced removes all sensual passion removes and abolishes all conceit of I amThe venerable Raadha said to the Lord A being a being one is calledIn what respect Sir is one called beingBecause of being caught and held fast by that desire that attachment that delight that craving for body for feeling for perception for mental activities for consciousness therefore one is called a beingJust as when little boys or girls are playing with mudpiesAs long as they are not rid of attachment to those mudpies are not rid of desire are not rid of affection thirst excitement and craving for them so long do they delight in them are amused by them value and cherish themBut when those little boys or girls are rid of attachment to those mudpies are rid of desire are rid of affection thirst excitement and craving for them then with hand and foot they scatter them destroy them demolish them stop playing with themIn the same way Raadha do you scatter body destroy it demolish it stop playing with it do you practice so as to end craving for itDo you scatter feeling perception mental activities consciousness destroy it demolish it stop playing with it do you practice so as to end craving for itIndeed Raadha the ending of craving is NibbaanaBhikkhus whatever there is of desire and attachment to body  that is a corruption of the mindWhatever there is of desire and attachment to feeling perception mental activities consciousness  that is a corruption of the mindBut when bhikkhus a bhikkhu has abandoned mental corruption with regard to these five his mind is inclined towards renunciationAnd a mind filled with renunciation is fit for realizing those things to be realized by direct knowledgeBhikkhus I will teach you the AllListen attend carefully to it and I will speakNow what bhikkhus is the AllIt is just the eye and visible objects the ear and sounds the nose and odors the tongue and tastes the body and tangible objects the mind and objects of mindThis bhikkhus is called the AllNow whoever should speak thus Setting aside this All I will proclaim another All it would be mere talk on his part and on being questioned he would be unable to proceed and in addition vexation will befall himFor what reasonIt would not be within his scope bhikkhusOnce a certain bhikkhu approached the LordHaving drawn near and prostrated himself he sat down to one sideSitting there that bhikkhu said to the LordHow knowing Sir how seeing is ignorance abandoned and understanding producedBy knowing and seeing the impermanence of the eye bhikkhus ignorance is abandoned and understanding is producedBy knowing and seeing the impermanence of visible objects visualconsciousness visualcontact And whatever arises conditioned by visualcontact felt as pleasant or painful or neutral  by knowing and seeing the impermanence of that also ignorance is abandoned and understanding is producedBy knowing and seeing the impermanence of the ear nose tongue body mind mindobjects mindconsciousness mindcontact And whatever arises conditioned by mindcontact felt as pleasant or painful or neutral  by knowing and seeing the impermanence of that also ignorance is abandoned and understanding is producedIt is by thus knowing and thus seeing bhikkhu that ignorance is abandoned and understanding is producedI will teach you the Dhamma bhikkhus for the full understanding of all graspingDependent upon the eye and visibleobjects visual consciousness arisesContact is the coming together these threeConditioned by contact is feelingSo seeing bhikkhus the instructed noble disciple is dispassionate towards the eye is dispassionate towards visibleobjects towards visualconsciousness visualcontact towards feelingBeing dispassionate he is detached being detached he is liberated being liberated he knows Grasping has been fully understood by meDependent upon the ear and sounds the nose and odors the tongue and tastes the body and tangible objectsDependent upon the mind and objects of mind mind consciousness arisesContact is the coming together of these threeConditioned by contact is feelingSo seeing bhikkhus the instructed noble disciple is dispassionate towards the mind towards mindobjects mindconsciousness mindcontact towards feelingBeing dispassionate he is detached being detached he is liberated being liberated he knows Grasping has been fully understood by meThis bhikkhus is the Dhamma for the full understanding of all graspingBhikkhus whatsoever bhikkhu does not know according to actuality the arising and passing away the satisfaction misery and release from the six bases of contact not lived by him is the holy life he is far from this Dhamma and DisciplineWhen this had been said a certain bhikkhu said to the LordAs to this Sir I am in despair for I Sir do not know according to actuality the arising and passing away the satisfaction misery and release from the six bases of contactWhat do you think bhikkhu do you look upon the eye as This is mine I am this This is myselfNo SirIt is good bhikkhuNow by the eye as This is not mine I am not this This is not myself it will be well understood by you according to actuality with perfect wisdomJust this is the end of sufferingDo you look upon the ear the nose the tongue the body the mind as This is mine I am this This is myselfNo SirIt is good bhikkhuJust this is the end of sufferingSitting at one side the venerable AAnanda said this to the LordThe world the world they say SirIn what sense Sir is it called the worldWhatever is of a nature to dissolve AAnanda this is called the world in the discipline of the NobleNow what is of a nature to dissolveThe eye AAnanda visibleobjects visualconsciousness visualcontactThe ear sounds mind mindcontact And whatever arises conditioned by mindcontact felt as pleasant or painful or neutral  that is of a nature to dissolveOnce the venerable Punna approached the Lord sat down to one side and saidIt would be good Sir were the Lord to teach me the Dhamma brieflyOn hearing that Dhamma from the Lord I might live alone secluded diligent ardent and resoluteThere are Punna visible objects cognized by the eye sounds cognized by the ear odors cognized by the nose flavors cognized by the tongue tangible objects cognized by the body mindobjects cognized by the mind pleasing agreeable charming endearing desirable arousing the passionsIf a bhikkhu delights in them welcomes them cleaves to them enjoyment arisesThe origin of enjoyment is the origin of suffering I say Punnabut if a bhikkhu does not delight in them does not welcome them does not cleave to them enjoyment ceasesThe cessation of enjoyment is the cessation of suffering I sayNow that you have been instructed by me Punna with this brief instruction in what country will you liveThere is Sir a country called Sunaaparanta I will live thereThe men of Sunaaparanta are violent and cruel PunnaIf they were to insult and abuse you how would it be with youIf Sir the men of Sunaaparanta were to insult and abuse me it would be thus with me Good are these men of Sunaaparanta very good are these men of Sunaaparanta in that they do not strike me with their hands It would be thus with me LordIt would be thus with me Happy OneBut if the men of Sunaaparanta were to strike you with their hands how would it be with you it would be thus with me Good are these men of Sunaaparanta very good are these men of Sunaaparanta in that they do not strike me with clods of earth But if the men of Sunaaparanta were to strike you with clods of earth how would it be with you it would be thus with me Good are these men of Sunaaparanta very good are these men of Sunaaparanta in that they do not strike me with a stick But if the men of Sunaaparanta were to strike you with a stick how would it be with you it would be thus with me Good are these men of Sunaaparanta very good are these men of Sunaaparanta in that they do not strike me with a weapon But if the men of Sunaaparanta were to deprive you of your life how would it be with you it would be thus with me There are disciples of the Lord who being vexed ashamed and disgusted with body and life seek a weapon but I come by a weapon that was unsought It would be thus with me LordIt would be thus with me Happy OneIt is good it is good PunnaBeing endowed with this selfmastery and composure you will be able to settle in the country of the Sunaaparanta peopleDo now Punna whatever you consider it the time forThen the venerable Punna pleased and appreciative of the Lords utterance arose from his seat prostrated himself before the Lord and keeping his right side towards him departedAnd having put away his bed and seat and taking his bowl and robe he set off for the country of SunaaparantaAnd walking journeying by stages the venerable Punna arrived in the country of Sunaaparanta and dwelt thereNow the venerable Punna during that rainy season brought in as many as five hundred lay followersDuring that rainy season he established himself in the three knowledgesAnd during that rainy season he attained final releaseThen a large number of bhikkhus approached the Lord and said The clansman Punna Sir who was instructed by the Lord with a brief instruction has diedWhat is his destinyWhat is his future stateA wise man bhikkhus was the clansman PunnaHe practiced according to Dhamma and did not trouble me with queries about DhammaThe clansman Punna bhikkhus has attained final releaseIt is a gain for you bhikkhus it is a great gain for you to have found the opportunity for living the holy lifeI have seen bhikkhus the hells called the six bases of contacts There whatever visible object one sees with the eye one sees only the unpleasant never the pleasant one sees only the disagreeable never the agreeable one sees only the unattractive never the attractiveWhatever sound one hears with the ear Whatever odor one smells with the nose Whatever flavor one tastes with the tongue Whatever tangible object one touches with the body Whatever mindobject one cognizes with the mind one cognizes only the unpleasant never the pleasant one cognizes only the disagreeable never the agreeable one cognizes the unattractive never the attractiveIt is a gain for you bhikkhus it is a great gain for you to have found the opportunity for living the holy lifeI have seen bhikkhus the heavens called the six bases of contact There whatever visible object one sees with the eye one sees only the pleasant never the unpleasant one sees only the agreeable never the disagreeable one sees only the attractive never the unattractiveWhatever sound one hears with the earWhatever mindobject one cognizes with the mind one only cognizes the pleasant never the unpleasant one cognizes only the agreeable never the disagreeable one cognizes only the attractive never the unattractiveIt is a gain for you bhikkhus it is a great gain for you to have found the opportunity for living the holy lifeThe ocean the ocean says the uninstructed ordinary person bhikkhusBut that is not the ocean in the Noble Ones DisciplineIt is a great mass of water a great extent of waterThere are bhikkhus visible objects cognizable by the eye sounds cognizable by the ear odors cognizable by the nose flavors cognizable by the tongue tangible objects cognizable by the body mindobjects cognizable by the mind pleasing agreeable charming endearing desirable arousing the passionsThis is called the ocean in the Noble Ones DisciplineHerein this world with its devas maaras brahmas with its recluses and braahmanas and mankind with its princes and ordinary men is almost entirely immersed is entangled like a ball of thread has become entangled like muñjagrass and rushes unable to go beyond a state of loss a bad destination ruination the round of birthsAt one time the Lord was staying near Saavatthi and there he addressed the bhikkhus sayingSuppose bhikkhus there were four poisonous snakes highly dangerous extremely venomousAnd a man were to come along wishing to live not wishing to die desiring happiness and loathing painAnd people were to say to him Here good man are four poisonous snakes highly dangerous extremely venomousFrom time to time they must be roused bathed fed and bedded downBut when one or the other of these four poisonous snakes becomes disturbed and angry then you will come by your death or suffering comparable to deathSo do whatever must be done good manThen suppose bhikkhus that man in terror of the four poisonous snakes might run away and people were to say to him Good man five murderers are following after you saying When we see him we shall kill him So do whatever must be done good manThen suppose bhikkhus that man in terror of the four poisonous snakes in terror of the five murderers might run away and people were to say to him Good man a sixth a murderous robber with an upraised sword is following after you saying When I see him I shall cut off his head So do whatever must be done good manThen suppose bhikkhus that man in terror of the four poisonous snakes in terror of the five murderers in terror of the sixth the murderous robber might run awayAnd he should see an empty villageWhatever house he enters he finds it bare void and emptyWhatever vessel he handles therein he finds it bare void and emptyThen people were to say to him Good man bandits who attack villages are going to attack this empty villageSo do whatever must be done good manThen suppose bhikkhus that man in terror of the four poisonous snakes in terror of the five murderers in terror of the sixth the murderous robber in terror of the villageattacking bandits might run awayAnd he should see a great stretch of water the near shore insecure and fearful the far shore secure and free from fear but no boat for crossing over nor a bridge for walking from one shore to the otherThen bhikkhus it might occur to that man Here is a great stretch of water but no boat nor a bridge What if I were to collect grass pieces of wood branches and leaves construct a raft and supported by it and laboring with hands and feet go safely to the other shoreCrossed over gone beyond the braahmana stands on dry groundThis is my simile bhikkhus for showing the meaningAnd this is its interpretationThe four poisonous snakes highly dangerous extremely venomous  this is a designation for the four great elements the elements of earth water fire and airThe five murderers  this is a designation for the five aggregates of grasping the bodyaggregate of grasping the feeling perception mental activities consciousnessaggregate of graspingThe sixth the murderous robber with an upraised sword  this is a designation for enjoyment and attachmentThe empty village  this is a designation for the six internal sensebasesFor if a wise learned and intelligent man examines the eye the ear the nose the tongue the body the mind it appears as void unsubstantial and emptyThe villageattacking bandits  this is a designation for the six external sensebasesFor the eye is attacked by attractive and repulsive visible objects the ear the nose the tongue the body the mind is attacked by attractive and repulsive mental objectsThe great stretch of water  this is a designation for the four floods sensual desire becoming views and ignoranceThe near shore insecure and fearful  this is a designation for the existencegroupThe far shore secure and free from fear  this is a designation for NibbaanaThe raft  this is a designation for the Noble Eightfold Path that is to say right view right thought right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness and right concentrationLaboring with hands and feet  this is a designation for strenuous effortCrossed over gone beyond the braahmana stands on dry ground  this is a designation for the Perfected OneAt one time the Lord was staying near Kosambii on the bank of the river GangesNow the Lord saw a large log of wood being carried along by the current of the river Ganges and on seeing it said to the bhikkhusBhikkhus do you see that large log of wood being carried along by the current of the river GangesYes SirIf that log of wood bhikkhus does not run aground on the near bank or the far bank does not sink in midstream is not caught on a sandbank is not seized by humans or nonhumans is not held in a whirlpool does not rot from within  then that log of wood will float down to the ocean will be led down to the ocean will tend towards the oceanSimilarly bhikkhus if you do not run aground on the near bank or the far bank if you do not sink in midstream if you are not caught on a sandbank if you are not seized by humans or nonhumans if you are not held in a whirlpool If you do not rot from within  then you will float down to Nibbaana you will be led down to Nibbaana you will tend towards NibbaanaWhat is the reasonRight view bhikkhus floats to Nibbaana leads to Nibbaana tends towards NibbaanaOn this being said a certain bhikkhu asked the Lord What Sir is the near bankWhat is the far bankWhat is sinking in midstreamWhat is being caught on a sandbankWhat is being seized by humansWhat is being seized by nonhumansWhat is being held in a whirlpoolWhat is rotting from withinThe near bank bhikkhu is a designation for the six internal sensebasesThe far bank is a designation for the six external sensebasesSinking in midstream is a designation for enjoyment and attachmentBeing caught on a sandbank is a designation for the I amconceit Now what is being seized by humansHerein a bhikkhu lives in close association with lay folkHe shares their joys and sorrowsHe is happy with those who are happy he suffers with those who sufferHe involves himself in all manner of business that goes onThis is called being seized by humansNow what is being seized by nonhumansHerein bhikkhu someone lives the holy life with the aspiration among a certain group of devasBy this virtuous conduct or observance or austerity or holy living may I become a deva or a certain kind of deva This is called being seized by nonhumansBeing held in a whirlpool is a designation for the fivefold sensual pleasuresNow what is rotting from withinHerein bhikkhus someone is immoral of an evil nature impure of dubious behavior of concealed deedsNot a recluse though pretending to be a recluse not one who lives the holy life though pretending to be one who does so rotten within full of desires a heap of impurityThis is called rotting from within Now at that time Nanda the cowherd was standing near the Lord and said I Sir have not run aground on the near bankI have not run aground on the far bank I shall not sink in midstream I shall not be caught on a sandbank neither humans nor nonhumans shall seize me I shall not be held in a whirlpool I shall not rot from withinSir may I obtain the going forth in the Lords presence may I obtain full ordinationNanda you must return the cattle to their ownersThey will go back by themselves Sir the cows are longing for their calvesDo return them NandaThen Nanda the cowherd having returned the cattle to their owners approached the Lord and said Sir the cattle are restoredMay I obtain Sir the going forth in the Lords presence may I obtain full ordinationAnd Nanda the cowherd obtained the going forth in the Lords presence obtained full ordinationAnd not long after his ordination the venerable Nanda living alone secluded diligent ardent and resolute soon realized here and now through his own direct knowledge that unequaled quest of the holy life And the venerable Nanda became one of the Perfected OnesLet us suppose bhikkhus that there is a king or a kings chief minister who has never heard the sound of a luteThen on hearing the sound for the first time he says Good man what is that sound so exciting so beautiful so intoxicating so entrancing so captivatingAnd they say to him It is the sound Sire of what is called a luteThereupon he says Go and bring me that luteThey bring it to him saying This Sire is that lute the sound of which is so exciting so captivatingBut he rejoins Away with the lute my manJust bring me that soundThen they say to him This which is called a lute Sire is made of various parts a great number of partsIt is because of its various parts that it makes a sound that is to say owing to the belly sounding board arm head strings plectrum and the effort of a mans fingersThe king or the kings chief minister then breaks up the lute into ten or a hundred piecesHaving broken it up he splinters it further burns it in a fire and reduces it to ashesHaving reduced it to ashes he winnows the ashes in a strong wind or lets them be borne away on the swift current of a riverAnd he says A poor thing is this that you call a lute my man whatever the socalled lute may bePeople have been infatuated and led astray by it for too longJust in this way bhikkhus a bhikkhu investigates body as far as body goes he investigates feeling perception mental activities consciousness as far as consciousness goesSo investigating whatever there may be there is for him no I or mine or I am in itThe uninstructed ordinary person bhikkhus has a saying There is a bottomless abyss in the great ocean But the uninstructed ordinary person speaks of what does not exist of what is not to be found to wit that there is a bottomless abyss in the great oceanA designation for painful bodily feeling bhikkhus is this term bottomless abyss When an uninstructed ordinary person experiences painful bodily feeling he grieves is afflicted laments beats his breast cries out loud and becomes distraughtSo it is said bhikkhus the uninstructed ordinary person has not emerged from the bottomless abyss has not obtained a firm footholdBut bhikkhus when an instructed noble disciple experiences painful bodily feeling he does not grieve is not afflicted does not lament nor beat his breast nor cry out loud nor become distraughtSo it is said bhikkhus the instructed noble disciple has emerged from the bottomless abyss and has obtained a firm footholdAt one time the venerable Saariputta was dwelling in Magadha at the village of NaalakaThere the wandering ascetic Jambukhaadaka approached the venerable Saariputta and exchanged friendly greetings with himAfter exchanging greetings and reminiscences he sat down to one sideHaving sat down the wandering ascetic Jambukhaadaka said this to the venerable SaariputtaNibbaana Nibbaana It is called friend SaariputtaBut what friend is NibbaanaThe ending of greed aversion and delusion friend is called NibbaanaBut is there a path is there a line of conduct for the realization of this NibbaanaThere is a path there is a line of conduct friend for the realization of this NibbaanaWhat is the path what is the line of conductIt is just this Noble Eightfold Path that is to say right view right thought right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness and right concentration It is a good path friend a good line of conduct for the realization of this Nibbaana and a sufficient reason for being diligentThus have I heardAt one time the Lord was staying amongst the Sakyas at the Sakya market town of SakkaraThen the venerable AAnanda approached the Lord prostrated himself and sat down to one sideSitting there the venerable AAnanda said to the LordHalf of this holy life Lord is friendship with the good companionship with the good association with the goodDo not say that AAnandaDo not say that AAnandaIt is the whole of this holy life this friendship companionship and association with the goodOf a bhikkhu AAnanda who is a friend companion and associate of the good it is to be expected that he will cultivate and seriously practice the Noble Eightfold PathAnd how AAnanda does a bhikkhu cultivate and seriously practice the Noble Eightfold PathHerein AAnanda a bhikkhu cultivates right view centered on detachment centered on dispassion centered on cessation ending in relinquishmentHe cultivates right thought speech action livelihood effort mindfulness right concentration centered on detachment centered on dispassion centered on cessation ending in relinquishmentIn this manner AAnanda a bhikkhu who is a friend companion associate of the good cultivates and seriously practices the Noble Eightfold PathIt is in this manner AAnanda it should be understood how the whole of this holy life is friendship companionship and association with the goodBy taking me as a good friend beings liable to birth are released from birth beings liable to old age are released from old age beings liable to death are released from death beings liable to sorrow lamentation suffering grief and despair are released there fromIn this manner AAnanda it should be understood how the whole of this holy life is friendship with the good companionship with the good association with the goodSaavatthi was the placeI will teach you bhikkhus the Noble Eightfold Path and analyze itListen attend carefully and I will speakYes Sir those bhikkhus replied to the LordThe Lord said What bhikkhus is the Noble Eightfold PathIt is right view and so forthNow what bhikkhus is right viewWhatever is knowledge of suffering the origin of suffering the cessation of suffering and the way leading to cessation of sufferingThis bhikkhus is called right viewNow what bhikkhus is right thoughtWhatever is a thought of renunciation a thought

bhikkhus is called right actionNow what bhikkhus is right livelihoodHerein bhikkhus the noble disciple having given up a wrong livelihood lives his life by means of a right livelihoodThis bhikkhus is called right livelihoodNow what bhikkhus is right effortHerein bhikkhus a bhikkhu generates desire strives stirs up energy exerts his mind and struggles to prevent the arising of evil unskilled states that have not arisenHe generates desire and strives to be rid of evil unskilled states that have arisenHe generates desire and strives to establish and not lose for the further cultivation abundance development and perfection of skilled states that have arisenThis bhikkhus is called right effortNow what bhikkhus is right mindfulnessHerein bhikkhus a bhikkhu lives practicing bodycontemplation on the body ardent clearly comprehending and mindful having overcome covetousness and grief concerning the worldHe lives practicing feelingcontemplation on feelings mindcontemplation on mind mindobjectcontemplation on the objects of mind ardent clearly comprehending and mindful having overcome covetousness and grief concerning the worldThis bhikkhus is called right mindfulnessNow what bhikkhus is right concentrationHerein bhikkhus a bhikkhu secluded from unskilled things dwells having entered the first absorption accompanied by thinking and investigation born of detachment and joy and blissAfter the subsiding of thinking and investigation and by gaining inner serenity and unification of mind he dwells having entered the second absorption which is without thinking and investigation is born of concentration and joy and blissAfter the fading away of joy he dwells in equanimity mindful and clearly comprehending and experiences in his person a bliss of which the Noble Ones say He who has equanimity and is mindful lives blissfully and he dwells having entered the third absorptionAfter the abandoning of pleasure and pain and the disappearance of former happiness and grief he dwells having entered the fourth absorption which is without pleasure and pain and is purified by equanimity and mindfulnessThis bhikkhus is called right concentrationBhikkhus whatsoever bhikkhus possess moral virtue possess concentration possess wisdom possess liberation possess the knowledge and insight of liberation  the seeing of those bhikkhus is of great profit I sayTo hear about those bhikkhus to approach those bhikkhus to associate with those bhikkhus to remember those bhikkhus to imitate those bhikkhus in going forth is of great profit I sayFor what reasonOn hearing

benefits are certainWhat seven fruits what seven benefitsOne attains final knowledge here and now prior if one does not attain final knowledge here and now prior then one attains it at the time of death if one does not attain final knowledge here and now nor at the time of death then by the destruction of the five lower fetters one attains final deliverance early if one does not attain final

Nerañjara beneath the Goatherds Banyan Tree having just attained full EnlightenmentWhile thus alone and secluded this thought arose in the Lords mindThis is the sole way for the purification of beings for the surmounting of sorrow and lamentation for the disappearing of suffering and grief for reaching the right path for realizing Nibbaana namely the four foundations of mindfulnessWhat are the

comprehending and mindful having overcome covetousness and grief concerning the worldThis is the sole way namely the four foundations of mindfulnessThen Brahma Sahampati being aware by his mind of the thought in the Lords mind just as a strong man might stretch his bent arm or bend his stretched arm so did he disappear from the Brahma world and appear in front of the LordAnd arranging his upper robe over one shoulder he bowed down before the Lord with folded hands and saidSo it is LordSo it is Happy OneThis is the sole way for the purification of beings namely the four foundations of mindfulnessSo spoke Brahma SahampatiAnd after these words he further saidBhikkhus a bhikkhu should live mindful and clearly comprehendingThis is our instruction to youAnd how is a bhikkhu mindfulHerein bhikkhus a bhikkhu lives practicing bodycontemplation on the body feeling feelingcontemplation on feelings mindcontemplation on mind mindobjectcontemplation on the objects of mind ardent

feelings are known to a bhikkhu as they arise known as they stay known as they come to an endThoughts are known as they arise known as they stay known as they come to an endPerceptions are known as

bhikkhus is the faculty of faithHerein bhikkhus the noble disciple has faithHe has faith in the Enlightenment of the Tathaagata thus The Lord is such since he is Arahant fully Enlightened perfect in understanding and conduct sublime knower of the worlds unsurpassed leader of men to be tamed the Teacher of devas and men enlightened the Lord This bhikkhus is called the faculty of faithNow what bhikkhus is the faculty of energyHerein bhikkhus the noble disciple lives with energy aroused for getting rid of unskilled states and perfecting skilled states strenuous and energetic not giving up

the venerable Anuruddha and saidVery clear and bright are your faculties friend AnuruddhaQuite pure and cleansed are your featuresIn what state does the venerable Anuruddha mostly dwell nowI mostly dwell now friend with the mind well established in the four foundations of mindfulnessWhat fourI live practicing bodycontemplation on the body feeling mind mindobjectcontemplation on the objects of

mindfulnessWhatever bhikkhu friend is an Arahant has finished with the taints reached fulfillment done what had to be done laid aside the burden attained his objective completely finished with the fetter of becoming and is released through perfect knowledge he mostly dwells with a mind well established in the four foundations of mindfulnessIt is indeed a gain for us friendIt is indeed a great gain for us friend that in the presence of the venerable Anuruddha we have heard him utter this impressive speechBhikkhus even though a Wheelturning King has absolute lordship and sovereignty over the four continents and when the body breaks up at death he arises in a good bourne the heaven world in companionship with the devas of the Heaven of the Thirtythree and there in the Nandana Grove surrounded by a group of celestial nymphs he roams about possessing and enjoying the fivefold heavenly sensepleasures  even so there are four things he does not haveAnd thus he is not completely freed from Niraya hell the animal womb the realm of ghosts a state of loss an evil bourne a state of ruinEven though a noble disciple bhikkhus keeps himself alive with scraps of food and wears castoff rags  yet there are four things that he has and is thus completely freed from Niraya hell the animal womb the realm of ghosts a state of loss an evil bourne a state of ruinWhat are the four things he hasThe noble disciple bhikkhus through experience has confidence in the Enlightened One thus The Lord is such since he is an Arahant fully enlightened perfect in understanding and conduct sublime knower of the worlds unsurpassed leader of men to be tamed the Teacher of devas and men enlightened the LordThrough experience he bas confidence in the Dhamma thus Well taught is the Dhamma by the Lord visible

disciples has progressed by the good way the community of the Lords disciples has progressed by the straight way the community of the Lords disciples has progressed by the true way the community of the Lords disciples has progressed by the proper way that is to say the four pairs of men the eight types of personsThis community of the Lords disciples is worthy of adoration is worthy of hospitality is worthy of gifts is worthy of reverential salutation as an unsurpassed field of merit for the worldHe has the virtues pleasing to the Noble Ones unbroken untorn unblotched unmottled liberating commended by the perceptive not misapprehended conducive to concentrationThese are the four things he hasThere is the possession of the four continents bhikkhus and there is the possession of these four thingsBut the possession of the four continents is not worth a sixteenth of the possession of these four thingsBhikkhus those for whom you have compassion those who think you worth listening to  whether friends acquaintances kinsmen or relatives  they should be encouraged in introduced to and established in the four factors of streamentryWhat are the fourThey should be encouraged in introduced to and established in confidence in the Enlightened One the Dhamma the Community in the virtues pleasing to the Noble Ones unbroken untorn unblotched unmottled liberating commended by the perceptive not misapprehended conducive to concentrationThose for whom you have compassion those who think you worth listening to  whether friends acquaintances kinsmen or relatives  they should be encouraged in introduced to and established in these four factors of streamentryThere are bhikkhus these four Noble TruthsWhat fourThe Noble Truth of suffering the Noble Truth of the origin of suffering the Noble Truth of the cessation of suffering and the Noble Truth of the way leading to cessation of sufferingNow what bhikkhus is the Noble Truth of sufferingIt may be said to be the five aggregates of grasping namely the bodyaggregate of grasping the feelingaggregate of grasping the perceptionaggregate of grasping the mental activitiesaggregate of grasping the consciousnessaggregate of graspingThis bhikkhus is called the Noble Truth of sufferingNow what bhikkhus is the Noble Truth of the origin of sufferingIt is that craving leading to becoming along with enjoyment and attachment finding enjoyment now here now there namely sensual craving the craving for becoming the craving for nonbecomingThis bhikkhus is called the Noble Truth of the origin of sufferingNow what bhikkhus is the Noble Truth of the cessation of sufferingIt is the complete fading away and cessation of this very craving the abandoning and rejecting of it liberation and detachment from itThis bhikkhus is called the Noble Truth of the cessation of sufferingNow what bhikkhus is the Noble Truth of the way to cessation of sufferingIt is just this Noble Eightfold Path that is to say right view right thought right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness and right concentrationThis bhikkhus is called the Noble Truth of the way to cessation of sufferingThese bhikkhus are the four Noble TruthsTherefore bhikkhus to realize This is suffering an effort must be madeTo realize This is the origin of suffering an effort must be madeTo realize This is the cessation of suffering an effort must be madeTo realize This is the way leading to cessation of suffering an effort must be madeSuppose bhikkhus a man whose lifespan is a hundred years who would live a hundred years and they were to say to him Come good man in the morning they will strike you with a hundred spears and again at midday and in the eveningNow good man you whose lifespan is a hundred years who will live a hundred years being struck daily with three hundred spears at the end of the hundred years will penetrate the four Noble Truth not penetrated beforeEven if it were to happen like that a son of good family bhikkhus influenced by what is of value might well undergoFor what reasonUnimaginable bhikkhus is the beginning to the round of birthsA starting point is not evident of blows by spears swords and axesBut O monks I do not say that the penetration of the four Noble Truths is accompanied by suffering and grief but it is accompanied by pleasure and happiness I say Therefore bhikkhus to realize This is suffering an effort must be made To realize This is the way to cessation of suffering an effort must be madeBhikkhus as long as moon and sun do not arise in the world so long is there no manifestation of a great light of great brightnessThere is then blinding darkness a total darknessThere is no discerning of night and day the months and halfmonths nor the seasons and the yearsBut when moon and sun arise in the world then there is a manifestation of a great light of great brightnessThere is then no blinding darkness no total darknessThen night and day are discerned the months and halfmonths and the seasons and the yearsSimilarity bhikkhus as long as a Tathaagata a Perfected One a fully Enlightened One does not arise in the world so long is there no manifestation of a great light of great brightnessThere is then a blinding darkness a total darknessThere is no declaring teaching making known establishing disclosing analyzing making clear of the four Noble TruthsBut when a Tathaagata a Perfected One a fully Enlightened One arises in the world then there is a manifestation of a great light of great brightnessThere is then no blinding darkness no total darknessThere is then a declaring a teaching a making clear of the four Noble TruthsTherefore bhikkhus to realize This is suffering an effort must be made To realize This is the way leading to cessation of suffering an effort must be madeTraditionally the twelve factors are regarded as spread over the three periods of time or past present and future lives and fall into groups as being active or causative and passive or resultantThere are two past active factors ignorance and volitional activities giving rise to their results in this life consciousness mindand body the sixfold sensefield contact and feelingCraving grasping and becoming are the present causative factors with their results in a future life represented by birth and aginganddeath etcSee Dependent Origination by Piyadassi TheraFurthermoreAll are enumerated fully in Majjhima Nikaaya suttaA person who has eliminated these five fetters is called an anaagaamii a neverreturnerAfter death he does not come back again to this world but is born in one of the five Pure Abodes of the realm of form and there realizes final deliveranceThe last five of these seven fruits refer to the five grades of anaagaamii in descending order the highest is one who attains final deliverance early down to the one going upstreamThe Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creedsFounded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topicsIts publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddhas discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practiceThese works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first aroseI will now explain this verse so that you can practice in a way leading to the supreme attainment capable of eliminating all your suffering and fears reaching the refuge of peaceWe come into this world without a substantial refugeNothing  aside from the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha  will follow us into the next lifeThese three are the only things in which we can take refuge both in this life and in lives to comeThere are two levels on which people take refuge in the Triple GemSome take refuge only allegorically on the level of individuals whereas others take refuge on the level of inner qualities by developing the steps of the practice within themselvesABuddhaBuddhas are people who have attained purity of heartThere are four typesPrivate Buddhas those who have gained Awakening without establishing a religionOn attaining the goal they live by themselvesDisciple Buddhas a Buddhas immediate disciples  male or female  who have practiced in line with the teachings of a Buddha until they too have gained AwakeningLearned Buddhas those who have studied the teachings in detail have followed them and have attained the goalAll four of these types are individual people so to take refuge in them is to take refuge on the level of individualsThey can give us refuge only in a shallow and not very substantial wayEven though taking refuge on this level can be advantageous to us it helps us only on the level of the world and can give only temporary protection against falling into the realms of deprivationIf we lose faith in these individuals our mind can change to a lower level  for all individuals fall under the laws of all fabricated things They are inconstant and changing subject to stress and notself  ie they cant prevent their own deathSo if you go to a Buddha as refuge on the level of individuals there are only two sorts of results youll get at first gladness and then sadness when the time comes to part  for its the nature of all individuals in the world that they arise age grow ill and dieThe wisest sages and the most ordinary people are all equal on this pointBDhammaFor many of us the teachings in which we take our refuge are also on the level of individualsWhy is thatBecause we see them as the words of individual peopleSages of the past have divided the teachings in the Buddhist Canon into four typesSayings of his disciplesSayings of heavenly beingsThere were occasions when heavenly beings on coming to pay respect to the Buddha said truths worth taking to heartSayings of seersSome hermits and yogis uttered truths from which Buddhists can benefitAll of these sayings were organized into the three parts of the Buddhist Canon the discourses the discipline and the AbhidhammaIf we take refuge in the Dhamma on this level it is simply an object something we can rememberBut memory is inconstant and cant provide us with a safe dependable refugeAt best it can help us only on the worldly level because we are depending allegorically on individuals on objects as our refugeSanghaThere are two sorts of SanghaThe conventional Sangha ordinary people who have ordained and taken up the homeless lifeThis sort of Sangha is composed of four sorts of peoplebUpadusika those who on being ordained in Buddhism destroy the Buddhas teachings through their behavior  not abandoning the things they should abandon not doing the things they should do damaging their own capacity for good and that of others being destructive falling away from the Buddhas teachingscUpamuyhika those who on being ordained in Buddhism make themselves blind and ignorant who dont look for tactics for bringing their behavior into line with the Buddhas teachingsThey dont pull themselves out of their unskillful ways and stay continually deluded oblivious and defileddUpanisaranika those who on being ordained in Buddhism are intent on studying and practicing in line with what they have learned who try to find themselves a secure refuge and who dont let themselves become heedless or complacentWhatever evil the Buddha said to abandon they try to abandonWhatever good he said to develop they try to developWhether or not they attain that goodness they keep on tryingAll four of these count as one type of Sangha on the level of individualsThe Noble SanghaThis has four levels those who have practiced the Buddhas teachings until they have reached the attainments of streamentry oncereturning nonreturning or arahantshipAll four of these are still on the level of individuals because they are individual people who have reached the transcendent attainments in their heartsSuppose for example we say that Aññakondañña is a streamwinner Sariputta a oncereturner Moggallana a nonreturner and Ananda an arahantAll four of them are still individuals in name and bodyTo take refuge in them is to take refuge on the level of individuals  and as individuals they are inconstant and unstableTheir bodies sense faculties and mental phenomena by nature have to age grow ill and dieIn other words they are anicca inconstant and changeable dukkha subject to stress and suffering and anatta They themselves cant prevent the nature of conditioned phenomena from taking its course with themThis being the case then when anyone tries to take refuge in them that refuge is inconstantWe can depend on them only for a while but they cant provide us any true refugeThey cant keep us from falling into the realms of deprivationAt best taking refuge in them can give us results on the worldly level  and the worldly level is changing with every momentThis ends the discussion of the Triple Refuge on the level of individualsTaking refuge in the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha on the level of inner qualities means reaching the Triple Gem with the heart through the practiceTo reach the Buddha on the level of inner qualities you first have to know the virtues of the Buddha which are of two sorts causes and resultsThe causes of his Awakening are mindfulness and alertnessThe result of his Awakening is the transcendent the stilling of all defilements and mental fermentationsSo we have to develop these qualities within ourselvesBuddhasati  mindfulness like the Buddhas  is what wakes us upFull alertness is what makes us correctly aware of cause and effectThe way to develop these qualities is to practice in line with the four frames of referenceThis will enable us to reach the Buddha on the level of inner qualitiesAContemplation of the body as a frame of referenceThis means being firmly mindful of the body using mindfulness to wake up the body and mind both by day and by night  sitting standing walking lying downWe use mindfulness and alertness to be fully conscious throughout the bodyThis is the cause for reaching the Buddha on the level of inner qualities  ie reaching the Buddha by oneself and within oneself without having to depend on anyone elseWhen you depend on yourself thats when youre on the right trackBefore focusing mindfulness on the body so as to wake yourself up you first have to know that there are two ways of looking at the bodyThe body in and of itself  ie any one aspect of any of these four propertiesFor example we can take the wind propertyFocus your mindfulness and alertness on nothing but the wind property and keep them thereYou dont have to get involved with any of the other propertiesThis is called the body in and of itselfFrom there you can go to wind in and of itselfThere are six aspects to the wind property the breath energy flowing down from the head to the spaces between the fingers and toes the breath energy flowing from the spaces between the fingers and toes up to the top of the head the breath forces in the stomach the breath forces in the intestines and the inandout breathThese six aspects make up the wind property in the bodyWhen you focus on wind in and of itself be mindful to keep track of only one of these aspects at a time  such as the inandout breath  without worrying about any other aspects of the breath energyThis can be called focusing on wind in itselfThe same principle applies to earth in and of itself water in and of itself and fire in and of itselfWhen you have mindfulness and alertness constantly established in the body the body in and of itself wind fire earth or water in and of itself  whichever seems easiest and most comfortable  keep with it as much as possibleWhen you do this the body will wake up for you arent letting it simply follow its natural courseTo bring mindfulness into the body helps keep it awakeThe body will feel lighter and lighter as we keep it in mindAlertness is what enables us to be aware throughout the bodyWhen these two mental qualities enter into the body the body will feel agile pliant and lightIn Pali this is called kayalahutaThe mind will also be awake and will give rise to knowledge in and of itself through its own sanditthiko practice  ie the person who does the practice will see the results for him or herself in the here and nowPeople who awaken from their slumbers are able to see things and know themThe same holds true for people who practice mindfulness immersed in the body as a frame of reference They are bound to see the true nature of their own bodiesTo penetrate in knowing and seeing in this way is to reach the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha  which differ only in name but are one and the same in their essenceWhoever doesnt practice in this way is asleep both in body and mindA person asleep cant see or know anything at all which is why we can say that people of this sort have yet to reach the Buddha on the level of the inner qualitiesBContemplation of feelings as a frame of referenceBe mindful of feelings as they arise within youFeelings are results that come from your own past and present actionsThere are three sortsTo practice contemplation of feelings be mindful of each of the various kinds of feeling that occur in the body and mindFor instance sometimes theres physical pleasure but mental distress sometimes physical pain but mental pleasure sometimes pleasure both in body and mind and sometimes pain both in body and mindSo focus in on being mindful of feelings as they ariseExamine them closelyThis is called contemplation of feelingsAs for feelings in and of themselves this means focusing on one type of feelingFor instance wherever theres pleasure focus right there solely on the pleasureYou dont have to get involved with feelings of pain or equanimityIf youre going to focus on pleasure keep focused right thereOr if you want you can focus on equanimity without getting involved with pleasure or painDont let the mind jump around in such a way that any other preoccupations come in and interfereKeep monitoring the feeling youve chosen until you know its true nature through your own awarenessWhichever type of feeling is easiest for you to focus on keep your mindfulness and alertness right there as much as you canThis is what will enable you to awaken from the feelings within youWhoever does this ranks as having developed the inner quality of buddha that is the cause for coming awakeContemplation of the mind as a frame of referenceBe mindful of the state of your own mind so that you can awaken it from the slumber of its delusionsWhen your mind awakens it will be able to see and know the various things occurring in the presentThis will enable it to become firmly centered in the factors of concentration and jhana or mental absorption which in turn lead to discernment skilled awareness and releaseThere are three basic states of mind you can focus onAversion The mind at times gets irritated and angry causing whatever internal goodness it has to deteriorateAversion is thus a way in which the mind destroys itselfDelusion absentmindedness forgetfulness mental darkness misunderstandingThese states of mind arise from preoccupations concerning what we like and dislikeIf you have mindfulness watching over your mind with every moment it will enable the mind to awaken and blossom to know the truth about itselfWhenever passion arises in the mind focus on being mindful of the mind in and of itselfDont focus on the object of the passionPay attention solely to the present and the passion will fadeOr if you want you can use other methods to help by contemplating the object of the passion in certain waysFor example you can contemplate the unattractiveness of the body focusing first on the insides of your own body seeing them as filthy and disgustingYour mind which has been attached will then be able to free itself from the passion in which it is immersed and to become more blooming and brightWhenever aversion arises in the mind focus on being mindful exclusively of the present state of your mindDont focus attention on the external object or person that gave rise to the anger and aversionAnger in the mind is like a burning fireIf you arent mindful and alert to the state of your own mind and instead think only of the object or person that incited the anger its like setting yourself on fireAll you can do is end up getting burntSo you shouldnt preoccupy yourself with the outside objectInstead focus on being mindful and aware of the state of aversion in the mindWhen mindfulness reaches full strength the state of aversion will immediately disbandAversion and anger are like a cover over a fire that lets the fire keep smoldering away providing heat but no lightIf we remove the cover by doing away with the aversion the light of the fire can brighten the mindThe light here is discernment and skilled awarenessActually theres nowhere else that we have to look for goodness other than our own mindsThats how well be able to gain the freedom from suffering and stress that is termed cittavimutti mental release ie a mind beyond the reach of its preoccupationsThis is one way in which we reach the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha on the level of inner qualitiesAs for states of delusion in which the mind tends to be absentminded and forgetful These come from there being many objects crowding in on the mindWhen we find this happening we should center the mind on a single preoccupation where we can gather strength for our mindfulness and alertness in the same way that we can take diffused light rays and focus them on a single pointThe power of the light is sure to get brighterIn the same way when we are constantly mindful of the mind and dont let it get involved with various outside perceptions and preoccupations mindfulness will give rise to a powerful light skilled awarenessWhen skilled awareness arises within us our minds will grow shining bright and well awaken from our slumber of unawarenessWe will have attained a quality of secure refuge in our own heartsWell know for ourselves and see for ourselves and this is what will enable us to attain the noble qualities of the transcendentDMental qualities as a frame of referenceBe mindful to focus on the mental qualities that occur in the mind with every momentMental qualities are of two basic sorts good and badBad mental qualities which obstruct the mind from attaining higher levels of goodness are called the Hindrances and there are five sortsaSensual desire hankering after sensual objects  sights sounds smells tastes tactile sensations and ideas that you like and find appealing and a hankering after sensual moods such as passion anger aversion and delusion  assuming good to be bad and bad to be good right to be wrong and wrong to be rightA hankering for any of these things is classed as sensual desirebMalevolence ill will for people or objects hoping that they will be destroyed or come to a bad endcSloth  drowsiness sleepiness torpor lassitude laziness and depressiondRestlessness  anxiety being upset at failure in your aims lacking the mindfulness to put a brake on your worries and concernseUncertainty indecision doubt about the various things or qualities your are working to develop in your practiceThese five Hindrances are bad mental qualitiesIf you fall into any of them youre in the dark  like a person at the bottom of a well who cant see anything on the surface of the earth cant move around as he likes cant hear what people at the top of the well are saying cant see the light of the sun and moon that illumine the earthIn the same way the Hindrances obstruct us from developing goodness in many many waysThey close off our ears and eyes keep us in the dark put us to sleepThis is why we should work at developing the good mental qualities that will awaken us from the slumber of our unawarenessFor instance we should develop the four levels of jhana or mental absorption which are the tools for suppressing or eliminating all of the HindrancesaThe first jhana has five factorsDirected thought Think about any one of the objects of meditation that exist within you such as the inandout breathMake the mind one keep it with the object you are thinking of and dont let it slip off to anything else This is called singleness of preoccupationEvaluation Carefully observe the object of your meditation until you see its truthWhen you are thoroughly aware of the object  this is called alertness  the results will arise within you pleasure or ease and rapture  fullness of body and mindWhen mindfulness fills the body like this the body feels saturated like soil saturated with moisture Whatever you plant stays green and freshPlants flourishBirds and other forest animals come to live in their shadeWhen rain falls the soil can hold it instead of letting it wash awayA person who has mastered the first jhana is like a holdingplace of goodness for other human and celestial beings because jhana and concentration can have a cooling influence not only on oneself but also on others as wellWhen mindfulness and alertness are stay focused on your mind the mind feels saturated and full with an unadulterated sense of rapture and joy at all timesAs for the pleasure and ease that come from the first jhana they give you a sense of freedom with no worries or concerns for anyone or anything  like a person who has attained enough wealth that he no longer has any worries or concerns about his livelihood and so can relax in peaceWhen you attain the pleasure and ease that come from the first jhana you are freed from the Hindrances of indecision and restlessness  anxietySo you should work at developing these factors in your mind until it can stay steadily in jhanaYour heart will then be blooming and bright giving rise to the light of discernment or liberating insightAnd if you have developed your capabilities enough then on attaining the first jhana you may gain entry to the transcendentSome people though may go on to the second jhanabThe second jhana has three factors rapture pleasure and singleness of preoccupationThe power of the mind gets stronger step by step so try to keep your mind in that state simply by focusing down and keeping mindfulness firmly established right thereThe mind will grow even stronger and this will lead you on to the third jhanacThe third jhana has two factors pleasure and singleness of preoccupationKeep focusing down through the power of mindfulness and alertness and you will be able to shed the factor of pleasure and enter the fourth jhanadThe fourth jhana has two factors equanimity and singleness of preoccupationOn this level of jhana the mind has great strength based on its strong focus accompanied by mindfulness and alertnessThe mind is firm and unmoving  so completely unmoved by past and future that it lets them both goIt keeps track solely of the present steady and unwavering like the light of a Coleman lantern when theres no windWhen the mind attains the fourth jhana it gives rise to a brightness discernment and the skill of liberating insightThis is what enables it to gain understanding into the four Noble Truths and so to proceed to the transcendent  the truly safe refugePeople who have done this experience nothing but an inner brightness and happiness in their hearts for they dwell with the quality they have given rise to within themselvesThey reach the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha on the highest level the level of release or ultimate attainment a quality free from defilement and mental fermentationsPeople who train their hearts in this way have reached the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha on the level of inner qualityIn other words they have reached refuge in their own heartsThey have absolutely closed off the route to the realms of deprivationAt the very least they are destined after death to go to the higher realms of happinessAt best they will attain nibbanaAll of them are certain to attain nibbana within at least seven lifetimes for they have reached an inner quality thats steady and certainThey wont fall into anything lowAnyone who has yet to attain this quality though has an uncertain futureSo if we want the peace and security that the Buddhas teachings has to offer we should all try to find ourselves a dependable refugeIf you take refuge on the allegorical level the level of individuals find people of worth so that your conviction in them will take you to the happy realmsAs for refuge on the level of inner qualities which will really be of substantial value to you practice so as to give rise to those qualities within yourselfTo summarize On the level of inner qualities the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha are all one and the same thingThey differ only in nameSo you should opanayiko  bring these qualities into your heartSanditthiko  When you practice youll see them for yourselfPaccattam  Youll know them only for yourselfThings that other people know about arent safeIf you want peace and refuge that are substantial and sure you should give rise to them in your own heartThe result will be nibbana liberation from defilement from all birth aging illness and death in this world and any world to comeThis is buddha on the level of results freedom from sleep total AwakeningAnd this ends our discussion of the verse on refugeWhen I was separated from my little one his father and the old mahout it was the end of the world for meFor days and months I had gone about in a dazeBut that experience I have related in a previous storyNow I would like to tell you about the peacockThe peacock was kept in a cage in the temple premisesI never could understand why the monk allowed him to be caged up like thatThe whole day long he used to pace back and forth back and forth unceasingly inside his cageWhen this gorgeous creature let out his mournful cry which resounded through the air I recognized the call all too wellThe note of pain grief lamentation and despair in the cry was unmistakableI realized he was suffering from the pain of separation  from his mate perhaps his kith and kin his familiar haunts in the jungle and furthermore he was experiencing extreme frustration at being locked up in a cageI walked up close to the cage and observed the marvelous colors of his bodyHe was a majestic specimenHe stood still posing feeling my admiring gaze on himAt that moment I knew he was not feeling any grief or lonelinessHe was finding selfaffirmation in my admiring gaze no doubtI lost myself in the sheer beauty of his form complexity of design and colorHe held his arched neck in a stately fashion its head proudly poised with its dainty coronetFrom the top of his head down over his neck to his breast and undercarriage he wore like a coat of mail an eyeshattering resplendent blueThen came a bold pattern of black and white on its wing feathers ending in a band of buff edgingOn the nape of his neck where the blue ended there was a scarf as it were of ornate embroidery in greens and goldsI had never seen anything like it before not even the richest of caparisons I and my companions wore in the Esala Perahera could compare with thisAnd the whole of his body had a wet glistening gold sheen to itThe fine quills of his green tail feathers with their eyes seemed aquiver as though just dipped in liquid goldAs I contemplated this ornate bird this mythical vehicle of a Hindu god my admiration slowly gave way to sadnessMy little ones father too had been a lordly majestic specimen but old age sickness and death had overtaken him in the endThe peacock was in the prime of his life but if I were able to telescope time into a few minutes duration I would see the change taking place in him very clearly revealed before me as though I were watching a filmThe change in us takes place in such slow motion that we do not notice it from moment to momentOnce an arctic tern told me that when he looked down from way up high at the great wide ocean beneath him he saw no motion at allOnly a frozen sheet of blue with gashes of white swirls all over like a still from a filmThat did not mean there was no motion in what he sawSo perhaps we do not see the constant flux in us and all around us but it is there all the sameThough the peacocks carriage was haughty his lackluster eyes betrayed his wretchednessI longed to comfort himBut what comforting words could I give himFriend I said finally trying hard to swallow down the lump that had got stuck in my throat We must count ourselves fortunate to be in the peaceful precincts of this templeThe peacock jerked his neck around and focused on me with angry red eyesYou call me fortunate he asked Do you speak in jestI have been sentenced for life in this hideous iron cage and you call me fortunateWhat wrong have I done to deserve this punishmentWe are all prisoners of our karma  up to a certain point I saidListen to the monk when he preaches to devotees on a fullmoon dayI have learned such lessons from his sermonsListening to sermons will not unlock the door of this prison will itIt will unlock other doors  the doors of your mindThe mind is free to roam anywhere at willBy disciplining it you can attain the highest bliss inside this cageMake out of your penance a unique opportunity to free your mindFree my mind the peacock let out a hollow croakYesDiscipline your mindStart today itself and see if it does not bring you peace and freedom from sufferingHow does one discipline ones mindI was about to teach him the technique of the inandout breathing meditation when the tortoise spoke upI had not seen him among the tall grass and weeds by the cageYou are talking about being imprisoned in a cage he said but what about my carapace that I carry around with me wherever I goBut that is your protection not your prison the peacock countered pecking away at the iron rails and sometimes trying desperately to grip one rail in between his beak and to pull it outExactlyI do not look upon it as a burden or prison but my protectionLike Kapuri here I have learned to listen to the words of the DhammaWe are blessed to live in these grounds as she says where we can hear the words of the Dhamma and live within sight of the Sangha who are protectors and teachers of the BuddhawordLike Kapuri I meditate tooI can reach far beyond the confines of my carapaceThe minds potentialities are infiniteAnd what do you meditate on the peacock asked with idle curiosityOn my thoughtsI watch each thought as it arises and passes awayI place a guard at the gateway of my mind and I challenge each and every thought as it comes peruse its identity card check the contents of its accompanying baggage and prevent it entry if it is unwholesomeNow I have become so adept at this exercise that I can even forestall unwholesome thoughts before they show their faces at the gateHavent you heard the words of the Tibetan yogi Milarepa Let no perverted thought find entry in your mindThen when wholesome thoughts come and I have checked their credentials I let them in and even encourage them to bring their friendsIn that manner do I pass the time of dayAnd you dont get boredI used to at the beginning when I was a novice at the practice of mental disciplineNot only bored I used to have all sorts of unruly thoughts barging through the gatewayThere would be a veritable clamor and scrimmage at the entrance and then an onrush of chaosThoughts of hate desire worries anxieties and even sloth and torpor would manage to slip in surreptitiously and also doubt and skepticism all trying their best to destroy my concentrationSuch impeding thoughts are common to us allBut as I progressed with my meditations my mindfulness became sharper and more alert in recognizing them stalling them or chasing them awayThey now only strengthen my will to persevereYou are luckier than us I said for you have a carapace which shields you from the external worldWe are exposed and vulnerable and are being continually bombarded by senseimpressionsThis makes the work of our meditations so much more difficultHow can I meditate the peacock asked irritablyIm all the time thinking of home  my little corner of the jungle grassland which was my kingdom He sighed deeplyThere I roamed at will with my dear ones roosting in the low woodapple trees scratching for grub under scrub jungleI was a king among the fraternity of jungle birdsEven the beasts of the jungle respected meHow sweet were conversations with them allEven when the rowdy monkeys came bounding from tree to tree and saw me they would pause to exchange a few words of polite chatterPleasant was the speech of jungle friends to my earsPleasant was it under the shade of the trees and sweet the taste of fruits and the waters of clear cool meandering streams in the grasslandsThat whole kingdom is now lost to meA whole world did I lose when I was ensnared by a twolegged hunterMoan not and do not think with bitterness of the twolegged hunterHe was your karma I saidI know exactly how you must feel for I too lost a whole worldHowever I practice very diligently the exercises set for meditation which is the only way out of pain grief lamentation and despairYour little corner of the jungle the tortoise said is not safe from the destructive powers of the elements earthquakes cyclones fires and manNeither are youYou yourself fell victim to mans cunningYou know the jungle teems with wild wily beasts of carnivorous bent from whom even you and your dear ones are not safeYou say the sweetest taste you ever want is the taste of jungle fruits and the water of the jungle streamsBut where is that world nowThere is no security in the external world because nothing is free from changeThe world of sense cannot offer a safe refuge to anyoneYou take our advice and start disciplining your mind from today I said and gave him a lesson on mindfulness of breathing and the meditation on lovingkindnessHaving given the instructions we left himOn the following day when I went to see how the peacock was I found him in a very depressed state of mindThe tortoise was already there trying to console himBut is there any harm in hoping the peacock asked tremulously as soon as he saw meHoping for whatHoping that I may escape this prison one day and return to my corner of the jungleHoping that some day in the future I may be able to join my loved onesIt is this hope that is preventing me from languishing away inside this cageDear friend do not languish away with vain hoping I said gentlyDo not knock your head against a stone wallLet that stone wall turn into vistas along which your mind can travel to real freedomThe peacock suddenly sat on the floor of the cage in a heap of feathers like a rebellious childAm I to end my days then in this miserable cage he cried out shrillyKapuri you are wise and talk like an oracleDo please read my futureWhat does it holdWill I never go back home and see my dear onesI could see that the peacock had begun to panicFear was written all over his quivering harried faceNo one can see the future I said for the future is as yet unchartedYou can work out your deliverance by making fresh wholesome karmaSeek your refuge in that karmaTortoise sir you look like a sage the peacock turned to him beseechingly Surely you can read my futureThe tortoise came up close to the cage then peering at the peacock whispered softly and soothinglyThere is hope  much hope to be had in your own effortsSeek your refuge in disciplineStrive hardBe braveIf you will excuse me I will go back to my meditations now the tortoise added but I shall come again to see you laterThank you sir Im most grateful to youAfter the tortoise went away I remained with the peacockHe looked desperate still and had begun to shiverSlowly I thrust my trunk through the gap between the rails and stroked him gentlyYou are shivering I told himDo you know why you are shiveringThe peacock shook his headIts because you are afraidYou are frightened of losing that socalled world of security  your loved ones familiar haunts and friendsI went through the same experience when the little one was taken away from me and before that when his father left me and later when my old mahout died I fell silent recalling those grim days when I alternated between panic anguish fear and despair which filled my legs with disquietI remembered how restless I was so restless that I was unable to stay still even for a minuteI swayed to and fro while I was tethered to a coconut tree in the temple premises just as the peacock paced back and forth in his cageTo and fro to and fro I swayed swaying my head and trunk as well and lifting my feet one after the other in a tormented unceasing motionThen I remembered how I used to stand stricken with fear my hide and my legs visibly shaking uncontrollablyOnce when this happened my young mahout noticed me shivering and rubbed my body all over and covered me with a heavy cloth thinking I had caught a chillBut the cloth was not necessaryThe moment his hand touched my body I felt a warmth coursing through meThere was no magic in his touch eitherIt was my instantaneous response to that physical contact of concernReflecting on the instantaneous warmth that coursed through my body when the mahout touched me and how the kindly feelings of gratitude surged through me ousting grief I had begun to see how quickly feelings arise and pass awayAll feelings are mere phenomena the monk had said in a sermonWe are but a continual arising and a passing away of physical and mental phenomena conditioned by a host of physical and mental phenomena and conditioning more physical and mental phenomena to ariseThe monk had described this life process as corporeality consisting of the four elements of earth water heat and air together with the mental factors of feeling perception mental formations and consciousness all fleeting phenomena and nothing abiding in them  no selfOur mind rooted in ignorance tries to attach a subject to these fleeting phenomena which are as insubstantial as foamReflecting on that experience of warmth that coursed through my body and how the kindly feelings of gratitude ousted grief I realized how good it was to cultivate and augment these thoughts of gratitude lovingkindness compassion and joyThat was a sure way of dispelling grief and losing ones socalled selfThen I remembered how in those days when I was estranged from thoughts of lovingkindness and sunk in my grief my chest used to hurt as if a dagger had been plunged into itSometimes it used to burn as though in flamesSo did my head beneath the scalp as if it was exposed to the raw airThe monk had said in a sermon once that we are all burning like a fire all the timeThe sense organ of sight  the eye  when it comes into contact with its senseobject starts up a conflagration in our minds he had saidSo also the other senses when they come into contact with their respective senseobjectsThe resulting process of physical and mental phenomena is like a raging fireDid you have nightmares the peacocks question cut across my thoughts bringing me up sharply to the presentOf courseThey were frightful images thrown up by fear  my little one looking lost and forlorn weeping for me or tearfully asking me why I had let him goThen deathYes I dreamt of death tooNot as something peaceful or as a release from suffering but something that evoked in me a dreadful fear of the deep dark unknownThese nightmares came to me in symbols but nevertheless they struck chords of doom in meSo how did you overcome fearWell even while groveling in the depths of abysmal despair when the ground underneath my feet seemed to be sliding away the words of the Blessed One would percolate through to my consciousness as I recalled the monk intoning passages from the Banner ProtectionTell me the Banner Protection the peacock beggedHe was still shiveringSo I began to chant it and the peacock settled down to listenOnce when the Buddha was residing near Savatthi at Jetavana at the monastery of Anathapindika he addressed the monks And I chanted on but the peacock began to doze offWhen I finished I found that the peacock had truly fallen asleepSo I quietly left himA few days later when my mahout led me into the temple premises after bathing me in the river following a hard days work at a dam site the tortoise told me that the peacock wanted to see meThe tortoise had been teaching him the inandout breathing meditation and the meditation on lovingkindness again but the peacock was not making much progress with them so it seemedWe went together to see himHow do you feel today I asked him cheerfullyA little better he said but tell me did repeating the Banner Protection really help you to get rid of fearYes when the full meaning of the words sank into my mind repeating the protection helped me a great dealYou see you must have faith in the BuddhaDhammaNot blind faith but faith resulting from having tested the validity of the Dhamma in the light of your own experienceWhen I contemplated the meaning of the words I realized that fear arises because one is afraid to lose what one values like ones life or what one thinks in ignorance is valuable and what one wants all the time and having which gives one a feeling of securityThis object which one values does not last forever and so the sense of security derived from it is also not lastingIt cannot last because of changeOne cannot ignore change in lifeChange is sufferingAnd what is at the root of wanting this and wanting that or not wanting this or not wanting thatIt is cravingCut off craving and one is spared fear and anguishSo simple is the remedy but so difficult  oh so difficult to doBut give up attachment I had toYou see there was nothing else I could doI cannot give up my past the peacock shook his head sadlyIt is impossibleWe knew the peacock said this because he was an aesthete and an epicureanWe realized that the chasteness of mental culture did not appeal to himHe told us that when he was in the jungle grasslands he had been used to dancing in the sun listening to concerts of bird song tasting wild fruits and spending his time agreeably with a community of peacocks and peahensIt seemed his enjoyment of life was so intense that sometimes he would break into an impromptu dance which was appreciated by an applauding audienceHe confessed to us that it was truly this that he enjoyed more than anything else  the adulation and admiration of his circle of friends among the bird population and the friendlier of the jungle beastsEven leopards were seen to amble over to the edge of the jungle to watch his performances which took place in a naturally formed shallow amphitheaterFinally it had come to a stage when his performances became the beall and endall of his life for he had come to delight in the adulation and admiration of all those around himIf he had no new audience to bedazzle every day he became bored and irritableHe had no idea to what extent he had been pampering his egosupporting delusionI do not think I will be successful in severing attachment the peacock shook his head againI know giving up attachment cannot be done without pain I saidCan one amputate a limb without anaesthesia without feeling painWell cutting off attachment is like thatIt was like that when my little one was taken away from me and before that when his father left me and after that when the old mahout diedWhen one loses the object of ones attachment there is bound to be sorrow and fear because one feels insecureIt is this attachment that gives one that false sense of self Listen to me the tortoise said patientlyWe are all to a greater or lesser extent prisoners of our karma  but our minds are always free to make new karmaThat is why the message of the BuddhaDhamma holds out so much hope and promise for the future to beings suffering in samsaraIt is not a pessimistic message but one that reveals the true nature of existence and offers hope for releaseIs it through disciplining the mind alone that one can achieve freedom and happiness the peacock asked dubiouslyMind is chief the tortoise declared firmly and quoted from the DhammapadaAll mental states have mind as their forerunner mind is their chief and they are mindmadeIf one speaks or acts with a polluted mind then suffering follows one as the wheel follows the hoof of the draftoxAll mental states have mind as their forerunner mind is their chief and they are mindmadeIf one speaks or acts with a pure mind then happiness follows one like ones shadow that never departsBut one cannot rush headlong into meditation without first having prepared the groundwork for it I saidIf one disciplines oneself in normal daytoday activities by keeping the five or eight precepts one would have already prepared the foundation for mental cultureYou see discipline in daytoday life is very important for purifying the mindDefilements are then easier to get rid ofObserving the precepts implies the application of discipline conscientiously and scrupulously over our actions both with regard to our thoughts as well as actions that stem from thoughtsA highly trained discipline is an essential prerequisite for a meditator seeking the path of freedomCorrect the tortoise saidNow peacock you are in an enviable position to practice the five precepts or even the eight preceptsBut know that mind is the forerunner of all evil and guard your mind for that is your greatest treasureWhen an angry thought comes into your mind observe it analyze why you are angry and check itIn that way discipline your mindAlso faith is very necessary I said implicit faith and confidence in the path of mental discipline undertakenEffort too is necessary unflagging effort mindfulness concentration all of which ultimately lead to wisdom or insightThese are the factors that help to make good ones escape from samsaraBut the humble foundation is discipline in daytoday life and that cannot be achieved without some basic disciplining of the mindThe peacock was now listening with avid interestTell me he said did you say that by putting a guard at the gateway of the mind and allowing only wholesome thoughts to enter good karma is madeYes indeed the tortoise said that is correctWe noticed that now the peacock had become quiet and calmTry the meditation the tortoise advised himFirst do the meditation on lovingkindness to all as I have taught you and then do the inandout breathing meditationThe peacock nodded and we left himSome days later when I went to see him I found he was in a better frame of mindHe did not seem so obsessed with his past and the pain of separation from itHe was obviously making an effort to keep his mind on the present moment all the timeTruly the past is only a construction of the mind he confided in meI am learning to let go of itGood I said Then you will realize that clinging to ideas and concepts and such mental constructions are all superficial and misleadingThey all arise mostly out of ignorance and have only one purpose  selfaffirmationYou will realize this when you go on meditating on your thoughtsNot so fast he said I have not given up the notion of self yetBut perhaps if I persevere hard enough I might see that noself point of viewExperience it see it I told himThe point of view of noself is not merely to be understood conceptuallyIt is to be experienced to be seen and realized for oneselfOnly then will all your grief and pain fall awaySuvimalee Karunaratna was born in Sri Lanka in and received her early education in Washington

discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practiceThese works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first aroseIn village India so I am told there are men who earn some extra rupees by trapping and taming monkeys to be sold as petsOver the years through trial and error several ways have been devised to capture these primates but the simplest method is said to be the monkeypotIn a clearing the trapper fastens a short piece of cord or thin chain to a stake or treestumpTo the other end he attaches a small pot one with a rather narrow neckInto this pot he drops several nuts and scatters a few more on the ground nearbyHe then goes a short distance away to wait out of sightSoon a band of monkeys arrives and descends to feedBefore long one of them discovers the contents of the potHe puts his hand in easily enough but having grasped the enticing snack he cannot pull his clenched fist out through the narrow opening no matter how hard he strugglesIn fear and panic the trapped monkey creates quite a ruckus which brings the trapper running with net and cageThe monkeys fate for all his cleverness is sealedAt first glance it would appear that the villager is the trapper the baited pot his trap and the poor monkey his victimNo doubt the villager sees things the same way and the hapless simian were he able to speak would likely agreeA closer look however shows a different perspectiveThe villager is not the trapper nor the pot a trap because there is nothing holding the monkeyHe could very easily remove his hand from the pot and rejoin his kin in the freedom of the treetops if only he would let go of the nutsIf he would only let goThe monkey in our anecdote does not suspect that he is being held prisoner solely by his mindHe has found some nutsGreed  unreasonable and unreasoning desire  has arisenThough the jungle abounds with fruits and nuts and all kinds of foods his conditioned reaction dictates that he must have these as wellHis narrow mindset is the only thing that imprisons him that prevents him from letting go from seeing the absurdity of his predicament as well as the obvious way out of itNow before we make any smug comments about the monkey and his intelligence or the apparent lack thereof and before we congratulate ourselves on our vastly superior reasoning powers let us see where we ourselves standThis business of letting go is so easy and yet so hard for monkey and for human being alikeWe are both caught up in the same predicamentThe details may be different played out on higher levels of sophistication or complexity but the end result is the same enslavement by concepts and conditioningWhile the monkey is done in by its greed for a few nuts we humans are done in by our greed for wealth fame power status pleasure and shiny trinkets and toys which we believe we absolutely must have and cannot live withoutEven more fundamentally we become enslaved not so much by the material objects themselves but by our attitudes and feelings toward themWe endlessly seek gratification for the senses pleasant things to look at to listen to to touch to taste to smellAnd more we are spurred on by thoughts or concepts created by our egodriven mindsThese last can be the hardest to satisfy since we cannot just please our senses and be contentRather we strive to fulfill fantasies of outdoing our peers of turning them green with envy by having the Biggest the Costliest the Latest the ShiniestWe are always caught up in competition in a game of oneupmanshipIt cannot even be said that we are materialistic We dont know how to beWe dont genuinely enjoy and appreciate the material things we have much less life itselfWe dont even know how to relaxAggressive competitiveness and acquisition become so obsessive so compulsive so ingrained that everything we do right down to the simplest recreational activity is turned into a contest a race a struggle to outdo others ourselves a clock or a calendarEverything becomes a contest for money trophies prestige or some other form of recognitionThe ironic part of all this is that while we are frantically making more money getting a bigger house and another pricey car hoarding more and better playthings and trying to impress the dickens out of the neighbors we have less and less time to enjoy the very things we are slaving forThe tragic part is that in the same feverish process of acquisition of material things we so very often lose our families our health our selfrespect and our peace of mindRush rush rushTempers flare ulcers growl blood pressure soarsMillions of us die from stressrelated illnessesMillions more try to find relief from their misery in alcohol and drugsIn the end all we manage to do is to rush into an early graveThough we may rise to an ever higher and higher standard of living at the same time our society is falling apart before our very eyesThe prize is not what we expected is itAll this misery in the name of whatUCCEAre we really that different from that poor monkeyWe do not know how or when to let go eitherOr what to let go ofWho is to say that we are not even worse off than our furry little friendCraving is a normal basic part of our conditioned natureThere are certain things that are necessary for our physical survival and mental wellbeing and others that are detrimentalThe mind of every sentient being discriminates putting these things into convenient categories labeling them good bad and indifferent according to how it perceives themAnd there are of course gradations within those categoriesAccording to the needs of the living organism itself an extremely complex psychobiological process a complicated psychobiological subprocess causes a desire to arise in the consciousness alerting the organism to seek or avoid certain objects or conditions to ensure its proper functioning or survivalSo far so goodThis is a necessary strategy evolved to maintain and protect the sentient being be it man or microbe as it goes about its business in the conditioned worldWhen this survival mechanism gets out of hand and instead of serving takes over as master it plunges us into a fog of cravings and longingsThis vague objectless wanting leaves us perpetually dissatisfied and unfulfilledIt leaves us feeling empty driven to search endlessly and compulsively for an elusive something that we hope might quench the cravingBut we do not know what we want or even why we want itLike the monkey drawn to the baited pot we grasp at all sorts of things  and ideas  with essentially the same resultsWe get trapped if not in the literal physical sense then certainly psychologically which makes the suffering even more damaging and prolongedAnd the emptiness persistsBut there is a solution and it is rather simpleSimple now though not necessarily easyRather than give in and blindly obey these impulses to grasp more to acquire more to hoard more we need to confront and analyze themWhere do they arise and whyThe answers may surprise us Behind this acquisitiveness is the egoconcept which necessarily gives rise to insecurity and fear in myriad formsThese in turn cause us consciously or subconsciously to seek all sorts of things with which to defend the apparent solidity of the ego to embellish and adorn it and to build a protective wall around it power status fame attention and material possessionsWe are even driven to exaggerate the basic requisites of food clothing shelter and medicine to rather outlandish proportionsTo put it simply due to ignorance of the nature of the ego we fail to make the distinction between This is needed and I WANT Through egomotivated thinking we create a great deal of unnecessary suffering for ourselves and we sacrifice much even most of the quality of our livesThe Buddha taught that as conditioned beings living in a conditioned existence we can never be completely free of all sorts of unpleasantness stress and sufferingAll conditioned phenomena are flawed and that inevitably gives rise to unsatisfactorinessThis is the First Noble Truth of the Buddhas teaching and far from being a vague philosophical speculation it is something that each of us experiences first hand for himorherself in daily lifeWhile true and permanent freedom comes about as a result of the insight gained through Vipassana meditation we can eliminate a great deal of unnecessary suffering in the meantime by applying the principle of renunciationUnfortunately the very word renunciation has a strange medieval ring to it in this modern Westerndominated supposedly hedonistic ageFor most it carries the smell of sackcloth and ashes an image of penance selfdenial selfdeprivation even selftortureIt is thought of as a negative dejected turning away from the world a gloomy giving up on life the last refuge of spurned lovers and aging old maidsIt is none of those thingsGenuine renunciation as the Buddha teaches it is akin to throwing open the windows of the mind to morning sunshine and crisp cool airRenunciation is cleaning house getting rid of trash and useless clutter both figurative and literalIt is recognizing that when we become attached to things we do not own them instead they own usIt is putting things in proper perspective simplifying our lives and being satisfied with enoughOn occasion the question is brought up whether the Dhamma is still valid in our timeSome people seem to think that while the Dhamma may have been well suited for the Asia of twentyfive hundred years ago it has no place in a twentieth century world dominated by fastpaced aggressive increasingly amoral Western technology and materialism and therefore it should be retired to a museum to rest amid the musty relics of a vanished Golden AgeIn other words it is as if an ageold system of treatment were no longer useful because the diseases of today are differentOthers approach the problem from another perspectiveThe efficacy and appropriateness of the Dhamma are not questionedInstead they feel that people today do not have the necessary time and opportunity for effective application and practice of the DhammaThe medicine is right for the disease but the patient is not able to take advantage of the treatmentLet us examine both of these viewsIt is true that the ancient world was a different place from oursCertainly life must have been considerably slowerpaced as it is even today in agricultural village societiesIn short the th century RatRace the technology that created it and all that they imply both good and bad did not existIt is very tempting for us to look back longingly to some gentler and quieter GoldenAge UtopiaThatNeverWasYes the ancient world surely was a very different place perhaps more so than we realize or even are capable of realizingBut in no way can that be taken to mean that it was a better placeThese differences are really only superficial and cosmeticThe underlying problem the basic problem of the world remains the same no matter how much the exterior trappings may changeAnd that problem is that the world is a place of sufferingThe world is a place of suffering but the suffering is not in the worldIt is in the mindIt is in your mind and it is in my mind and it is in the mind of every sentient being in existenceThat is of course the kind of statement that brings out the critics who insist that Buddhism is pessimisticNot soBuddhism impartially states what everyone can see and verify independently for himself or herselfLet us define sufferingIn his first sermon given after his Enlightenment the Buddha said as followsBirth is accompanied by pain disease is painful death is painfulSorrow lamentation grief and despair are sufferingEnduring the unpleasant is suffering and separation from the pleasant is sufferingNot getting what one wants is sufferingIndeed all the five aggregates which arise from craving and attachment are sufferingWho can possibly argue with that statementSuffering is physical mental and emotionalAnd none of us is exempt or immuneIt is true that pleasure and happiness also existNo one can deny that eitherBut pleasure and happiness are fragile and fleetingThey depend on certain conditions being in accord with what we want and expectAs soon as those conditions change as soon as we no longer have things our way some degree of unhappiness or suffering arisesBe it trivial or severe it is suffering nonethelessWe each create our own misery and unhappiness and even determine the degree to which we suffer by the expectations we set up and by the strength and inflexibility with which we hold those expectationsWe have just restated the first and second of the Four Noble Truths and all we have said is just as true for us today as it was on the day that the Buddha first uttered his TeachingWe see that the ancient and contemporary worlds are alike in that both are filled with sentient beings all of whom experience suffering and all of whom seek reliefTo this suffering the Buddha was no strangerHe saw it clearly all around him and he was sensitive to itOut of his compassion he set aside his own life of comfort and privilege in order to find once and for all time full and permanent release from the suffering inherent in all conditioned things situations and circumstancesAfter years of diligent searching he succeeded in liberating himselfAfter that attainment of Enlightenment again out of his great compassion he spent the remaining fortyfive years of his life showing the way to liberation to any and all who would listenThe Dhamma the Teaching of the Buddha is not his invention any more than the laws of physics are the invention of Isaac NewtonNewton was simply an observer who devoted himself to the investigation of certain laws of nature which he studied experimented with described and brought to the attention of others for the benefit of societyJust so did the Buddha devote himself to finding the cause for the arising of suffering and the means to its cessationThe Dhamma is a summary of the Buddhas search discoveries applications and resultsIt is a report of the way the laws of nature and mind operate and a set of instructions a manual as it were of how we each can most effectively use that information for our own greatest benefit in all aspects of daily life and ultimately for liberation from sufferingIt is eternally validThe first two of the Four Noble Truths serve to identify the problem and to reveal its causeThe Third Noble Truth identifies the remedy and the Fourth Noble Truth is the actual application of the treatmentIt is now entirely up to each of us to take it from thereThe Buddha did all that he could doNo one could have done moreThe doctor can identify the disease and indicate the remedyBut he cannot undergo the treatment on behalf of the patientSimilarly the Buddha shows us the path and gives us a detailed map with comprehensive instructions but each of us must put forth the effort to travel that path in order to reach the goalNo one can travel it for usWhat does it mean to be a BuddhistWhat does it entail to follow the path that the Buddha mapped out for usCan we do a good job of it in todays worldTo be a Buddhist in name only is very easyIt is also a colossal waste of time a disservice to all practicing Buddhists and an insult to the BuddhaTo be a serious practicing Buddhist does take time and effort and commitmentOne has to take time to study the Dhamma to be well acquainted with the core of the TeachingOne must know the Precepts not just well enough to repeat them or to do the minimum to get by but to understand in depth their ethical and moral basisOnce a person has this knowledge and understanding and lives by it one realizes that it is not for the sake of ones spiritual benefit alone but that it orders and simplifies all of everyday life as wellThis includes family business and social relationships childrearing in short all the aspects of lay householder lifeAnd upon this solid foundation and only upon it can one build ones meditative practice that is the mental cultivation of insight that leads to EnlightenmentYes it does take time and effortBut all worthwhile endeavors doAnd this is the most worthwhile endeavor of all bar noneWe find time and energy for all sorts of draining useless even harmful pursuitsCertainly we can make time for the application of the DhammaOne further point must be addressedMany persons seem to feel that in order to make significant progress one needs to enter the monastic lifeThat they cannot do so because of lay responsibilities or because they feel they are not suited for monastic life appears to them a great obstacleThe good news is that the lay person can make a great deal of progress right where he is in his present situationThe Suttas abound with accounts of lay women and men who rose to great spiritual heights even attained NibbanaAnd all the while they managed households raised families earned livings took care of personal affairs and operated businessesTo the casual observer they were living very ordinary normal livesAnd this is no less true todayThe Dhamma is unique a complete training system unmatched and unsurpassed by any otherIt is not difficult to followOne starts precisely where one is and proceeds at ones own proper paceAt the very least adherence to Buddhist ethics will greatly simplify life bring peace of mind and allow one to live a blameless existenceIt will also assure a wholesome rebirth in which one may again have the opportunity to continue making progress toward liberation from Samsara should one fall short of liberation in this lifeThe Dhamma is fully as potent now as it ever wasAnd once we make up our minds to apply its principles to our lives we shall see that all that needs to be done is well within our capabilities even in todays hostile whirlwind worldAll of us seek each in his or her own way that strangely elusive state called happiness but very few of us can describe or define just what we think will give us that happinessMost of us are looking for something but we dont quite know whatAt best we may have only some vague nebulous hunchesNot very much to go onIt is as if we have undertaken a journey without a clear idea of where we are going or how we are to get thereIs it any wonder that we repeatedly fail in spite of all our effortsAll things change and our notions of happiness are no exceptionIt is clear that if it is formed at all the concept of happiness is extremely subjective and personal open not only to wide individual interpretation but to the vagaries of social cultural and even economic conditioning as wellIn simpler bygone days it appears that happiness was generally taken to be a tranquil anxietyfree state of contentment brought about by the fulfillment of certain conditions necessary for survivalOne who was properly sheltered adequately clothed well fed free from serious illness and pain and was not in danger of harm from enemies was deemed to be happyFor what more could one askFragile though it was such a basic state of security was deemed to be a blessing and grounds for great happinessIn our time however it seems that happiness is more than ever held to be somehow linked with the experience of pleasure and with getting and having things Some seek it in the direct agitation and gratification of the sensesOthers in the accumulation of material objects and in the attainment of fame status power and wealthAnd many think it lies in the rather hazy concept of being free which today has taken on the extreme connotation of freedom from discipline morals social conventions and even good tasteUnhappiness is much easier to define possibly because we experience so much more of itBut either way whether we are scrutinizing happiness or suffering we are dealing with unstable impermanent states of mind and impermanent external conditions being in accord or at odds with what we want and expectAs soon as we no longer have things going our way happiness wanes and some degree of unhappiness or suffering arisesIt may be trivial or severe but it is nonetheless sufferingSuffering is simply wanting endless wantingIt is dissatisfaction with things being the way they areThe Buddha identifies wanting as the basis of all our suffering and in the same breath he adds that it is the causative factor of rebirthThe Buddha points out that there is no lasting inherent pleasure or happiness to be derived from having satisfied a desireAny desireThe pleasure occurs only during the peak moment of releasing the frustration the anticipation the tension of the wanting itselfOnce the desired object is secured once the discomfort of wanting has been relieved gratification dwindles to an afterglow and soon ceasesAs soon as the novelty wears off our attention rather quickly moves to the next item that catches our eyeIt is a neverending processFurthermore the Buddha also points out that no object or situation can ever in and of itself be a source of pleasure or displeasureRather these are constructs of the mindIn our minds we form certain expectations the way we want specific things situations and persons to beAs long as these expectations happen to be met we experience a degree of satisfactionWhen they are not met we experience displeasure disappointment anger and other unwholesome mindstates in direct proportion to our frustrationWe cannot crave that which we already have only that which is still out of our reachWe can have an attachment to what is already ours but that is also a desire a wanting for the future to be a certain wayWe want a guarantee that the object of our attachment will continue to give us pleasure that it will remain in our possession and that it will not change break or otherwise fail to live up to our expectationsWe still want something that is out of reach a firm guarantee that future circumstances will not alterWe deceive ourselves and each other into believing that happiness is just one more step away almost within our reachIf only we could get rid of this if only we could have that if only we could change the other then for sure we would be really and truly happy foreverWe spend our lives ifonlying reaching and grasping yet we never manage to get hold of happinessIt always seems to slip through our fingersThat is the story of our lives life after life birth after birthYes this constant reaching and grasping for just one more thing this is the craving the tanha about which the Buddha warns usThis is the glue that binds us so firmly to the Wheel of Samsara this grim MerryGoRound of Misery that drags us endlessly from birth to rebirth from death to death again and from suffering to more suffering relieved here and there by shortlived sparks of gratification or pleasureIronically the more we grasp at this thing called happiness the more we chase after it the more certain it is that it will escape usWe have misinterpreted misunderstood both the cause and the nature of happiness and then we have compounded the error by looking for the happiness in the wrong place in the world rather than within the mindOur efforts are doomed to failure from the very firstHappiness lies not in the ability to satisfy our every desire but rather in the ability to refrain from reacting compulsively to every craving and prodding of the mindIt is the ability to observe the mind dispassionately to allow anything to manifest without our buying into it without becoming enslaved by itThere is little that can be done about what occurs to us through external circumstancesThat is old conditioned stuff kammavipaka surfacingWe need do nothing except to observe carefully its arising and its passing awayWe do however need to be very careful about how we react to itThat reaction that mental emotional and volitional response creates our conditioning for the futureThe clear awareness of our feelings toward the arisen object or thought unaccompanied by an automatic selfinterested reflex reaction based in greed or aversion begins to weaken the kammic bonds that hold us to samsaric miseryAnd practiced regularly it provides insight into the workings of nature and of the mindThis insight this understanding of the impermanence ultimate unsatisfactoriness and selfless nature of all conditioned phenomena quickly breaks the kammic chains and leads to liberation from SamsaraIt is the very core of the Buddhas TeachingPetr Karel Ontl was born into a BohemianAmerican family in Prague Czechoslovakia in and emigrated to the United States inA certified foreign language teacher he has worked in the fields of teaching photography care for the elderly and translationHe has been a Theravada Buddhist for the past twenty years and is affiliated with the Bhavana Society in High View West VirginiaThe Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creedsFounded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topicsIts publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddhas discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practiceThese works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first aroseThis booklet contains a collection of short suttas spoken by the Buddha and a passage from the Visuddhimagga each preceded by a brief introduction by the translatorThe unifying theme of these pieces may be called a positive response in dealing with provocative people and situationsThe texts set forth practical techniques taught by the Buddha for overcoming resentment hatred and other such pollutants and for cultivating such elevating mental qualities as good will amity and compassionFor anyone intent on spiritual development these practical instructions will help to cleanse the mind and to unfold its great hidden potentialsIn the realm of spirituality tit for tat very much a norm in the world never worksIt is only by a positive response that spiritual progress is possibleIf one is reproached even manhandled and one reacts with resentment one would certainly fail either to achieve a purposive result for oneself or to win over the opponentBut if one endures the reproach and responds with good will then one can win over the offending person as well as effect a significant triumph over oneself making progress on the onward path to spiritual liberationAn outlook that fosters a positive response to every negative move thus becomes imperative to any serious seeker of truthIt is essential therefore that a meditator should assiduously strive to cultivate a positive attitude leading to the conquest of evil by goodThe Buddha in a masterly discourse entitled The Parable of the Saw makes this point amply clearThe Buddha exhorts the monk Phagguna Phagguna if anyone were to reproach you right to your face give you a blow with the hand or hit you with a clod of earth or with a stick or with a sword even then you should abandon those urges and thoughts which are worldlyThere Phagguna you should train yourself thus Neither shall my mind be affected by this nor shall I give vent to evil words but I shall remain full of concern and pity with a mind of love and I shall not give in to hatred So that the point will go straight home the Buddha recounts a delightful story of the mistress Vedehika which is again supported by several analogies the great earth empty space the river Ganges and the catskin bagTo emphasize this philosophy of positive approach the Buddha further tells the monks that even if bandits were to sever them limb by limb with a doublehandled saw they should not give way to hatred but must develop thoughts of boundless love towards the bandits as well as the entire worldThe monks it is said were greatly inspired as they heard this philosophy of positive responsePhagguna if anyone were to reproach you right to your face even then you should abandon those urges and thoughts which are worldlyThere Phagguna you should train yourself thus Neither shall my mind be affected by this nor shall I give vent to evil words but I shall remain full of concern and pity with a mind of love and I shall not give in to hatred This is how Phagguna you should train yourselfPhagguna if anyone were to give you a blow with the hand or hit you with a clod of earth or with a stick or with a sword even then you should abandon those urges and thoughts which are worldlyThere Phagguna you should train yourself thus Neither shall my mind be affected by this nor shall I give vent to evil words but I shall remain full of concern and pity with a mind of love and I shall not give in to hatred This is how Phagguna you should train yourselfIn the past monks in this very Savatthi there was a mistress Vedehika by nameAnd monks this good reputation had spread about the mistress Vedehika The mistress Vedehika is gentle the mistress Vedehika is meek the mistress Vedehika is calm Now monks the mistress Vedehika had a maidservant Kali by name who was able energetic and very methodical in her workThen monks it occurred to Kali the maidservant This good reputation has spread about my lady The mistress Vedehika is gentle the mistress Vedehika is meek the mistress Vedehika is calm Could it be that my lady does have anger within her which she does not show or could it be that she does not have angerOr is it because I am methodical in my job that my lady though she does have anger within does not show it and not because she does not have angerWhy dont I test my ladyThus monks the maidservant Kali got up late the next morningAnd monks the mistress Vedehika told this to the maidservant Kali Hey you Kali  What is it lady  Why did you get up so late  Oh that is nothing lady  WhatThat is nothing indeedYou bad maidservant you got up late Angry and displeased she frownedThen monks it occurred to Kali the maidservant Though she does have anger within my lady does not show it it is not that she does not have angerIt is because I am methodical in my job that though she does have anger within my lady does not show it and not because she does not have angerWhy dont I test my lady furtherNow monks Kali the maidservant got up even later than beforeThen monks the mistress Vedehika told the maidservant Kali Hey you Kali  What is it lady  Why did you get up even later than before  Oh that is nothing lady  WhatThat is nothing indeedYou bad maidservant you got up even later than before Angry and displeased she gave vent to her displeasureThen monks it occurred to the maidservant Kali Though she does have anger within my lady does not show it it is not that she does not have angerIt is because I am methodical in my job that though she does have anger within my lady does not show it and not because she does not have angerWhy dont I test my lady furtherAnd monks the maidservant Kali got up even later than beforeThen monks the mistress Vedehika told the maidservant Kali Hey you Kali  What is it lady  Why did you get up so late  Oh that is nothing lady  WhatThat is nothing indeedYou bad maidservant you got up so late And angry and displeased she hit her on the head with the doorbarAnd this injured her headNow monks the maidservant Kali with her head injured and blood oozing went about among the neighbors shouting Look sirs at the deed of the gentle oneLook sirs at the deed of the meek oneLook sirs at the deed of the calm oneHow can she saying to her own maidservant You got up late today angry and displeased having taken a doorbar give me a blow on the head and injure my headAnd then monks this illrepute spread thereafter about the mistress Vedehika The mistress Vedehika is violent the mistress Vedehika is arrogant the mistress Vedehika is not calmIn the same way monks some monk here is very gentle very meek and very calm so long as disagreeable ways of speech do not assail him but when disagreeable ways of speech do assail the monk it is then that the monk is to be judged whether he is gentle meek or calm Monks I do not call that monk dutiful who is dutiful on account of the requisites he gets ie the robe almsfood lodging and medicaments whereby he falls into pseudodutifulnessAnd whyFor monks when that monk fails to get the requisites of the robe almsfood lodging and medicaments he ceases to be dutiful and is not in keeping with the norms of dutifulnessBut monks whichever monk out of reverence for the Teaching out of respect for the Teaching out of dedication to the Teaching showing honor to the Teaching and giving regard to the Teaching comes to be dutiful and is in keeping with the norms of dutifulness him do I consider as dutifulTherefore monks you should consider Only out of reverence for the Teaching out of respect for the Teaching out of dedication to the Teaching showing honor to the Teaching and giving regard to the Teaching shall we become dutiful shall we be in keeping with the norms of dutifulness Thus indeed monks you should train yourselvesMonks there are these five modes of speech which people might use when speaking to you  speech that is timely or untimely true or false gentle or harsh with a good or a harmful motive and with a loving heart or hostilityMonks some might speak to you using speech that is timely or untimely monks some might speak to you according to truth or falsely monks some might speak to you gently or harshly monks some might speak to you with a good motive or with a harmful motive monks some might speak to you with a loving heart or with

and pity with a mind of love and we shall not give in to hatredOn the contrary we shall live projecting thoughts of universal love to that very person making him as well as the whole world the object of our thoughts of universal love  thoughts that have grown great exalted and measurelessWe shall dwell radiating these thoughts which are void of hostility and ill will It is in this way monks that you should train yourselvesSuppose monks a person were to come to you holding a hoe and a basket and he were to say I shall make this great earth earthless Then he would strew the earth here and there spit here and there and urinate here and there and would say Be earthless be earthless What do you think monks would this person render this great earth earthlessNo indeed not most venerable sirAnd whyBecause this great earth most venerable sir is deep and without measureIt cannot possibly be turned earthlessOn the contrary that person would only reap weariness and frustrationIn the same way

sever you limb by limb with a doublehandled saw even then whoever of you harbors ill will at heart would not be upholding my TeachingMonks even in such a situation you should train yourselves thus Neither shall our minds be affected by this nor for this matter shall we give vent to evil words but we shall remain full of concern and pity with a mind of love and we shall not give in to hatredOn the contrary we shall live projecting thoughts of universal love to those very persons making them as well as the whole world the object of our thoughts of universal love  thoughts that have grown great exalted and measurelessWe shall dwell radiating these thoughts which are void of hostility and ill will It is in this way monks that you should train yourselvesMonks if you should keep this instruction on the Parable of the Saw constantly in mind do you see any mode of speech subtle or gross that you could not endureNo LordTherefore monks you should keep this instruction on the Parable of the Saw constantly in mindThat will conduce to your wellbeing and happiness for long indeedThat is what the Blessed One saidDelighted those monks acclaimed the Teaching of the Blessed OneA sylvan grove nestled at the foothills surrounding the capital city of Rajagaha this royal pleasance known as the Bamboo Grove was offered to the Buddha by King BimbisaraThe king built a monastery there with a large number of meditation huts where at least monks stayed spending their time in meditation and intense spiritual endeavorThe Bamboo Grove was neither too far nor too near the city but at just the right distance from it for the large number of devotees who flocked there every morning and evening to pay homage to the LordA certain brahman belonging to the Bharadvaja clan had a great prejudice against the Buddha since he thought a kshatriya had claimed to be a saintAnd as it transpired his own wife was a great devotee of the MasterOn a certain festival day when everybody including his wife had gone to the monastery to hear the discourse the brahman coming to know of it became furiousFuming with rage he rushed to the monastery and forcing his way through the crowd and shouting loudly foul abuse he headed straight to the place where the Buddha was seatedPeople were aghastEven the presence of the king the nobles and ministers did not deter the enraged brahman from reviling the Buddha to his faceWhen the Buddha remained completely unruffled projecting powerful thoughts of lovingkindness the brahman stopped abusing himBut he was still peevishNow the Buddha asked him My friend if somebody visits you and you offer food which he refuses who gets itIf the visitor doesnt accept it I will get it back because I offered it to himSince I dont accept your abuse to whom will it returnThe brahman was so moved by the tremendous implication of this analogy that he fell at the feet of the Buddha and sought to be ordained as a monkSoon after his ordination he attained ArahatshipThe Buddha had transformed him by his positive approachA friend of this brahman belonging to the same Bharadvaja clan and noted for his cantankerous nature heard about the incident and became very angryIn fact he was known as Akkosa Bharadvaja Bharadvaja the Abusive He made his way to the monastery on a certain day when a large number of people flocked to hear the Buddhas discourseThe outcome was identical and he too became a monk and later on an ArahatSuch was the tremendous impact which the Buddhas positive response wrought even on the most hostile personsThe Tipitaka is replete with such instancesThe following discourse known as the Akkosa Sutta describes the incident vividlyOnce the Blessed One was staying at Rajagaha in the Bamboo Grove near the Squirrels Feeding PlaceNow the brahman Akkosa Bharadvaja heard this The brahman Bharadvaja it seems has become a monk under the Great Monk Gotama Angry and unhappy he went to where the Blessed One wasHaving approached the Blessed One he abused and criticized the Blessed One in foul and harsh wordsThus reviled the Blessed One spoke to the brahman Akkosa Bharadvaja Well brahman do friends confidants relatives kinsmen and guests visit youYes Gotama sometimes friends confidants relatives kinsmen and guests do visit meWell brahman do you not offer them snacks or food or tidbitsYes Gotama sometimes I do offer them snacks or food or tidbitsBut if brahman they do not accept it who gets itIf Gotama they do not accept it I get it backEven so brahman you are abusing us who do not abuse you are angry with us who do not get angry you are quarreling with us who do not quarrelAll this of yours we dont acceptYou alone brahman get it back all this brahman belongs to youWhen brahman one abuses back when abused repays anger in kind and quarrels back when quarreled with this is called brahman associating with each other and exchanging mutuallyThis association and mutual exchange we do not engage inTherefore you alone brahman get it back all this brahman belongs to youPeople including the king know the Venerable Gotama thus The Monk Gotama is the Worthy One When does the Venerable Gotama become angrySaid the BuddhaWhen the Lord proclaimed this the brahman Akkosa Bharadvaja said this to the Blessed One Wonderful indeed O Venerable GotamaHerewith I go to the Venerable Gotama for refuge to his Teaching and to his Holy Order of MonksMost venerable sir may I have the privilege to receive at the hands of the revered Lord Gotama the initial monastic ordination and also the higher ordination of a bhikkhuAnd the brahman Akkosa Bharadvaja received at the hands of the Blessed One the initial monastic ordination and he also received the higher ordination of a bhikkhuAnd within a short time of his ordination the Venerable Akkosa Bharadvaja living alone secluded diligent zealous and unrelenting reached that incomparable consummation of holiness for which sons of noble families having totally abandoned the household life take to the life of homelessnessWith direct knowledge he realized the ultimate then and there and lived having access to itHe saw with his supernormal vision Ceased is rebirth lived is the holy life completed is the spiritual task and henceforth there is nothing higher to be achievedThe Venerable Akkosa Bharadvaja indeed became one of the ArahatsThe modern psychoanalytical technique known as TA Transactional Analysis distinguishes four possible attitudes that condition a mans conductThese areOut of these the fourth one represents the approach of positive responseThe person who says I am all right and you are also all right is optimistic and tries to find the best in every man and in every situationIt is only when one seeks good that one finds good which leads one to ultimate goodWhoever is committed to the philosophy of positive response must necessarily seek good and discover goodIn a discourse entitled Wood from a Pyre the Buddha classifies human beings into four distinct categories namelyOf these the last category represents the man who is committed to positive responseThe Buddha uses very telling analogiesThe worst of the four he says is a man who is like a piece of wood from a pyre burnt on both sides and fouled with dung in the middleIt cannot be used as firewood in the village nor can it be used as timber in the forestEven so is the man who neither promotes his own wellbeing nor anothersHe represents a man of negative approach void of love  mettaThe best man is compared with the skimmings of ghee which is reckoned as the best of dairy productsSays the sutta From a cow comes milk from milk curd from curd butter from butter ghee and from ghee the skimmings of ghee which is the best The man who treads the path of positive response is the man who promotes his own wellbeing as well as the good of othersHe has the bright outlook which says I am all right and you are also all right That is to say I have nothing to complain about I grudge noneI see good everywhereEven from the worst of men I can learn somethingEvery impediment for me is something to be turned into an aid and every failure into a step forward to successMonks these four kinds of persons are to be found existing in the worldWhich fourOne who is engaged in promoting neither his own good nor in promoting the good of another one who is engaged in promoting anothers good but not in promoting his own good one who is engaged in promoting his own good but not in promoting the good of another and one who is engaged in promoting his own good and also in promoting the good of anotherJust as monks a piece of wood from a pyre burnt at both ends and in the middle fouled with dung serves neither for fuel in the village nor for timber in the forest so in the same way monks is such a person I say who is engaged in promoting neither his own good nor in promoting the good of anotherMonks there is the person who is engaged in promoting the good of another but not in promoting his own goodOf these two individuals the latter is superiorMonks there is the person who is engaged in promoting his own good but not in promoting the good of anotherOf these three individuals he is superiorMonks there is the person who is engaged in promoting his own good and also in promoting anothers goodOf these four individuals he is the foremost the chief the principal the best and the supremeJust as monks from a cow comes milk from milk curd from curd butter from butter ghee from ghee the skimmings of ghee and that is reckoned the best even so monks among these four individuals the person who is engaged in promoting his own good and also the good of another is the foremost the chief the principal the best and the supremeMonks these are the four individuals who are to be found existing in the worldThe approach of positive response calls for selftransformation through a sustained process of selfadmonition and selfcorrectionUnless one has brought about a measure of transformation in ones conduct and beliefs attitudes and thinking it is impossible to respond positively leading to ones own wellbeing as well as that of othersBut transformation cannot come about without a reorientation of ones motivationsThat is where selfadmonition and selfcorrection play a crucial roleSelfadmonition requires a reconsideration of ones judgments and a reassessment of ones valuesystemThe Visuddhimagga contains some very valuable passages concerning reassessment and consideration of judgments which instantly cause resentment to subsideSays the Visuddhimagga If by striving and putting forth effort his resentment subsides well and goodIf it does not he should then consider some of the qualities of the person which express calmness and purity and which inspire confidence when recollected and after reconsidering in this manner he should make resentment subsideNow for someone his bodily conduct is calm and this calmness can be seen in the way he performs the various duties but his conduct in speech and thought is not calmHaving ignored his latter conduct only the calm conduct in his bodily actions should be consideredFor another his conduct in speech is calm and this calmness is apparent to allHe is by nature very skilful in welcoming others friendly and a good conversationalist he is congenial easily approachable and courteous in his speech he expounds the Teaching in a pleasant way explaining the Dhamma in clear language and in detail but his conduct in bodily actions and in thought is not calmHaving ignored his latter conduct only his calm conduct in speech should be consideredAnother is calm in his thoughts and this calmness is evident to all from the way he worships at the shrine etcOne who is not calm in his thoughts when he worships at the shrine or at the Bodhi tree or an elder does not do it devoutly and when he sits at the pavilion where the Dhamma is preached his mind strays away and he nodsYet another has calm thoughts worships devoutly and deliberately and hears the Dhamma attentively retaining it in mind and evincing joyful convictionThus for someone his conduct in thought is calm but not so his conduct in bodily action and speechHaving ignored his latter conduct only his calm conduct in thought should be consideredFor someone however not even one of these three actions is calmFor such a person compassion should be aroused thus Although he is now going about in the human world after a certain time he will surely find himself in any of the eight great hells or the sixteen minor hells For through compassion resentment subsides alsoFor someone all these actions are calmFor such whichever one likes one might considerTowards such persons the cultivation of universal love is easyThe Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creedsFounded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topicsIts publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddhas discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practiceThese works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first aroseIn the early centuries after the Buddhas passing away as Buddhism became a popular religion the idea was formalized that there were three paths to awakening to choose from the path to awakening as a disciple of a Buddha the path to awakening as a private Buddha ie one who attained awakening on his own but was not able to teach the path of practice to others and the path to awakening as a Rightly Selfawakened BuddhaEach path was defined as consisting of perfections of character but there was a question as to what those perfections were and how the paths differed from one anotherThe Theravadins for instance specified ten perfections and organized their Jataka collection so that it culminated in ten tales each illustrating one of the perfectionsThe Sarvastivadins on the other hand specified six perfections and organized their Jataka collection accordinglyAll Buddhists agreed that the third path took by far the longest to follow but disagreements arose as to whether the perfections developed along the different paths were quantitatively or qualitatively differentIn other words did a Buddha develop more of the same sort of perfections that an arahant developed or did he develop perfections of a radically different sortThose who believed that the perfections differed only quantitatively were able to take the early Buddhist canons as their guide to the path to Buddhahood for they could simply extrapolate from the path of the arahant as described in those canonsThose seeking Buddhahood who believed that the perfections differed qualitatively however had to look outside the canonsPeople in this latter group often practiced a form of meditation aimed at inducing visions of bodhisattvas treading the path to full Buddhahood along with Buddhas in other worldsystemsThese Buddhas and bodhisattvas  it was hoped  would provide an insiders knowledge of the full Buddhas pathThe teachings that resulted from these visions were very diverse not until the rd century CE with the development of the Yogacara school was a concerted effort made to collate these various teachings into a single body  what we now know as the Mahayana movement  but the differences among these teachings were so great that the Mahayana never achieved true unityThus historically there have been two major ways of following the path to full Buddhahood following guidelines gleaned from the early canons and following the traditions set in motion by the experiences of visionaries from the beginning of the common eraThe materials in this study guide take the first courseTheres a common misunderstanding that the Theravada school teaches only the savaka path but a glance at Theravada history will show that many Theravadins have vowed to become bodhisattvas and have undertaken the practice of the ten perfections as set forth in the Theravadin JatakasBecause these perfections differ only quantitatively for arahants Theravadins who aspire to arahantship cite the perfections as qualities that they are developing as part of their practice outside of formal meditationFor example they make donations to develop the perfection of generosity undertake building projects to develop the perfection of endurance and so forthFor people in the modern world who are wrestling with the issue of how to practice the Dhamma in daily life the perfections provide a useful framework for developing a fruitful attitude toward daily activities so that any activity or relationship undertaken wisely with the primary purpose of developing the perfections in a balanced way becomes part of the practiceThe perfections also provide one of the few reliable ways of measuring the accomplishments of ones lifeAccomplishments in the realm of work and relationships have a way of turning into dust but perfections of the character once developed are dependable and lasting carrying one over and beyond the vicissitudes of daily livingThus they deserve to take high priority in the way we plan our livesThese two facts are reflected in the two etymologies offered for the word perfection They carry one across to the further shore and they are of foremost importance in formulating the purpose of ones lifeThe material in this study guide is organized under the heading of the eighth perfection  determination  for several reasonsThe first reason is that determination is needed for undertaking the path of perfections to begin with in that it gives focus motivation and direction to the practiceThe second reason is that the four aspects of skilled determination  discernment truth relinquishment and calm  when studied carefully cover all ten of the perfections generosity virtue renunciation discernment persistence endurance truth determination good will and equanimityIn this way the material gathered here illustrates the general principle that each of the perfections when properly practiced includes all tenThe third reason is that the four aspects of skilled determination highlight the importance of establishing wise priorities and sticking to them regardless of the temptation to sacrifice them for lesser aimsIn this way they help guard against a common problem in approaching practice in daily life a tendency to indulge in the selfdelusion that can justify any activity as long as its done mindfully as part of the pathThe fourth and perhaps most important reason for organizing the material in this way is that skilled determination begins with discernment the ability to make wise distinctions that help keep each of the perfections on path to the goal of ending sufferingIf they are not informed by these distinctions the perfections are simply generic virtues common to all cultures leading to pleasant results but not necessarily to the transcendentThus the material here has been chosen to highlight the need to use discernment in making important distinctions in developing the perfections in a wise and effective wayFor instance under the theme of good will passage  shows that good will is not necessarily lovingkindness Wishing happiness for others is not necessarily a desire to become involved with themPassages  show that although one should extend good will to all one should be selective in ones friendshipsPassage  makes the point that good will should not be practiced to the point of entanglementSimilarly under the theme of persistence passage  points out that persistence is not simply a matter of brute forceOne has to discern which type of effort is appropriate for the issue at handPassages  show that the amount of effort appropriate in a particular situation has to be gauged both by the nature of the problem and by ones own level of energyUnder the theme of renunciation passages  teach standards for determining how much physical pleasure is compatible with progress on the pathUnder the theme of patience passage  points out the need to distinguish what should and should not be tolerated at the same time counseling common sense in avoiding unnecessary dangersUnder the theme of equanimity passages  distinguish between levels of equanimity on the path and between them and the equanimity that results from awakeningThis makes the point that  contrary to a common misunderstanding  equanimity in the face of sensory input is not the goal or even the highest level of equanimity on the pathInstead it is simply a means to a higher end the highest bliss of nibbanaPassages in this guide are drawn from the Pali canon and from the teachings of Ajaan Lee DhammadharoThese two are wise peopleWhich twoThe one who sees his transgression as a transgression and the one who rightfully pardons another who has confessed his transgressionThese two are wise peopleAs for the course of action that is pleasant to do but that when done leads to what is unprofitable it is in light of this course of action that one may be known  in terms of manly stamina manly persistence manly effort  as a fool or a wise personFor a fool doesnt reflect Even though this course of action is pleasant to do still when it is done it leads to what is unprofitable So he does it and thus the doing of that course of action leads to what is unprofitable for himBut a wise person reflects Even though this course of action is pleasant to do still when it is done it leads to what is unprofitable So he doesnt do it and thus the nondoing of that course of action leads to what is profitable for himAnd what is right resolveResolve aimed at renunciation at freedom from ill will at harmlessness This is called right resolveAnd what is the right view that is without fermentations transcendent a factor of the pathThe discernment the faculty

fermentations who is fully possessed of the noble pathThis is the right view that is without fermentations transcendent a factor of the pathOne tries to abandon wrong view  to enter into right view This is ones right effortOne is mindful to abandon wrong view  to enter  remain in right view This is ones right mindfulnessThus these three qualities  right view right effort  right mindfulness  run  circle around right viewOf those right view is the forerunnerAnd how is right view the forerunnerOne discerns wrong resolve as wrong resolve and right resolve as right resolveAnd what is wrong resolveBeing resolved on sensuality on ill will on harmfulnessThis is wrong resolveAnd what is right resolveRight resolve I tell you is of two sorts There is right resolve with fermentations siding with merit resulting in the acquisitions and there is noble right resolve without fermentations transcendent a factor of the pathAnd what is the right resolve that has fermentations sides with merit  results in acquisitionsBeing resolved on renunciation on freedom from ill will on harmlessnessThis is the right resolve that has fermentations sides with merit  results in acquisitionsAnd what is the right resolve that is without fermentations transcendent a factor of the pathThe thinking directed thinking resolve mental absorption mental fixity focused awareness  verbal fabrications in one developing the noble path whose mind is noble whose mind is without fermentations who is fully possessed of the noble pathThis is the right resolve that is without fermentations transcendent a factor of the pathOne tries to abandon wrong resolve  to enter into right resolve This is ones right effortOne is mindful to abandon wrong resolve  to enter  remain in right resolve This is ones right mindfulnessThus these three qualities  right view right effort  right mindfulness  run  circle around right resolveWhat youve done is to learn from your own actionsAs for your previous efforts you neednt concern yourself with them any longerThrow them outThis is a sense of discernment that arises of its own accord an ingenuity and sense of judgment that come not from anything your teachers have taught you but from observing and evaluating on your own the object that you yourself have madeThe same holds true in practicing meditationFor discernment to arise you have to be observant as you keep track of the breath and to gain a sense of how to adjust and improve it so that its wellproportioned throughout the body  to the point where it flows evenly without faltering so that it s comfortable in slow and out slow in fast and out fast long short heavy or refinedGet so that both the inbreath and the outbreath are comfortable no matter what way you breathe so that  no matter when  you immediately feel a sense of ease the moment you focus on the breathWhen you can do this physical results will appear a sense of ease and lightness open and spaciousThe body will be strong the breath and blood will flow unobstructed and wont form an opening for disease to step inThe body will be healthy and awakeAs for the mind when mindfulness and alertness are the causes a still mind is the resultWhen negligence is the cause a mind distracted and restless is the resultSo we must try to make the causes good in order to give rise to the good results weve referred toIf we use our powers of observation and evaluation in caring for the breath and are constantly correcting and improving it well develop awareness on our own the fruit of having developed our concentration higher step by step Ajaan Lee The allaround knowing that arises within us comes from causes and effects not from what we read in books hear other people tell us or conjecture on our ownSuppose we have some silver coins in our pocketIf all we know is that other people say its money we dont know its qualitiesBut if we experiment with it and put it in a smelter to see what its made of and to see how it can be made into other things thats when well know its true qualitiesThis is the kind of knowledge that comes from our own actionsThis knowledge when we meditate comes in five formsWe find within ourselves that some things are caused by the properties of the body some are caused by the mind some causes come from the mind but have an effect on the body some causes come from the body but have an effect on the mind some causes come from the body and mind acting together Ajaan Lee   We should make a point of searching for whatever will give rise to discernmentSutamayapañña Listen to things that are worth listening toCintamayapaññaOnce youve listened evaluate what youve learnedDont accept it or reject it right off handBhavanamayapañña Once youve put what youve learned to the test practice in line with itThis is the highest perfection of discernment  liberating insightYou know what kinds of stress and pain should be remedied and so you remedy themYou know what kinds shouldnt be remedied and so you dontFor the most part were really ignorantWe try to remedy the things that shouldnt be remedied and it just doesnt work  because theres one kind of stress that should simply be observed and shouldnt be fiddled with at allLike a rusty watch Dont polish away any more rust than you shouldIf you go taking it apart the whole thing will stop running for goodWhat this means is that once youve seen natural conditions for what they truly are you have to let them beIf you see something that should be fixed you fix itWhatever shouldnt be fixed you dontThis takes a load off the heartIgnorant people are like the old woman who lit a fire to cook her rice and when her rice was cooked had her mealWhen she had finished her meal she sat back and had a cigarIt so happened that when she lit her cigar with one of the embers of the fire it burned her mouthDamned fire she thoughtIt burned my mouth So she put all her matches in a pile and poured water all over them so that there wouldnt be any more fire in the house  just like a fool with no sense at allThe next day when she wanted fire to cook her meal there wasnt any leftAt night when she wanted light she had to go pestering her neighbors asking this person and that and yet still she hated fireWe have to learn how to make use of things and to have a sense of how much is enoughIf you light only a little fire itll be three hours before your rice is cookedThe fire isnt enough for your foodSo it is with us We see stress as something bad and so try to remedy it  keeping at it with our eyes closed as if we were blindNo matter how much we treat it we never get anywhere at allPeople with discernment will see that stress is of two kinds physical stress or the inherent stress of natural conditions and mental stress or the stress of defilementOnce theres birth there has to be aging illness and deathWhoever tries to remedy aging can keep at it till theyre withered and grayWhen we try to remedy illness were usually like the old woman pouring water all over her matchesSometimes we treat things just right sometimes we dont  as when the front step gets cracked and we dismantle the house right up to the roofIllness is something that everyone has in other words the diseases that appear in the various parts of the bodyOnce weve treated the disease in our eyes itll go appear in our ears nose in front in back in our arm our hand our foot etc and then itll sneak insideLike a person trying to catch hold of an eel The more you try to catch it the more it slips off every which wayAnd so we keep on treating our diseases till we dieSome kinds of disease will go away whether we treat them or notIf its a disease that goes away with treatment then take medicineIf its one that goes away whether we treat it or not why botherThis is what it means to have discernmentIgnorant people dont know which kinds of stress should be treated and which kinds shouldnt and so they put their time and money to wasteAs for intelligent people they see what should be treated and they treat it using their own discernmentAll diseases arise either from an imbalance in the physical elements or from kammaIf its a disease that arises from the physical elements we should treat it with food medicine etcIf it arises from kamma we have to treat it with the Buddhas medicineIn other words stress and pain that arise from the heart if we treat them with food and medicine wont respondWe have to treat them with the DhammaWhoever knows how to manage this is said to have a sense of how to observe and diagnose stressIf we look at it in another way well see that aging illness and death are simply the shadows of stress and not its true substancePeople lacking discernment will try to do away with the shadows which leads only to more suffering and stressThis is because they arent acquainted with what the shadows and substance of stress come fromThe essence of stress lies with the mindAging illness and death are its shadows or effects that show by way of the bodyWhen we want to kill our enemy and so take a knife to stab his shadow how is he going to dieIn the same way ignorant people try to destroy the shadows of stress and dont get anywhereAs for the essence of stress in the heart they dont think of remedying it at allThis ignorance of theirs is one form of avijja or unawarenessTo look at it in still another way both the shadows and the real thing come from tanha cravingWere like a person who has amassed a huge fortune and then when thieves come to break in goes killing the thievesHe doesnt see his own wrongdoing and sees only the wrongdoing of othersActually once hes piled his house full in this way thieves cant help but break inIn the same way people suffer from stress and so they hate it and yet they dont make the effort to straighten themselves outStress comes from the three forms of craving so we should kill off craving for sensuality craving for becoming and craving for no becomingThese things are fabricated in our own heart and we have to know them with our own mindfulness and discernmentOnce weve contemplated them until we see well know This sort of mental state is craving for sensuality this sort is craving for becoming and this sort craving for no becomingPeople with discernment will see that these things exist in the heart in subtle intermediate and blatant stages just as a person has three stages in a lifetime youth middle age and old ageYouth is craving for sensualityOnce this thirst arises in the heart it wavers and moves  this is craving for becoming  and then takes shape as craving for no further becoming  a sambhavesin with its neck stretched out looking for its object causing itself stress and painIn other words we take a liking to various sights sounds smells flavors etc and so fix on them which brings us stressSo we shouldnt preoccupy ourselves with sights sounds etc that provoke greed anger or delusion causing the mind to waver and whisk out with conceptsWhen we gain discernment we should destroy these forms of craving with anulomikañana knowledge in accordance with the four Noble Truths knowing exactly how much ease and pleasure the mind has when cravings for sensuality becoming and no becoming all disappearThis is called knowing the reality of disbandingAs for the cause of stress and the path to the disbanding of stress well know them as wellIgnorant people will go ride in the shadow of a car  and theyll end up with their heads bashed inPeople who dont realize what the shadows of virtue are will end up riding only the shadowsWords and deeds are the shadows of virtueActual virtue is in the heartThe heart at normalcy is the substance of virtueThe substance of concentration is the mind firmly centered in a single preoccupation without any interference from concepts or mental labelsThe bodily side to concentration  when our mouth eyes ears nose and tongue are quiet  is just the shadow as when the body sits still its mouth closed and not speaking with anyone its nose not interested in any smells its eyes closed and not interested in any objects etcIf the mind is firmly centered to the level of fixed penetration then whether we sit stand walk or lie down the mind doesnt waverOnce the mind is trained to the level of fixed penetration discernment will arise without our having to search for it just like an imperial sword When its drawn for use its sharp and flashingWhen its no longer needed it goes back in the scabbardThis is why we are taughtThe mind is the most extraordinary thing there isThe mind is the source of the DhammaThis is what it means to know stress its cause its disbanding and the path to its disbandingThis is the substance of virtue concentration and discernmentWhoever can do this will reach release nibbanaWhoever can give rise to the Dhamma of study and practice within themselves will meet with the Dhamma of attainment without a doubtThis is why its said to be sanditthiko visible in the present akaliko bearing fruit no matter what the time or seasonKeep working at it always Ajaan Lee The intention to do harm is a heavy form of selfharmAt the very least it uses up our time and destroys our opportunity to do goodWe have to wipe it out with the intention not to do harm  or in other words with concentrationThis is like seeing that theres plenty of unused space in our property and that we arent making enough for our livingWell have to leap out into the open field so as to give ourselves the momentum for doing our full measure of goodness as the opportunity arisesNekkhammasankappo ie being at ease in quiet solitary placesAbyapadasankappo We dont have to think about our own bad points or the bad points of othersAvihinsasankappo not creating trouble or doing harm to ourselves ie not thinking about our own shortcomings which would depress us if we think about our own shortcomings itll spread like wildfire to the shortcomings of othersFor this reason wise people lift their thoughts to the level of goodness so that they can feel love and good will for themselves and so that they can then feel love and good will for others as wellWhen our mind has these three forms of energy its like a table with three legs that can spin in all directionsTo put it another way once our mind has spun up to this high a level we can take pictures of everything above and below usWell develop discernment like a bright light or like binoculars that can magnify every detailThis is called ñaṇa  intuitive awareness that can know everything in the world LokavidūThe discernment here isnt ordinary knowledge or insightIts a special cognitive skill the skill of the Noble PathWell give rise to three eyes in the heart so as to see the reds and greens the highs and lows of the mundane world a sport for those with wisdomOur internal eyes will look at the Dhamma in front and behind above and below and all around us so as to know all the ins and outs of goodness and evilThis is discernmentWell be at our ease feeling pleasure with no pain interfering at allThis is called vijjacaranasampanno  being fully equipped with cognitive skillWhoever sees the world as having highs and lows doesnt yet have true intuitive discernmentWhoever has the eye of intuition will see that there are no highs no lows no rich no poorEverything is equal in terms of the three common characteristics inconstant stressful and notselfIts like the equality of democracyTheir home is the same as our home with no differences at allPeople commit burglaries and robberies these days because they dont see equalityThey think that this person is good that person isnt this house is a good place to eat that house isnt this house is a good place to sleep that house isnt etcIts because they dont have insight the eye of discernment that theres all this confusion and turmoilIf we can get our practice on the Noble Path well enter nibbanaVirtue will disband concentration will disband discernment will disbandIn other words we wont dwell on our knowledge or discernmentIf were intelligent enough to know we simply know without taking intelligence as being an essential part of ourselvesOn the lower level were not stuck on virtue concentration or discernmentOn a higher level were not stuck on the stages of streamentry oncereturning or nonreturningNibbana isnt stuck on the world the world isnt stuck on nibbanaOnly at this point can we use the term arahantThis is where we can relaxThey can say inconstant but its just what they sayThey can say stress but its just what they sayThey can say notself but its just what they sayWhatever they say thats the way it isIts true for them and theyre completely right  but completely wrongAs for us only if we can get ourselves beyond right and wrong will we be doing fineRoads are built for people to walk on but dogs and cats can walk on them as wellSane people and crazy people will use the roads They didnt build the roads for crazy people but crazy people have every right to use themAs for the precepts even fools and idiots can observe themThe same with concentration Crazy or sane they can come and sitAnd discernment We all have the right to come and talk our heads off but its simply a question of being right or wrongNone of the valuables of the mundane world give any real pleasureTheyre nothing but stressTheyre good as far as the world is concerned but nibbana doesnt have any need for themRight views and wrong views are an affair of the worldNibbana doesnt have any right views or wrong viewsFor this reason whatever is a wrong view we should abandonWhatever is a right view we should develop  until the day it can fall from our graspThats when we can be at our ease Ajaan Lee One sleeps easily wakes easily dreams no evil dreamsOne is dear to human beings dear to nonhuman beingsThe devas protect oneNeither fire poison nor weapons can touch oneOnes mind gains concentration quicklyOnes complexion is brightOne dies unconfused and  if penetrating no higher  is headed for the Brahma worldsAs you say Master Frying Pan answered the bamboo acrobat and climbing the bamboo pole stood on his shouldersSo then the bamboo acrobat said to his assistant Now you watch after me my dear Frying Pan and Ill watch after youThus protecting one another watching after one another well show off our skill receive our reward and come down safely from the bamboo poleWhen he had said this Frying Pan said to him But that wont do at all MasterYou watch after yourself and Ill watch after myself and thus with each of us protecting ourselves watching after ourselves well show off our skill receive our reward and come down safely from the bamboo poleWhat Frying Pan the assistant said to her Master was the right way in that caseThe establishing of mindfulness is to be practiced with the thought Ill watch after myself The establishing of mindfulness is to be practiced with the thought Ill watch after others When watching after oneself one watches after othersWhen watching after others one watches after oneselfAnd how does one when watching after oneself watch after othersThrough pursuing through developing it through devoting oneself to itThis is how one when watching after oneself watches after othersAnd how does one when watching after others watch after oneselfThrough endurance through harmlessness and through a mind of kindness  sympathyThis is how one when watching after others watches after oneselfThe establishing of mindfulness is to be practiced with the thought Ill watch after myself The establishing of mindfulness is to be practiced with the thought Ill watch after others When watching after oneself one watches after othersWhen watching after others one watches after oneselfThe only way to put out these fires is to meditate and develop thoughts of good willThe mind wont feel any anger hatred or ill will and instead will feel nothing but thoughts of sympathy seeing that everyone in the world aims at goodness but that our goodness isnt equalYou have to use really careful discernment to consider cause and effect and then be forgiving with the thought that we human beings arent equal or identical in our goodness and evilIf everyone were equal the world would fall apartIf we were equally good or equally bad the world would have to fall apart for sureSuppose that all the people in the world were farmers with no merchants or government officialsOr suppose there were only government officials with no farmers at all Wed all starve to death with our mouths gaping and dryIf everyone were equal and identical the end of the world would come in only a few days timeConsider your body Even the different parts of your own body arent equalSome of your fingers are short some are long some small some largeIf all ten of your fingers were equal youd have a monsters handsSo when even your own fingers arent equal how can you expect people to be equal in terms of their thoughts words and deedsYou have to think this way and be forgivingWhen you can think in this way your good will can spread to all people everywhere and youll feel sympathy for people on high levels low levels and in betweenThe big ball of fire inside you will go out through the power of your good will and loving kindnessThis comes from getting life insurance practicing tranquility meditation so as to chase the defilements away from the mindThoughts of sensual desire ill will lethargy restlessness and uncertainty will vanish and the mind will be firmly centered in concentration using its powers of directed thought to stay with its meditation word  buddho and its powers of evaluation to create a sense of inner lightness and easeWhen the mind fills itself with rapture  the flavor arising from concentration  it will have its own inner food and nourishment so that whatever you do in thought word or deed is sure to succeed Ajaan Lee A characteristic of a thoroughbred of a monk Whatever tricks or deceits or wiles or subterfuges he has he shows them as they actually are to the Teacher or to his knowledgeable companions in the holy life so that the Teacher or his knowledgeable companions in the holy life can try to straighten them outThen the Blessed One having left a little bit of the remaining water in the water dipper said to VenRahula Rahula do you see this little bit of remaining water left in the water dipperYes sirThats how little of a contemplative there is in anyone who feels no shame at telling a deliberate lieHaving tossed away the little bit of remaining water the Blessed One said to VenRahula Rahula do you see how this little bit of remaining water is tossed awayYes sirRahula whatever there is of a contemplative in anyone who feels no shame at telling a deliberate lie is tossed away just like thatHaving turned the water dipper upside down the Blessed One said to VenRahula Rahula do you see how this water dipper is turned upside downYes sirRahula whatever there is of a contemplative in anyone who feels no shame at telling a deliberate lie is turned upside down just like thatHaving turned the water dipper rightside up the Blessed One said to VenRahula Rahula do you see how empty  hollow this water dipper isYes sirRahula whatever there is of a contemplative in anyone who feels no shame at telling a deliberate lie is empty  hollow just like thatRahula its like a royal elephant immense pedigreed accustomed to battles its tusks like chariot polesHaving gone into battle it uses its forefeet  hindfeet its forequarters  hindquarters its head  ears  tusks  tail but will simply hold back its trunkThe elephant trainer notices that and thinks This royal elephant has not given up its life to the king But when the royal elephant having gone into battle uses its forefeet  hindfeet its forequarters  hindquarters its head  ears  tusks  tail  his trunk the trainer notices that and thinks This royal elephant has given up its life to the kingThere is nothing it will not doIn the same way Rahula when anyone feels no shame in telling a deliberate lie there is no evil I tell you he will not doThus Rahula you should train yourself I will not tell a deliberate lie even in jestI do not say brahman that everything that has been seen should be spoken aboutNor do I say that everything that has been seen should not be spoken aboutI do not say that everything that has been heard everything that has been sensed everything that has been cognized should be spoken aboutNor do I say that everything that has been cognized should not be spoken aboutWhen for one who speaks of what has been seen unskillful mental qualities increase and skillful mental qualities decrease then that sort of thing should not be spoken aboutBut when for one who speaks of what has been seen unskillful mental qualities decrease and skillful mental qualities increase then that sort of thing should be spoken aboutWhen for one who speaks of what has been heard what has been sensed what has been cognized unskillful mental qualities increase and skillful mental qualities decrease then that sort of thing should not be spoken aboutBut when for one who speaks of what has been cognized unskillful mental qualities decrease and skillful mental qualities increase then that sort of thing should be spoken aboutThen Vassakara the brahman delighting  rejoicing in the Blessed Ones words got up from his seat and leftTell me Bharadvaja is there among the brahmans even one brahman who says This I know this I see only this is true anything else is worthless No Master GotamaAnd has there been among the brahmans even one teacher or teachers teacher back through seven generations who said This I know this I see only this is true anything else is worthless No Master GotamaAnd among the brahman seers of the past the creators of the hymns the composers of the hymns  those ancient hymns sung repeated  collected which brahmans at present still sing still chant repeating what was said repeating what was spoken  ie Atthaka Vamaka Vamadeva Vessamitta Yamataggi Angirasa Bharadvaja Vasettha Kassapa  Bhagu was there even one of these who said This we know this we see only this is true anything else is worthless No Master GotamaSo then Bharadvaja it seems that there isnt among the brahmans even one brahman who says This I know this I see only this is true anything else is worthless And there hasnt been among the brahmans even one teacher or teachers teacher back through seven generations who said This I know this I see only this is true anything else is worthless And there hasnt been among the brahman seers of the past the creators of the hymns the composers of the hymns even one who said This we know this we see only this is true anything else is worthless Suppose there were a row of blind men each holding on to the one in front of him the first one doesnt see the middle one doesnt see the last one doesnt seeIn the same way the statement of the brahmans turns out to be a row of blind men as it were the first one doesnt see the middle one doesnt see the last one doesnt seeSo what do you think Bharadvaja this being the case doesnt the conviction of the brahmans turn out to be groundlessIts not only out of conviction Master Gotama that the brahmans honor thisThey also honor it as unbroken traditionBharadvaja first you went by convictionNow you speak of unbroken traditionThere are five things that can turn out in two ways in the herenowWhich fiveConviction liking unbroken tradition reasoning by analogy  an agreement through pondering viewsThese are the five things that can turn out in two ways in the herenowNow some things are firmly held in conviction and yet vain empty  falseSome things are not firmly held in conviction and yet they are genuine factual  unmistakenSome things are wellliked truly an unbroken tradition wellreasoned Some things are wellpondered and yet vain empty  falseSome things are not wellpondered and yet they are genuine factual  unmistakenIn these cases it isnt proper for a knowledgeable person who safeguards the truth to come to a definite conclusion Only this is true anything else is worthlessBut to what extent Master Gotama is there the safeguarding of the truthTo what extent does one safeguard the truthWe ask Master Gotama about the safeguarding of the truthIf a person has conviction his statement This is my conviction safeguards the truthBut he doesnt yet come to the definite conclusion that Only this is true anything else is worthless To this extent Bharadvaja there is the safeguarding of the truthTo this extent one safeguards the truthI describe this as the safeguarding of the truthBut it is not yet an awakening to the truthIf a person likes something holds an unbroken tradition has something reasoned through analogy has something he agrees to having pondered views his statement This is what I agree to having pondered views safeguards the truthBut he doesnt yet come to the definite conclusion that Only this is true anything else is worthless To this extent Bharadvaja there is the safeguarding of the truthTo this extent one safeguards the truthI describe this as the safeguarding of the truthBut it is not yet an awakening to the truthYes Master Gotama to this extent there is the safeguarding of the truthTo this extent one safeguards the truthWe regard this as the safeguarding of the truthBut to what extent is there an awakening to the truthTo what extent does one awaken to the truthWe ask Master Gotama about awakening to the truthThere is the case Bharadvaja where a monk lives in dependence on a certain village or townThen a householder or householders son goes to him and observes him with regard to three mental qualities  qualities based on greed qualities based on aversion qualities based on delusion Are there in this venerable one any such qualities based on greed that with his mind overcome by these qualities he might say I know while not knowing or say I see while not seeing or that he might urge another to act in a way that was for hisher longterm harm  pain As he observes him he comes to know There are in this venerable one no such qualities based on greed His bodily behavior  verbal behavior are those of one not greedyAnd the Dhamma he teaches is deep hard to see hard to realize tranquil refined beyond the scope of conjecture subtle tobeexperienced by the wiseThis Dhamma cant easily be taught by a person whos greedyWhen on observing that the monk is purified with regard to qualities based on greed he next observes him with regard to qualities based on aversion based on delusion Are there in this venerable one any such qualities based on delusion that with his mind overcome by these qualities he might say I know while not knowing or say I see while not seeing or that he might urge another to act in a way that was for hisher longterm harm  pain As he observes him he comes to know There are in this venerable one no such qualities based on delusion His bodily behavior  verbal behavior are those of one not deludedAnd the Dhamma he teaches is deep hard to see hard to realize tranquil refined beyond the scope of conjecture subtle tobeexperienced by the wiseThis Dhamma cant easily be taught by a person whos deludedWhen on observing that the monk is purified with regard to qualities based on delusion he places conviction in himWith the arising of conviction he visits him  grows close to himGrowing close to him he lends earLending ear he hears the DhammaHearing the Dhamma he remembers itRemembering it he penetrates the meaning of those dhammasPenetrating the meaning he comes to an agreement through pondering those dhammasThere being an agreement through pondering those dhammas desire arisesWith the arising of desire he becomes willingWilling he contemplatesContemplating he makes an exertionExerting himself he both realizes the ultimate meaning of the truth with his body and sees by penetrating it with discernmentTo this extent Bharadvaja there is an awakening to the truthTo this extent one awakens to the truthI describe this as an awakening to the truthBut it is not yet the final attainment of the truthYes Master Gotama to this extent there is an awakening to the truthTo this extent one awakens to the truthWe regard this as an awakening to the truthBut to what extent is there the final attainment of the truthTo what extent does one finally attain the truthWe ask Master Gotama about the final attainment of the truthThe cultivation development  pursuit of those very same qualities to this extent Bharadvaja there is the final attainment of the truthTo this extent one finally attains the truthI describe this as the final attainment of the truthSo he posed himself a question Now that youve been born as a human being what is the highest thing you want in this world He then placed the following conditions on his answer In answering you have to be really honest and truthful with yourselfAnd once youve answered you have to hold to your answer as an unalterable law on which youve affixed your seal without ever letting a second seal be affixed on topSo what do you want and how do you want itYou have to give an honest answer understandI wont accept anything falseAnd once youve answered you have to keep to your answerDont be a traitor to yourselfWhen he was sure of his answer he said to himself I want only the highest and most certain happiness and ease the happiness that wont change into anything elseOther than that I dont want anything else in the worldOnce he had given this answer he kept to it firmlyHe didnt allow anything that would have caused the least bit of pain or distraction to his heart to get stuck there as a stain on itHe kept making a persistent effort with all his might to discover the truth without retreat until he finally awakened to that truth the reality of LiberationIf we search for the truth like the Buddha  if were true in our intent and true in what we do  theres no way the truth can escape usBut if we arent true to ourselves we wont find the true happiness the Buddha foundWe tell ourselves that we want to be happy but we go jumping into firesWe know what things are poison yet we go ahead and drink them anywayThis is called being a traitor to yourselfEvery person alive wants happiness  even common animals struggle to find happiness  but our actions for the most part arent in line with our intentionsThis is why we dont get to realize the happiness we want simply because theres no truth to usFor example when people come to the monastery If they come to make offerings observe the precepts and sit in meditation for the sake of praise or a good reputation theres no real merit to what theyre doingThey dont gain any real happiness from it so they end up disappointed and dissatisfiedThen they start saying that offerings precepts and meditation dont give any good resultsInstead of reflecting on the fact that they werent right and honest in doing these things they say that theres no real good to the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha that the Buddhas teachings are a lot of nonsense and liesBut actually the Buddhas teachings are an affair of the truthIf a person isnt true to the Buddhas teachings the Buddhas teachings wont be true to that person and that person wont be able to know what the Buddhas true teachings areWhen we practice virtue concentration and discernment its as if we were taking the jewels and robes of royalty and the Noble Ones to dress up our heart and make it beautifulBut if we arent true in our practice its like taking robes and jewels and giving them to a monkeyThe monkey is bound to get them dirty and tear them to shreds because it has no sense of beauty at allWhoever sees this kind of thing happening is sure to see right through it that its a monkey showEven though the costumes are genuine the monkey inside isnt genuine like the costumesFor instance if you take a soldiers cap and uniform to dress it up as a soldier its a soldier only as far as the cap and uniform but the monkey inside is still a monkey and not a soldier at allFor this reason the Buddha teaches us to be true in whatever we do  to be true in being generous true in being virtuous true in developing concentration and discernmentDont play around at these thingsIf youre true then these activities are sure to bear you the fruits of your own truthfulness without a doubt Ajaan Lee There is the case where a noble disciple abandoning the taking of life abstains from taking lifeIn doing so he gives freedom from danger freedom from animosity freedom from oppression to limitless numbers of beingsIn giving freedom from danger freedom from animosity freedom from oppression to limitless numbers of beings he gains a share in limitless freedom from danger freedom from animosity and freedom from oppressionThis is the first gift the first great gift  original longstanding traditional ancient unadulterated unadulterated from the beginning  that is not open to suspicion will never be open to suspicion and is unfaulted by knowledgeable contemplatives  brahmansFurthermore abandoning taking what is not given the noble disciple abstains from taking what is not givenIn doing so he gives freedom from danger freedom from animosity freedom from oppression to limitless numbers of beingsIn giving freedom from danger freedom from animosity freedom from oppression to limitless numbers of beings he gains a share in limitless freedom from danger freedom from animosity and freedom from oppressionThis is the second gift the second great giftFurthermore abandoning illicit sex the noble disciple abstains from illicit sexIn doing so he gives freedom from danger freedom from animosity freedom from oppression to limitless numbers of beingsIn giving freedom from danger freedom from animosity freedom from oppression to limitless numbers of beings he gains a share in limitless freedom from danger freedom from animosity and freedom from oppressionThis is the third gift the third great giftFurthermore abandoning lying the noble disciple abstains from lyingIn doing so he gives freedom from danger freedom from animosity freedom from oppression to limitless numbers of beingsIn giving freedom from danger freedom from animosity freedom from oppression to limitless numbers of beings he gains a share in limitless freedom from danger freedom from animosity and freedom from oppressionThis is the fourth gift the fourth great giftFurthermore abandoning the use of intoxicants the noble disciple abstains from taking intoxicantsIn doing so he gives freedom from danger freedom from animosity freedom from oppression to limitless numbers of beingsIn giving freedom from danger freedom from animosity freedom from oppression to limitless numbers of beings he gains a share in limitless freedom from danger freedom from animosity and freedom from oppressionThis is the fifth gift the fifth great gift  original longstanding traditional ancient unadulterated unadulterated from the beginning  that is not open to suspicion will never be open to suspicion and is unfaulted by knowledgeable contemplatives  brahmansAnd how is one made pure in four ways by verbal actionThere is the case where a certain person abandoning false speech abstains from false speechWhen he has been called to a town meeting a group meeting a gathering of his relatives his guild or of the royalty if he is asked as a witness Come  tell good man what you know If he doesnt know he says I dont know If he does know he says I know If he hasnt seen he says I havent seen If he has seen he says I have seen Thus he doesnt consciously tell a lie for his own sake for the sake of another or for the sake of any rewardAbandoning false speech he abstains from false speechHe speaks the truth holds to the truth is firm reliable no deceiver of the worldAbandoning divisive speech he abstains from divisive speechWhat he has heard here he does not tell there to break those people apart from these people hereWhat he has heard there he does not tell here to break these people apart from those people thereThus reconciling those who have broken apart or cementing those who are united he loves concord delights in concord enjoys concord speaks things that create concordAbandoning abusive speech he abstains from abusive speechHe speaks words that are soothing to the ear that are affectionate that go to the heart that are polite appealing  pleasing to people at largeAbandoning idle chatter he abstains from idle chatterHe speaks in season speaks what is factual what is in accordance with the goal the Dhamma  the VinayaHe speaks words worth treasuring seasonable reasonable circumscribed connected with the goalThis is how one is made pure in four ways by verbal actionAnd how is one made pure in three ways by mental actionThere is the case where a certain person is not covetousHe does not covet the belongings of others thinking O that what belongs to others would be mine He bears no ill will and is not corrupt in the resolves of his heartMay these beings be free from animosity free from oppression free from trouble and may they look after themselves with ease He has right view and is not warped in the way he sees things There is what is given what is offered what is sacrificedThere are fruits  results of good  bad actionsThere is this world  the next worldThere is mother  fatherThere are spontaneously reborn beings there are contemplatives  brahmans who faring rightly  practicing rightly proclaim this world  the next after having directly known  realized it for themselves This is how one is made pure in three ways by mental actionHetthimasilanormalcy of word and deed which consists of three kinds of bodily acts  not killing not stealing not engaging in sexual misconduct and four kinds of speech  not lying not speaking divisively not saying anything coarse or abusive not speaking idlyIf we class virtue on this level according to the wording of the precepts and the groups of people who observe them there are four  the five precepts the eight the ten and the preceptsAll of these deal with aspects of behavior that should be abandoned termed pahanakiccaAt the same time the Buddha directed us to develop good manners and proper conduct in the use of the four necessities of life  food clothing shelter and medicine  so that our conduct in terms of thought word and deed will be orderly and becomingThis aspect is termed bhavanakicca behavior we should work at developing correctlyObservance of these precepts or rules  dealing merely with words and deeds  forms the lower or preliminary level of virtue which is what makes us into fullfledged human beingsMajjhimasilathe medium level of virtue ie keeping watch over your words and deeds so that they cause no harm and in addition keeping watch over your thoughts so as to keep your mental kamma upright in three ways aAnabhijjhavisamalobha not coveting things that do not belong to you and that lie beyond your scope or powers not focusing your thoughts on such things not building what are called castles in the airThe Buddha taught us to tend to the wealth we already have so that it can grow on its ownThe wealth we already have if we use our intelligence and ingenuity will draw more wealth our way without our having to waste energy by being covetous or greedyFor example suppose we have a single banana tree If we water it give it fertilizer loosen the soil around its roots and protect it from dangers our single banana tree will eventually give rise to an increase of other banana treesIn other words if were intelligent we can turn whatever wealth we have into a basis for a livelihoodBut if we lack intelligence  if our hearts simply want to get without wanting work  then even if we acquire a great deal of wealth we wont be able to support ourselvesThus greed of this sort in which we focus our desires above and beyond our capacities is classed as a wrong kind of mental actionbAbyapada abandoning thoughts of ill will hatred and vengeance and developing thoughts of good will instead thinking of the good aspects of the people who have angered usWhen people make us angry it comes from the fact that our dealings with them  in which we associate with and assist one another  sometimes lead to disappointmentThis gives rise to dislike and irritation which in turn cause us to brood so that we develop hurt feelings that grow into anger and thoughts of retaliationThus we should regard such people from many angles for ordinarily as human beings they should have somegood to themIf they dont act well toward us they may at least speak well to usOr if they dont act or speak well to us perhaps their thoughts may be wellmeaning to at least some extentThus when you find your thoughts heading in the direction of anger or dislike you should sit down and think in two ways Try to think of whatever ways that person has been good to youWhen these things come to mind theyll give rise to feelings of affection love and good willThis is one wayAnger is something worthless like the scum floating on the surface of a lakeIf were stupid we wont get to drink the clean water lying underneath or if we drink the scum we may catch a diseaseA person who is bad to you is like someone sunk in filthIf youre stupid enough to hate or be angry with such people its as if you wanted to go sit in the filth with themIs that what you wantThink about this until any thoughts of ill will and anger disappearcSammaditthiabandoning wrong views and mental darknessIf our minds lack the proper training and education we may come to think that we and all other living beings are born simply as accidents of nature that father and mother have no special meaning that good and evil dont existSuch views deviate from the truthThey can dissuade us from restraining the evil that lies within us and from searching for and fostering the goodTo believe that theres no good or evil that death is annihilation is Wrong View  a product of shortsighted thinking and poor discernment seeing things for what they arentSo we should abandon such views and educate ourselves searching for knowledge of the Dhamma and associating with people wiser than we so that they can show us the bright pathWell then be able to reform our views and make them Right which is one form of mental uprightnessVirtue on this level when we can maintain it well will qualify us to be heavenly beingsThe qualities of heavenly beings which grow out of human values will turn us into human beings who are divine in our virtues for to guard our thoughts words and deeds means that we qualify for heaven in this lifetimeThis is one aspect of the merit developed by a person who observes the middle level of virtueUparimasila higher virtue where virtue merges with the Dhamma in the area of mental activityThere are two sides to higher virtue aPAHANAKICCA qualities to be abandoned which are of five sorts  Kamachanda affection desire laxity infatuation Byapada ill will and hatred Thīnamiddha discouragement drowsiness sloth Uddhaccakukkucca restlessness and anxiety Vicikicchadoubt uncertainty indecisionIll will lies at the essence of killing for it causes us to destroy our own goodness and that of others  and when our mind can kill off our own goodness whats to keep us from killing other people and animals as wellRestlessness lies at the essence of taking what isnt givenThe mind wanders about taking hold of other peoples affairs sometimes their good points sometimes their badTo fasten onto their good points isnt too serious for it can give us at least somenourishmentAs long as were going to steal other peoples business and make it our own we might as well take their silver and goldTheir bad points though are like trash theyve thrown away  scraps and bones with nothing of any substance  and yet even so we let the mind feed on themWhen we know that other people are possessive of their bad points and guard them well and yet we still take hold of these things to think about it should be classed as a form of taking what isnt givenSensual desires lie at the essence of sensual misconductThe mind feels an attraction for sensual objects  thoughts of past or future sights sounds smells tastes or tactile sensations  or for sensual defilements  passion aversion or delusion  to the point where we forget ourselvesMental states such as these can be said to overstep the bounds of propriety in sensual mattersDoubt lies at the essence of lyingIn other words our minds are unsure with nothing reliable or true to themWe have no firm principles and so drift along under the influence of all kinds of thoughts and preoccupationsDrowsiness is intoxication  discouragement dullness forgetfulness with no mindfulness or restraint watching over the mindThis is what it means to be drugged or drunkAll of these unskillful qualities are things we should eliminate by training the heart along the lines ofbBHAVANAKICCA qualities to be developed MindfulnessStart out by directing your thoughts to an object such as your inandout breathingUse mindfulness to steady the mind in its object throughout both the inbreath and the outVitakka thinking in this way is what kills off sensual desires in that the discipline of mindfulness keeps the mind from slipping off into external objectsVicaraEvaluate and be observantMake yourself aware of whether or not youve received a sense of comfort and relaxation from your in and outbreathingIf not tend to the breath and adjust it in a variety of ways eg in long and out long in long and out short in short and out short in short and out long in slow and out slow in fast and out fast in gently and out gently in strong and out strong in throughout the body and out throughout the bodyAdjust the breath until it gives good results to both body and mind and youll be able to kill off feelings of ill will and hatredPitiWhen you get good results  for instance when the subtle breath sensations in the body merge and flow together permeating the entire sense of the body  the breath is like an electric wire the various parts of the body such as the bones are like electricity poles mindfulness and alertness are like a power source and awareness is thus bright and radiantBoth body and mind feel satisfied and fullThis is piti or rapture which can kill off feelings of drowsinessSukha Now that feelings of restlessness and anxiety have disappeared a sense of pleasure and ease arises for both body and mindThis pleasure is what kills off restlessnessEkaggata Doubts and uncertainty fade into the distanceThe mind reaches singleness of preoccupation in a state of normalcy and equilibriumThis normalcy of mind which is maintained through the power of the discipline of mindfulness forms the essence of virtue firmness steadiness stabilityAnd the resulting flavor or nourishment of virtue is a solitary sense of calm for the mindWhen freedom of this sort arises within us this is called the development of silanussati the mindfulness of virtueThis is virtue that attains excellence  leading to the paths their fruitions and nibbana  and thus can be called uparimasila higher virtueTo summarize there are three levels of virtue external intermediate and internalIn ultimate terms however there are two Mundane virtue virtue connected with the world in which we maintain the principles of ordinary human morality but are as yet unable to reach the transcendent levels stream entry oncereturning nonreturning and arahantshipWe cant yet cut the Fetters that tie the heart to the influences of all the worldsThis is thus called mundane virtueTranscendent virtue virtue thats constant and sure going straight to the heart bathing the heart with its nourishmentThis arises from the practice of tranquility meditation and insight meditationTranquility meditation forms the cause and insight meditation the result discovering the true nature of the properties aggregates and senses seeing clearly the four Noble Truths in proportion to our practice of the Path and abandoning the first three of the Fetters aSakkayaditthi views that see the body or the aggregates as in the self or as belonging to the selfOrdinarily we may be convinced that views of this sort are mistaken yet we cant really abandon themBut when we clearly see that theyre wrong for sure this is called Right View  seeing things as they truly are  which can eliminate such wrong views as seeing the body as belonging to the self or the self as the five aggregates or the five aggregates as in the selfbVicikiccha doubt about whats genuine and true and whats counterfeit and falseThe power of Right View allows us to see that the quality to which we awaken exists at all times and that the true qualities enabling us to awaken also exist and are made effective through the power of the practices were followingOur knowledge is definite and trueOur doubts about the virtues of the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha are cleared up for goodThis is called becoming a niyatapuggala a person who is certain and surecSilabbataparamasa When the heart abandons this Fetter it no longer fondles theories concerning moral virtue its no longer stuck merely on the level of manners and activitiesGood and evil are accomplished through the heart activities are something separateEven though people who reach this level do good  taking the precepts making gifts and offerings or meditating in line with the good customs of the world  theyre not caught up on any of these things because their hearts have reached the nourishment of virtueThey arent stuck on the particulars ie their activities nor are they stuck on the purpose ie the meaning or intent of their various good mannersTheir hearts dwell in the nourishment of virtue tranquility stability normalcy of mindJust as a person who has felt the nourishment that comes from food permeating his body isnt stuck on either the food or its flavor  because hes received the benefits of the nourishment it provides  in the same way the hearts of people who have reached the essence of virtue are no longer stuck on activities or manners particulars or purposes because theyve tasted virtues nourishmentThis is thus classed as transcendent virtue the first stage of nibbanaEven though such people may be destined for further rebirth theyre special people apart from the ordinaryAnyone whose practice reaches this level can be counted as fortunate as having received dependable wealth like ingots of goldJust as gold can be used as currency all over the world because it has special value for all human beings  unlike paper currency whose use is limited to specific countries  in the same way a heart that has truly attained virtue has a value in this life that will remain constant in lives to comeThus a person who has reached this level has received part of the Noble Wealth of those who practice the religion Ajaan Lee Then the Blessed One as soon as he perceived with his awareness the train of thought in VenSonas awareness disappeared from Vulture Peak Mountain  just as a strong man might extend his flexed arm or flex his extended arm  appeared in the Cool Wood right in front of VenSona and sat down on a prepared seatVenSona after bowing down to the Blessed One sat to one sideAs he was sitting there the Blessed One said to him Just now as you were meditating in seclusion didnt this train of thought appear to your awareness Of the Blessed Ones disciples who have aroused their persistence I am one but my mind is not released from fermentations What if I were to disavow the training return to the lower life enjoy wealth  make merit Yes lordNow what do you think SonaBefore when you were a housedweller were you skilled at playing the vinaYes lordAnd what do you think when the strings of your vina were too taut was your vina in tune  playableNo lordAnd what do you think when the strings of your vina were too loose was your vina in tune  playableNo lordAnd what do you think when the strings of your vina were neither too taut nor too loose but tuned to be right on pitch was your vina in tune  playableYes lordIn the same way Sona overaroused persistence leads to restlessness overly slack persistence leads to lazinessThus you should determine the right pitch for your persistence attune the pitch of the faculties and there pick up your themeYes lord VenSona answered the Blessed OneThen having given this exhortation to VenSona the Blessed One  as a strong man might extend his flexed arm or flex his extended arm  disappeared from the Cool Wood and appeared on Vulture Peak MountainSo after that VenSona determined the right pitch for his persistence attuned the pitch of the faculties and there picked up his themeDwelling alone secluded heedful ardent  resolute he in no long time reached  remained in the supreme goal of the holy life for which clansmen rightly go forth from home into homelessness knowing  realizing it for himself in the here  nowHe knew Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task doneThere is nothing further for the sake of this world And thus VenSona became

gift attentively he  wherever the result of that gift ripens  is rich with much wealth with many possessionsAnd his children wives slaves servants and workers listen carefully to him lend him their ears and serve him with understanding heartsHaving given a gift in season he  wherever the result of that gift ripens  is rich with much wealth with many possessionsAnd his goals are fulfilled in seasonHaving given a gift with an empathetic heart he  wherever the result of that gift ripens  is rich with much wealth with many possessionsAnd his mind inclines to the enjoyment of the five strings of lavish sensualityHaving given a gift without adversely affecting himself or others he  wherever the result of that gift ripens  is rich with much wealth with many possessionsAnd not from anywhere does destruction come to his property  whether from fire from water from kings from thieves or from hateful heirsThese five are a person of integritys gifts nor with the thought Giving is good nor with the thought This was given in the past done in the past by my father  grandfatherIt would not be right for me to let this old family custom be discontinued nor with the thought I am welloffThese are not welloffIt would not be right for me being welloff not to give a gift to those who are not welloff nor with the thought Just as there were the great sacrifices of the sages of the past  Atthaka Vamaka Vamadeva Vessamitta Yamataggi Angirasa Bharadvaja Vasettha Kassapa  Bhagu  in the same way this will be my distribution of gifts nor with the thought When this gift of mine is given it makes the mind sereneGratification  joy arise  but with the thought This is an ornament for the mind a support for the mind  on the breakup of the body after death one reappears in the company of Brahmas RetinueThen having exhausted that action that power that status that sovereignty one is a nonreturner and does not come back to this worldThis Sariputta is the cause this is the reason why a person gives a gift of a certain sort and it does not bear great fruit or great benefit whereas another person gives a gift of the same sort and it bears great fruit and great benefitAnd which are the three factors of the donorThere is the case where the donor before giving is glad while giving hisher mind is bright  clear and after giving is gratifiedThese are the three factors of the donorAnd which are the three factors of the recipientsThere is the case where the recipients are free of passion or are practicing for the subduing of passion free of aversion or practicing for the subduing of aversion and free of delusion or practicing for the subduing of delusionThese are the three factors of the recipientsJust as it is not easy to take the measure of the great ocean as just this many buckets of water just this many hundreds of buckets of water just this many thousands of buckets of water or just this many hundreds of thousands of buckets of water It is simply reckoned as a great mass of water incalculable immeasurableIn the same way it is not easy to take the measure of the merit of a donation thus endowed with six factors as just this much a bonanza of merit a bonanza of what is skillful  a nutriment of bliss heavenly resulting in bliss leading to heaven  that leads to what is desirable pleasing charming beneficial pleasant It is simply reckoned as a great mass of merit incalculable immeasurableFurthermore good people people of integrity admire one who is generous a master of giving this too is a fruit of generosity visible in the here  nowFurthermore the fine reputation of one who is generous a master of giving is spread far  wide this too is a fruit of generosity visible in the here  nowFurthermore when one who is generous a master of giving approaches any assembly of people  noble warriors brahmans householders or contemplatives  heshe does so confidently  without embarrassment this too is a fruit of generosity visible in the here  nowFurthermore at the breakup of the body after death one who is generous a master of giving reappears in a good destination the heavenly world this is a fruit of generosity in the next lifeSo when you develop yourself so as to gain the discernment that sees how worldly things are undependable and unsure dont let your property  your worldly possessions  sit idleThe Buddha teaches us to plant crops on our land so that we can benefit from itIf you dont make use of your land its sure to fall into other peoples handsIn other words when we stake out a claim to a piece of property we should plant it full of cropsOtherwise the government wont recognize our claim and well lose our rights to itEven if we take the case to court we wont have a chance to winSo once you see the weakness of an idle claim you should hurry up and plant crops on it so that the government will recognize your claim and issue you a title to the landWhat this means is that we should make use of our material possessions by being generous with them using them in a way that develops the inner wealth of generosity within usThis way they become the kind of wealth over which we have full rights and that will benefit us even into future lifetimes Ajaan Lee As a first step were taught dana  to be generous to give donations  as a strategy for getting us to learn how to let goThe next step is caga  renouncing rights of possession  which is letting go at a higher level than danaAnd finally on a more refined level were taught to relinquish all our upadhi or the acquisitiondefilements in the mindThis is the level on which we examine and explore until we can gain total releaseDana means giving away material thingsIf we dont give them away theyre hard to let goFor the most part if we dont give things away we hold rights over them and regard them as belonging to usBut if we give them away we no longer have any rights over themThings we hold onto are dangerousThey can cause us harmThey cause harm to people who steal them from usAnd once those people have stolen them then they claim rights over themThe Buddha saw these dangers which is why he taught us to be generous to learn how to give things awayPeople who develop the habit of being generous reap many rewardsTheir act of generosity comes back to them both in the present and on into the futureThey have lots of friendsOther people trust themTheir hearts are light  they arent weighed down with worries about looking after the things theyve given awayAnd these same results will keep coming in the future just as when we have a bucket of rice grains if we plant them in a field well reap ten buckets of rice in returnThe same holds true with the goodness we develop in this lifetimeIt gives enormous returnsThats how people of discernment understand itCaga is the next stepDana is something that even crazy people can do but caga is a type of giving that only wise people can do because their sense of personal possession has to end immediately in the act of givingThey see that all material things are common property things dont really belong to us they dont really belong to other peopleIf you see things as belonging to you thats addiction to sensualityIf you see things as belonging to others thats addiction to selfafflictionWhen were born we didnt bring anything along with us when we cameWhen we die we wont take anything along when we goSo what really belongs to usOur sense of possession has to fall away from the heart if our giving is to count as cagaThe third level of letting go is relinquishing whats in the heartWhether or not we give things away we let go of them in the heart every dayWe let go of the things we haveWe let go of the things we dont haveJust as a person has to wash his mouth and hands every day after he eats if he wants to stay clean at all timesWhat this means is that were not willing to let anything act as an enemy to the heart by making us stingy or graspingIf we dont do this were the type of person who doesnt wash up after a mealWere not cleanWe stay asleep without ever waking upBut when we let go in this way its called viragadhammaor dispassionThe lower levels of letting go are things we can do only from time to timeDispassion is something we can develop always Ajaan Lee So it is AnandaSo it isEven I myself before my selfawakening when I was still an unawakened Bodhisatta thought Renunciation is goodSeclusion is good But my heart didnt leap up at renunciation didnt grow confident steadfast or firm seeing it as peaceThe thought occurred to me What is the cause what is the reason why my heart doesnt leap up at renunciation doesnt grow confident steadfast or firm seeing it as peace Then the thought occurred to me I havent seen the drawback of sensual pleasures I havent pursuedI havent understood the reward of renunciation I havent familiarized myself with itThats why my heart doesnt leap up at renunciation doesnt grow confident steadfast or firm seeing it as peaceThen the thought occurred to me If having seen the drawback of sensual pleasures I were to pursue that theme and if having understood the reward of renunciation I were to familiarize myself with it theres the possibility that my heart would leap up at renunciation grow confident steadfast  firm seeing it as peaceSo at a later time having seen the drawback of sensual pleasures I pursued that theme having understood the reward of renunciation I familiarized myself with itMy heart leaped up at renunciation grow confident steadfast  firm seeing it as peaceThen quite withdrawn from sensuality withdrawn from unskillful qualities I entered  remained in the first jhana rapture  pleasure born of seclusion accompanied by directed thought  evaluationAs I remained there I was beset with attention to perceptions dealing with sensualityThat was an affliction for meJust as pain arises as an affliction for a healthy person even so the attention to perceptions dealing with sensuality that beset me was an affliction for meYes young manI have slept in easeOf those in the world who sleep in ease I am oneBut cold lord is the winter nightThe BetweentheEights is a time of snowfallHard is the ground trampled by cattle hoovesThin is the spread of leavesSparse are the leaves in the treesThin are your ochre robesAnd cold blows the Veramba windYet still the Blessed One says Yes young manI have slept in easeOf those in the world who sleep in ease I am one In that case young man I will question you in returnAnswer as you see fitNow what do you think Suppose a householder or householders son has a house with a gabled roof plastered inside  out draftfree with closefitting door  windows shut against the windInside he has a horsehair couch spread with a longfleeced coverlet a white wool coverlet an embroidered coverlet a rug of kadalideer hide with a canopy above  red cushions on either sideAnd there a lamp would be burning and his four wives with their many charms would be attending to himWould he sleep in ease or notOr how does this strike youYes lord he would sleep in easeOf those in the world who sleep in ease he would be oneBut what do you think young manMight there arise in that householder or householders son any bodily fevers or fevers of mind born of passion so that  burned with those passionborn fevers  he would sleep miserablyYes lordAs for those passionborn fevers  burned with which the householder or householders son would sleep miserably  that passion has been abandoned by the Tathagata its root destroyed made like a palmyra stump deprived of the conditions of existence not destined for future arisingTherefore he sleeps in easeReflecting appropriately he uses alms food not playfully nor for intoxication nor for putting on bulk nor for beautification but simply for the survival  continuance of this body for ending its afflictions for the support of the holy life thinking Thus will I destroy old feelings and not create new feelingsI will maintain myself be blameless  live in comfortReflecting appropriately he uses lodging simply to counteract cold to counteract heat to counteract the touch of flies mosquitoes wind sun  reptiles simply for protection from the inclemencies of weather and for the enjoyment of seclusionReflecting appropriately he uses medicinal requisites that are used for curing the sick simply to counteract any pains of illness that have arisen and for maximum freedom from diseaseSuppose that a fletcher were to heat  warm an arrow shaft between two flames making it straight  pliableThen at a later time he would no longer heat  warm the shaft between two flames making it straight  pliableWhy is thatBecause he has attained the goal for which he was heating  warming the shaft In the same way the monk no longer exerts himself with stress  painWhy is thatBecause he has attained the goal for which he was exerting himself with stress  painThen the Blessed One told a certain monk Come monkIn my name call Bhaddiya saying The Teacher calls you my friend As you say lord the monk answered and having gone to VenBhaddiya on arrival he said The Teacher calls you my friendAs you say my friend VenBhaddiya repliedThen he went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one sideAs he was sitting there the Blessed One said to him Is it true Bhaddiya that on going to a forest to the foot of a tree or to an empty dwelling you repeatedly exclaim What blissWhat blissYes lordWhat meaning do you have in mind that you repeatedly exclaim What blissWhat blissBefore when I has a householder maintaining the bliss of kingship I had guards posted within and without the royal apartments within and without the city within and without the countrysideBut even though I was thus guarded thus protected I dwelled in fear  agitated distrustful and afraidBut now on going alone to a forest to the foot of a tree or to an empty dwelling I dwell without fear unagitated confident and unafraid  unconcerned unruffled my wants satisfied with my mind like a wild deerThis is the meaning I have in mind that I repeatedly exclaim What blissWhat blissThen Mara the Evil One went to the Blessed One and recited this verse in his presenceThe BuddhaThen Mara the Evil One  sad  dejected at realizing The Blessed One knows me the One WellGone knows me  vanished right thereVenYasojaVenVakkaliSo Kali the slave got up after daybreakThen Lady Vedehika said to her Hey KaliYes madamWhy did you get up after daybreakNo reason madamNo reason you wicked slave and yet you get up after daybreak Angered  displeased she scowledThen the thought occurred to Kali the slave Anger is present in my lady without showing and not absentAnd its just because Im diligent deft  neat in my work that the anger present in my lady doesnt showWhy dont I test her some moreSo Kali the slave got up later in the dayThen Lady Vedehika said to her Hey KaliYes madamWhy did you get up later in the dayNo reason madamNo reason you wicked slave and yet you get up later in the day Angered  displeased she grumbledThen the thought occurred to Kali the slave Anger is present in my lady without

ladies the gentle ones handiworkSee the eventempered ones handiworkSee the calm ones handiworkHow could she angered  displeased with her only slave for getting up after daybreak grab hold of a rolling pin and give her a whack over the head cutting it openAfter that this evil report about Lady Vedehika circulated Lady Vedehika is viciousLady Vedehika is foultemperedLady Vedehika is violentIn the same way monks a monk may be ever so gentle ever so eventempered ever so calm as long as he is not touched by disagreeable aspects of speechBut it is only when disagreeable aspects of speech touch him that he can truly be known as gentle eventempered  calmI dont call a monk easy to admonish if he is easy to admonish and makes himself easy to admonish only by reason of robes almsfood lodging  medicinal requisites for curing the sickWhy is thatBecause if he doesnt get robes almsfood lodging  medicinal requisites for curing the sick then he isnt easy to admonish and doesnt make himself easy to admonishBut if a monk is easy to admonish and makes himself easy to admonish purely out of esteem for the Dhamma respect for the Dhamma reverence for the Dhamma then I call him easy to admonishThus

these five hindrances corruptions of awareness that weaken discernment then  quite secluded from sensuality secluded from unskillful qualities  he enters  remains in the first jhana rapture  pleasure born of seclusion accompanied by directed thought  evaluationWith the stilling of directed thoughts  evaluations he enters  remains in the second jhana rapture  pleasure born of concentration unification of awareness free from directed thought  evaluation  internal assuranceWith the fading of rapture he remains equanimous mindful  alert and senses pleasure with the bodyHe enters  remains in the third jhana of which the Noble Ones declare Equanimous  mindful he has a pleasant abiding With the abandoning of pleasure  pain  as with the earlier disappearance of elation  distress  he enters  remains in the fourth jhana purity of equanimity  mindfulness neither pleasure nor painWith his mind thus concentrated purified  bright unblemished free from defects pliant malleable steady  attained to imperturbability he directs and inclines it to the knowledge of the ending of the fermentationsHe discerns as it has come to be that This is stress This is the origination of stress This is the cessation of stress This is the way leading to the cessation of stress These are fermentations This is the origination of fermentations This is the cessation of fermentations This is the way leading to the cessation of fermentations His heart thus knowing thus seeing is released from the fermentation of sensuality the fermentation of becoming the fermentation of ignoranceWith release there is the knowledge Released He discerns that Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task doneThere is nothing further for this worldThis for him is victory in the battleThis individual I tell you is like the warrior who can handle the cloud of dust the top of the enemys banner the tumult  handtohand combatOn winning the battle victorious in battle he comes out at the very head of the battleSome individuals are like thisThis is the fifth type of warriorlike individual who can be found existing among the monksThese are the five warriorlike individuals who can be found existing among the monksAnd what are the fermentations to be abandoned by avoidingThere is the case where a monk reflecting appropriately avoids a wild elephant a wild horse a wild bull a wild dog a snake a stump a bramble patch a chasm a cliff a cesspool an open sewerReflecting appropriately he avoids sitting in the sorts of unsuitable seats wandering to the sorts of unsuitable habitats and associating with the sorts of bad friends that would make his knowledgeable friends in the holy life suspect him of evil conductThe fermentations vexation or fever that would arise if he were not to avoid these things do not arise for him when he avoids themThese are called the fermentations to be abandoned by avoidingAnd what are the fermentations to be abandoned by destroyingThere is the case where a monk reflecting appropriately does not tolerate an arisen thought of sensualityHe abandons it destroys it dispels it  wipes it out of existenceReflecting appropriately he does not tolerate an arisen thought of ill willReflecting appropriately he does not tolerate an arisen thought of crueltyReflecting appropriately he does not tolerate arisen evil unskillful mental qualitiesHe abandons them destroys them dispels them  wipes them out of existenceThe fermentations vexation or fever that would arise if he were not to destroy these things do not arise for him when he destroys themThese are called the fermentations to be abandoned by destroyingSo when were intent on training our minds to be good there are bound to be obstacles  the forces of Mara  just as in the case of the Buddha but we simply have to slash our way through them using our powers of endurance and the full extent of our abilities to fight them offIts only normal that when we have something good there are going to be other people who want what weve got in the same way that sweet fruit tends to have worms and insects trying to eat itA person walking along the road emptyhanded doesnt attract anyones attention but if were carrying something of value there are sure to be others who will want what weve got and will even try to steal it from usIf were carrying food in our hand dogs or cats will try to snatch itBut if we dont have any food in our hand they wont pounce on usIts the same way when we practiceWhen we do good we have to contend with obstacles if we want to succeedWe have to make our hearts hard and solid like diamond or rock which dont burn when you try to set them on fireEven when they get smashed the pieces maintain their hardness as diamond and rockThe Buddha made his heart so hard and solid that when his body was cremated parts of it didnt burn and still remain as relics for us to admire even todayThis was through the power of his purity and truthfulnessSo we should set our minds on purifying our bodies and minds until they become so truly elemental that fire wont burn them just like the Buddhas relicsEven if we cant get them to be that hard at least we should make them like tamarind seeds in their casing even if insects bore through the casing and eat all the flesh of the tamarind fruit they cant do anything to the seeds which maintain their hardness as always Ajaan Lee And what is unworldly equanimityThere is the case where with the abandoning of pleasure  pain  as with the earlier disappearance of elation  distress  one enters  remains in the fourth jhana purity of equanimity  mindfulness neither pleasure nor painThis is called unworldly equanimityAnd what is an even more unworldly unworldly equanimityAny equanimity that arises in one free from fermentation while heshe is reflecting on hisher mind that is released from greed released from aversion released from delusion this is called an even more unworldly unworldly equanimityAnd what is equanimity coming from multiplicity dependent on multiplicityThere is equanimity with regard to forms equanimity with regard to sounds smells tastes tactile sensationsThis is equanimity coming from multiplicity dependent on multiplicityAnd what is equanimity coming from singleness dependent on singlenessThere is equanimity dependent on the sphere of the infinitude of space equanimity dependent on the sphere of the infinitude of consciousness dependent on the sphere of nothingness dependent on the sphere of neither perception nor nonperceptionThis is equanimity coming from singleness dependent on singlenessBy depending  relying on equanimity coming from singleness dependent on singleness abandon  transcend equanimity coming from multiplicity dependent on multiplicitySuch is its abandoning such its transcendingBy depending  relying on nonfashioning abandon  transcend the equanimity coming from singleness dependent on singlenessSuch is its abandoning such its transcendingAnd another thing If you put the zero after other numbers they become ten twenty thirty forty fifty hundreds thousands on to infinityBut if you put the zeros first even if you have ten thousand of them they dont countSo it is with the heart Once weve turned it from one to zero and put the zero first then other people can praise or criticize us as they like but it wont countGood doesnt count bad doesnt countThis is something that cant be written cant be read that we can understand only for ourselves Ajaan Lee If it is possible to live with a purpose what should that purpose beA purpose might be a guiding principle a philosophy or a value of sovereign importance that informs and directs our activities and thoughtsTo have one is to live seriously  though not necessarily wisely  following some track believing in a hub to the wheeling universe or a sea toward which we flow or an end before which all the hubbub of civilization subsidesWhat is your purpose friend or what should it bePerhaps most of us do not come to a clear conclusion in the matter but this does not mean we have no purpose only that we do not recognize it or admit it or even choose it for ourselvesIn the unhappiest case nature simply takes its course which is a turbid meandering through the swamps of desireIf life means nothing then only pleasure is worthwhile or if life has meaning and we cannot get at it then still only enjoyment matters  such is the view of brutes and some sophisticated philosophersIt slips into the unconscious by default when we hold no other but we are reluctant to entertain it and will rather if we think about it take as our purpose support of family search for beauty improvement of society fame selfexpression development of talent and so onBut it might be fair to say that apart from these or beneath these the fundamental purpose of many of us is the search for love particularly romantic loveThe love of a man for a woman and a woman for a man is often the floor to which people fall after the collapse of other dreamsIt is held to be solid when nothing else is and though it frequently gives way and dumps them into a basement of despair it still enjoys a reputation of dependabilityNo matter that this reputation is illogical  it still flourishes and will continue to flourish regardless of what is said in any bookLove or possibly the myth of love is the first last and sometimes the only refuge of uncomprehending humanityWhat else makes our hearts beat so fastWhat else makes us swoon with feelingWhat else renders us so intensely alive and achingThe search for love  the sublime the nebulous the consuming  remains sacred in a world that increasingly despises the sacredWhen the heroic and the transcendental are but memories when religious institutions fill up with bureaucrats and social scientists when nobody believes there is a sky beyond the ceiling then there seems no other escape from the prison of self than the abandon of loveWith a gray age of spiritual deadness upon us we love or beg for love or grieve for loveWe have nothing higher to live forIndeed many take it on faith that romantic love is the highest thing to live forPopular literature movies art and music tirelessly celebrate it as the one truth accessible to allSuch love obliterates reason as poets have long sweetly lamented and this is part of its charm and power because we want to be swept up and spirited out of our calculating selvesWant is the key word for in the spiritual void of modern life the wanting of love becomes increasingly indistinguishable from love itselfSo powerful so insistent is it that we seldom notice that the gratification is rare and the craving relentlessLove is mostly in anticipation it is an agony of anticipation it is an ache for a completion not found in the dreary round of mundane routineThat we never seem to possess it in its imagined fullness does not deter usIt hurts so bad that it must be goodPractically nobody questions the supremacy of romantic love which is good enough reason to do a little poking around the foundations of its pedestalWho is entirely satisfied with the romance in his or her lifeWho has found the sublime rapture previously imaginedAnd if one has actually found such a thing does it last or does it not rather change and decline from the peak of ecstasyAnd if it declines what becomes of ones purpose in lifeIf a purpose is achieved it is no longer a purpose it can no longer guide or sustain usDoes one taste of nectar satisfy us foreverWhen we tire of crass material goals we may go searching for love instead of say religious insight because love seems both more accessible and more urgent and because so much of institutional religion in our time has degenerated into insipid humanismSome claim refuge here but many more longing for authentic and moving experience turn to the vision of the lover that source of wonder joy and transcendence who it is thought must be pursued and if captured perfected and if perfected then enjoyed forever  or until some other lover lights up the horizonLove is its own justification especially for the young who have no other inspiration or no career or responsibilities to dull themselves with as their plodding elders doLonging bursts through this one channel that seems open dizzily insisting that the life of unreflecting passion is the highest they can aspire toThey do not reason but fallTheir elders do reason  obsessively  but fall all the same thereby admitting that with all their thought and experience they find when driven to extremity they have nothing but love to live forThis is not to say that such a surrender must be bad only that it happens out of instinct and uninformed passionLove is sweet and it is our nature to give wayBut why do we worship it so ardently and why do we break off our search for fulfillment herePerhaps because we see no other godsYet if love is the highest thing to live for then this is a hopeless universe because we should see in a calm hour that Cupids arrows not only thrill us but make us bleedMan Kills Estranged Lover Then Self Wife Stabs Husband in Domestic Quarrel Love Triangle Leads To Shooting So read the headlines with depressing regularityThe stories behind these are only the most shocking of countless tales of passion but they do forcefully suggest that romantic love is not always a blessingOne might object that hate not love spawns such tragedies but where has such hate come from if not from a prior attachment now brokenWe should know from experience how easily what we call love can turn to bitterness jealousy and malice and though we protest that this is not the fault of love we ought to notice that where one passion arises another is likely to followPassions are unreliable volatile dangerous and a poor foundation for happinessDivorces suicides dissipation violence depravity fanaticism and other miseries great and small follow from passion and yet passion is still in the public mind considered commendable a mark of vigor and livelinessThough everybody will admit that passion gone awry is dangerous few realize that passion is by its nature likely to go awryRomantic love is a chancy passion that may result in the opposite of what is desiredIt may have happy consequences too  else it would not have so many votaries  but it raises the stakes in the gamble of life and makes us more vulnerable both to our own weaknesses and to unpredictable fortuneAs most of us count the joys of successful love worth the pain involved in its pursuit we must learn to step lightly and with intelligenceWe believe with some reason that love can ennoble and redeem us and call forth our purest energies but we are slower to see that when the lamp of love flickers out as it tragically tends to do we might lose our way in a fearful labyrinth of sufferingGranted that few will shun the pursuit of romance out of fear of unhappy consequences what can be done to ameliorate those consequencesIf we really have nothing higher to live for nothing to fall back on the lugubrious truth is that nothing much can be done to ameliorate them given the volatile nature of human affections so it would be wise to make sure there really is no superior sustaining ideal before committing ourselves exclusively to the chaseBuddhism of course teaches such an ideal which is nothing less than deliverance from all sorrow called NibbanaWhile worldly joys are mutable and fleeting Nibbana is established sorrowless stainless and secureWhile worldly pains are piercing unpredictable and unavoidable Nibbana is altogether free from painIt is the end of suffering the supreme refuge the ultimate emancipationThe Buddha himself applied many terms of praise to it while recognizing their essential inadequacyNibbana cannot be grasped by language or concept but it can be known and realized by one who makes the right effortsThis is a critical pointNibbana is not something that happens to us through an external agency rather it is something that we ourselves may achieveThe Buddha certainly never would have troubled himself to teach had he not understood that his own realization was not fortuitous but rightly won and that those who followed his instructions could win realization for themselvesThat understanding passed down has sustained the Buddhist religion to the present day
