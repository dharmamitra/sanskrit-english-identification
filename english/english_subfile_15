Main course dishes and desserts come pouring in from every directionIf we lack mindfulness and discernment we lie clutching our food like a pig lying next to its hay and then climbing up to lie on the chopping blockAs for the Dhamma we have no hope of winning itAny meditation monk who is clever in this way is bound to go under in this way without a doubtTo have mindfulness and discernment we have to thinkHowever much of the necessities of life we may have we must find tactics for keeping the mind in shape to keep wary and uncomplacent like a deer wary of dangerIn places where you dont have to be wary of food like this the mind goes about thinking in another way to reform itselfThere where will you get an excess of anythingEverything is lackingInsufficientSome days you get enough alms to eat some days you dontThis way theres nothing to be concerned about because youve been full and been hungry beforeEven if you go without food for one or two days you wont dieThis is how the heart deals with the problem and so it isnt concerned about food or anything elseIf theres nothing but rice you eat rice  and you dont see that youre concerned about itAfter all youve come to a place like this so whats wrong with eating whatevers availableWhere are you going to find anything to go with the riceYouve been fed rice ever since the day you were born so whats wrong with eating just riceCan you eat other things without riceIf eating other things is really special youve already eaten a lot of them so why arent you ever fullYouve come looking for the Dhamma not for foodWhy are you so worked up about your stomachYouve already eaten a lot and yet nothing special has ever come of itYoure looking for the extraordinary Dhamma so what business do you have getting worked up about foodAn expert in Dhamma isnt an expert in eating The mind deals with the situation in the flash of an eye and the end result is that it isnt concernedThis is how a meditation monk subdues himself  or in other words subdues his greed for the necessities of lifeAnd as a result of correcting itself in the matter of eating or not eating the mind keeps spinningYou sit in meditation without getting tiredWith no food in your stomach what is there to get drowsy aboutIf you dont eat at all youre not drowsy at all and can meditate with easeThis is a tactic in teaching monks to practice the Dhamma rukkhamulasenasanam  under the shade of trees in the mountains in the forest in lonely places where its scary  aharasappaya where the food is amenableAmenable here means that it doesnt disrupt the body that it isnt harmful or toxic to the body and that it doesnt disrupt the mind as wellAmenable food means nothing but rice sometimes or just a little food so that our meditation goes wellIts amenable for those intent on the DhammaBut those of us who are intent on nourishing the stomach for the sake of the body cant do this at allOtherwise well die  dont say I didnt warn youNormally if we eat a lot with nothing but good dishes to eat then we sleep like pigsHow can this be amenableIts amenable for the defilements not for winning the DhammaIts amenable for the affairs of defilements and the affairs of pigsThe term amenable food has to refer to eating in a way that serves a purposeTo eat just a little serves a purpose Wherever we sit in meditation the mind is really solidIf were involved with concentration the mind is solidIf were involved with discernment it keeps spinning with much more agility than normalThe Dhamma tends to arise in places where things are lacking in difficult places where were cornered at the end of our ropeIt doesnt arise where things are overflowing where our needs are metIt doesnt arise in comfortable places because we just get complacentThis is the way we tend to beThe Lord Buddha lived in a royal palace  for how long and then left it to take up the homeless lifeWho ever suffered more than heBuddha  Awakening  tends to arise in situations like thatHis disciples came from all sorts of families  the families of kings financiers landowners  listen to this  wealthy peopleWhen they went out to become sons of the Sakyan sons of the victorious Buddha how did they liveIf were going to die then we dieWere not going to worry or be bothered with anything at all except for the Dhamma ThereThey gained the Dhamma in difficult places just like the BuddhaSo which way are we going to takeThe Buddha has already shown us the wayThe Dhamma arises in that sort of place  in tight spots where things are difficultThe Dhamma arises from a heap of sufferingIf theres no heap of suffering then mindfulness and discernment dont ariseIf we dont think we dont gain mindfulness and discernmentThe Dhamma doesnt appearIf theres a lot of stress its a whetstone for discernment which probes for clear insight into the affairs of stressThis way we can live through it and come out superlative peopleSo thenEvamNormally the mind is radiant and always ready to make contact with everything of every sortAlthough all phenomena without exception fall under the laws of the three characteristics  stress inconstancy and notself  the true nature of the mind doesnt fall under these lawsThe extent to which the mind does follow these laws is because the things that fall under these three characteristics come spinning in and become involved with it so that it goes spinning along with themEven then though it spins in a way that doesnt disintegrate or fall apartIt spins with the things that have the power to make it spin but the natural power of the mind itself is that it knows and does not dieThis deathlessness is something that lies beyond disintegrationThis nondisintegration is something that lies beyond the three characteristics and the common laws of nature but were not aware of it because conventional realities become involved with the mind and surround it so that the minds behavior conforms thoroughly to theirsThe fact that were unaware that birth and death are things that have always been with the mind infected by defilement is because ignorance itself is an affair of defilementBirth and death are an affair of defilementOur own true affair the affair thats ours pure and simple  the affair of the mind pure and simple  is that we dont have the power to be our own true selfWe have been taking all sorts of counterfeit things as our self all along and so the minds behavior is not in keeping with its true natureIts behavior falls under the sway of the deceits of defilement which make it worry and fear dreading death dreading everythingWhatever happens  a little pain a lot of pain  its afraidIf even the least little thing disturbs it its afraidAs a result the mind is filled with worries and fearsEven though fear and worry arent directly an affair of the mind they still manage to make it trembleWell see  when the mind is cleansed so that it is fully pure and nothing can become involved with it  that no fear appears in the mind at allFear doesnt appearCourage doesnt appearAll that appears is its own nature by itself just its own timeless natureThats allThis is the genuine mindGenuine mind here refers only to the purity or the saupadisesanibbana of the arahantsNothing else can be called the genuine mind without reservations or hesitationsI for one would feel embarrassed to use the term for anything else at allThe original mind means the original mind of the round in which the mind finds itself spinning around and about as in the Buddhas saying Monks the original mind is radiant  notice that  but because of the admixture of defilements or because of the defilements that come passing through it becomes darkenedThe original mind here refers to the origin of conventional realities not to the origin of purityThe Buddha uses the term pabhassaram  pabhassaramidam cittam bhikkhave  which means radiantIt doesnt mean pureThe way he puts it is absolutely rightThere is no way you can fault itHad he said that the original mind is pure you could immediately take issue If the mind is pure why is it bornThose who have purified their minds are never rebornIf the mind is already pure why purify it Right here is where you could take issueWhat reason would there be to purify itIf the mind is radiant you can purify it because its radiance is unawareness incarnate and nothing elseMeditators will see clearly for themselves the moment the mind passes from radiance to mental release Radiance will no longer appearRight here is the point where meditators clearly know this and its the point that lets them argue  because the truth has to be found true in the individual heartOnce a person knows he or she cant help but speak with full assuranceThus the fact that our mind is surrounded made to fear to worry to love to hate or whatever is caused entirely by the symptoms of conventional reality the symptoms of defilementWe have no mental power of our ownWe have only the power of defilement craving and mental effluents pushing and pressuring us day and night while we sit stand walk and lie downWhere are we going to find any happiness and ease as long as these things which are constantly changing keep provoking the mind to change along with them without our being aware of the factThere can be no ease in this world  none at all  until these things can be completely eradicated from the heartUntil then we can have no secure ease and relief in any wayWe can only shift and change about or lean this way and that depending on how much were provoked by the things that come and involve usThis is why the Buddha teaches us to cleanse the mind which is the same thing as cleansing ourselves of sufferingThere is no one who has genuinely penetrated the principles of the truth like the Lord BuddhaOnly he can be called sayambhu  one who needs no teaching or training from anyone elseIn curing his heart of defilement he performed the duties of both student and teacher all by himself until he awakened to the level of the superlative Dhamma becoming the superlative person the superlative MasterThis is not to deny that on the level of concentration  the development of mental stillness  he received training from the two hermits but that in itself wasnt the way of extrication leading to the level of omniscienceBy the time he was to attain omniscience he had left the two hermits and was striving on his ownHe came to know the Dhamma on his own and to see on his own without anyone elses teaching himHe then brought that Dhamma to teach the world so that it has known good and evil heaven hell and nibbana ever sinceHad there been no one to teach us we of the world would be completely burdened with the mass of fire filling our hearts and would never see the day when we could put our burdens downThis being the case we should appreciate the worth of the Dhamma that the Buddha brought to the world after having endured hardships in a way no one else in the world could have managedSo now at present what is it that covers the heart so that we cant find its radiance and purity even though each of us wants to find purityWhat conceals itTo answer in terms of natural principles we should start with the five khandhasAs for the mind of unawareness we can save that for laterLets just start out with whats really obvious  the five khandhas and their companions sight sounds smells tastes and tactile sensationsThese make contact with the eye ear nose tongue and body and then link up with the mind forming the basis for this assumption and thatThe mind then takes the objects that have come passing by and uses them to bind itself entangle itself or encircle itself so that it is completely darkened with love hate anger and all sorts of other states all of which come from the things I have mentionedBut what lies buried deep is our belief that the khandhas form our selfFrom time immemorial whatever our language whatever our race  even when we are common animals  we have to believe that these things are us are ours that they are a being the self of a being our own selfIf we become deities we believe that our divine bodies are oursIf we become hungry ghosts or whatever the things we dwell in  gross bodies or refined  we take to be us or oursEven when we become human beings and begin to have some sense of good and evil we still have to believe that This is us or This is ours Of the five khandhas the body is us Vedana sañña sankhara and viññana are us are ours These assumptions lie buried deep within usThe Buddha thus teaches us to investigateWe investigate these things so as to see their truth clearly and then to uproot our mistaken assumptions and attachments that they are the selfWe do this for the sake of freedom and for nothing elseIf we look at these things in their normal state we might wonder why we should investigate themSights are simply sights sounds are sounds smells smells tastes tastes tactile sensations are simply natural phenomena as theyve always beenTheyve never announced that they are our enemiesSo why investigate themWe investigate them to know the truth of each one of them as it actually is to realize our own delusions by means of this investigation and to extricate ourselves from them through knowledge  for the fact that the mind lays claim to the khandhas as its self as belonging to itself is because of delusion and nothing elseOnce we have investigated and clearly understood what these things are the mind withdraws inwardly through knowledge understanding and discernment with no more concern for these thingsWe investigate whichever khandha is most prominentWe neednt conjecture or speculate about the fact that we havent contemplated the five khandhas in their entirety or each khandha in turnWe neednt conjecture at allAll we need to do is to see which khandha is prominent and merits investigation at the moment  which khandha we feel best suited to handle  and then investigate and explore it so that it becomes clearTake for instance the body whichever aspect of the body is most prominent in your awareness  the aspect that has you most interested that you want most to investigateLatch onto that spot and focus on examining it so as to see its truth in terms of the question What is stressIn the texts we are told that stress means unendurability but this doesnt sit well with my own crass tastes which is why  one mans meat being another mans poison  I prefer to translate stress as a constant squeeze This is more in keeping with my tastes which are very crudeFor example the phrase yampiccham na labhati tampi dukkham is right in line with my translationIn other words Not attaining what is desired is stress How is it stressIn that it puts a squeeze on us or makes us uncomfortableIf we dont get what we want were uncomfortableEven if we get what we want but then lose it we suffer stressStress in this sense fits the translation a squeeze This squeeze is whats meant by stress or unendurabilityIf it cant endure let it go its own wayWhy mess with itActually no matter which khandha no matter which of the three characteristics the mind is the one at fault for getting attached which is why we have to examine the khandhas until we have them clearWhatever aspect of the body look so as to see it clearlyIf were not yet clear about the filthiness in our physical heap we can look at the charnel ground within us so as to see it clearlyWhen were told to visit the charnel ground this is where we make our visitEven if we visit a charnel ground outside the purpose is to reflect inwardly on the inner charnel ground  our own bodyAs for the external charnel ground in the days of the Buddha it was a place where corpses were scattered all over the placeThe dead were hardly ever buried or cremated as they are todaySo the Buddha taught monks to visit the charnel ground where old corpses and new were scattered everywhereHe also gave detailed instructions as to the direction from which to enter in keeping with his sharp intelligence as a selfdependent Buddha the Teacher of the worldHe said to approach from the upwind side and not from the downwind sideOtherwise the stench of the various corpses would be bad for your healthWhen you encounter corpses in this way how do you feelLook at the different types of corpsesHow do you feelNow refer inwardly to your own body which is another corpse This is how he taught the monks to investigateOnce we have an eyewitness  ourself  as to what the corpses in the external charnel ground are like we can refer inwardly to the internal charnel ground ourself againOnce we have grasped the basic principle the external charnel ground gradually fades out of the pictureInstead we investigate our internal charnel ground so that it becomes gradually more and more clearIn other words we see how this body is a well of filthRepulsiveSomething that constantly has to be washed bathed and cleanedIs there anything that once it has become involved with any part of the body remains cleanEven the food we eat once we consume it becomes filthy from the moment it enters the mouth and passes on downOur clothing is also dirtyIt has to be washed and laundered  a lot of fuss and botherThe same holds true for our homesThey constantly have to be cleaned scrubbed dusted and sweptOtherwise they turn into another charnel ground because of the filth and the smellEverywhere wherever human beings live has to be cleaned  because human beings are filthyAnd since our bodies are already filthy everything that comes into contact with them becomes filthyEven food  delicious inviting appealing food  once it becomes mixed with the filth in the body such as saliva becomes filthy as wellIf you took food of various kinds into your mouth and then spit it out thered be no way you could take it back in againItd be too disgustingRevoltingWhyBecause the body is filthy by its very nature and so whatever becomes involved with the body becomes filthy as wellTo contemplate in this way is called investigating the charnel ground or investigating the theme of loathsomenessSoFocus in on seeing its inherent natureLook at every facet in whichever way comes most naturally to youWhen youve examined one spot your knowledge gradually seeps into the next spot and the nextIf mindfulness and awareness keep in close connection discernment cant help but go to work and advance unceasinglyYoull feel profoundly moved as you come to see and know truly step by stepThis is discernment on the first level of investigationOnce youve investigated filthiness you then investigate the process of change in the bodyIn other words filth is in this bodyDry corpses fresh corpses raw corpses cooked corpses all kinds of corpses are gathered together in this body but Ive never heard the place where they are barbecued roasted and stewed called a crematoriumInstead its called kitchenBut actually thats what it is a crematorium for animalsAnd then theyre all buried here in this stomach this graveWere a burial ground for all kinds of animals  yes us if we look at ourselves in all fairness with impartiality because were filled with old corpses and newOnce we have contemplated in this way then if we dont feel disenchantment if we dont feel disengagement what will we feel for thats the way the truth actually isThe Buddha taught us to get to the truth because this is what the truth isIf we dont resist the truth we will all be able to unshackle ourselves from our attachments and false assumptions  from our stupidity and foolishness  step by stepThe mind will become bright and clear radiating its brightness with dignity bravery and courage in the face of the truth that comes into contact with it at all timesIt will be content to accept every facet of the truth with fairness and impartialityEven though we may not have yet abandoned our attachments absolutely we can still find relief in having put them down to at least some extentWe no longer have to be constantly weighed down with our attachments to the khandhas to the point where we are always miserableThis is in keeping with the saying Fools the heavier their burdens the more they keep piling onSages the lighter their burdens the more they let go  until nothing is leftWhen we investigate in this way we should examine the process of change in the khandhasEvery piece every bit every part of the body undergoes changeTheres no exception not even for a single hairEverything undergoes change in the same waySo which part is us which part is ours to which we should be attachedThe same holds true with the word anatta notselfIt drives home even more firmly the fact that these things dont deserve our attachmentAnatta lies in the same parts as change  the very same partsTheyre anatta not ours or anyone elsesEach one each one is simply a natural phenomenon mingled with the others in line with its own nature without any concern for who will like it or hate it latch onto it or let it goBut we human beings are lightfingered and quickWhatever comes our way we snatch hold of it snatch hold of it with no concern for right or wrongWere more lightfingered and quick than a hundred monkeys and yet all of us all over the world like to criticize monkeys for not being able to sit contented and stillActually we ourselves cant stay contented and still in any positionWere full of restlessness  unruly reckless overflowing our boundaries  and yet we never think of criticizing ourselvesThe Dhamma taught by the Buddha is thus like a stick for slapping the hands of this lightfingered unruly monkeyWith the three characteristics anatta among them he warns us strikes our wrists Dont reach He slaps us strikes us Dont reach for it as me or mine The phrase The body is not the self is just like thatDont reach for itDont latch onto it This is simply so that we will see that its already notselfBy its nature its notselfIt doesnt belong to anyone at allHes already told us Anatta Its not the self This is how we investigate the bodySo now then Focus on visualizing it as it disintegrates in whichever way seems most natural to youThis part decomposesThat part decomposesThis part falls offThat part falls offLet yourself become engrossed in watching it using your own ingenuityThis falls off that falls off until everything has fallen apart  all the bones from the skull on downOnce the skin that enwraps them has decomposed the flesh has decomposed the tendons that hold them together have decomposed the bones cant help but fall apart piece by piece because they are held together only by tendonsOnce the tendons decompose the different parts have to fall off piece by piece in a pile on the ground scattered all over the placeYou can even visualize having vultures crows and dogs come to eat and scatter the parts everywhereHow does the mind feel about thisWell then look at itVisualize the liquid parts seeping into the earth and evaporating into the air then drying away drying away until they no longer appearThe solid parts once theyve dried return to the earth from which they cameEarth returns to earth water to water wind to windPenetrate down into any of four elements  earth water wind or fire  because each gives clear evidence of the Noble TruthsWe dont have to think that weve examined earth clearly but this element or that element isnt clearWe neednt think that way at allIf we examine any one of them until its clear we will penetrate them all because earth water wind and fire are all already open and aboveboardThey appear to our sightIn our body we already have waterWind  for example the inandout breath  is already clearly there already clear to seeFire  the warmth in the body  is something we all have here in our bodiesSo why dont we accept its truth with right discernmentOnce weve investigated it over and over again we have to accept itWe cant resist the truth because thats why were here We want the truthSo keep investigatingLook for the part thats you or yours Look for itThere isnt any  not a oneThe whole thing originally belongs to them to earth water wind and fireIt originally belongs to the different elementsNow when you look in this manner the mind can settle down and grow stillAt the same time these arent preoccupations that will make the mind proud conceited or unrulyRather they are themes that calm the heart which is why the Buddha taught us to investigate them repeatedly until we understand and become adept at themWhen the mind sees clearly with its own discernment it cant help but withdraw into stillness firmly centered within letting go of all its caresThis is one level in the investigation of the khandhasNow for the next step Investigate feelings of pain especially when you are ill or have been sitting in meditation for a long time and severe pain arisesTake it on right thereA warrior has to fight when the enemy appearsIf theres no enemy how can you call him a warriorAnd whats the enemyFeelings of pain the enemy of the heartWhen youre ill where does it hurtThere You have your enemyIf youre a warrior how can you run away and hideYou have to fight until you gain knowledge and then use that knowledge to come out victoriousSoWhat does the pain come fromFrom the time we were born until we first sat in meditation it wasnt thereBefore we first became ill it didnt appearIt appears only now that were illBefore that where was it hidingIf its really us our mind should have been aware of it at all times so why hasnt this kind of pain appeared at all timesWhy is it appearing nowIf the pain is us then when it vanishes why doesnt the mind vanish with itIf theyre really one and the same thing they have to vanish togetherThe pain should appear as long as the mind is awareIf theyre one and the same thing the pain shouldnt vanishYou have to look and investigate until this is clearAt the same time analyze the body when the pain arises  when for example your legs ache or when this or that bone hurtsFix your attention on the bone if the bone is really hurtingIs the bone the painAsk yourselfAnd whatever youre asking about focus your attention right thereDont ask in the abstract or absentmindedlyAsk in a way that focuses the mind right down to see the truthFocus steadily right on the painStare the mind right down on whichever bone you identify with the painLook carefully to see Is this bone the pain Fix your attention thereReally observe with your own discernmentIf this bone is really the pain then when the pain vanishes why doesnt the bone vanish with itIf they really are one and the same thing then when the pain vanishes the bone should vanish tooIt shouldnt remainBut look When the disease goes away or when we get up from sitting in meditation the really severe pain vanishes the stress vanishesSo if they are one and the same thing why doesnt the bone vanish as wellThis shows that they arent one and the sameThe feeling isnt the same as the bodyThe body isnt the same as the feelingSimilarly the body and the mind arent one and the sameEach has its own separate realityDistinguish them so as to see them clearly in line with this truth and youll understand their true nature through discernment with no doubts at allFeeling will appear in its true natureUltimately the investigation will come circling in circling in circling in to the mindThe pain will gradually shrink into itself away from the minds assumptionsIn other words you will see that the mind is the culpritThe mind is the instigatorThe physical pain will gradually subside and fade awayThe body will simply be there as the body with the same reality it had before the pain appearedAnd now that the pain has vanished the flesh skin tendon bone or whatever part you had identified as the pain will maintain its reality in the same wayIt isnt the painThe body is the bodyThe feeling is the feelingThe mind is the mindFix your attention on seeing them clearlyOnce the mind has penetrated to the truth the pain will disappearThis is one resultAnother result is that even if the pain doesnt vanish  here Im referring to the physical pain  still it cant have any impact on the heart and mindUltimately the mind is serene secure and majestic there in the midst of the physical painNo matter which part of the body you say is pained  even if its the whole body at once  the mind isnt disturbed or agitated in any wayIts relaxed and at ease because it has seen with discernment right through the pain appearing at the momentThis is another sort of result that comes from investigating painWhen investigating pain then the greater the pain the more important it is that your mindfulness and discernment not retreatThey have to keep advancing so as to know the truthYou neednt aim at making the pain vanish because such a desire would simply enhance the pain and make it more and more severeActually youre making an investigation simply to see the truthWhether or not the pain vanishes know the truth that is the pain or gives rise to the pain by seeing through it with your own discernment Thats enoughFix your attention there and these things will keep appearing and disappearing there in the khandhasThe body appears for a certain period and then disintegrates in what we call deathAs for feelings of pain they appear a hundred times in a single day and then disappear a hundred times a thousand times as wellWhats lasting about themThis is the kind of truth they areGet so you clearly know with discernment the truth of painful feelings as they appearDont retreat or let the mind wander adriftWhat is sañña labeling at the momentSañña is the important instigatorAs soon as sankhara fashions anything  blip sañña latches right onto it and labels it this labels it that  stirring things all upWhen we talk about the things that create havoc provoking this issue and that were referring to these characters sankharas and saññas that label things and stamp meanings on themThis is usThis is oursThis is painIt hurts right hereIt hurts right thereIm afraid of the painIm afraid to die  afraid of everything of every sortThese are the characters that fool us into fear making the mind apprehensive making it give up its efforts and loseIs it good to loseEven children playing games have a sense of shame when they lose and try to make up their lossesAs for meditators who lose out to defilement who lose out to pain If they dont feel embarrassed in the presence of the defilements the pains and themselves then theyre simply too shamelessKnow that vedana sañña sankhara and viññana are simply individual conditions displayed by the mindThey appear and vanishSañña anatta  seeThey too are notself so how can you hold to themHow can you believe them to be you to be yours to be trueKeep track of them so that you can know them clearly with mindfulness and discernment audacious undaunted diamondhearted decisive in the face of defilement and pain of every sortSankharas mental formations They form  blip blip blip  in the heartThe heart ripples for a moment blip blip blipThe moment they arise they vanishSo what substance or truth can you find in these saññas and sankharasViññana cognizance As soon as anything comes into contact this takes note and vanishes takes note and vanishesSo ultimately the khandhas are full of nothing but appearing and vanishingTheres nothing lasting about them that can give us any real sustenance or nourishmentTheres not even the least bit of substance to themSo use your discernment to investigate until you see clearly in this way and you will come to see the real Dhamma taught by the Buddha which has not been otherwise from time immemorial and by the same token will never be otherwise at allOnce weve investigated to this extent how can the mind not withdraw into stillness until it is plainly apparentIt has to be stillIt has to stand outThe minds awareness of itself has to be prominent because it has withdrawn inwardly from having seen the truth of these thingsThe mind has to be prominentPain no matter how horribly severe will dissolve away through investigation through the minds having clearly seen its truthOr if it doesnt go away then the pain and the mind will each have their own separate realityThe heart will be inwardly majesticUndauntedUnfearingWhen the time comes for death let it happenThere is no more fear because death is entirely a matter of rupa vedana sañña sankhara and viññanaIts not a matter of the knower  the heart  breaking apartIts not the knower  the heart  that diesOnly those other things dieThe minds labels and assumptions have simply fooled it into fearIf we can catch sight of the fact that these labels and assumptions are illusions and not worthy of credence the mind will withdraw inwardly no longer believing them but believing the truth instead believing the discernment that has investigated things thoroughlyNow when the mind has investigated time and again ceaselessly relentlessly it will develop expertise in the affairs of the khandhasThe physical khandha will be the first to be relinquished through discernmentIn the beginning stage of the investigation discernment will see through the physical khandha before seeing through the others and will be able to let it goFrom there the mind will gradually be able to let go of vedana sañña sankhara and viññana at the same timeTo put the matter simply once discernment sees through them it lets goIf it has yet to see through them it holds onOnce we see through them with discernment we let them go  let them go completely  because we see that they are simply ripplings in the mind  blip blip blip  without any substance at allA good thought appears and vanishesA bad thought appears and vanishesWhatever kind of thought appears its simply a formation and as such it vanishesIf a hundred formations appear all hundred of them vanishThere is no permanence to them substantial enough for us to trustSo thenWhat is it that keeps supplying us with these things or keeps forcing them out on usWhat is it that keeps forcing this thing and that out to fool usThis is where we come to what the Buddha calls the pabhassaracitta the original radiant mindBut monks because of the admixture of defilement or because of the defilements that come passing through  from sights sound smells tastes tactile sensations from rupa vedana sañña sankhara and viññana that our labels and assumptions haul in to burn us  the mind becomes defiled Its defiled with just these very thingsThus investigation is for the sake of removing these things so as to reveal the mind through clear discernmentWe can then see that as long as the mind is at the stage where it hasnt ventured out to become engaged in any object  inasmuch as its instruments the senses are still weak and undeveloped  it is quiet and radiant as in the saying The original mind is the radiant mind But this is the original mind of the round of rebirth  for example the mind of a newborn child whose activities are still too undeveloped to take any objects on fullyIts not the original mind freed from the cycle and fully pureSo while we investigate around us stage by stage the symptoms of defilement that used to run all over the place will be gathered into this single point becoming a radiance within the mindAnd this radiance Even the tools of supermindfulness and superdiscernment will have to fall for it when they first meet with it because its something we have never seen before never met before from the beginning of our practice or from the day of our birthWe thus become awed and amazedIt seems for the moment that nothing can compare to it in magnificenceAnd why shouldnt it be magnificentIt has been the king of the round of rebirth in all three worlds  the world of sensuality the world of form and the world of formlessness  since way back when for countless aeonsIts the one who has wielded power over the mind and ruled the mind all alongAs long as the mind doesnt possess the mindfulness and discernment to pull itself out from under this power how can it not be magnificentThis is why it has been able to drive the mind into experiencing birth on various levels without limit in dependence on the fruits of the different actions it has performed under the orders of the ephemeral defilementsThe fact that living beings wander and stray taking birth and dying unceasingly is because this nature leads them to do soThis being the case we have to investigate it so as to see it plainlyActually radiance and defilement are two sides of the same coin because they are both conventional realitiesThe radiance that comes from the convergence of the various defilements will form a point a center so that we can clearly perceive that This is the center of the radiance When any defilement appears in correspondence with that state or level of the mind a very refined stress will arise in the center we call radiantThus radiance defilement and stress  all three  are companionsThey go togetherFor this reason the mind possessing this radiance must worry over it guard it protect it maintain it for fear that something may come to disturb it jar it obscure its radianceEven the most refined adulteration is still an affair of defilement about which we as meditators should not be complacentWe must investigate it with unflagging discernmentIn order to cut through the burden of your concerns once and for all you should ask yourself What is this radiance Fix your attention on it until you knowTheres no need to fear that once this radiance is destroyed the real you will be destroyed along with itFocus your investigation right at that center to see clearly that this radiance has the characteristics of inconstancy stress and notself just like all the other phenomena you have already examinedIts not different in any way aside from the difference in its subtletyThus nothing should be taken for grantedIf anything has the nature of conventional reality let discernment slash away at itFocus right down on the mind itselfAll the really counterfeit things lie in the mindThis radiance is the ultimate counterfeit and at that moment its the most conspicuous pointYou hardly want to touch it at all because you love it and cherish it more than anything elseIn the entire body there is nothing more outstanding than this radiance which is why you are amazed at it love it cherish it dawdle over it want nothing to touch itBut its the enemy king unawarenessHave you ever seen itIf you havent then when you reach this stage in your practice youll fall for it of your own accordAnd then youll know it of your own accord  no one will have to tell you  when mindfulness and discernment are readyIts called avijja  unawarenessRight here is the true unawarenessNothing else is true unawarenessDont go imagining avijja as a tiger a leopard a demon or a beastActually its the most beautiful most alluring Miss Universe the world has ever seenGenuine unawareness is very different from what we expect it to beWhen we reach genuine unawareness we dont know what unawareness is and so we get stuck right thereIf theres no one to advise us no one to suggest an approach we are sure to stay stuck there a long time before we can understand and work ourselves freeBut if there is someone to suggest an approach we can begin to understand it and strike right at that center without trusting it by investigating it in the same way we have dealt with all other phenomenaOnce weve investigated it with sharp discernment until we know it clearly this phenomenon will dissolve away in a completely unexpected wayAt the same time you could call it Awakening or closing down the cemeteries of the round of rebirth the round of the mind under the shade of the Bodhi treeOnce this phenomenon has dissolved away something even more amazing that has been concealed by unawareness will be revealed in all its fullnessThis is what is said to be like the quaking of the cosmos within the heartThis is a very crucial mental moment when the heart breaks away from conventionsThis moment when release and conventional reality break away from each other is more awesome than can be expressedThe phrase the path of arahantship giving way to the fruition of arahantship refers to precisely this mental moment the moment in which unawareness vanishesAs we are taught when the path is fully developed it steps onward to the fruition of arahantship which is the Dhamma  the mind  at its most completeFrom that moment on there are no more problemsThe phrase the one nibbana is fully realized in this heart in the moment unawareness is dissolvingWe are taught that this is the moment when the path and the fruition  which are a pair  come together and meetIf we were to make a comparison with climbing the stairs to a house one foot is on the last step the other foot is on the floor of the houseWe havent yet reached the house with both feetWhen both feet are on the floor of the house weve reached the house As for the mind it is said to reach the Dhamma or to attain the ultimate Dhamma and from the moment of attainment its called the one nibbanaIn other words the mind is completely freeIt displays no further activity for the removal of defilementThis is called the one nibbanaIf you want you can call it the fruition of arahantship for at this stage there are no more defilements to quibbleOr you can call it the one nibbanaBut if you want to give it the conventional label most appropriate to the actual principle so that nothing is deficient in conventional terms you have to say the one nibbana so as to be completely fitting with conventional reality and release in the final phase of wiping out the cemeteries of the mind of unawarenessThe Buddha taughtThis refers to the stage of those who have no more defilements who have attained saupadisesanibbana alive such as the arahantsTo practice the religion means to attend to your own heart and mindWho is it that suffers pain and difficultyWho is the suspect forever imprisonedWho else if not the mindAnd who has it imprisoned if not all the defilements and mental effluentsTo deal with the situation you have to deal directly with the enemies of the heart using your discernment for only sharp discernment is capable of dealing with the defilements until they dissolve away of their own accord as I have already mentionedFrom that point on there are no more problemsAs for rupa vedana sañña sankhara and viññana theyre simply conditions  just conditions  no longer capable of affecting or provoking the mindThe same with sights sounds smells tastes and tactile sensations Each has its separate realityTo each one we say If it exists it existsIf not no matter The only problem has been the mind that makes labels and assumptions through its own stupidityOnce it gains enough intelligence it becomes realAll phenomena within and without are realEach has its own separate reality with no more of the conflicts or issues that used to occurWhen we reach the stage where each has its own separate reality we can say that the war between the mind and defilement is overWhen the time comes to part we partIf not we live together like everyone else in the world but we dont take issue with each other like everyone else in the world because weve made our investigationIf the words inconstancy stress and notself dont refer to the khandhas for which we are responsible what do they refer toSo now we have completed our studies  our study of the three characteristics rather than of the three divisions of the Pali canon although actually the three divisions are nothing other than the three characteristics in that the three divisions are a description of the three characteristics throughoutInconstancy the process of changeStressNotself The khandhas are not us  not us while we are living so when we die what is there to latch ontoWhen you see the truth in this way you dont worry or feel apprehensive over the life or death of the khandhasThe mind simply perceives the modes in which the khandhas behave and break apart but by its nature it doesnt disband along with the khandhas so theres nothing to fearIf death comes you dont try to prevent itIt life continues you dont try to prevent it for each is a truthIn completing your study of death you become the ultimate person  the ultimate youWhen you have completed your study of death you dont fear death  If life continues let it continue if death comes let it die  for you have spread a net around yourself with your discernmentYou dont tremble over the truths of which the heart is fully aware at all timesSoThats enough for nowAs it happens were at the end of the tapeA talk given to the monks at Wat Pa Baan TaadThe ordinary mind  no matter whose  when it doesnt yet have any standards and meets up with things that drag it here and there in the wrong directions will tend to go rolling after those preoccupations without letup to the point where it cant find any foundation for sustaining its peace and calmIn terms of the Dhamma these preoccupations are called defilementsWe can see them when we begin to practice The mind stumbles and crawls along not at all willing to follow the Dhamma because the defilements are strongThis is something I havent forgotten from the time I first set out to practice up until now because its a truth that lies embedded in the heartHow could I forgetFrom the very start of my practice I was really in earnest  because thats the sort of person I wasI wouldnt just play aroundWherever I would take my stance thats how it would have to beWhen I set out to practice I had only one book  the Patimokkha  in my shoulder bagNow I was going for the full path and the full resultsI was going to give it my all  give it my lifeI wasnt going to hope for anything elseI was going to hope for nothing but release from sufferingI was sure that I would attain release from suffering in this lifetimeAll I asked was that there be someone who could show me that the paths fruitions and nibbana were for realI would give my life to that person and to the Dhamma through the practice without holding anything backIf I was to die Id die with the practiceI wouldnt die with retreatMy heart was set like a stone postThe first rains after I had set out to practice I spent in Cakkaraad District Korat Province because I hadnt been able to catch up with Venerable Acariya MunI began accelerating my efforts as soon as I got there and it wasnt long before my mind attained stillness because I was practicing both day and nightI wasnt willing to do any other work aside from the work of concentration practice  sitting and walking meditation  in my own stumbling and crawling wayMy mind was able to quiet down so I really accelerated my efforts but then as Ive told you before it regressed when I was making a klodUp to that point I was no mean hand at concentrationIt was really solidI was sure that the paths fruitions and nibbana were for real because the mind was really solidIt wasnt affected by anything at allBut even then it still managed to regress just because I made a single klodWhen I reached Venerable Acariya Mun he taught me the Dhamma as if it came straight out of his heartHe would never use the words It seems to be because it really came right out of his heart  how he had practiced what he had known and seenIt was as if he kept saying Right hereRight here So did he see or didnt heDid he know or didnt heRight here Where were the paths fruitions and nibbanaRight hereRight here My mind was convinced really convincedFrom that point on I made a resolution As long as he was still alive I wouldnt leave him until either he died or I didAs for going off from time to time to practice on my own Id ask to do that as a matter of course but Id take him as my base as if my home were with himNo matter where Id go Id have to return to himSo then I stepped up my efforts full speedThat dream I had  Ill never forget itIve told you all this dream before but it had such an impact on me that it bears telling againI had come to stay with him and made my resolution with full conviction with complete faith in himThere was no point on which you could fault himWhatever he did inwardly or outwardly was right in line with the principles of the Dhamma and VinayaThere was nothing roundabout or evasive about himThat was why I had made up my mind to stay with himIf he were alive today I still wouldnt leave himId have to stay with him although as a matter of course Id still go here or there from time to time as I had told myselfIt was only around the fourth or fifth night after I had gone to stay with him this dream you know was really amazingI dreamed that I was fully robed carrying my bowl and klod following an overgrown trail through the jungleThere were no side paths on either sideBoth sides were full of thorns and bramblesAll I could do was to keep trying to follow the trail which was just barely a path all overgrown just enough to give a hint of where to goFinally I reached a point where a thick clump of bamboo had fallen across the trailI couldnt see which way to goThere was no way around it on either sideHow was I going to get past itI peered here and there until finally I saw an opening  a tiny opening right along the path just enough for me to force my way through together with my bowlSince there was no other way I removed my outer robe  thats how clear the dream was as if I werent dreaming at all  I removed my outer robe and folded it away just as we keep our robes folded hereI removed my bowl strap from my shoulder and crawled through the opening dragging my bowl by its strap and pulling my klod just within reach behind meI was able to force my way through dragging my bowl my klod and my robe behind me but it was really difficultI kept at it for a long time until finally I worked my way freeI pulled my bowl and my bowl came freeI pulled my klod and my klod came freeI pulled my robe and my robe came freeAs soon as I was entirely free I put on my robe again  thats how clear the dream was  I put on my robe slung my bowl over my shoulder and told myself Now I can go on I kept following that trailit was really overgrown  for about another meters wearing my robe carrying my bowl and klodLooking ahead there was wide open spaceIn front of me was the oceanLooking across there was no further shoreAll I could see was the shore on which I was standing and a tiny island way out in the distance a black speck on the edge of the horizonI was going to that islandAs soon as I walked down to the waters edge a boat  I dont know where it came from and I didnt notice whether it was a speedboat or a rowboat or whatever  a boat came up to the shore and I got inThe boatsman didnt say anything to meAs soon as I sat down in the boat and got my bowl and other things in the boat sped out to the island without my having to say a wordI dont know how it happenedIt kept speeding speeding out to the islandThere didnt seem to be any dangers or waves or anything at allWe went silently and in no time at all we arrived  because after all it was a dreamAs soon as I reached the island I got my things out of the boat and went ashoreThe boat disappeared completely without my saying even a word to the boatsmanI slung my bowl over my shoulder and climbed up the islandI kept climbing until I saw Venerable Acariya Mun sitting on a small bench pounding his betel nut and watching me climb up towards himMaha he said how did you get hereSince when has anyone come that wayHow were you able to make it hereI came by boatOhoThat trail is really difficultNobody dares risk his life coming that wayVery well then now that youre here pound my betel for me He handed me his betel pounder and so I pounded away  chock chock chockAfter the second or third chock I woke upI felt really disappointedI wished I could have continued with the dream to see at least how it endedThat morning I went to tell my dream to Venerable Acariya MunHe interpreted it very wellThis dream you know he said is very auspiciousIt shows the pattern for your practice without any deviationsFollow the practice in the way that youve dreamedIn the beginning itll be extremely difficult Thats what he saidYou have to give it your bestDont retreatThe beginning will be difficultThe part where you made it through the clump of bamboo Thats the difficult partSo give it your bestDont you ever retreatOnce you get past that its all wide openYoull get to the island without any troubleThats not the hard pointThe hard point is right hereI listened to him really listened to him and it went straight to the heartEven if it kills you dont retreat at this pointHere at the beginning is the hardest part  where the mind advances and regressesThis part is so hard that youll want to go smash your head against that mountain over there out of frustrationThe mind advances and regresses over and over againOnce you get past this point though youll make progress easily without any obstacles at allThats all there is to itGive it your best at the beginning and dont retreatUnderstand Thats what he saidIf you retreat here you wont get anywhereSo give it your lifeStrike your way through right hereAfter all your vision says you can make itNo matter how difficult it gets you can make itSo dont retreatI remembered his words and took them to heart  happy and pleasedI kept practicing until that following April in line with what he had saidThe mind had regressed ever since December the previous year until December of that year and then on into AprilIt still hadnt advancedIt would advance to full strength and then deteriorate again and again for a yearIt wasnt until April that I found a new approach focusing on my meditation theme in a new way so that it was really solidFrom that point on I was able to sit in meditation all night longThe mind was able to settle down in full measure which is why I accelerated my efforts from then onSpeaking of the difficulty thats how difficult it really was for meFrom there on in the mind was centered and never regressedThe way it had regressed before was an excellent teacherId absolutely refuse to let it regress again That was how I feltIf it regressed again Id dieI couldnt stand to stay in the world bearing the mass of suffering that would come if it regressed again because I had already been through it once  more than a year of the most acute sufferingTheres no suffering that burns more than the suffering that comes when the mind regressesIf it were to regress again itd kill me which was why I was really meticulous in keeping watch over myself from then onI wouldnt let the mind regress and so it kept on progressingThe first time I saw the marvelousness of the mind was when I began sitting in meditation all night  right from the very first nightI was investigating pain and was it ever severeAt first I hadnt planned on sitting until dawn you knowI was simply sitting along and the pain began to growNo matter how I contemplated it I didnt get anywhere at allEhWhat is thisOkay if Im going to die today let me die So I made resolution in that moment From this moment on I wont get up until dawnSoIf I survive so be itIf not so be itI struck right into the pain to the point where the mind which had never examined anything in that way Discernment had never moved into action that way you know but when it was really cornered at the end of its rope discernment stirred itself into action keeping up with events from every angle until it was fully alert to the pain alert to the body and understood the affairs of the mindEach was a separate realityThey then split away from one another and disappeared completely even though nothing like that had ever happened to me beforeThe body disappeared from my sense of awarenessThe pain completely vanishedAll that was left was an awareness that was simply awareIt wasnt the sort of outstanding awareness we might imagine it to beIt was just simple awareness but very subtle very refined and very amazing in that momentWhen I retreated from that state I renewed my investigation but when I used the strategies I had used before I didnt get any results because they were now allusions to the pastI had to come up with new strategies to keep up with the events of the momentThe mind then settled down againThat night it settled down three times and then dawn cameWas I ever amazed at myselfThat morning when I got the chance I went to tell Venerable Acariya MunNormally Id be very intimidated by him but that morning I wasnt intimidated at allI wanted to tell him the truth so that he could see the results of my being true  how I had practiced so that things had occurred that wayI spoke with audacity even though I had never spoken that way with him beforeI really told it to him straight  crashbang and after he had listened he said Thats the way its got to be Thats just what he saidHe really let me have itHe explained things to my complete satisfactionIt was as if I were a dog As soon as he praised and spurred me on this stupid dog I was was all raring to bark and biteAfter one or two more days I sat up in meditation all night againAfter another two or three more days I did it again until the mind was thoroughly amazedThe affairs of death you know disappear when the mind really knowsWhen you separate the elements and khandhas to look at life and death the four elements of earth water wind and fire dissolve down into their original properties as earth water wind and fireSpace returns to its original property as spaceThe mind that used to fear death becomes even more prominentSo what is there to dieWhen it knows so prominently in this way how can it dieThe mind doesnt dieSo what does it fearWeve been lied toThe world of defilements has been lying to usWhen Id investigate one day Id get one approach another day Id get another approach but they were all hardhitting and amazingThe mind was more and more amazing and brave to the point where I felt When the time comes to die what sort of pain do they think theyre going to bring out to fool meEvery facet of todays pain is complete in every wayBeyond this theres simply deathIve seen all these pains understood them all and dealt with them allSo when the time comes to die what sort of pain are they going to bring out to deceive meTheres no way they can deceive meThe pain will have to be just this sort of painAs for death nothing diesSo what is there to fear aside from the defilements that lie to us making us fall for their fake tricks and deceitsFrom this point on Ill never fall for their tricks againThats the way the mind is when it knows and it knew clearly right from the very first nightAs for the mental state that had progressed and regressed up to that first night it hadnt regressedBeginning that previous April it hadnt regressed but it still wasnt clearThat first night though it became clear OhThis is how its supposed to be the mind that doesnt regress It was as if it had been climbing up and falling down climbing up and falling down until finally it climbed up and grabbed hold tight per cent sure that it wouldnt regressThis was why I stepped up my efforts full speedDuring that Rains Retreat I sat up all night in meditation nine or ten times but never two nights in a rowSometimes Id skip two or three nights sometimes six or sevenI got to the point where I was completely sure about pain  heavy or light big or smallI understood how to deal with pain how to sidestep it how to cure it right in time without being shaken by itI wasnt even afraid of death because I had investigated it with the most completely adroit strategiesMindfulness and discernment were completely up on death in every waySpeaking of effort in the practice my tenth rains  beginning from the April after my ninth rains  was when I made the most allout effortIn all my life I have never made a more vigorous effort in terms of the body than I did during my tenth rainsThe mind went all out and so did the bodyFrom that point on I kept making progress until the mind was like rockIn other words I was skilled enough in the solidity and stability of my concentration that the mind was like a slab of rockIt couldnt easily be affected by anything at all  and then I was stuck on that concentration for five full yearsOnce I was able to get past that concentration thanks to the hardhitting Dhamma of Venerable Acariya Mun I set out to investigateWhen I began to investigate with discernment things went quickly and easily because my concentration was fully preparedIt was as if all the materials for building a house were right at hand but I hadnt yet put them together into a house and so they were just useless pieces of woodMy concentration simply stopped at concentration that wayWhen I didnt put it together into mindfulness and discernment it couldnt support anything at all which is why I had to set out investigating in the way with which Venerable Acariya Mun hit me over the headAs soon as he hit me I set out and no sooner had I set out than I began to know what was whatI was able to kill off that defilement cut this one down step by stepI began to wake up Here Ive been lying in concentration as if I were dead  for all these months all these years  and it hasnt accomplished a thing So now I stepped up my efforts at discernment making it spin day and night without anything to put a brake on it at allBut you know Im the sort of person who goes to extremesWhatever tack I set out on thats the only tack I takeWhen I began following the path of discernment I started criticizing concentration as being like lying down deadActually concentration is a means for resting the mindIf you practice just right thats the way it isBut instead I criticized concentration as being like lying down deadAll these years and it hasnt given rise to discernmentSo I stepped up my efforts at discernment beginning first with the bodyWhen I contemplated unattractiveness it was remarkable you knowReally remarkableThe mind when it contemplated was adroit and audaciousI could perceive right through whatever I looked at  man woman no matter how youngTo tell you frankly how really audacious the mind was it wouldnt have to be a question of old women you knowIf the gathering was full of young women I could march right in without any sign of lust appearing at allThats how daring the mind was because of its contemplation of unattractivenessLooking at a person there would just be the bones wrapped up in skin nothing but flesh all glaring and redSo where could I see any beautyThe power of the unattractiveness was really strongNo matter whose body I looked at thats how Id perceive itSo where would there be any beauty to make me feel desireThis was why Id dare march right in really beautiful young women you knowI could march right in with no trouble at all when I felt daring like this because I was sure of my strengthBut this daring wasnt right in terms of the point at which the mind really had its fill of lust which is why I criticized myself afterwards after the mind had passed this pointThis daring was a kind of madness but while I was following the path it was right because that was how I had to follow it throughThis is like criticizing food after youve eaten your fillRight or wrong its the same sort of thingI contemplated unattractiveness until no physical desire appeared at allIt gradually faded away all on its own without giving any reason at any specific time or placeIt didnt give me any assurance that lust or passion for the male or female body had disappeared at this or that point in time and place so I had to deliberate againI wouldnt go along with this simple fading away on its ownThat is my mind wouldnt accept itIf lust had been wiped out at any particular point there should have been some sort of indication so that I could know clearly that it was all gone for this or that reason at this or that moment this or that placeIt should have had its momentSo now the mind had to back up and contemplate to find various approaches to remedy the situationIf it were really all gone why hadnt there been a clear indication that it had been wiped out at this or that momentAs soon as I saw a persons body I would perceive right through itThere would be nothing but flesh and bones in that bodyIt wouldnt be a beautiful woman or a beautiful person or anything because the power of my contemplation of unattractiveness was so strong that Id perceive everyone as a pile of bonesWhat would there be to make the mind feel attraction or desire when its in a state like thatI now had to turn around and take a new approachIf physical desire had ended without leaving a trace at a particular moment using a particular strategy why hadnt there been a clear indicationI turned around and contemplated another wayI brought attractiveness in to force out the unattractiveness  the pile of bones  covering it with skin to make it beautifulI had to force the mind you knowOtherwise it would immediately break through to unattractiveness because it was so adept that wayI forced the mind to visualize the bones covered with skin so that theyd be beautiful and then had that beautiful body cling right to mineThat was how I contemplatedId do walking meditation visualizing the beauty of that body clinging to mine clinging right to mine as I walked back and forthSoHow much time would it takeIf there was any desire still left it would have to showIf not then let me know that it was goneI practiced this way for four full days without any physical attraction or desire appearing at allEven though it was an extremely beautiful body nothing appearedThe image kept trying to change into a pile of bones wrapped in skin but I forced the mind to stay just at the skin levelThe fourth night tears began to flowIve had enoughI give in In other words the mind wasnt feeling any pleasureIt said that it had had enough so I tested it again Enough of whatIf you admit that theres no more desire then let me knowI wont accept your giving in like thisTo give in like this is just a ruseI wont go along with itI kept on contemplating every facet to find which facet would make the mind feel desire to see at which moment the desire would arise so that I could then take whatever might appear and focus on it as the object to be contemplated and uprootedThe night got later and later and I kept on focusing in  but I wasnt focused on contemplating unattractiveness at that pointI was contemplating nothing but attractiveness for those entire four days because I was determined to find an approach to test and learn the truth of the situationAfter about or pmthe night of the fourth day there was a flickering as if the mind was going to feel lust for that beautiful body that had been clinging to me constantly during that periodIt was a peculiar sort of flickeringMindfulness was alert to it because mindfulness was there all the timeAs soon as the flickering appeared I kept encouraging itSee that flickeringWeve caught the criminal who has been in hidingSeeSo how can it be goneIf its gone why does it have to behave like this I focused in on itThat flickering was simply a condition of the mind that appeared only slightly with no effect on the body at allIt was inside the mindWhen I encouraged it it would flicker again which proved that it wasnt all goneSo now that it wasnt all gone what was I supposed to doI now had to take a new approach by alternating my tacticsSince this was a path I had never taken before something I had never known before it was very difficult to proceedAs soon as Id focus on unattractiveness attractiveness would vanish in the flash of an eyeIt would vanish extremely fast because I was already adept at unattractivenessAs soon as Id focus on unattractiveness the body would turn immediately into a pile of bones so I would have to focus on attractiveness to make it beautiful againI kept changing back and forth between the two this wayThis took a long time because it was a path I had never trodI didnt understand so I had to try out different methods until I could be sure and settle on one path or anotherI finally came to the truth when I was sitting visualizing an image of unattractiveness right in front of meThe mind focused on unattractiveness standing still right thereI wouldnt let it move or change in any wayI had it stay right there like thatIf it was an image of bones wrapped in skin or a pile of bones with the skin removed I had it stay right there in front of meThe mind stared right at it with mindfulness focused waiting to learn the truth from that image of unattractiveness to see what it would do how this pile of unattractiveness would move or changeHowever I stared at it thats how it would stay because of the adeptness of the mindIf I wouldnt have it destroy the image it wouldnt destroy itI forced it not to destroy itIf I had focused on destroying it it would have been demolished in an instant because of the speed of discernmentBut I didnt let the mind destroy itI had it stay right there in front of me in order to exercise and experiment to find the truth of which I could be certainAs I kept focusing in the image of unattractiveness standing there before me was gradually sucked into the mind absorbed into the mind so that I finally realized that unattractiveness was a matter of the mind itselfThe state of mind that had fixed on the idea of unattractiveness sucked it in  which meant that attractiveness and unattractiveness were simply a matter of the mind deceiving itselfThe mind then let go in a flashIt let go of external unattractivenessIt understood now because it had made the breakThis is how its supposed to beIts been simply a matter of the mind painting pictures to deceive itself getting excited over its shadowsThose external things arent passion aversion and delusion The mind is what has passion aversion and delusion As soon as the mind knew this clearly it extricated itself from external affairs and came inwardAs soon as the mind would blip outward it knew that these inner affairs were displaying themselvesSo now the image of unattractiveness appeared exclusively within the mindI then focused and investigated within the mindBut now it wasnt a matter of that sort of passionIt was something very differentThe affairs of worldly passion now were all goneThe mind understood clearly that things had to make the break that wayIt had passed its verdictIt had understoodSo now that there was the image appearing within the mind focused withinAs soon as it focused within it knew clearly that this internal image came from the mindWhen it disappeared it disappeared here and didnt go anywhere elseThe instant after Id focus on making it appear it would vanishBefore I had focused on it for long it would vanishAfter that it was just like a lightning flash As soon as I focused on making an image it would vanish immediately so there was no time to elaborate on its being attractive or anything at all because of the speed of the arising and disappearingThe instant it would appear  blip it would vanishFrom that point on there were no more images in the mindThe mind became a completely empty mindAs for external unattractiveness that problem had already been taken care ofI had understood it from the moment it was sucked in toward the mind and the mind had immediately let go of external unattractivenessIt let go of sights sounds smells tastes everything external  because the mind was what had been the deceiverOnce I understood this point clearly those other things were no longer a problemThe mind had understood immediately and let go of external things once and for allAfter the internal images had all disappeared the mind was emptyCompletely emptyWhatever I focused on was completely emptyId look at trees mountains buildings and see them simply as shades as shadowsThe major part  the mind  was empty all throughEven when Id look at my own body Id see it simply as a shadowAs for the mind itself it was empty clear through  to the point where I exclaimed to myself Is the mind really this empty It was empty at all timesNothing passed into itEven though it was that empty I would form mental pictures as a way of exercising itWhatever image Id form would be a means of exercising the mind to make it even more adept at emptiness to the point where after a single blip itd be empty  a single blip and itd be emptyThe moment anything was formed  blip itd be empty right thenAt this point  the point where the mind was empty in full measure  this awareness was also prominent in full measureIt fully comprehended rupa vedana sañña sankhara and viññanaIt fully let go of them on its own without anything leftAll that was left was awarenessThere was a feeling of relatedness and intimacy a very subtle sensitivity for this awareness that is hard to describe in line with its realityThere was a feeling of absorption exclusively for this awarenessAny other condition that arose would vanish in the same instantI kept watch over itMindfulness and discernment on this level If this were the time of the Buddha we would call them supermindfulness and superdiscernment but in our day and age we shouldnt reach for those labelsIts enough for our purposes to call them automatic mindfulness and discernmentThats appropriate enough for themTheres no need to call them anything more exalted than that for this doesnt deviate at all from the truth as it existsThis is why the mind was prominent and this prominence made it bright all the way throughOne day I was doing walking meditation on the western side of Wat Doi DhammachediI had gone without food for three or four days and that day was the lunar sabbath so people were coming to the monastery to give almsI went off to do walking meditation from daybreak and came back only when it was time to receive alms in front of the main hallWhen I was standing in contemplation on the meditation path an uncanny feeling of wonder arose to the point where I exclaimed Why is it that this mind is so amazingWhatever I look at  even the earth on which Im treading and see clearly with my eyes  why is it that the mind which is the major part is completely emptyThere are no trees or mountains in the mindIts completely empty with nothing leftTheres nothing but emptiness filling the heartI stood there contemplating for a moment when a kind of realization appeared If there is a point or a center of the knower anywhere that is the essence of a level of being Thats what it said and I was bewilderedActually the word point referred to that point of the knowerIf I had understood this problem in terms of the truth that appeared to warn me things would have been able to disband right then and thereBut instead of understanding I was bewildered  because it was something I had never before known or seenIf there was a point it would be the point of the knowerIf there was a center it would mean the center of the knowerWhere was itThere in that knowing mindThat was the essence of a level of beingThe statement that appeared in the mind already said so clearlyThere was nothing at all wrong about it but I was simply bewildered  What is this  so for the time being I didnt get any benefit from it at allI let more than three months pass by in vain even though the problem was still weighing on the mindI couldnt set it downWhen the time came for me to know I was contemplating just the mind  nothing wideranging or anything  because the mind had already known everything on the blatant levelWhatever sights sounds smells tastes or tactile sensations there might be throughout the cosmos the mind had already known understood and let goIt wasnt interested in investigating themIt wasnt even willing to investigate rupa vedana sañña sankhara or viññana at allIt was interested only in that conspicuous awareness together with the subtle feelings within the mindMindfulness and discernment kept making contact with that awareness examining it back and forthBut you should know that the point I referred to was still a conventional realityNo matter how magnificent it might be it was still magnificence in the realm of conventionNo matter how radiant or splendid it might be it was still radiance and splendor in the realm of convention because there was still unawareness within itUnawareness forms the essence of conventional realityThe point of that prominence eventually began to show its ups and downs  in keeping with the very refined level of the mind  so that I was able to catch sight of themSometimes it was a little tarnished sometimes radiant sometimes stressful sometimes at ease in line with the refinement of the mind on this level enough for me to detect its irregularitiesMindfulness and discernment on this level were very meticulous guardians of this state of mind you knowInstead of aiming my guns  mindfulness and discernment  in on the mind I had aimed them outside as unawareness had deceived me into doingThis is why unawareness is said to be really cunningThere is nothing more cunning than unawareness which is the final pointGreed for example is something blatant easy to understand and plainly harmful and yet world is still content to feel greedThink about itAnger is also blatant and yet the world is still content to feel angerInfatuation love hate All these things are blatant easy to understand and plainly harmful and yet the world is still content to feel themBut this was not the same sort of thing at allIt had gone way beyondIt had let go of all those other things but why was it still attached to this radiance this marvelNow that it was inside it would become tarnished just a littleIt would display stress just a little  which was a form of change and nothing constant or trustworthy  so that I could catch sight of it using mindfulness and discernment that were continually focused there at all times without letup trying to know and see how this state of mind would behaveUltimately there was no escaping it I had to see that this state of mind was nothing to be trusted so I came to reflect Why is it that this state of mind can be so changeableNow its defiled now its radiant now its easeful now its stressfulIts not always constant and trueWhy is it that a mind as refined as this can still show such a variety of conditionsAs soon as mindfulness and discernment had turned to take an interest in investigating this state of mind a totally unexpected realization sprang up within the mind Defilement radiance ease and stress These are all conventional realitiesTheyre all anatta  notselfThat was enoughMindfulness and discernment realized that that state of mind immersed in unawareness was a conventional reality that should simply be let goIt shouldnt be held toA moment after this realization arose to warn mindfulness and discernment which were acting as the sentinels at that moment it was as if the mind mindfulness and discernment each became impartial and impassive not stirring themselves to perform any duty at allAt that moment the mind was neutral not focused on anything not alluding absentmindedly to anything anywhereDiscernment didnt do any workMindfulness was alert in its normal way without being focused on anythingThat moment  when the mind mindfulness and discernment were each impassive and impartial  was the moment when the cosmos in the mind over which unawareness held sway trembled and quakedUnawareness was thrown down from its throne on the heartIn its place the pure mind appeared at the same moment that unawareness was toppled smashed and eradicated through the power of triumphant mindfulness and discernment  the moment when the sky came crashing down and the cosmos trembled and quaked showing its final marvel on the border between convention and releaseJudgment was passed in the court of justice with knowledge and vision of release acting as judgeThe middle way the truth of the path was declared absolute winner while the truth of the origin of stress was knocked out and carried off on a stretcher with no way of reviving ever againI was utterly astounded and exclaimed Isnt it amazingIsnt it amazingWhere has this Dhamma been hidingHow is it that the genuine Dhamma this amazing Dhamma exceeding all expectations  exceeding all the world  has now appeared in the mind and is one with the mindAnd before where were the Buddha and Noble SanghaHow is it that these tremendously amazing refuges have now become one with the heartIs this what the true Buddha Dhamma and Sangha are like They didnt fit in with any guesses or speculations at all but were simply a pure truth dwelling with a pure truthThen I reflected with discouragement back on my fellow living beings with regard to the Dhamma that was in my heart Since this is what the genuine Dhamma is like how could it be brought out and taught so that others would know and understandWouldnt it be more appropriate to live alone until the day the body breaks apart rather than try to teach anyoneAs soon as I considered this a kind of realization suddenly appeared to me The Lord Buddha knew this amazing Dhamma all by himself but was able to become the Teacher of living beings throughout the three levels of the cosmosHow is it that I have been able to teach myself and yet get discouraged at the thought of being able to teach othersThe way to teach the way to know isnt hidden or mysterious When I realized this my discouragement at the thought of teaching my friends gradually faded awayThis event made me think of the first moments after the Buddhas Awakening when he wearied at the thought of taking the excellent Dhamma in his heart and teaching it to the world because he felt that it lay beyond the capability of other people to realize itEven though he had aspired to be a Teacher to instruct the world he felt that the Dhamma he had realized was a Dhamma beyond reach that it would be hopeless to encourage the world to accept it and practice so as to know itBut when he reflected on the path he had followed to Awakening he realized that the Dhamma wasnt beyond reach or beyond hope that there would be infinite benefits for the world if he were to teach the way of the Dhamma whose results he had come to see beyond a doubtThis was why he made up his mind to teach the world from that point onThe reason I had felt the same way was because it was a Dhamma I had never before seen or known and it was a Dhamma utterly amazingWhen I looked solely at the results in the present without reflecting back on the causes  the path I had followed  I felt disheartened and abandoned the idea of telling or teaching anyone about this DhammaBut since reflecting back on the path I had followed I have felt more like speaking and acting out the various facets of the Dhamma in line with the various levels of people who have become involved with me who have studied and trained with me ever since to the point where I have become a sham Acariya as decreed by monks novices and people in generalThis being the case Ive had to speak teach preach and scold heavily or lightly as events may call forI have to beg the forgiveness of my listeners and readers for speaking in an uncouth way to the point of being ugly but when this scrap of a monk was hiding out in the forest and mountains he suffered mightily while training himself by struggling in various ways on the verge of death  because of all sorts of sufferings  without anyone to provide him with a funeralNo one knew or was interested except for a few of those people in the forest and mountains on whom I depended to keep my life going from one day to the next who may have known of some aspects of some of my sufferingsFor this reason the statement that the Buddha practiced to the point of losing consciousness before gaining Awakening is a truth that those who practice wholeheartedly for the sake of the Dhamma the paths fruitions and nibbana have to believe wholeheartedly without any doubtOnly those who have never practiced or had any interest in practice or who practice by tying pillows to the backs of their heads and waiting for defilement to die or dig graves for defilement by lying down and waiting to rake in the paths fruitions and nibbana wont believe in the difficulty with which the Buddha and his Noble Disciples practicedEspecially at present when people are very clever Whatever would fly in the face of their already being wise and allknowing no matter how right or good or fantastic that thing might be they arent willing to use it to take the measure of their own wisdomAs a result their wisdom cant escape creating a lot of foolishness for themselves and the common goodFor this reason the path leading to depravity for the mind and the path leading to Dhamma within the mind are very differentThose who practice the Dhamma says are those who investigate and reflect on every facet of the world and the Dhamma without being complacentNo matter what posture we are in no matter where we should always use mindfulness and discernment to look after ourselvesWe shouldnt be concerned with the deficient or developed manners the good or bad behavior of other people the points they give us or take away more than we are concerned with our own deficient or developed manners our own good or bad behavior and the points we give or take away from ourselvesThis is the path of the Dhamma for those who practice the Dhamma who are always embued with DhammaThe opposite way is the low path for those with low minds with no righteousness infiltrating them at allThis is a warning for all those meditators who have come here for training to understand and take to heartThe Dhamma I have related today is mostly personal and isnt appropriate to be made public to people at large whose sensitivities may varyI myself might be open to criticism and it might be harmful to the attitudes of those who hear or read when the tape is transcribed onto paper  except for restricted circles of people who would understandTo make this talk public thus goes against the grain with me but the extent to which I have made it public is out of sympathy for those who have come for training in all rectitude and who have pleaded with me to make it public as an example that those who practice may follow for a long time to comeIf this is wrong in any way I ask the forgiveness of all my readersIts with the thought that there will be many people endowed with rectitude in the practice of meditation both now and the future who might get some benefit from this outlandish talk that I put up with the embarrassment of having exposed my own stupidity in itThis Dhamma talk was given as an answer to a question posed by one of the more important senior monks of our day and ageThe gist is as followsThis was when I began to investigate into the converging point of the cycle of defilement  namely unawarenessWhile I was investigating I didnt know that I was investigating unawarenessI was simply thinking What is this There was an uncertainty right there so I focused the mind there directed my attention to investigate what it was where it came from where it was goingIt so happened I hit the right spot I say this because I didnt know that it was called or what unawareness wasActually unawareness and its name are very differentWe see its currents spreading out all over the world but those are only its branchesIts like trying to catch an outlaw At first all we can catch are his henchmenWhoever we catch is just a henchmanWe dont know where the chief outlaw is or what he looks like because we have never seen himWe catch lots of his henchmen closing in on him encircling himThis is called laying siege to the outlawOur police force is very large and very strongEach person on the force helps the others so they have a lot of strength surrounding the spot where the outlaw lies catching this person tying up that oneOrdinarily when theyre asked outlaws wont tell who their chief isWhenever we catch an outlaw we tie him up until no one is left inside our siege lineThe last person left is the chief outlawThe last person lies in a strategic place because his henchmen have to guard him well on all sides so that no one can easily slip in to see himThe henchmen keep getting captured one after another until we reach the cave in which the chief outlaw is hiding and then we kill everyone in thereThis is when we know clearly that the wily outlaw has been wiped out for goodThis is simply an analogyTo put it in other words the minds involvement with anything is a branch of delusionRegardless of whether the delusion leads in a good or a bad direction its nothing but an affair of unawareness and the branches of unawareness but actual unawareness itself doesnt lie thereSo the tactics for investigating it if we were to use another analogy are like bailing water out of a pond to catch the fish in itIf theres a lot of water we dont know how many fish it containsSo we keep bailing out the water until it starts receding lower and lowerThe fish gather togetherEach fish wherever it is swims down deeper into the waterThe water keeps getting bailed out and the fish keep gathering togetherWe can see where each fish is going because the water keeps receding until at last when the water is dry the fish have nowhere to hide and so we can catch themSights sounds smells tastes and tactile sensations together with the mental acts that intermingle with them These are like the water in which the fish liveTo investigate these things is not for the purpose of taking possession of them but for the purpose of killing defilement in the same way that a person bails out the water not because he wants the water but because he wants the fishTo investigate these things is not for the purpose of taking possession of them but for the purpose of knowing them stage by stageAs soon as we know to a certain point we are no longer concerned with that pointWe know the things with which we are involved as well as the fact that we are the one at fault for being involved that our own misunderstanding is what deludes us into loving and hating these thingsAt this point the scope of our investigation keeps narrowing in narrowing in just as the water keeps recedingWhatever elements or khandhas we investigate they are just like external things in generalThere are no differencesOn the material side the elements are the same elementsThe difference lies in the acts of the mind that display themselves  but we arent yet aware of them so we go labeling things in line with them which is still one of the branches of unawarenessBut as our investigation seeps deeper and deeper into the central area the more clearly we see the things that come to be involved with us the more clearly we see the mind as it goes out to become involved each time  in the same way that the more the water recedes the more clearly we see the fishAs we investigate the more clearly we see phenomena outside and inside the body as well as our own mental concomitants then the more clearly we see the point where the chief culprit liesAs our investigation keeps closing in the minds focus grows narrower and narrowerIts concerns grow less and lessThe currents sent out by the mind grow shorterAs soon as it stirs itself to become involved with any object we investigate both that object and the stirring of the mind as it goes out to actWe see both aspectsWe see the causes and results on both sides namely the side with which the mind involves itself the things with which it is involved and the one who becomes involvedDiscernment keeps moving in step by stepWhen it moves in and reaches unawareness itself meditators for the most part  if no teacher has warned them in advance  are bound to hold to that as their real selfThis is because they have investigated and seen all things clearly in the heart so that they are fully wise to those things and have let them go with nothing remaining  but what is it that knows those thingsThis is what they take and cherishThis is termed unawareness converging but it turns into their self without their realizing itThe mind gets deluded thereThe term unawareness refers to this very delusion about oneselfDelusions about outside things are not matters of actual unawarenessBecause of our delusion about this because of our delusion about that which knows all other things we forget to investigate and pass judgment on what it is  because when the scope of the mind narrows it gathers itself into a pointThe point of the mind that appears at this stage is a radiant mind bright cheerful and boldAll happiness seems to be gathered right thereWhat do these things come fromIf you were to call them results Id have to admit that they are resultsWe could say that theyre results of the practice  if we arent deluded about this pointIf were still deluded these things are still the origin of stressThis is the central point of the origin of stressBut if were meditators who are always interested in investigating whatever comes our way we wont overlook thisNo matter what we cant help but become interested in investigating this point  because we have already investigated and understood all things of every sort to the point where the mind wont make contact with themIf we take the mind out to investigate anything it wont make contact because it has already had enough of that thingNow every mental act that arises arises from this pointThoughts that form form from this pointThe happiness that appears appears hereThe happiness that appears undergoes changes we can see This is what makes us begin investigating again because this is a level in which we are very observantWhen we observe the happiness we see that it isnt steady for the happiness produced by unawareness is a conventional realitySometimes it gets tarnished a little  just a little  enough for us to know that it isnt uniformIt keeps changing in that way in line with its status as a refined phenomenonThis is the point that we trust and believe inEven those who practice with intensity and extreme interest will fall for this point and become attached to it if no one has explained it to them in advanceBut even though we trust in it we cant help observing it if we are interested because thats all there is that attracts the heartThis is what causes us to be attracted to it to be content with what appearsAs long as we have been investigating thats the way it has been  to the extent that we dont know what unawareness is  and so we believe that this will be nibbana this point that is bright and clear all the timeAll the time here means all the time for those meditators who are persistent in cleansing it and who arent entirely complacent in their trust for it who are very protective of this point and wont let anything touch itSuch people use a great deal of cautionAs soon as anything touches that point they will rectify it immediatelyBut they dont know what it is that they love and cherishEven though that love and cherishing is clearly a burden they dont realize the fact at that momentOnly when enough time has passed for them to be ready to know will they become interested in investigating this pointWhat is thisWeve investigated everything of every sort but what is this Now the mind focuses in on that pointDiscernment probes inWhat is this for sureIs it true yet or notIs it awareness or unawareness These doubts keep nagging at the mindBut we keep on investigating and contemplating using discernment without ceasing  because this is something we have never seen never met with before  to see why we love it why we are protective of itIf its something true why do we have to love and protect itWhy do we have to care for itTo care for something is a burden in which case this must be a hazard for the person who cherishes and cares for it or something that shouldnt be trusted  even though at that moment we still dont know what it is whether its really unawareness or not because we have never seen how true awareness differs from unawareness or how release differs from conventional realityThis is where discernment becomes interested in investigatingNow Id say that this is something very elaborate and involvedIf I were to describe it in line with how I investigated it or to condense it so as to give the gist in a reasonable amount of time Id summarize quickly by saying whatever makes an appearance investigate itWhatever makes an appearance is a matter of conventional reality  Im referring here to the refined phenomena that appear in the heartUltimately even that very point with its brightness is the point of genuine unawarenessFocus down on it using discernmentJust as all phenomena in general are simply phenomena this nature is also simply a phenomenon in exactly the same wayWe cant latch onto it as being us or ours  but our protectiveness shows that we hold to it as being us or ours which is a mistakeDiscernment probes inward to see just what this is as if we were to turn around to look at ourselvesWe look outside and see the earth the sky the airWhatever passes into our range of vision we seeBut if we dont look back at ourselves we wont see ourselvesDiscernment at this stage is very quickIt looks back and forth back and forth to see this last point or this last stage and its investigation is just like its investigation of things in generalIt investigates not to take possession of its object but simply to know its object for what it truly isWhen this disbands its not like other things disbandingWhen other things disband they go with a feeling that we understand themBut this isnt like thatWhen it disbands it disintegrates in an instant like a lightning flashTheres an instant where it acts of its own accord  or you could say that it flips overIt flips over and disappears completelyWhen it disappears thats when we know that it was genuine unawareness  because once this has disappeared nothing more appears for us to doubtWhat remains is nothing like it at allIts a pure natureEven though we have never seen it before when it appears in that moment there is nothing to doubt  and thats how the burden is all goneThe word I refers to this genuine unawarenessIt means that this unawareness is still standingWhatever we have been investigating has been for its sakeWhatever we say we know this I is what knowsRadiantIm radiantLightIm lightHappyIm happyMe I they refer to thisThis is genuine unawarenessWhatever we do is for its sakeOnce it disintegrates there is nothing more for anythings sakeIts all goneIf we were to make an analogy its like a water jar whose bottom has been smashedNo matter how much water we may pour into it nothing stays in the jarEverything that may be formed in line with the nature of the khandhas can still be formed but nothing sticks because the vessel  unawareness the chief culprit  has disintegratedAs soon as sankharas form  blip they vanishThey simply pass by disappearing disappearing because theres no place to keep them no one who owns themThe nature that realizes that nothing is its owner is a nature that has reached its fullnessIt is thus a genuinely pure nature and no longer a burden that needs to be watched over or protected from danger ever againThis unawareness is what has been concealing the true Dhamma the true mind all alongThis is why we havent seen the true natural marvelousness of the mindFor this reason meditators who reach the stage of this pitfall latch onto it as something marvelous love it cherish it are protective of it and regard it as me or mine My mind is radiantMy mind is courageous and braveMy mind is happyMy mind knows everything of every sort  but this nature doesnt know itself which is why the Buddha called it genuine unawarenessOnce we turn around and know it it disintegratesOnce it disintegrates its just like opening the lid of a pot Whatever is in the pot we can see it allOnly unawareness keeps the mind concealedThis purity is a truth that lies beyond the truths of stress its origin its cessation and the pathIts a truth beyond the four Noble TruthsOf the four truths one pair binds the other unbinds and stopsWhat do they bind and unbindThey bind the heart or keep it covered and they unbind the heart or uncover itThey open up the things that cover it so as to reveal its purity in line with its truthIts truth is already there but the two truths of stress and its origin keep it concealed just as the lid of a pot conceals whatever is in the pot so that we cant see itThe path  the practice  opens itThe path and the cessation of stress open the pot so that we can see clearly whats insideEven though the purity is already there its concealed by the first two truths and revealed by the truths that unbindThis is what is bound this is what is revealedOnce its revealed there are no more problemsBoth pairs of truths are activitiesBoth are conventional realitiesThe path and the cessation of stress are conventional realitiesOnce they have performed their duties they passStress and the origin of stress are also conventional realitiesOnce the two conventional realities remedy the two conventional realities that pure nature is a nature that stays fixedWhat we see at that point is called releaseThings are opened so that we see release or natural purityThe burden of the task is ended right hereWhen the mind is pure it doesnt confer any titles on itselfAs for external things the worldly phenomena connected with external things theyre far awayThe worldly phenomena that we used to say were good or bad pleasant or painful in the heart are no longer a problem once that point has disintegratedWhen we investigate to this level its not widerangingIf we can derive an approach from the explanations given by a meditation master who has known and passed this stage we can make quick progress  but its important that we not set up any expectationsExpectations are not the pathWhatever appears keep investigating and understanding that point  each successive thing as it appearsThats the correct pathUnawareness refers to the nature I have just explainedThats genuine unawarenessAll other things are just its branchesLike a vine whose stem grows in one place but that creeps to whoknowswhere No matter how long it is it keeps creeping and climbingWhen we catch hold of it we follow it in follow it in until we reach its stemHeres the stemHeres the rootOnce we pull up the root the whole thing diesIn the same way the branches of unawareness are many and long so that when we actually reach unawareness we dont know what it isBut we investigate itDiscernment probes on inEven though we dont know that this is unawareness our investigation is on the right path and so unawareness opens up of its own accord in the same way as when we eat Fullness appears clearly for us to see step by step all on its ownSo to summarize the issue of whether unawareness is a factor of rebirth or a factor of kamma It creates levels of being it creates kamma relentlesslyThese are both matters of the same cycleIt keeps creating levels of being within itselfThe mind cant lie stillIt simply keeps creating being and birth all the timeIt works at accumulating these things for itself but for the most part it accumulates things that weigh it down constantly making it sink to lower levelsWhen people talk about destroying the wheel of kamma this unawareness is whats destroyedOnce this is destroyed there are no more connections to create further levels of being and birthEven though the things that used to be involved with us continue to become involved as they normally did they pass byThey dont seep inThey dont set up house and move into this spot the way they used toThey simply pass byAnd we know that this pure nature doesnt connect with anythingWe have seen the connections of the mind step by step and when we reach the level where it doesnt connect with anything we knowAs for knowing the question of levels of being and birth as to whether or not well be reborn there is no need to speculate because the present already tells us clearly that when there are no connections to levels of being and birth inside us as we plainly see there are no levels of being or birth to continue into the futureThe factory has been destroyed and there is no way it can rebuild itselfThere is no way it can produce issues as it used toThe factory that produced suffering has been destroyed once and for allThe phrase khandhas pure and simple refers to this stageThe khandhas are khandhas pure and simple without any defilementsIf the mind isnt defiled the khandhas arent defiledThey are simply toolsIf the central part  the mind  is defiled each khandha follows it in being defiledThe body becomes a means for increasing defilement in the heartVedana sañña sankhara and viññana all become means for increasing defilement in the heartIf the mind is pure the khandhas for their part are also pureNothing is defiledBut if the mind is defiled the khandhas are defiled all the livelong dayThis is the way the truth isThe creation of being and birth is a matter of the mind that keeps producing itselfIt cant stay stillA mind that has the cycle in charge of its work or supervising its work will have to keep itself spinning all the timeWhatever thoughts it spins are for the sake of creating being and birthAs soon as the cycle disintegrates there is nothing to create being and birth any moreThose whose minds have attained realization exclaim spontaneously in the heart to proclaim the Dhamma unabashedly to the world saying that there are no more levels of being in which theyare to be reborn  as when the Buddha exclaimed anekajatisamsaram because he knew right in the present that there was nothing creating itselfGoodness stayed in its own territory and didnt seep in didnt mingleEvil stayed in its own territory and didnt seep in or mingleThey didnt come running inWhen we say that they didnt come running in its not that he forced them not toIt was simply their own natureWhen these things come running in we dont force them toTheres simply a medium along which they runWhen theres no more medium they disconnect of their own accordIt seemed to me when I was investigating this  when unawareness disappeared  that there was a moment that let me know very clearlyIt was a moment  an instant I hadnt anticipated or expectedIt was an instant that grabbed my attentionThe instant unawareness disappeared was an instant in which it displayed itself as if it flipped itself over into a new worldIt flipped in the flash of an eye and vanished in the same instant although this wasnt anything I had anticipatedI hadnt intended for it to flipIt happened of its own accordThis is something very subtle that is impossible for me to describe correctly in line with the truth of that instantIn practicing the religion if we practice it really to gain release from suffering there are two intricate pointsTo separate the attachments between the mind and the body This is one intricate point and then this second intricate point that was the final point of my abilityOther than that theres nothing deviousOnce when I went to practice at Wat Doi Dhammachedi the problem of unawareness had me bewildered for quite some timeAt that stage the mind was so radiant that I came to marvel at its radianceEverything of every sort that could make me marvel seemed to have gathered there in the mind to the point where I began to marvel at myself Why is it that my mind is so marvelous Looking at the body I couldnt see it at allIt was all space  emptyThe mind was radiant in full forceBut luckily as soon as I began to marvel at myself to the point of exclaiming deludedly in the heart without being conscious of it  if we speak on the level of refined Dhamma it was a kind of delusion it was amazed at itself Why has my mind come so far  at that moment a statement of Dhamma spontaneously aroseThis too I hadnt anticipatedIt suddenly appeared as if someone were speaking in the heart although there was no one there speakingIt simply appeared as a statement If there is a point or a center of the knower anywhere that is the essence of a level of being Thats what it saidThat phenomenon actually was a point the point of knowledge the point of radianceIt really was a point just as the statement had saidBut I didnt take into consideration what the point was and so I was bewilderedInstead of gaining an approach from the warning that had appeared I took the problem to chew over until I came to consider the part about the point That was what ended the problemI then came back to understand clearly the matter of If there is a point or a center of the knower anywhere that is the essence of a level of being That was when I understood Oh  I seeThe words point and center refer to just this Before I hadnt understoodIt really was a pointNo matter how marvelous it was the point of the marvelousnessIt was a point there to be knownOnce that disintegrated there were no more points because every point is a conventional realityNo matter how refined each is a conventional realityThis is why I am always teaching my fellow meditators Once youve reached that point dont be protective of anythingInvestigate on inEven if the mind should actually be demolished by that investigation let it be demolishedWhatever is left to be aware of the purity let it be aware  or if everything is going to be demolished so that there is nothing left to be aware of purity then at least find outDont be protective of anything at all I say this out of fear that theyll be protective of this thingIf they arent warned that forcefully then no matter what theyre bound to get stuckAll I ask is that they find out Whatever is going to vanish let it vanishEven if the mind is going to vanish from the power of the investigation let it vanishTheres no need to protect it When investigating you have to take it that farBut theres no escaping the truth Whatever arises has to vanish whatever is true whatever is a natural principle in and of itself wont vanishIn other words the pure mind wont vanishEverything of every sort may vanish but that which knows their vanishing doesnt vanishThis vanishes that vanishes but the one that knows their vanishing doesnt vanishWhether or not we try to leave it untouched it keeps on knowingBut to try to protect it is tantamount to protecting unawareness because unawareness is subtleIts there in the mindTo be protective of the mind is tantamount to being protective of unawarenessSo thenIf the mind is going to be destroyed along with it let it be destroyedTo make a comparison with slashing slash right on downDont let there be anything leftLet everything in there close up shop and leaveTo take it that far is just rightIf youre hesitant then you are sure to get stuck at this levelThats why you cant let yourself be hesitantYou have to take the defilements all outWhatever is going to vanish let it all vanishAs for that which is in no position to vanish it wont vanish no matter whatTo put it simply its as if bandits had gotten into this houseIf youre protective of the house where the bandits are then  Bang theyll shoot you deadSo if you should burn the whole house down then burn it downIf you let the bandits stay there theyll go on to destroy things that have more value than the houseSo be willing to sacrifice the houseSet fire to itThis is called setting fire to unawarenessIf the mind is really going to vanish let it vanishBut actually the mind doesnt vanishOnly when you have burned that thing will you know Oh  the thing of value has been lying beneath the power of unawarenessUnawareness has had it covered The instant unawareness vanishes this other thing is revealedInstead of vanishing too it doesnt vanish but if youre protective of it youll be stuck and will never get freeThe period when I was investigating this point was after Venerable Acariya Mun had passed awayI really felt at the end of my ropeI couldnt stay with my fellow meditatorsI couldnt stay with anyone at allTheyd get in the wayTheyd spoil the fun of my internal efforts at investigation  because at that time the mind was really spinningIt had reached the level where it would spin and spin without stoppingAt the time I called it spinning as a wheel of Dhamma not as a wheel of rebirth It spun to release itselfIt spun all the timeAnd as soon as it fully reached a state of enough it stopped  completely and unexpectedlyFor a while at first I had been getting annoyedThe more Ive investigated this mind  and the more refined it has become  why has the burden instead of growing lighter become so heavy like thisAnd it doesnt have any sense of day or night  why is it I was getting a little concerned and annoyedBut even though I was annoyed the mind didnt let upIt kept spinning there right before my eyesIt kept spinning scratching and digging looking for things that I hadnt yet known or seenWherever I was caught up at any point it would keep digging and scratching its way awayAs soon as it made contact it would immediately latch on and stick with itAs soon as it understood the matter would pass and disappearThe mind would then continue probingHad Venerable Acariya Mun been alive at that point things would have gone more quicklyThis is why I have taught my fellow meditators that Ill give them my allIf I cant solve their problems Ill take them to a teacher who canThose are the lengths Ill go to  so that my fellow meditators can put their minds to restAnd for this reason Im not willing to have some of my talks recorded because I let everything outAs soon as Ive finished the sound vanishesI talk just for those who are therePeople who didnt understand those matters would think I was braggingActually I speak in line with the truth and to encourage my students It has to be like thisYou have to slash into it like this Thats just how I put itIts as if I give myself as a guarantee so that my students can be confident that what I say isnt wrong and so that theyll feel inspired to apply themselves to the effort with strength and resilienceOther people though who didnt understand my motives or anything would think I was braggingInstead of benefiting theyd be harmedEven if I werent harmed they might be so I have to be carefulFor this reason on some occasions and with some people where I should really pull out all the stops thats what I doOtherwise I cant put my mind to rest about themWe really have to give and takeIts as if we both open up and give it our all to the point where we keep nothing back not even a centThis is the way it sometimes is on some occasions but not alwaysIt depends on the situation how far we should goIf we go that far then if other people listened in theyd think we were crazyI myself when listening to Venerable Acariya Mun talk If hed take it that far itd go straight to the heartFor three days afterwards I would feel as if the leaves on the trees werent movingThe atmosphere would seem absolutely stillThe power of his Dhamma blanketed everything  because the people listening were really intent on listening the person speaking was really intent on speaking and so they reached each otherAs for us even when were told ThisThisIts like this we still dont seeIts like pointing out things to the blind  pitiful when you think about itFor this reason wherever I am if I havent bowed down to Venerable Acariya Mun I cant lie down to sleep no matter where I amEven if Im about to do walking meditation I first face in his direction and pay him homageIf theres a picture of him as a conventional focus I pay homage to his pictureIf theres nothing I take his virtues and form them into a convention to which I pay respectHis virtues will never fade for meIts as if he hadnt passed away a nature that stays like that as if he were watching me all the timeThis is why all the Noble Disciples who have seen the principles of the truth of the Lord Buddha with their full hearts submit to himThat is they submit to the principles of the truth that are principles of nature they dont submit to his person or anything like thatThey submit in that the principles of the truth are now the same for them and will never fadeNo matter how far they may be from him that truth will never fade because the truth is the same for all of themEven though the Buddha may have entered total nibbana more than years ago this is not a problem that has an impact on the truth appearing in our heartsIts simply the passage of conventional time or of the body  thats all  but the principle of that truth is unmoving always one who is pureWhether alive or totally nibbanaed its one who is pureThis is a truth that is fixedThose who know this principle of the truth all trust it in the same way because the true Buddha the true Dhamma and the true Sangha lie in the heartThe heart truly pure is the Buddha the Dhamma and the Sangha in full measure untouched and undisturbed by time or place unlike conventional realities in generalOnce the mind has been wellcleansed so that its constantly radiant then when were in a quiet place without any sounds  for instance late in the still of the night  even if the mind hasnt gathered in concentration we find that when we focus on that center of awareness it is so exceedingly delicate and refined that its hard to describeThis refinement then becomes like a radiance that spreads all around us in every directionNothing appears to be making contact with the senses of sight hearing smell taste and feeling at that moment even though the mind hasnt gathered into the factors of concentrationInstead this is the firm foundation of the mind that has been wellcleansed and displays a striking awareness magnificence and sensitivity within itselfWith this type of awareness its as if we werent dwelling in a body at allThis is a very refined awareness pronounced within itselfEven though the mind hasnt gathered in concentration still  because of the refinement of the mind because of the pronounced nature of the mind  it becomes a pronounced awareness without any visions or images appearing at allThis awareness is preeminent exclusively in itselfThis is one stage of the mindAnother stage is when this wellcleansed mind gathers into stillness not thinking not forming any thoughts at allIt rests from its activity  its ripplingAll thoughtformations within the mind rest completelyAll that remains is simple awareness  which is called the mind entering into stillnessHere even more so nothing appears at allAll that appears is awareness as if it were blanketing the entire cosmos  because the currents of the mind arent like the currents of lightThe currents of light have their end near or far depending on the strength of the lightFor example with electric light if the candle power is high it will shine for a long distanceIf low it will shine for a short distanceBut the currents of the mind arent like thatThey have no near or far To put it simply there is no time or placeThe mind can blanket everythingFar is like nearNear far They dont really applyAll that appears is that awareness blanketing everything to the ends of the universeIts as if all that appears in the entire world is this single awareness as if there were nothing in our consciousness at all even though everything still exists as it always hasThis is what its like the power of the mind the current of the mind that has been cleansed of things that cloud and obscure itEven more so when the mind is completely pure This is even harder to describeI wouldnt know how to label it because its not something to be labeledIts not something that can be expressed like conventional things in general because its not a conventional realityIt lies solely within the range of those who are nonconventional who know their own nonconventionalityFor this reason it cant be describedNow the world is full of conventionsWhatever we say we need to use a conventional picture a supposition to make comparisons in every caseIt seems like thisIt seems like that Or Its like thisIts like thatIts similar to that For example take the word nibbana Ordinary defilement  our ordinary mind  requires that we think of nibbana as broad and spacious with nothing appearing in itBut we forget that the word nibbana which is a conventional word still has some conventionality to itWe might even think that theres nothing in nibbana but pure people milling around  both men and women because they both can reach purity Nibbana has nothing but those who are pure milling around to and fro or sitting around in comfort and peace without being disturbed by sadness discontent or loneliness as we are in our conventional world so full of turmoil and stressActually we dont realize that this picture  of pure men and women milling or sitting around happily at their leisure without anything disturbing them  is simply a convention that cant have anything to do with the release of actual nibbana at allWhen we talk about things that are beyond the range of convention  even though they may not be beyond the range of the speakers awareness even though they may be well within that persons range  they cant be expressed in conventional termsWhatever is expressed is bound to be interpreted wrongly because ordinarily the mind is always ready to be wrong or continues to be wrong within itselfAs soon as anything comes flashing out we have to speculate and guess in line with our incorrect and uncertain understanding  like VenYamaka saying to VenSariputta that an arahant no longer exists after deathVenYamaka was still an ordinary runofthemill person but even though VenSariputta who was an arahant tried to explain things to him he still wouldnt understand until the Lord Buddha had to come and explain things himselfEven then  if Im not mistaken  VenYamaka still didnt understand in line with the truth the Buddha explained to himAs I remember the texts say that VenYamaka didnt attain any of the paths and fruitions or nibbana or anythingStill there must have been a reason for the Buddhas explanationIf there were nothing to be gained by teaching the Buddha wouldnt teachIn some cases even when the person being taught didnt benefit much from the Dhamma other people involved wouldThis is one of the traits of the Lord BuddhaThere had to be a reason for everything hed sayIf there was something that would benefit his listeners hed speakIf not he wouldntThis is the nature of the Buddha fully reasonable fully accomplished in everything of every sortHe wouldnt make empty pronouncements in the way of the rest of the worldSo when he spoke to VenYamaka Im afraid Ive forgotten the details  because its been so long since I read it  to the point where Ive forgotten who benefited on that occasion or maybe VenYamaka did benefitIm not really sureAt any rate lets focus on the statement An arahant doesnt exist after death as the important pointThe Buddha asked Is the arahant his body so that when he dies he is annihilated with the bodyIs he vedanaSaññaSankharaViññanaIs he earth water wind or fire so that when he dies hes annihilated with these things He kept asking in this way until he reached the conclusion that the body is inconstant and so disbandsVedana sañña sankhara and viññana are inconstant and so disbandWhatever is a matter of convention follows these conventional waysBut whatever is a matter of release  of purity  cannot be made to follow those ways because it is not the same sort of thingTo take release or a released mind and confuse or compound it with the five khandhas which are an affair of conventional reality is wrongIt cant be doneThe five khandhas are one level of conventional reality the ordinary mind is also a level of conventional realityThe refinement of the mind  so refined that it is marvelous even when there are still things entangling it  displays its marvelousness in line with its level for us to see clearlyEven more so when the things entangling it are entirely gone the mind becomes DhammaThe Dhamma is the mindThe mind is DhammaThe entire Dhamma is the entire mindThe entire mind is the entire DhammaAt this point no conventions can be supposed because the mind is pure DhammaEven though such people may still be alive directing their khandhas that nature stays that way in full measureTheir khandhas are khandhas just like oursTheir appearance manners and traits appear in line with their characteristics in line with the affairs of conventional reality that appear in those ways which is why these things cannot be mixed together to become one with that natureWhen the mind is released the nature of release is one thing the world of the khandhas is another world entirelyEven though the pure heart may dwell in the midst of the world of the khandhas it is still always a mind releasedTo call it a transcendent mind wouldnt be wrong because it lies above conventional reality  above the elements and khandhasThe transcendent Dhamma is a Dhamma above the worldThis is why people of this sort can know the issue of connection in the mindOnce the mind is cleansed stage by stage they can see its beginning points and end pointsThey can see the minds behavior the direction towards which it tends most heavily and whether there is anything left that involves the mind or acts as a means of connectionThese things they know and they know them clearlyWhen they know clearly they find a way to cut to remove from the mind the things that lead to connection step by stepWhen the defilements come thick and fast there is total darkness in the mindWhen this happens we dont know what the mind is or what the things entangling it are and so we assume them to be one and the sameThe things that come to entangle the mind and the mind itself become mixed into one so theres no way to knowBut once the mind is cleansed step by step we come to know in stages until we can know clearly exactly how much there is still remaining in the mindEven if theres just a bit we know theres a bit because the act of connection lets us see plainly that This is the seed that will cause us to be reborn in one place or another We can tell this clearly within the mindWhen we know this clearly we have to try to rectify the situation using the various methods of mindfulness and discernment until that thing is cut away from the mind with no more connectionsThe mind will then become an entirely pure mind with no more means of connection or continuationWe can see this clearlyThis is the one who is releasedThis is the one who doesnt dieOur Lord Buddha  from having practiced truly from having truly known in line with the principles of the truth seeing them clearly in the heart  spoke truly acted truly and knew trulyHe taught what he had truly known and truly seen  and so how could he be wrongAt first he didnt know how many times he had been born or what various things he had been born asEven concerning the present he didnt know what his mind was attached to or involved with because he had many many defilements at that stageBut after he had striven and gained Awakening so that the entire Dhamma appeared in his heart he knew clearlyWhen he knew clearly he took that truth to proclaim the Dhamma to the world and with intuitive insight knew who would be able to comprehend this sort of Dhamma quickly as when he knew that the two hermits and the five brethren were already in a position to attain the DhammaHe then went to teach the five brethren and attained the aim he foresawAll five of them attained the Dhamma stage by stage to the level of arahantshipSince the Buddha was teaching the truth to those aiming at the truth with their full hearts they were able to communicate easilyThey looking for the truth and he teaching the truth were right for each otherWhen he taught in line with the principles of the truth they were able to comprehend quickly and to know step by step following him until they penetrated the truth clear throughTheir defilements however many or few they had all dissolved completely awayThe cycle of rebirth was overturned to their complete reliefThis is how it is when a person who truly knows and truly sees explains the DhammaWhether its an aspect of the Dhamma dealing with the world or with the Dhamma itself what he says is bound to be certain because he has seen it directly with his own eyes heard it with his own ears touched it with his own heartSo when he remembers it and teaches it how can he be wrongHe cant be wrongFor example the taste of salt Once we have known with our tongue that its salty and we speak directly from the saltiness of the salt how can we be wrongOr the taste of hot peppers The pepper is hotIt touches our tongue and we know This pepper is hot When we speak with the truth  This pepper is hot  just where can we be wrongSo it is with knowing the DhammaWhen we practice to the stage where we should know we have to know step by stepKnowing the Dhamma happens at the same moment as abandoning defilementWhen defilement dissolves away the brightness that has been obscured will appear in that very instantThe truth appears clearlyDefilement which is a truth we know clearlyWe then cut it away with the path  mindfulness and discernment  which is a principle of the truth and then we take the truth and teach it so that those who are intent on listening will be sure to understandThe Buddha taught the Dhamma in sections but they arent in excess of our five khandhas with the mind in charge responsible for good and evil and for dealing with everything that makes contactEven though there may be as many as sections to the Dhamma they were taught in line with the attributes of the mind of defilement and of the Dhamma itself for the sake of living beings with their differing temperamentsThe Buddha taught extensively  sections of the Dhamma  so that those of differing temperaments could put them into practice and straighten out their defilementsAnd we should make ourselves realize that those who listen to the Dhamma from those who have truly known and truly seen  from the mouth of the Buddha the arahants or meditation masters  should be able to straighten out their defilements and mental effluents at the same time they are listeningThis is a point that doesnt depend on time or placeAll the Dhamma comes down to the mindThe mind is a highly appropriate vessel for each level of the DhammaIn teaching the Dhamma what are the things entangling and embroiling the mind that are necessary to describe so that those who listen can understand and let goThere are elements khandhas and the unlimited sights sounds smells tastes and tactile sensations outside us which make contact with the eye ear nose tongue body and heart within usThus it is necessary to teach both about things outside and about things inside because the mind can become deluded and attached both outside and insideIt can love and hate both the outside and the insideWhen we teach in line with the causes and effects both inside and out in accordance with the principles of the truth the mind that contemplates or investigates exclusively in line with the principles of truth has to know step by step and be able to let goOnce we know something we can let it goThat puts an end to our problem of having to prove or investigate the matter againWhatever we understand is no longer a problem because once we have understood we let goWe keep letting go because our understanding has reached the truth of those various things in full measureThe investigation of the Dhamma on the levels in which it should be narrow has to be narrowOn the levels in which it should be wideranging it has to be wideranging in line with the full level of the mind and the DhammaSo when the heart of the meditator should stay in a restricted range it has to be kept in that rangeFor example in the beginning stages of the training the mind is filled with nothing but cloudiness and confusion at all times and cant find any peace or contentmentWe thus have to force it to stay in a restricted range  for example with the meditation word buddho or with the inandout breath  so as to gain a footing with its meditation theme so that stillness can form a basis or a foundation for the heart so that it can set itself up for the practice that is to followWe first have to teach the mind to withdraw itself from its various preoccupations using whichever meditation theme it finds appealing so that it can find a place of rest and relaxation through the stillnessOnce we have obtained enough stillness from our meditation theme to form an opening onto the way we begin to investigateDiscernment and awareness begin to branch out in stages or to widen their scope until they have no limitWhen we reach an appropriate time to rest the mind through the development of concentration we focus on tranquillity using our meditation theme as we have done before without having to pay attention to discernment in any way at that momentWe set our sights on giving rise to stillness with the meditation theme that has previously been coupled with the heart or that we have previously practiced for the sake of stillnessWe focus in on that theme step by step with mindfulness in charge until stillness appears giving peace and contentmentThis is called resting the mind by developing concentrationWhen the mind withdraws from its resting place discernment has to unravel and investigate thingsLet it investigate whatever it should at that particular time or stage until it understands the matterWhen discernment begins to move into action as a result of its being reinforced by the strength of concentration its investigations have to grow more and more wideranging step by stepThis is where discernment is widerangingThis is where the Dhamma is widerangingThe more resourceful our discernment the more its investigations spread until it knows the causes and effects of phenomena as they truly areIts doubts then disappear and it lets go in stages in line with the levels of mindfulness and discernment suited to removing the various kinds of defilement step by step from the heartThe mind then gradually retreats into a more restricted range as it sees necessary all on its own without needing to be forced as before  because once it has investigated and known in line with the way things really are what is there left to be entangled withTo be concerned aboutThe extent to which it is concerned or troubled is because of its lack of understandingWhen it understands with the discernment that investigates and unravels to see the truth of each particular thing the mind withdraws and lets go of its concernsIt goes further and further inward until its scope grows more and more restricted  to the elements the khandhas and then exclusively to the mind itselfAt this stage the mind works in a restricted scope because it has cut away its burdens in stagesWhat is there in the elements and the khandhasAnalyze them down into their parts  body feelings sañña sankhara and viññana  until you have removed your doubts about any one of themFor example when you investigate the body an understanding of feeling automatically followsOr when you investigate feelings this leads straight to the body to sañña sankhara and viññana which have the same sorts of characteristics  because they come from the same current of the mindTo put it briefly the Buddha taught that each of the five khandhas is a complete treasury or complete heap of the three characteristicsWhat do they have thats worth holding on toThe physical elements the physical heap all physical forms are simply heaps of the elementsVedana sañña sankhara and viññana are all mere mental phenomenaThey appear  blip blip blip  and disappear in an instantWhat value or substance can you get from themDiscernment penetrates further and further inIt knows the truth which goes straight to the heart and it lets go with that straighttotheheart knowledgeIn other words it lets go straight from the heartWhen the knowledge goes straight to the heart it lets go straight from the heartOur job narrows in narrows in as the work of discernment dictatesThis is the way it is when investigating and knowing the path of the mind that involves itself with various preoccupationsWe come in knowing we come in letting go step by step cutting off the paths of the tigers that used to roam about looking for food  as in the phrase from the Dhamma textbooks Cutting off the paths of the tigers that roam about looking for food We cut them out from the paths of the eye ear nose tongue and body along which they used to roam involving themselves with sights sounds smells tastes and tactile sensations gathering up poisonous food and bringing it in to burn the heartDiscernment thus has to roam about investigating the body feelings sañña sankhara and viññana by probing inward probing inward along the paths that the tigers and leopards like to follow so as to cut off the paths along which they used to go looking for foodThe Buddha teaches us to probe inward cutting off the paths until we have the tigers cagedIn other words unawareness which is like a tiger converges in at the one mindAll defilements and mental effluents converge in at the one mindThey cant go out roaming freely looking for food as they did beforeThe mind of unawareness You could say that its like a football because discernment unravels it  stomps on it kicks it back and forth  until it is smashed to bits until the defilement of unawareness is smashed insideThis is the level of the mind where defilement converges so when discernment unravels it its just like a football that is stomped and kickedIt gets kicked back and forth among the khandhas until its smashed apart by discernmentWhen the conventional mind is smashed apart the mind released is fully revealedWhy do we say the conventional mind and the mind releasedDo they become two separate mindsNot at allIts still the same mindWhen conventional realities  defilements and mental effluents  rule it thats one state of the mind but when its washed and wrung out by discernment until that state of mind is smashed apart then the true mind the true Dhamma which can stand the test doesnt disappear with itThe only things that disappear are the things inconstant stressful and notself that had infiltrated the mind  because defilements and mental effluents no matter how refined are simply conventions inconstant stressful and notselfWhen these things disappear the true mind above and beyond convention can then appear to its full extentThis is whats called the mind releasedThis is whats called the pure mind completely cut off from all connections and continuationsAll that remains is simple awareness utterly pureWe cant say at what point in our body this simple awareness is centeredBefore it was a prominent point that we could know and see clearlyFor example in concentration we knew that it was centered in the middle of the chestOur awareness was pronounced right thereThe stillness was pronounced right thereThe brightness the radiance of the mind was pronounced right thereWe could see it clearly without having to ask anyoneAll those whose minds have centered into the foundation of concentration find that the center of what knows is really pronounced right here in the middle of the chestThey wont argue that its in the brain or whatever as those who have never experienced the practice of concentration are always sayingBut when the mind becomes a pure mind that center disappears and so we cant say that the mind is above or below or in any particular spot because its an awareness that is pure an awareness that is subtle and profound above and beyond any and all conventionsEven so we are still veering off into conventions when we say that its extremely refined which doesnt really fit the truth because of course the notion of extreme refinement is a conventionWe cant say that this awareness lies high or low or where it has a point or a center  because it doesnt have one at allAll there is is awareness with nothing else infiltrating itEven though its in the midst of the elements and khandhas with which it used to be mixed its not that way any moreIt now lies world apartWe now can know clearly that the khandhas are khandhas the mind is the mind the body is the body vedana sañña sankhara and viññana are each separate khandhasBut as for feelings in that mind they no longer exist ever since the mind gained release from all defilementTherefore the three characteristics which are convention incarnate dont exist in that mindThe mind doesnt partake of feeling apart from the ultimate ease that is its own nature  and the ultimate ease here is not a feeling of easeWhen the Buddha teaches that nibbana is the ultimate ease the term ultimate ease is not a feeling of ease like the feelings or moods of the mind still defiled or the feelings of the body that are constantly appearing as stress and easeThe ultimate ease is not a feeling like thatThose who practice should take this point to heart and practice so as to know it for themselvesThat will be the end of the question in line with the Dhamma that the Buddha says is sanditthiko  to be seen for oneself  and on which he lays no exclusive claimsThus we cannot say that the mind absolutely pure has any feelingThis mind has no feelingThe term ultimate ease refers to an ease by the very nature of purity and so there cant be anything inconstant stressful or notself found infiltrating that ultimate ease at allNibbana is constantThe ultimate ease is constantThey are one and the sameThe Buddha says that nibbana is constant the ultimate ease is constant the ultimate void is constantTheyre all the same thing  but the void of nibbana lies beyond conventionIts not void in the way the world supposes it to beIf we know clearly we can describe and analyze anything at allIf we dont understand we can talk from morning till night and be wrong from morning till nightThere is no way we can be right because the mind isnt rightNo matter how much we may speak in line with what we understand to be right in accordance with the Dhamma if the mind that is acting isnt right how can we be rightIts as if we were to say Nibbana is the ultimate ease nibbana is the ultimate void to the point where the words are always in our mouth and in our heart If the mind is a mind with defilements it cant be rightWhen the mind isnt right nothing can be rightOnce the mind is right though then even when we dont say anything were right  because that nature is already rightWhether or not we speak were rightOnce we reach the level where were right theres no wrongThis is the marvel that comes from the practice of the religionThe Buddha taught only as far as this level and didnt teach anything furtherIts in every way the end of conventions the end of formulations the end of defilement the end of suffering and stressThis is why he didnt teach anything further because this is the point at which he fully aimed the full level of the mind and of the DhammaBefore he totally entered nibbana his last instructions were Monks I exhort youFormations are constantly arising and ceasingInvestigate formations that are arising and disbanding or arising and ceasing with noncomplacencyThat was allHe closed his mouth and never said anything againIn this teaching which has the rank of a final instruction how should we understand or interpret the word formationWhat kind of formations does it refer toWe could take it as referring to outer formations or inner formations and we wouldnt be wrongBut at that moment we can be fairly certain that those who had come to listen to the Buddhas final instructions at the final hour were practicing monks with high levels of mental attainment from arahants on downSo I would think that the main point to which the Buddha was referring was inner formations that form thoughts in the mind and disrupt the mind at all timesHe taught to investigate the arising and ceasing of these formations with noncomplacency  in other words to investigate with mindfulness and discernment at all timesThese formations cover the cosmosWe could if we wanted to analyze the word formations as outer formations  trees mountains animals people  but this wouldnt be in keeping with the level of the monks gathered there nor would it be in keeping with the occasion the Buddhas last moments before total nibbana in which he gave his exhortation to the Sangha the ultimate teaching at the final hourHis final exhortation dealing with formations given as he was about to enter total nibbana must thus refer specifically to the most refined formations in the heartOnce we comprehend these inner formations how can we help but understand their basis  what they arise fromWell have to penetrate into the wellspring of the cycle of rebirth the mind of unawarenessThis is the way to penetrate to the important pointThose who have reached this level have to know thisThose who are approaching it in stages who havent fully reached it still know this clearly because they are investigating the matter which is what the Buddhas instructions  given in the midst of that important stage of events  were all aboutThis I think would be in keeping with the occasion in which the Buddha spokeWhyBecause ordinarily when the mind has investigated to higher and higher levels these inner formations  the various thoughts that form in the mind  are very crucial to the investigation because they appear day and night and are at work every moment inside the mindA mind reaching the level where it should investigate inner phenomena must thus take these inner formations as the focal point of its investigationThis is a matter directly related to the Buddhas final instructionsThe ability to overthrow unawareness must follow on an investigation focused primarily on inner formationsOnce we have focused in focused in down to the root of defilement and have then destroyed it these formations no longer play any role in giving rise to defilement againTheir only function is to serve the purposes of the DhammaWe use them to formulate Dhamma for the benefit of the worldIn teaching Dhamma we have to use thoughtformations and so formations of this sort become tools of the DhammaNow that we have given the khandhas a new ruler the thoughtformations which were forced into service by unawareness have now become tools of the Dhamma  tools of a pure heartThe Buddha used these thoughtformations to teach the world to formulate various expressions of the DhammaThe Dhamma we have mentioned here doesnt exist solely in the past in the time of the Buddha or solely in the future in a way that would deny hope to whose who practice rightly and properlyIt lies among our own khandhas and mind in our body and mindIt doesnt lie anywhere else other than in the bodies and minds of human beings women and menThe defilements the path and purity all lie right here in the heartThey dont lie in that time or period way back when or with that person or thisThey lie with the person who practices who is using mindfulness and discernment to investigate right nowWhyBecause we are all aiming at the DhammaWe are aiming at the truth just like the Dhamma the truth that the Buddha taught then and that always holds to the principle of being majjhima  in the center  not leaning toward that time or this not leaning toward that period or this placeIts a Dhamma always keeping to an even keel because it lies in the center of our elements and khandhasMajjhima in the center or always just right for curing defilementSo please practice correctly in line with this DhammaYou will see the results of majjhima  a Dhamma just right always and everywhere  appearing as I have saidNibbana the ultimate ease will not in any way lie beyond this knowing heartAnd so Ill ask to stop hereAn excerpt from a letter written by Venerable Acariya Maha Boowa to MrsPow Phanga Vathanakul dated FebruaryThe practice of the Dhamma in keeping with the Dhamma that he gave with utter compassion unequaled by that of anyone else in the world This is the true homage to the BuddhaThe seeing of the truth that lies within you using discernment step by step at all times This is the seeing of the Buddha step by stepThe seeing of the truth with the full heart using discernment This is the seeing of the Buddha in fullThe true Buddha the true Dhamma lie with the heartTo attend to your own heart is to attend to the BuddhaTo watch over your own heart with mindfulness and discernment is truly to see the Buddha Dhamma and SanghaThe king of death warns and assaults the bodies of the worlds living beings in line with the principles of his truthYou have to greet his warnings and assaults with mindfulness discernment conviction and unflagging persistence and take out your treasures  the paths fruitions and nibbana  to flaunt in his face braving death in the course of persistent effortYou and he who have regarded each other as enemies for such a long time will then become true friends  neither of you to take advantage of the other ever againThe body and the khandhas are things that the world must relinquish in spite of its regretsYou should relinquish them with mindfulness and discernment before the time comes to relinquish them in the way of the worldThis is the supreme lettinggo second to nothingPlease take this to heart because it is written straight from the heartIf anything in this translation is inaccurate or misleading I ask forgiveness of the author and reader for having unwittingly stood in their wayAs for whatever may be accurate I hope the reader will make the best use of it translating it a few steps further into the heart so as to attain the truth to which it pointsThe translatorThe first two steps in the process of becoming a lay disciple of the Buddha are the going for refuge and the undertaking of the five preceptsBy the former step a person makes the commitment to accept the Triple Gem  the Buddha the Dhamma and the Sangha  as the guiding ideals of his life by the latter he expresses his determination to bring his actions into harmony with these ideals through right conductThe following two tracts were written for the purpose of giving a clear and concise explanation of these two stepsThough they are intended principally for those who have newly embraced the Buddhas teaching they will probably be found useful as well by longterm traditional Buddhists wanting to understand the meaning of practices with which they are already familiar and also by those who want to know what becoming a Buddhist involvesIn order to keep our treatment compact and to avoid the intimidating format of a scholastic treatise references to source material in the tracts themselves have been kept to a minimumThus we here indicate the sources upon which our account has drawnGoing for Refuge is based primarily upon the standard commentarial passage on the topic found with only minor variations in the Khuddakapatha Atthakatha the Dighanikaya Atthakatha and the Majjhimanikaya AtthakathaThe first has been translated by VenBhikkhu anamoli in Minor Readings and the Illustrator the third by VenNyanaponika Thera in his The Threefold RefugeThe tract Taking the Precepts relies principally upon the commentarial explanations of the training rules in the Khuddakapatha Atthakatha referred to above and to the discussion of the courses of kamma in the MajjhimanikayaThe former is available in English in Venanamolis Minor Readings and Illustrator the latter in Right Understanding Discourse and Commentary on the Sammaditthisutta translated by Bhikkhu SomaAnother useful work on the precepts was The Five Precepts and the Five Ennoblers by HRH Vajirañanavarorasa a late Supreme Patriarch of ThailandAlso consulted was the section on the courses of karma in Vasubandhus Adhidharmakosa and its commentary a Sanskrit work of the Sarvastivada tradition Bhikkhu BodhiThe Buddhas teaching can be thought of as a kind of building with its own distinct foundation stories stairs and roofLike any other building the teaching also has a door and in order to enter it we have to enter through this doorThe door of entrance to the teaching of the Buddha is the going for refuge to the Triple Gem  that is to the Buddha as the fully enlightened teacher to the Dhamma as the truth taught by him and to the Sangha as the community of his noble disciplesFrom ancient times to the present the going for refuge has functioned as the entranceway to the dispensation of the Buddha giving admission to the rest of the teaching from its lowermost story to its topAll those who embrace the Buddhas teaching do so by passing through the door of taking refuge while those already committed regularly reaffirm their conviction by making the same threefold professionAs slight and commonplace as this step might seem especially in comparison with the lofty achievements lying beyond its importance should never be underestimated as it is this act which imparts direction and forward momentum to the entire practice of the Buddhist pathSince the going for refuge plays such a crucial role it is vital that the act be properly understood both in its own nature and in its implications for future development along the pathTo open up the process of going for refuge to the eye of inner understanding we here present an examination of the process in terms of its most significant aspectsThese will be dealt with under the following eight headings the reasons for taking refuge the existence of a refuge the identification of the refuge objects the act of going for refuge the function of going for refuge methods of going for refuge the corruption and breach of the going for refuge and the similes for the refugesWhen it is said that the practice of the Buddhas teaching starts with taking refuge this immediately raises an important questionThe question is What need do we have for a refuge A refuge is a person place or thing giving protection from harm and dangerSo when we begin a practice by going for refuge this implies that the practice is intended to protect us from harm and dangerOur original question as to the need for a refuge can thus be translated into another question What is the harm and danger from which we need to be protected If we look at our lives in review we may not see ourselves exposed to any imminent personal dangerOur jobs may be steady our health good our families wellprovided for our resources adequate and all this we may think gives us sufficient reason for considering ourselves secureIn such a case the going for refuge becomes entirely superfluousTo understand the need for a refuge we must learn to see our position as it really is that is to see it accurately and against its total backgroundFrom the Buddhist perspective the human situation is similar to an iceberg a small fraction of its mass appears above the surface the vast substratum remains below hidden out of viewOwing to the limits of our mental vision our insight fails to penetrate beneath the surface crust to see our situation in its underlying depthsBut there is no need to speak of what we cannot see even what is immediately visible to us we rarely perceive with accuracyThe Buddha teaches that cognition is subservient to wishIn subtle ways concealed from ourselves our desires condition our perceptions twisting them to fit into the mould they themselves want to imposeThus our minds work by way of selection and exclusionWe take note of those things agreeable to our preconceptions we blot out or distort those that threaten to throw them into disarrayFrom the standpoint of a deeper more comprehensive understanding the sense of security we ordinarily enjoy comes to view as a false security sustained by unawareness and the minds capacity for subterfugeOur position appears impregnable only because of the limitations and distortions of our outlookThe real way to safety however lies through correct insight not through wishful thinkingTo reach beyond fear and danger we must sharpen and widen our visionWe have to pierce through the deceptions that lull us into a comfortable complacency to take a straight look down into the depths of our existence without turning away uneasily or running after distractionsWhen we do so it becomes increasingly clear that we move across a narrow footpath at the edge of a perilous abyssIn the words of the Buddha we are like a traveler passing through a thick forest bordered by a swamp and precipice like a man swept away by a stream seeking safety by clutching at reeds like a sailor crossing a turbulent ocean or like a man pursued by venomous snakes and murderous enemiesThe dangers to which we are exposed may not always be immediately evident to usVery often they are subtle camouflaged difficult to detectBut though we may not see them straightaway the plain fact remains that they are there all the sameIf we wish to get free from them we must first make the effort to recognize them for what they areThis however calls for courage and determinationOn the basis of the Buddhas teaching the dangers that make the quest for a refuge necessary can be grouped into three general classes the dangers pertaining to the present life those pertaining to future lives and those pertaining to the general course of existenceEach of these in turn involves two aspects and objective aspect which is a particular feature of the world and a subjective aspect which is a corresponding feature of our mental constitutionWe will now consider each of these in turnAObjective aspectThe most obvious danger confronting us is the sheer fragility of our physical body and its material supportsFrom the moment we are born we are subject to disease accident and injuryNature troubles us with disasters such as earthquakes and floods societal existence with crime exploitation repression and the threat of warEvents on the political social and economic fronts rarely pass very long without erupting into crisisAttempts at reform and revolution always wind up repeating the same old story of stagnation violence and consequent disillusionmentEven in times of relative tranquillity the order of our lives is never quite perfectSomething or other always seems to be getting out of focusSnags and predicaments follow each other endlesslyEven though we might be fortunate enough to escape the serious adversities there is one we cannot avoidThis is deathWe are bound to die and with all our wealth expertise and power we still stand helpless before our inevitable mortalityDeath weighs upon us from the time we are bornEvery moment brings us closer to the inescapableAs we are drawn along feeling secure in the midst of our comforts we are like a man walking across a frozen lake believing himself safe while the ice is cracking underfootThe dangers hanging over us are made even more problematic by their common feature of uncertaintyWe have no knowledge when they will take placeIf we knew calamity is going to hit we could at least prepare in advance to resign ourselves stoicallyBut we do not enjoy even this much edge on the futureBecause we lack the benefit of foreknowledge our hopes stand up straight moment after moment coupled with a vague presentiment that any second in a flash they can suddenly be dashed to piecesOur health might be stricken down by illness our business fail our friends turn against us our loved ones die  we do not knowWe can have no guarantee that these reversals will not come upon usEven death is only certain in that we can be sure it will strikeExactly when it will strike still remains uncertainBSubjective aspectThe adversities just sketched are objective features built into the worlds constitutionOn the one side there is calamity crisis and predicament on the other the radical uncertainty pervading themThe subjective aspect of the danger pertaining to the present life consists in our negative response to this twofold liabilityThe element of uncertainty tends to provoke in us a persistent disquietude running beneath our surface selfassuranceAt a deep interior level we sense the instability of our reliances their transience and vulnerability to change and this awareness produces a nagging apprehensiveness which rises at times to a pitch of anxietyThe source of our disquietude we may not always be able to pinpoint but it remains lurking in the undercurrent of the mind  an unlocalized fear that our familiar supports will suddenly be stripped away leaving us without our usual frame of referenceThis anxiety is sufficient disturbance in itselfYet often our fears are confirmedThe course of events follows a pattern of its own independently of our will and the two do not necessarily coincideThe world thrown up illness loss and death which strike when the time is ripeWhen the course of events clashes with our will the outcome is pain and dissatisfactionIf the conflict is small we become angry upset depressed or annoyed if it is great we undergo anguish grief or despairIn either case a fundamental disharmony emerges from the cleavage between desire and the world and the result for us is sufferingThe suffering that arises is not significant solely in itselfIt has a symptomatic value pointing to some more deeply grounded malady underlying itThis malady lies in our attitude towards the worldWe operate out of a mental frame built up of expectations projections and demandsWe expect reality to conform to our wishes to submit to our mandates to confirm our preconceptions but this it refuses to doWhen it refuses we meet pain and disappointment born from the conflict between expectation and actualityTo escape this suffering one of the two must change our will or the worldSince we cannot alter the nature of the world to make it harmonize with our will the only alternative is to change ourselves by putting away attachment and aversion towards the worldWe have to relinquish our clinging to stop hankering and grasping to learn to view the fluctuation of events with a detached equanimity free from the swing of elation and dejectionThe mind of equanimity poised beyond the play of worldly opposites is the highest safety and security but to gain this equanimity we stand in need of guidanceThe guidance available cannot protect us from objective adversityIt can only safeguard us from the dangers of a negative response  from anxiety sorrow frustration and despairThis is the only protection possible and because it grants us this essential protection such guidance can be considered a genuine refugeThis is the first reason for going for refuge  the need for protection from negative reactions to the dangers besetting us here and nowAObjective aspectOur liability to harm and danger does not end with deathFrom the perspective of the Buddhas teaching the event of death is the prelude to a new birth and thus the potential passageway to still further sufferingThe Buddha teaches that all living beings bound by ignorance and craving are subject to rebirthSo long as the basic drive to go on existing stands intact the individualized current of existence continues on after death inheriting the impressions and dispositions accumulated in the previous lifeThere is no soul to transmigrate from one life to the next but there is an ongoing stream of consciousness which springs up following death in a new form appropriate to its own dominant tendenciesRebirth according to Buddhism can take place in any of six realms of becomingThe lowest of the six is the hells regions of severe pain and torment where evil actions receive their due expiationThen comes the animal kingdom where suffering prevails and brute force is the ruling powerNext is the realm of hungry ghosts shadowy beings afflicted with strong desires they can never satisfyAbove them is the human world with its familiar balance of happiness and suffering virtue and evilThen comes the world of the demigods titanic beings obsessed by jealousy and ambitionAnd at the top stands the heavenly worlds inhabited by the devas or godsThe first three realms of rebirth  the hells the animal kingdom and the realm of ghosts  together with the asuras are called the evil destinations or plane of miseryThey receive these names because of the preponderance of suffering found in themThe human world and the heavenly worlds are called in contrast the happy destinations since they contain a preponderance of happinessRebirth in the evil destinations is considered especially unfortunate not only because of the intrinsic suffering they involve but for another reason as wellRebirth there is calamitous because escape from the evil destinations is extremely difficultA fortunate rebirth depends on the performance of meritorious actions but the beings in the evil destinations find little opportunity to acquire merit thence the suffering in these realms tends to perpetuate itself in a circle very difficult to breakThe Buddha says that if a yoke with a single hole was floating at random on the sea and a blind turtle living in the sea were to surface once every hundred years  the likelihood of the turtle pushing his neck through the hole in the yoke would be greater than that of a being in the evil destinations regaining human statusFor these two reasons  because of their inherent misery and because of the difficulty of escaping from them  rebirth in the evil destinations is a grave danger pertaining to the future life from which we need protectionBSubjective aspectProtection from a fall into the plane of misery cannot be obtained from othersIt can only be obtained by avoiding the causes leading to an unfortunate rebirthThe cause for rebirth into any specific plane of existence lies in our kamma that is our willed actions and volitionsKamma divides into two classes the wholesome and the unwholesomeThe former are actions motivated by detachment kindness and understanding the latter actions motivated by greed hatred and delusionThese two classes of kamma generate rebirth into the two general planes of existence wholesome kamma brings rebirth into the happy destinations unwholesome kamma brings rebirth into the evil destinationsWe cannot obliterate the evil destinations themselves they will continue on as long as the world itself enduresTo avoid rebirth in these realms we can only keep watch over ourselves by controlling our actions so that they do not spill over into the unwholesome courses leading to a plunge into the plane of miseryBut to avoid generating unwholesome kamma we need help and that for two principal reasonsFirst we need help because the avenues of action open to us are so varied and numerous that we often do not know which way to turnSome actions are obviously wholesome or unwholesome but others are difficult to evaluate throwing us into perplexity when we run up against themTo choose correctly we require guidance  the clear indications of one who knows the ethical value of all actions and the pathways leading to the different realms of beingThe second reason we need help is because even when we can discriminate right from wrong we are often driven to pursue the wrong against our better judgmentOur actions do not always follow the counsel of our dispassionate decisionsThey are often impulsive driven by irrational urges we cannot master or controlBy yielding to these drives we work our own harm even while helplessly watching ourselves do soWe have to gain mastery over our mind to bring our capacity for action under the control of our sense of higher wisdomBut this is a task which requires disciplineTo learn the right course of discipline we need the instructions of one who understands the subtle workings of the mind and can teach us how to conquer the obsessions which drive us into unhealthy selfdestructive patterns of behaviorBecause these instructions and the one who gives them help protect us from future harm and suffering they can be considered a genuine refugeThis is the second reason for going for refuge  the need to achieve mastery over our capacity for action so as to avoid falling into the evil destinations in future livesAObjective aspectThe perils to which we are exposed are immensely greater than those just discussedBeyond the evident adversities and misfortunes of the present life and the risk of a fall into the plane of misery there is a more fundamental and comprehensive danger running through the entire course of worldly existenceThis is the intrinsic unsatisfactoriness of samsaraSamsara is the cycle of becoming the round of birth aging and death which has been revolving through beginningless timeRebirth does not take place only once leading to an eternity in the life to comeThe lifeprocess repeats itself over and over the whole pattern spelling itself out again and total with each new turn each single birth issues in decay and death each single death gives way to a new birthRebirth can be fortunate or miserable but wherever it occurs no halt is made to the revolution of the wheelThe law of impermanence imposes its decree upon the entire domain of sentient life whatever arises must eventually ceaseEven the heavens provide no outlet life there also ends when the kamma that brought a heavenly birth is exhausted to be followed by a rearising in some other plane perhaps in the miserable abodesBecause of this pervasive transience all forms of conditioned existence appear to the eye of wisdom as essentially dukkha unsatisfactory or sufferingNone of our supports and reliances is exempt from the necessity to change and pass awayThence what we resort to for comfort and enjoyment is in reality a concealed form of suffering what we rely on for security is itself exposed to danger what we turn to for protection itself needs to be protectedNothing that we want to hold to can be held onto forever without perishing It is crumbling away it is crumbling away therefore it is called the worldYouth issues in old age health in sickness life in deathAll union ends in separation and in the pain that accompanies separationBut to understand the situation in its full depth and gravity we must multiply it by infinityFrom time without beginning we have been transmigrating through the round of existence encountering the same experiences again and again with vertiginous frequency birth aging sickness and death separation and loss failure and frustrationRepeatedly we have made the plunge into the plane of misery times beyond counting we have been animal ghost and denizen of hellOver and over we have experienced suffering violence grief despairThe Buddha declares that the amount of tears and blood we have shed in the course of our samsaric wandering is greater than the waters in the ocean the bones we have left behind could form a heap higher than the Himalaya mountainsWe have met this suffering countless times in the past and as long as the causes of our cycling in samsara are not cut off we risk meeting more of the same in the course of our future wanderingBSubjective aspectTo escape from these dangers there is only one way of release to turn away from all forms of existence even the most sublimeBut for the turning away to be effective we must cut off the causes that hold us in bondage to the roundThe basic causes that sustain our wandering in samsara lie within ourselvesWe roam from life to life the Buddha teaches because we are driven by a profound insatiable urge for the perpetuation of our beingThis urge the Buddha calls bhavatanha the craving for existenceWhile craving for existence remains operative even if only latently death itself is no barrier to the continuation of the lifeprocessCraving will bridge the vacuum created by death generating a new form of existence determined by the previously accumulated storage of kammaThus craving and existence sustain each other in successionCraving brings forth a new existence the new existence gives the ground for craving to resume its search for gratificationUnderlying this vicious nexus which links together craving and repeated existence is a still more primordial factor called ignoranceIgnorance is a basic unawareness of the true nature of things a beginningless state of spiritual unknowingThe unawareness operates in two distinct ways on one side it obscures correct cognition on the other it creates a net of cognitive and perceptual distortionsOwing to ignorance we see beauty in things that are really repulsive permanence in the impermanent pleasure in the unpleasurable and selfhood in selfless transient unsubstantial phenomenaThese delusions sustain the forward drive of cravingLike a donkey chasing a carrot suspended from a cart dangling before its face we rush headlong after the appearances of beauty permanence pleasure and selfhood only to find ourselves still emptyhanded more tightly entangled in the samsaric roundTo be freed from this futile and profitless pattern it is necessary to eradicate the craving that keeps it in motion not merely temporarily but permanently and completelyTo eradicate craving the ignorance which supports it has to be dislodged for as long as ignorance is allowed to weave its illusions the ground is present for craving to reviveThe antidote to ignorance is wisdomWisdom is the penetrating knowledge which tears aside the veils of ignorance in order to see things as they really are It is not mere conceptual knowledge but an experience that must be generated in ourselves it has to be made direct immediate and personalTo arouse this wisdom we need instruction help and guidance  someone who will teach us what we must understand and see for ourselves and the methods by which we can arouse the liberating wisdom that will cut the cords binding us to repeated becomingSince those who give this guidance and the instructions themselves provide protection from the perils of transmigration they can be considered a genuine refugeThis is the third reason for going for refuge  the need for deliverance from the pervasive unsatisfactoriness of SamsaraTo realize that the human situation impels the search for a refuge is a necessary condition for taking refuge but is not in itself a sufficient conditionTo go for refuge we must also become convinced that an effective refuge actually existsBut before we can decide on the existence of a refuge we first have to determine for ourselves exactly what a refuge isThe dictionary defines refuge as a shelter or protection from danger and distress a person or place giving such protection and an expedient used to obtain such protectionThis tallies with the explanation of the Pali word sarana meaning refuge which has come down in the Pali commentariesThe commentaries gloss the word sarana with another word meaning to crush explaining that when people have gone for refuge then by that very going for refuge it crushes dispels removes and stops their fear anguish suffering risk of unhappy rebirth and defilementThese explanations suggest two essential qualifications of a refugeFirst a refuge must be itself beyond danger and distressA person or thing subject to danger is not secure in itself and thus cannot give security to othersOnly what is beyond fear and danger can be confidently relied upon for protectionSecond the purported refuge must be accessible to usA state beyond fear and danger that is inaccessible is irrelevant to our concerns and thus cannot function as a refugeIn order for something to serve as a refuge it must be approachable capable of giving protection from dangerFrom this abstract determination of the qualifications of a refuge we can return to the concrete question at handDoes there exist a refuge able to give protection from the three types of dangers delineated above from anxiety frustration sorrow and distress in the present life from the risk of an unhappy destination after death and from continued transmigration in samsaraThe task of working out an answer to this question has to be approached cautiouslyWe must recognize at once that an objectively verifiable publicly demonstrable answer cannot be givenThe existence of a refuge or the specification of a particular refuge cannot be proven logically in an irrefutable manner binding on allThe most that can be done is to adduce cogent grounds for believing that certain persons or objects possess the qualifications of a refugeThe rest depends upon faith a confidence born out of trust at least until that initial assent is transformed into knowledge by means of direct experienceBut even then the verification remains inward and personal a matter of subjective appropriation rather than of logical proof or objective demonstrationFrom the Buddhist perspective there are three refuges which together make available complete protection from danger and distressThese three are the Buddha the Dhamma and the SanghaThe three are not separate refuges each sufficient in itself rather they are interrelated members of a single effective refuge which divides into three by way of a distinction in the characteristics and functions of its membersWhy such a distinction is necessary becomes clear if we consider the order in which the three are presentedThe Buddha comes first because he is a personSince we are persons we naturally look to another person for guidance inspiration and directionWhen it is ultimate deliverance that is at stake what we look for in the first place is a person who has himself reached complete freedom from danger and can lead us to the same state of safetyThis is the Buddha the enlightened one who comes first in the triad for the reason that he is the person who discovers achieves and proclaims the state of refugeIn the second place we need that state of refuge itself the state beyond fear and danger then we need a path leading to this goal and also we need a set of instructions guiding us along the pathThis is the Dhamma which as we will see has this threefold denotationThen in the third place we need persons who began like ourselves  as ordinary people troubled by afflictions  and by following the way taught by the guide reached the state of safety beyond fear and dangerThis is the Sangha the community of spiritual persons who have entered the path realized the goal and can now teach the path to othersWithin the triad each member works in harmony with the other two to make the means of deliverance available and effectiveThe Buddha serves as the indicator of refugeHe is not a savior who can bestow salvation through the agency of his personSalvation or deliverance depends upon us upon our own vigor and dedication in the practice of the teachingThe Buddha is primarily a teacher an expounder of the path who points out the way we ourselves must tread with our own energy and intelligenceThe Dhamma is the actual refugeAs the goal of the teaching the Dhamma is the state of security free from danger as the path it is the means for arriving at the goal and as the verbal teaching it is the body of instructions describing the way to practice the pathBut to make effective use of the means at our disposal we need the help of others who are familiar with the pathThose who know the path make up the Sangha the helpers in finding refuge the union of spiritual friends who can lead us to our own attainment of the pathThis triadic structure of the three refuges can be understood with the aid of a simple analogyIf we are ill and want to get well we need a doctor to diagnose our illness and prescribe a remedy we need medicine to cure our illness and we need attendants to look after our requirementsThe doctor and attendants cannot cure usThe most they can do for us is to give us the right medicine and make sure that we take itThe medicine is the actual remedy which restores our healthSimilarly when seeking relief from suffering and distress we rely on the Buddha as the physician who can find out the cause of our illness and show us the way to get well we rely on the Dhamma as the medicine which cures our afflictions and we rely on the Sangha as the attendants who will help us take the medicineTo get well we have to take the medicineWe cant just sit back and expect the doctor to cure us all by himselfIn the same way to find deliverance from suffering we have to practice the Dhamma for the Dhamma is the actual refuge which leads to the state of deliveranceThe fruitfulness of the act of taking refuge is proportional to the depth and precision with which we understand the nature of the refugeobjectsTherefore these objects have to be identified with precision and correctly understoodEach refugeobject has a double layer of signification one concrete and mundane the other intangible and supramundaneThe two are not entirely distinct but intermesh in such a way that the former acts as a vehicle for the latterAn examination of each refuge in turn will make clear what their twofold signification is and how they interfuseThe Buddha as refuge can be considered firstOn one level the word Buddha refers to a particular figure  the man Siddhattha Gotama who lived in India in the fifth century BWhen we take refuge in the Buddha we take refuge in this person for he is the teacher of the Dhamma and the historical founder of BuddhismHowever in going to him for refuge we do not take refuge in him merely in his concrete particularityWe rely upon him as the Buddha the enlightened one and this has a significance transcending the limits of what can be given by empirical historical factWhat enables the Buddha to function as a refuge is his actualization of a supramundane attainmentThis attainment is the state of Buddhahood or perfect enlightenment a state which has been realized by other persons in the past and will be realized again in the futureThose who realize this state are BuddhasWhen we take refuge in the Buddha we rely upon him as a refuge because he embodies this attainment in himselfIt is his Buddhahood that makes the Buddha a refugeBut what is the Buddhahood of the BuddhaIn brief the Buddhahood of the Buddha is the sum total of the qualities possessed by that person named Gotama which make him a BuddhaThese qualities can be summed up as the abandonment of all defects and the acquisition of all virtuesThe defects abandoned are the defilements together with their residual impressionsThe defilements are afflictive mental forces which cause inner corruption and disturbance and motivate unwholesome actionsTheir principle members are greed hatred and delusion from these all the secondary defilements deriveIn the Buddha these defilements have been abandoned totally completely and finallyThey are abandoned totally in that all defilements have been destroyed with none remainingThey are abandoned completely in that each one has been destroyed at the root without residueAnd they have been abandoned finally in that they can never arise again in the futureThe virtues acquired by the Buddha are very numerous but two stand out as paramount great wisdom and great compassionThe great wisdom of the Buddha has two aspects  extensiveness of range and profundity of viewThrough the extensive range of his wisdom the Buddha understands the totality of existent phenomena through his profundity of view he understands the precise mode of existence of each phenomenonThe Buddhas wisdom does not abide in passive contemplation but issues in great compassionThrough his great compassion the Buddha comes forth to work for the welfare of othersHe takes up the burden of toiling for the good of sentient beings actively and fearlessly in order to lead them to deliverance from sufferingWhen we go for refuge to the Buddha we resort to him as the supreme embodiment of purity wisdom and compassion the peerless teacher who can guide us to safety out of the perilous ocean of samsaraThe Dhamma too involves a double referenceAt the elementary level the word Dhamma signifies the teaching of the Buddha  the conceptually formulated verbally expressed set of doctrines taught by or deriving from the historical figure GotamaThis teaching called the transmission is contained in the Tipitaka or three collections of scripture and in the commentaries and expository works which explain themThe three collections are the Vinayapitaka the Suttapitaka and the AbhidhammapitakaThe Vinayapitaka collects together all the monastic rules and regulations detailing the discipline for Buddhist monks and nunsThe Suttapitaka contains the discourses of the Buddha expounding his doctrine and the practice of his pathThe Abhidhammapitaka presents an exposition of the sphere of actuality from the standpoint of a precise philosophical understanding which analyzes actuality into its fundamental constituting elements and shows how these elements lock together through a network of conditional relationsThe verbally transmitted Dhamma contained in the scriptures and commentaries serves as the conduit to a deeper level of meaning communicated through its words and expressionsThis is the Dhamma of actual achievement which comprises the path and the goalThe goal is the final end of the teaching nibbana the complete cessation of suffering the unconditioned state outside and beyond the round of impermanent phenomena making up samsaraThis goal is to be reached by a specific path a course of practice bringing its attainment namely the noble eightfold path  right views right intentions right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness and right concentrationThe path divides into two stages a mundane path and a supramundane pathThe mundane path is the course of application developed when its factors are cultivated in daily life and in periods of intensified practiceThe supramundane path is a state of wisdomconsciousness that arises when all the requisite conditions for realization are fully matured usually at the peak of intensified practiceThis path actually represents a state in the experience of enlightenment having the dual function of realizing nibbana and eradicating defilementsThe supramundane path comes only in momentary breakthroughs which when they occur effect radical transformations in the structure of the mindThese breakthroughs are four in number called the four pathsThe four divide according to their ability to cut the successively subtler fetters causing to samsaraThe first path the initial breakthrough to enlightenment is the path of streamentry which eradicates the fetters of egoaffirming views doubt and clinging to rites and wrong observancesThe second called the path of the oncereturner does not cut off any fetters but weakens their underlying rootsThe third the path of the nonreturner eliminates the fetters of sensual desire and illwillAnd the forth the path of arahatship eradicates the five remaining fetters  desire for existence in the spheres of fine material and immaterial being conceit restlessness and ignoranceEach pathmoment is followed immediately by several moments of another supramundane experience called fruition which comes in four stages corresponding to the four pathsFruition marks the enjoyment of the freedom from defilement effected by the preceding pathmomentIt is the state of release or experiential freedom which comes when the fetters are brokenEarlier it was said that the Dhamma is the actual refugeIn the light of the distinctions just drawn this statement can now be made more preciseThe verbal teaching is essentially a map a body of instructions and guidelinesSince we have to rely on these instructions to realize the goal the teaching counts as an actual refuge but it is so in a derivative wayThus we can call it an actual but indirect refugeThe mundane path is direct since it must be practiced but because it serves principally as preparation for the supramundane path its function is purely provisional thus it is an actual and direct but provisional refugeThe supramundane path apprehends nibbana and once attained leads irreversibly to the goal thence it may be called an actual direct and superior refugeHowever even the supramundane path is a conditioned phenomenon sharing the characteristic of impermanence common to all conditioned phenomenaMoreover as a means to an end it possesses instrumental value only not intrinsic valueThus its status as a refuge is not ultimateUltimate status as a refuge belongs exclusively to the goal to the unconditioned state of nibbana which therefore among all three refuges can alone be considered the refuge which is actual direct superior and ultimateIt is the final resort the island of peace the sanctuary offering permanent shelter from the fears and dangers of samsaric becomingAt the conventional or mundane level the Sangha signifies the BhikkhuSangha the order of monksThe Sangha here is an institutional body governed by formally promulgated regulationsIts doors of membership are open to any candidate meeting the required standardsAll that is needed to enter the Sangha is to undergo ordination according to the procedure laid down in the Vinaya the system of monastic disciplineDespite its formal character the order of monks fulfills an indispensable role in the preservation and perpetuation of the Buddhas dispensationIn an unbroken lineage extending back over twentyfive hundred years the monastic order has served as the custodian of the DhammaThe mode of life it makes possible permits it to exercise this functionThe Buddhas dispensation as we suggested possesses a twofold character it is a path of practice leading to liberation from suffering and also a distinctive set of doctrines embedded in scriptures expounding the details of this pathThe Sangha bears the responsibility for maintaining both aspects of the dispensationIts members assume the burden of continuing the tradition of practice with the aim of showing that the goal can be realized and deliverance attainedThey also take up the task of preserving the doctrines seeing to it that the scriptures are taught and transmitted to posterity free from distortion and misinterpretationFor these reasons the institutional Sangha is extremely vital to the perpetuation of the Buddhas teachingHowever the order of monks is not itself the Sangha which takes the position of the third refugeThe Sangha which serves as refuge is not an institutional body but an unchartered spiritual community comprising all those who have achieved penetration of the innermost meaning of the Buddhas teachingThe Sangharefuge is the ariyan Sangha the noble community made up exclusively of ariyans person of superior spiritual statureIts membership is not bound together by formal ecclesiastical ties but by the invisible bond of a common inward realizationThe one requirement for admission is the attainment of this realization which in itself is sufficient to grant entranceThough the way of life laid down for the monastic order with its emphasis on renunciation and meditation is most conducive to attaining the state of an ariyan the monastic Sangha and the ariyan Sangha are not coextensiveTheir makeup can differ and that for two reasons first because many monks  the vast majority in fact  are still worldlings and thence cannot function as a refuge and second because the ariyan Sangha can also include laymenMembership in the ariyan Sangha depends solely on spiritual achievement and not on formal ordinationAnyone  layman or monk  who penetrates the Buddhas teaching by direct vision gains admission through that very attainment itselfThe membership of the ariyan Sangha comprises eight types of persons which unite into four pairsThe first pair consists of the person standing on the path of streamentry and the streamenterer who has entered the way to deliverance and will attain the goal in a maximum of seven lives the second pair of the person standing on the path of the oncereturner and the oncereturner who will return to the human world only one more time before reaching the goal the third pair of the person standing on the path of the nonreturner and the nonreturner who will not come back to the human world again but will take rebirth in a pure heavenly world where he will reach the final goal and the fourth pair of the person standing on the path of arahatship and the arahant who has expelled all defilements and cut off the ten fetters causing bondage to samsaraThe eight persons can be divided in another way into two general classesOne consists of those who by penetrating the teaching have entered the supramundane path to liberation but still must practice further to arrive at the goalThese include the first seven types of ariyan persons who are collectively called trainees or learners because they are still in the process of trainingThe second class comprises the arahats who have completed the practice and fully actualized the goalThese are called beyond training because they have no further training left to undertakeBoth the learners and the arahats have directly understood the essential import of the Buddhas teaching for themselvesThe teaching has taken root in them and to the extent that any work remains to be done they no longer depend on others to bring it to its consummationBy virtue of this inner mastery these individuals possess the qualifications needed to guide others towards the goalHence the ariyan Sangha the community of noble persons can function as a refugeTo enter the door to the teaching of the Buddha it is not enough merely to know the reference of the refugeobjectsThe door of entrance to the teaching is the going for refuge to the Buddha the Dhamma and the SanghaTo understand what the refugeobjects mean is one thing to go to them for refuge is another and it is the going for refuge alone that constitutes the actual entrance to the dispensationBut what is the going for refugeAt first glance it would seem to be the formal commitment to the Triple Gem expressed by reciting the formula of refuge for it is this act which marks the embracing of the Buddhas teachingSuch an understanding however would be superficialThe treatises make it clear that the true going for refuge involves much more than the reciting of a preestablished formulaThey indicate that beneath the verbal profession of taking refuge there runs concurrently another process that is essentially inward and spiritualThis other process is the mental commitment to the taking of refugeThe going for refuge as defined by the commentaries is in reality an occasion of consciousness It is an act of consciousness devoid of defilements by confidence in and reverence for taking as the supreme resort That the act is said to be devoid of defilements stresses the need for sincerity of aimRefuge is not pure if undertaken with defiled motivation  out of desire for recognition pride or fear of blameThe only valid motivation for taking refuge is confidence and reverence directed towards the Triple GemThe act of consciousness motivated by confidence and reverence occurs taking the Triple Gem as the supreme resortThat the Triple Gem is taken as the supreme resort means that it is perceived as the sole source of deliveranceBy turning to the threefold refuge as supreme resort the going for refuge becomes an act of opening and selfsurrenderWe drop our defenses before the objects of refuge and open ourselves to their capacity to helpWe surrender our ego our claim to selfsufficiency and reach out to the refugeobjects in the trust that they can guide us to release from our confusion turmoil and painLike any other act of consciousness the going for refuge is a complex process made up of many factorsThese factors can be classified by way of three basic faculties intelligence volition and emotionTo bring the act of going for refuge into clearer focus we will take the mental process behind the outer act divide it by way of these faculties and see how each contributes to its total characterThat is we will examine the going for refuge as an act of intelligence will and emotionBefore doing this however one word of caution is necessaryAny particular phenomenon represents far more than is immediately visible even to a deeply probing inspectionA seed for example has a much greater significance than the grain of organic matter that meets the eyeOn one side it collects into itself the entire history of the trees that went into its making on the other it points beyond to the many potential trees locked up in its hullSimilarly the act of consciousness involved in taking refuge represents the crystallization of a vast network of forces extending backwards forwards and outwards in all directionsIt simultaneously stands for the many lines of experience converging upon its formation out of the dim recesses of the past and the potential for future lines of development barely adumbrated in its own immediate contentThis applies equally to the act of taking refuge as a whole and to each of its constituting factors both the whole and its parts must be seen as momentary concretions with a vast history past and future hidden from our sightTherefore what emerges out of an analytical scrutiny of the refugeact should be understood to be only a fraction of what the act implies by way of background and future evolutionTurning to the act of taking refuge itself we find in the first place that it is an act of understandingThough inspired by reverence and trust it must be guided by vision by an intelligent perceptivity which protects it from the dangers of blind emotionThe faculty of intelligence steers the act of refuge towards the actualization of its inner urge for liberationIt distinguishes the goal from the distractions and prevents the aspirant from deviating from his quest for the goal to go in pursuit of futile endsFor this reason we find that in the formulation of the noble eightfold path right view is given firstTo follow the path we must see where it leads from where it goes and the steps that must be taken to get from the one point to the otherIn its initial form the faculty of intelligence involved in taking refuge comprehends the basic unsatisfactoriness of existence which makes reliance on a refuge necessarySuffering has to be seen as a pervasive feature infecting our existence at its root which cannot be eliminated by superficial palliatives but only by a throughgoing treatmentWe must come to see further that the causes of our dissatisfaction and unrest lie within ourselves in our clinging craving and delusions and that to get free from suffering we must follow a course which extinguishes its causesThe mind also has to grasp the reliability of the refugeobjectsAbsolute certainty as to the emancipating power of the teaching can only come later with the attainment of the path but already at the outset an intelligent conviction must be established that the refugeobjects are capable of providing helpTo this end the Buddha has to be examined by investigating the records of his life and character his teaching searched for contradictions and irrationalities and the Sangha approached to see if it is worthy of trust and confidenceOnly if they pass these tests can they be considered dependable supports for the achievement of our ultimate aimIntelligence comes into play not only with the initial decision to take refuge but throughout the entire course of practiceThe growth of understanding brings a deeper commitment to the refuges and the deepening of the inner refuge facilitates the growth of understandingThe climax of this process of reciprocal development is the attainment of the supramundane pathWhen the path arises penetrating the truth of the teaching the refuge becomes irreversible for it has been verified by direct experienceThe going for refuge is also an act of volitionIt results from a voluntary decision free from coercion or outside pressuresIt is a choice that must be aparappaccaya not compelled by others This freely chosen act brings about a farreaching restructuring of volitionWhereas previously the will might have been scattered among a multitude of interests and concerns when the taking of refuge gains ascendency the will becomes ordered in a unified way determined by the new commitmentThe spiritual ideal comes to the center of the inner life expelling the less crucial concerns and relegating the others to a position subordinate to its own directionIn this way the act of refuge brings to the mind a harmonization of values which now ascend to and converge upon the fundamental aspiration for deliverance as the guiding purpose of all activityThe act of taking refuge also effects a deepseated reversal in the movement of the willBefore refuge is taken the will tends to move in an outward direction pushing for the extension of its bounds of selfidentityIt seeks to gain increasing territory for the self to widen the range of ownership control and dominationWhen refuge is sought in the teaching of the Buddha the ground is laid for this pattern to be undermined and turned aroundThe Buddha teaches that our drive for selfexpansion is the root of our bondageIt is a mode of craving of grasping and clinging leading headlong into frustration and despairWhen this is understood the danger in egocentric seeking comes to the surface and the will turns in the opposite direction moving towards renunciation and detachmentThe objects of clinging are gradually relinquished the sense of I and mine withdrawn from the objects to which it has attached itselfUltimate deliverance is now seen to lie not in the extension of the ego to the limits of infinity but in the utter abolition of the egodelusion at its baseThe third aspect of going for refuge is the emotionalWhile going for refuge requires more than emotional fervor it also cannot come to full fruition without the inspiring upward pull of the emotionsThe emotions entering into the refuge act are principally three confidence reverence and loveConfidence is a feeling of serene trust in the protective power of the refugeobjects based on a clear understanding of their qualities and functionsConfidence gives rise to reverence a sense of awe esteem and veneration born from a growing awareness of the sublime and lofty nature of the Triple GemYet this reverence does not remain cool formal and aloofAs we experience the transforming effect of the Dhamma on our life reverence awakensLove adds the element of warmth and vitality to the spiritual lifeIt kindles the flame of devotion coming to expression in acts of dedicated service by which we seek to extend the protective and liberative capacity of the threefold refuge to othersThe going for refuge is the door of entrance to the teaching of the BuddhaIt functions in the context of the teaching as the entranceway to all the practices of the Buddhist disciplineTo engage in the practices in their proper setting we have to enter them through the door of taking refuge just as to go into a restaurant and have a meal we have to enter through the doorIf we merely stand outside the restaurant and read the menu on the window we may come away with a thorough knowledge of the menu but not with a satisfied appetiteSimilarly by merely studying and admiring the Buddhas teaching we do not enter upon its practiceEven if we abstract certain elements of practice for our personal use without first taking refuge our efforts cannot count as the actual practice of the Buddhas teachingThey are only practices derived from the teaching or practices in harmony with the teaching but so long as they are not conjoined with a mental attitude of taking refuge in the Triple Gem they have not yet become the practice of the Buddhas teachingTo bring out the significance of going for refuge we can consider a contrast between two individualsOne meticulously observes the moral principles embedded in the five preceptsHe does not formally undertake the precepts in the context of Buddhist ethical practice but spontaneously conforms to the standards of conduct they enjoin through his own innate sense of right and wrong that is he follows them as part of natural moralityWe might further suppose that he practices meditation several hours a day but does this not in the framework of the Dhamma but simply as a means to enjoy peace of mind here and nowWe can further suppose that this person has met the Buddhas teaching appreciates it and respects it but does not feel sufficiently convinced to acknowledge its truth or find himself impelled to go for refugeOn the other hand let us suppose there is another person whose circumstances prevent perfect observance of the precepts and who cannot find leisure for practicing meditationBut though he lacks these achievements from the depths of his heart with full sincerity understanding and dedication of purpose he has gone for refuge to the Triple GemComparing these two persons we can ask whose mental attitude is of greater longterm spiritual value  that of the person who without going for refuge observes the moral principles embedded in the five precepts and practices meditation several hours a day or that of the other person who cannot accomplish these practices but has sincerely gone for refuge to the Buddha Dhamma and SanghaNo clear pronouncement on this case is found in the suttas and commentaries but enough indication is given to support an intelligent guessOn this basis we would say that the mental attitude of the second person who has gone for refuge with clear understanding and sincerity of heart is of greater longterm spiritual valueThe reason for such a judgment is as followsAs a result of his moral and meditative practices the first individual will enjoy peace and happiness in his present life and will accumulate merit which will lead to a favorable rebirth in the futureHowever when that merit ripens it will become exhausted and expend its force without leading to further spiritual developmentWhen the fortunate rebirth resulting from the merit comes to an end it will be followed by rebirth in some other plane as determined by storedup kamma and the person will continue to revolve in the cycle of existenceHis virtuous undertakings do not contribute directly to the transcending of the samsaric roundOn the other hand the person who has sincerely gone for refuge to the Triple Gem without being capable of higher practices still lays the foundation for spiritual progress in future lives merely by his heartfelt act of seeking refugeOf course he has to reap the results of his kamma and cannot escape them by taking refuge but all the same the mental act of going for refuge if it is truly the focus of his inner life becomes a powerful positive kamma in itselfIt will function as a link tending to bring him into connection with the Buddhas dispensation in future lives thereby aiding his chances for further progressAnd if he fails to reach deliverance within the dispensation of the present Buddha it will very likely lead him to the dispensations of future Buddhas until he eventually reaches the goalSince this all comes about through the germination of that mental act of going for refuge we can understand that the taking of refuge is very essentialThe importance of going for refuge can be further gauged through a textual simile comparing faith to a seedSince faith is the motivating force behind the act of refuge the analogy may be transferred to the refugeact itselfWe explained earlier that the mental act of going for refuge calls into play three cardinal faculties  understanding will and emotionThese three faculties are already present even in that very simple basic act of seeking refuge contained there as seeds with the potential to develop into the flowers and fruits of the Buddhist spiritual lifeThe understanding that leads a man to go for refuge  the understanding of the danger and fearfulness of samsaric existence  this is the seed for the faculty of wisdom which eventually issues in direct penetration of the four noble truthsThe element of volition is the seed for the will to renunciation  the driving force that impels a man to renounce his craving enjoyments and egoistic clingings in order to go forth in search of liberationIt functions as well as the seed for the practice of right effort the sixth factor of the noble eightfold path by which we strive to abandon unwholesome impure mental states and to cultivate the wholesome and pure statesDevotion and reverence for the Triple Gem  these become the seed for the germination of unwavering confidence the assurance of a noble disciple whose confidence in the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha can never be shaken by any outside forceIn this way the simple act of going for refuge serves as the threefold seed for the development of the higher faculties of right understanding right effort and unshakable confidenceFrom this example we can again understand the taking of refuge to be very essentialThe methods of going for refuge divide into two general kinds the superior or supramundane going for refuge and the common or mundane going for refugeThe supramundane going for refuge is the going for refuge of a superior person that is of an ariyan disciple who has reached the supramundane path leading irreversibly to nibbanaWhen such a person goes for refuge to the Triple Gem his going for refuge is a superior refuge unshakable and invincibleThe ariyan person can never again through the remainder of his future births go for refuge to any other teacher than the Buddha to any other doctrine than the Dhamma or to any other spiritual community than the SanghaThe Buddha says that the confidence such a disciple places in the Triple Gem cannot be shaken by anyone in the world that it is firmly grounded and immovableThe common way of going for refuges is the way in which ordinary persons the vast majority below the ariyan plane go for refuge to the Triple GemThis can be subdivided into two types the initial going for refuge and the recurrent going for refugeThe initial going for refuge is the act of formally going for refuge for the first timeWhen a person has studied the basic principles of the Buddhas teaching undertaken some of its practices and become convinced of its value for his life he may want to commit himself to the teaching by making an outer profession of his convictionStrictly speaking as soon as there arises in his mind an act of consciousness which takes the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha as his guiding ideal that person has gone for refuge to the Triple Gem and become a Buddhist lay discipleHowever within the Buddhist tradition it is generally considered to be insufficient under normal circumstances to rest content with merely going for refuge by an internal act of dedicationIf one has sincerely become convinced of the truth of the Buddhas teaching and wishes to follow the teaching it is preferable when possible to conform to the prescribed way of going for refuge that has come down in the Buddhist traditionThis way is to receive the three refuges from a bhikkhu a Buddhist monk who has taken full ordination and remains in good standing in the monastic OrderAfter one has decided to go for refuge one should seek out a qualified monk  ones own spiritual teacher or another respected member of the Order  discuss ones intentions with him and make arrangements for undergoing the ceremonyWhen the day arrives one should come to the monastery or temple bringing offerings such as candles incense and flowers for the shrine room and a small gift for the preceptorAfter making the offerings one should in the presence of the preceptor join the palms together in respectful salutation bow down three times before the image of the Buddha and pay respects to the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha as represented by the images and symbols in the shrineThen kneeling in front of the shrine one should request the bhikkhu to give the three refugesThe bhikkhu will reply Repeat after me and then reciteThe candidate should repeat each line after the bhikkhuAt the end the bhikkhu will say Saranagamanam sampunnam The going for refuge is completed With this one formally becomes a lay follower of the Buddha and remains such so long as the going for refuge stands intactBut to make the going for refuge especially strong and definitive the candidate may confirm his acceptance of the refuge by declaring to the monk Venerable sir please accept me as a lay disciple gone for refuge from this day forth until the end of my life This phrase is added to show ones resolution to hold to the three refuges as ones guiding ideal for the rest of ones lifeFollowing the declaration of the refuges the bhikkhu will usually administer the five precepts the ethical observances of abstaining from taking life stealing sexual misconduct false speech and intoxicantsThese will be discussed in subsequent articlesBy undergoing the formal ceremony of taking refuge one openly embraces the teaching of the Buddha and becomes for the first time a selfdeclared follower of the MasterHowever going for refuge should not be an event which occurs only once in a lifetime and then is allowed to fade into the backgroundGoing for refuge is a method of cultivation a practice of inner development which should be undertaken regularly repeated and renewed every day as part of ones daily routineJust as we care for our body by washing it each morning so we should also take care of our mind by implanting in it each day the fundamental seed for our development along the Buddhist path that is the going for refugePreferably the going for refuge should be done twice each day with each refuge repeated three times but if a second recitation is too difficult to fit in as a minimum one recitation should be done every day with three repetitions of each refugeThe daily undertaking of the refuges is best done in a shrine room or before a household altar with a BuddhaimageThe actual recitation should be preceded by the offering of candles incense and possibly flowersAfter making the offerings one should make three salutations before the Buddhaimage and then remain kneeling with the hands held out palms joinedBefore actually reciting the refuge formula it may be helpful to visualize to oneself the three objects of refuge arousing the feeling that one is in their presenceTo represent the Buddha one can visualize an inspiring picture or statue of the MasterThe Dhamma can be represented by visualizing in front of the Buddha three volumes of scripture to symbolize the Tipitaka the three collections of Buddhist scripturesThe Dhamma can also be represented by the dhammacakka the wheel of Dhamma with its eight spokes symbolizing the noble eightfold path converging upon nibbana at the hub it should be bright and beautiful radiating a golden lightTo represent the Sangha one can visualize on either side of the Buddha the two chief disciples Sariputta and Moggallana alternatively one can visualize around the Buddha a group of monks all of them adepts of the teaching arahats who have conquered the defilements and reached perfect emancipationGenerating deep faith and confidence while retaining the visualized images before ones inner eye one should recite the refugeformula three times with feeling and convictionIf one is undertaking the practice of meditation it is especially important to recite the refugeformula before beginning the practice for this gives needed inspiration to sustain the endeavor through the difficulties that may be encountered along the wayFor this reason those who undertake intensive meditation and go off into solitude preface their practice not with the usual method of recitation but with a special variation Aham attanam Buddhassa niyyatemi Dhammassa Sanghassa My person I surrender to the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha By surrendering his person and life to the Triple Gem the yogin shields himself against the obstacles which might arise to impede his progress and safeguards himself against egoistic clinging to the attainments he might reachHowever this variation on the refugeformula should not be undertaken lightly as its consequences are very seriousFor ordinary purposes it is enough to use the standard formula for daily recitationCorruptions of the refuge are factors that make the going for refuge impure insincere and ineffectiveAccording to the commentaries there are three factors that defile the going for refuge  ignorance doubt and wrong viewsIf one does not understand the reasons for going for refuge the meaning of taking refuge or the qualities of the refugeobjects this lack of understanding is a form of ignorance which corrupts the going for refugeDoubt corrupts the refuge insofar as the person overcome by doubt cannot settle confidence firmly in the Triple GemHis commitment to the refuge is tainted by inner perplexity suspicion and indecisionThe defilement of wrong views means a wrong understanding of the act of refuge or the refugeobjectsA person holding wrong views goes for refuge with the thought that the refuge act is a sufficient guarantee of deliverance or he believes that the Buddha is a god with the power to save him or that the Dhamma teaches the existence of an eternal self or that the Sangha functions as an intercessory body with the ability to mediate his salvationEven though the refuge act is defiled by these corruptions as long as a person regards the Triple Gem as his supreme reliance his going for refuge is intact and he remains a Buddhist followerBut though the refuge is intact his attitude of taking refuge is defective and has to be purifiedSuch purification can come about if he meets a proper teacher to give him instruction and help him overcome his ignorance doubts and wrong viewsThe breach of the refuge means the breaking or violation of the commitment to the threefold refugeA breach of the refuge occurs when a person who has gone for refuge comes to regard some counterpart to the three refuges as his guiding ideal or supreme relianceIf he comes to regard another spiritual teacher as superior to the Buddha or as possessing greater spiritual authority than the Buddha then his going for refuge to the Buddha is brokenIf he comes to regard another religious teaching as superior to the Dhamma or resorts to some other system of practice as his means to deliverance then his going for refuge to the Dhamma is brokenIf he comes to regard some spiritual community other than the ariyan Sangha as endowed with supramundane status or as occupying a higher spiritual level than the ariyan Sangha then his going for refuge to the Sangha is brokenIn order for the refugeact to remain valid and intact the Triple Gem must be recognized as the exclusive resort for ultimate deliverance For me there is no other refuge the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha are my supreme refugeBreaking the commitment to any of the three refugeobjects breaks the commitment to all of them since the effectiveness of the refugeact requires the recognition of the interdependence and inseparability of the threeThus by adopting an attitude which bestows the status of a supreme reliance upon anything outside the Triple Gem one cuts off the going for refuge and relinquishes ones claim to be a disciple of the Buddha Dhamma and SanghaIn order to become valid once again the going for refuge must be renewed preferably by confessing ones lapse and then by once more going through the entire formal ceremony of taking refugeIn the traditional Indian method of exposition no account or treatment of a theme is considered complete unless it has been illustrated by similesTherefore we conclude this explanation of going for refuge with a look at some of the classical similes for the objects of refugeThough many beautiful similes are given in the texts from fear of prolixity we here limit ourselves to fourThe first simile compares the Buddha to the sun for his appearance in the world is like the sun rising over the horizonHis teaching of the true Dhamma is like the net of the suns rays spreading out over the earth dispelling the darkness and cold of the night giving warmth and light to all beingsThe Sangha is like the beings for whom the darkness of night has been dispelled who go about their affairs enjoying the warmth and radiance of the sunThe second simile compares the Buddha to the full moon the jewel of the nighttime skyHis teaching of the Dhamma is like the moon shedding its beams of light over the world cooling off the heat of the dayThe Sangha is like the persons who go out in the night to see and enjoy the refreshing splendor of the moonlightIn the third simile the Buddha is likened to a great raincloud spreading out across the countryside at a time when the land has been parched with a long summers heatThe teaching of the true Dhamma is like the downpour of the rain which inundates the land giving water to the plants and vegetationThe Sangha is like the plants  the trees shrubs bushes and grass  which thrive and flourish when nourished by the rain pouring down from the cloudThe fourth simile compares the Buddha to a lotus flower the paragon of beauty and purityJust as a lotus grows up in a muddy lake but rises above the water and stands in full splendor unsoiled by the mud so the Buddha having grown up in the world overcomes the world and abides in its midst untainted by its impuritiesThe Buddhas teaching of the true Dhamma is like the sweet perfumed fragrance emitted by the lotus flower giving delight to allAnd the Sangha is like the host of bees who collect around the lotus gather up the pollen and fly off to their hives to transform it into honeyGoing for refuge to the Triple Gem  the Buddha the Dhamma and the Sangha  is the door of entrance to the Buddhas teachingTo enter the teaching we have to pass through this door but once we have made the initial commitment by taking refuge it is necessary to go further and to put the teaching into actual practiceFor the Buddhas teaching is not a system of salvation by faithIt is essentially a path leading to nibbana the end of sufferingAt the outset we need a certain degree of faith as the incentive for entering the path but progress towards the goal depends primarily upon our own energy and intelligence in following the path through each of its successive stagesThe teaching takes the attainment of deliverance away from every external resort and places it into our own handsWe have to realize the goal for ourselves within ourselves by working upon ourselves with the guidance of the Buddhas instructionsThe path of liberation that the Buddha points to is the threefold training in moral discipline concentration and wisdomThese three divisions of the path rise up each in dependence upon its predecessor  concentration upon moral discipline and wisdom upon concentrationThe foundation for the entire path it can be seen is the training in moral disciplineBecause this first section of the path plays such a pivotal role it is vitally important for the serious practitioner to obtain a clear understanding of its essential meaning and the way it is to be practicedTo aid the development of such an understanding we here present an explanation of the training in sila or moral discipline giving special attention to its most basic form as the observance of the five preceptsThe subject will be dealt with under the following headings the essential meaning of sila the five precepts individually explained the eight precepts the benefits of sila the undertaking of sila the breach of sila and the similes for silaThe Pali word for moral discipline sila has three levels of meaning inner virtue ie endowment with such qualities as kindness contentment simplicity truthfulness patience etc virtuous actions of body and speech which express those inner virtues outwardly and rules of conduct governing actions of body and speech designed to bring them into accord with the ethical idealsThese three levels are closely intertwined and not always distinguishable in individual casesBut if we isolate them sila as inner virtue can be called the aim of the training in moral discipline sila as purified actions of body and speech the manifestation of that aim and sila as rules of conduct the systematic means of actualizing the aimThus sila as inner virtue is established by bringing our bodily and verbal actions into accord with the ethical ideals and this is done by following the rules of conduct intended to give these ideals concrete formThe Buddhist texts explain that sila has the characteristic of harmonizing our actions of body and speechSila harmonizes our actions by bringing them into accord with our own true interests with the wellbeing of others and with universal lawsActions contrary to sila lead to a state of selfdivision marked by guilt anxiety and remorseBut the observance of the principles of sila heals this division bringing our inner faculties together into a balanced and centered state of unitySila also brings us into harmony with other menWhile actions undertaken in disregard of ethical principles lead to relations scarred by competitiveness exploitation and aggression actions intended to embody such principles promote concord between man and man  peace cooperation and mutual respectThe harmony achieved by maintaining sila does not stop at the social level but leads our actions into harmony with a higher law  the law of kamma of action and its fruit which reigns invisibly behind the entire world of sentient existenceThe need to internalize ethical virtue as the foundation for the path translates itself into a set of precepts established as guidelines to good conductThe most basic set of precepts found in the Buddhas teaching is the pañcasila the five precepts consisting of the following five training rulesthe training rule of abstaining from taking what is not giventhe training rule of abstaining from sexual misconductthe training rule of abstaining from false speech andthe training rule of abstaining from fermented and distilled intoxicants which are the basis for heedlessnessThese five precepts are the minimal ethical code binding on the Buddhist laityThey are administered regularly by the monks to the lay disciples at almost every service and ceremony following immediately upon the giving of the three refugesThey are also undertaken afresh each day by earnest lay Buddhists as part of their daily recitationThe precepts function as the core of the training in moral disciplineThey are intended to produce through methodical practice that inner purity of will and motivation which comes to expression as virtuous bodily and verbal conductHence the equivalent term for precept sikkhapada which means literally factor of training that is a factor of the training in moral disciplineHowever the formulation of ethical virtue in terms of rules of conduct meets with an objection reflecting an attitude that is becoming increasingly widespreadThis objection raised by the ethical generalist calls into question the need to cast ethics into the form of specific rulesIt is enough it is said simply to have good intentions and to let ourselves be guided by our intuition as to what is right and wrongSubmitting to rules of conduct is at best superfluous but worse tends to lead to a straightjacket conception of morality to a constricting and legalistic system of ethicsThe Buddhist reply is that while moral virtue admittedly cannot be equated flatly with any set of rules or with outward conduct conforming to rules the rules are still of value for aiding the development of inner virtueOnly the very exceptional few can alter the stuff of their lives by a mere act of willThe overwhelming majority of men have to proceed more slowly with the help of a set of stepping stones to help them gradually cross the rough currents of greed hatred and delusionIf the process of selftransformation which is the heart of the Buddhist path begins with moral discipline then the concrete manifestation of this discipline is in the lines of conduct represented by the five precepts which call for our adherence as expedient means to selftransformationThe precepts are not commandments imposed from without but principles of training each one takes upon himself through his own initiative and endeavors to follow with awareness and understandingThe formulas for the precepts do not read Thou shalt abstain from this and that They read I undertake the training rule to abstain from the taking of life etcThe emphasis here as throughout the entire path is on selfresponsibilityThe precepts engender virtuous dispositions by a process involving the substitution of oppositesThe actions prohibited by the precepts  killing stealing adultery etc are all motivated by unwholesome mental factors called in Buddhist terminology the defilementsBy engaging in these actions knowingly and willingly we reinforce the grip of the defilements upon the mind to the point where they become our dominant traitsBut when we take up the training by observing the precepts we then put a brake upon the current of unwholesome mental factorsThere then takes place a process of factor substitution whereby the defilements are replaced by wholesome states which become increasingly more deeply ingrained as we go on with the trainingIn this process of selftransformation the precepts draw their efficacy from another psychological principle the law of development through repetitionEven though at first a practice arouses some resistance from within if it is repeated over and over with understanding and determination the qualities it calls into play pass imperceptibly into the makeup of the mindWe generally begin in the grip of negative attitudes hemmed in by unskillful emotionsBut if we see that these states lead to suffering and that to be free from suffering we must abandon them then we will have sufficient motivation to take up the training designed to counter themThis training starts with the outer observance of sila then proceeds to internalize selfrestraint through meditation and wisdomAt the start to maintain the precepts may require special effort but by degrees the virtuous qualities they embody will gather strength until our actions flow from them as naturally and smoothly as water from a springThe five precepts are formulated in accordance with the ethical algorithm of using oneself as the criterion for determining how to act in relation to othersIn Pali the principle is expressed by the phrase attanam upamam katva consider oneself as similar to others and others as similar to oneself The method of application involves a simple imaginative exchange of oneself and othersIn order to decide whether or not to follow a particular line of action we take ourselves as the standard and consider what would be pleasant and painful for ourselvesThen we reflect that others are basically similar to ourselves and so what is pleasant and painful to us is also pleasant and painful to them thus just as we would not want others to cause pain for us so we should not cause pain for othersAs the Buddha explainsSamyuttanikaya NoThis deductive method the Buddha uses to derive the first four preceptsThe fifth precept abstaining from intoxicants appears to deal only with my relation to myself with what I put into my own bodyHowever because the violation of this precept can lead to the violation of all the other precepts and to much further harm for others its social implications are deeper than is evident at first sight and bring it into range of this same method of derivationBuddhist ethics as formulated in the five precepts is sometimes charged with being entirely negativeIt is criticized on the ground that it is a morality solely of avoidance lacking any ideals of positive actionAgainst this criticism several lines of reply can be givenFirst of all it has to be pointed out that the five precepts or even the longer codes of precepts promulgated by the Buddha do not exhaust the full range of Buddhist ethicsThe precepts are only the most rudimentary code of moral training but the Buddha also proposes other ethical codes inculcating definite positive virtuesThe Mangala Sutta for example commends reverence humility contentment gratitude patience generosity etcOther discourses prescribe numerous family social and political duties establishing the well being of societyAnd behind all these duties lie the four attitudes called the immeasurables  lovingkindness compassion sympathetic joy and equanimityBut turning to the five precepts themselves some words have to be said in defense of their negative formulationEach moral principle included in the precepts contains two aspects  a negative aspect which is a rule of abstinence and a positive aspect which is a virtue to be cultivatedThese aspects are called respectively varitta and carittaThus the first precept is formulated as abstaining from the destruction of life which in itself is a varitta a principle of abstinenceBut corresponding to this we also find in the descriptions of the practice of this precept a caritta a positive quality to be developed namely compassionThus in the suttas we read The disciple abstaining from the taking of life dwells without stick or sword conscientious full of sympathy desirous of the welfare of all living beings So corresponding to the negative side of abstaining from the destruction of life there is the positive side of developing compassion and sympathy for all beingsSimilarly abstinence from stealing is paired with honesty and contentment abstinence from sexual misconduct is paired with marital fidelity in the case of lay people and celibacy in the case of monks abstinence from falsehood is paired with speaking the truth and abstinence from intoxicants is paired with heedfulnessNevertheless despite this recognition of a duality of aspect the question still comes up if there are two sides to each moral principle why is the precept worded only as an abstinenceWhy dont we also undertake training rules to develop positive virtues such as compassion honesty and so forthThe answer to this is twofoldFirst in order to develop the positive virtues we have to begin by abstaining from the negative qualities opposed to themThe growth of the positive virtues will only be stunted or deformed as long as the defilements are allowed to reign uncheckedWe cannot cultivate compassion while at the same time indulging in killing or cultivate honesty while stealing and cheatingAt the start we have to abandon the unwholesome through the aspect of avoidanceOnly when we have secured a foundation in avoiding the unwholesome can we expect to succeed in cultivating the factors of positive performanceThe process of purifying virtue can be compared to growing a flower garden on a plot of uncultivated landWe dont begin by planting the seeds in expectation of a bountiful yieldWe have to start with the duller work of weeding out the garden and preparing the bedsOnly after we have uprooted the weeds and nourished the soil can we plant the seeds in the confidence that the flowers will grow healthilyAnother reason why the precepts are worded in terms of abstinence is that the development of positive virtues cannot be prescribed by rulesRules of training can govern what we have to avoid and perform in our outer actions but only ideals of aspiration not rules can govern what develops within ourselvesThus we cannot take up a training rule to always be loving towards othersTo impose such a rule is to place ourselves in a double bind since inner attitudes are just simply not so docile that they can be determined by commandLove and compassion are the fruits of the work we do on ourselves inwardly not of assenting to a preceptWhat we can do is to undertake a precept to abstain from destroying life and from injuring other beingsThen we can make a resolution preferably without much fanfare to develop lovingkindness and apply ourselves to the mental training designed to nourish its growthOne more word should be added concerning the formulation of the preceptsDespite their negative wording even in that form the precepts are productive of tremendous positive benefits for others as well as for oneselfThe Buddha says that one who abstains from the destruction of life gives immeasurable safety and security to countless living beingsHow the simple observance of a single precept leads to such a result is not immediately obvious but calls for some thoughtNow by myself I can never give immeasurable safety and security to other beings by any program of positive actionEven if I were to go on protest against all the slaughterhouses in the world or to march against war continuously without stopping by such action I could never stop the slaughter of animals or ensure that war would come to an endBut when I adopt for myself the precept to abstain from the destruction of life then by reason of the precept I do not intentionally destroy the life of any living beingThus any other being can feel safe and secure in my presence all beings are ensured that they will never meet harm from meOf course even then I can never ensure that other living beings will be absolutely immune from harm and suffering but this is beyond anyones powerAll that lies within my power and the sphere of my responsibility are the attitudes and actions that emanate from myself towards othersAnd as long as these are circumscribed by the training rule to abstain from taking life no living being need feel threatened in my presence or fear that harm and suffering will come from meThe same principle applies to the other preceptsWhen I undertake the precept to abstain from taking what is not given no one has reason to fear that I will steal what belongs to him the belongings of all other beings are safe from meWhen I undertake the precept to abstain from sexual misconduct no one has reason to fear that I will try to transgress against his wifeWhen I undertake the precept to abstain from falsehood then anyone who speaks with me can be confident that they will hear the truth my word can be regarded as trustworthy and reliable even in matters of critical importanceAnd because I undertake the precept of abstaining from intoxicants then one can be assured that the crimes and transgression that result from intoxication will never be committed by myselfIn this way by observing the five precepts I give immeasurable safety and security to countless beings simply through these five silent but powerful determinations established in the mindThe first of the five precepts reads in Pali Panatipata veramani sikkhapadam samadiyami in English I undertake the training rule to abstain from taking life Here the word pana meaning that which breathes denotes any living being that has breath and consciousnessIt includes animals and insects as well as men but does not include plants as they have only life but not breath or consciousnessThe word living being is a conventional term an expression of common usage signifying in the strict philosophical sense the life facultyThe word atipata means literally striking down hence killing or destroyingThus the precept enjoins abstinence from the taking of lifeThough the precepts wording prohibits the killing of living beings in terms of its underlying purpose it can also be understood to prohibit injuring maiming and torturing as wellThe Pali Buddhist commentaries formally define the act of taking life thus The taking of life is the volition of killing expressed through the doors of either body or speech occasioning action which results in the cutting off of the life faculty in a living being when there is a living being present and perceives it as a living beingThe first important point to note in this definition is that the act of taking life is defined as a volitionVolition is the mental factor responsible for action it has the function of arousing the entire mental apparatus for the purpose of accomplishing a particular aim in this case the cutting off of the life faculty of a living beingThe identification of the transgression with volition implies that the ultimate responsibility for the act of killing lies with the mind since the volition that brings about the act is a mental factorThe body and speech function merely as doors for that volition ie as channels through which the volition of taking life reaches expressionKilling is classified as a bodily deed since it generally occurs via the body but what really performs the act of killing is the mind using the body as the instrument for actualizing its aimA second important point to note is that killing need not occur directly through the bodyThe volition to take life can also express itself through the door of speechThis means that the command to take life given to others by way of words writing or gesture is also considered a case of killingOne who issues such a command becomes responsible for the action as soon as it achieves its intention of depriving a being of lifeA complete act of killing constituting a full violation of the precept involves five factors a living being the perception of the living being as such the thought or volition of killing the appropriate effort and the actual death of the being as a result of the actionThe second factor ensures that responsibility for killing is incurred only when the perpetrator of the act is aware that the object of his action is a living beingThus if we step on an insect we do not see the precept is not broken because the perception or awareness of a living being is lackingThe third factor ensures that the taking of life is intentionalWithout the factor of volition there is no transgression as when we kill a fly while intending simply to drive it away with our handThe fourth factor holds that the action must be directed to the taking of life the fifth that the being dies as a result of this actionIf the life faculty is not cut off a full violation of the precept is not incurred though in harming or injuring living beings in any way its essential purpose will be violatedThe taking of life is distinguished into different types by way of its underlying motivationOne criterion for determining the motivation is the defilement principally responsible for the actionActs of killing can originate from all three unwholesome roots  from greed hatred and delusionAs the immediate cause concomitant with the act of killing hatred together with delusion functions as the root since the force which drives the act is the impulse to destroy the creatures life a form of hatredAny of the three unwholesome roots however can serve as the impelling cause or decisive support for the act operating over some span of timeThough greed and hatred are always mutually exclusive at a single moment the two can work together at different moments over an extended period to occasion the taking of lifeKilling motivated primarily by greed is seen in such cases as killing in order to gain material benefits or high status for oneself to eliminate threats to ones comfort and security or to obtain enjoyment as in hunting and fishing for sportKilling motivated by hatred is evident in cases of vicious murder where the motive is strong aversion cruelty or jealousyAnd killing motivated by delusion can be seen in the case of those who perform animal sacrifices in the belief that they are spiritually wholesome or who kill followers of other religions with the view that this is a religious dutyActs of taking life are differentiated by way of their degree of moral gravityNot all cases of killing are equally blameworthyAll are unwholesome a breach of the precept but the Buddhist texts make a distinction in the moral weight attached to different kinds of killingThe first distinction given is that between killing beings with moral qualities and killing beings without moral qualitiesFor all practical purposes the former are human beings the latter animals and it is held that to kill a fellow human being is a more serious matter ethically than to kill an animalThen within each category further distinctions are drawnIn the case of animals the degree of moral gravity is said to be proportional to the animal to kill a larger animal being more blameworthy than to kill a smaller oneOther factors relevant to determining moral weight are whether the animal has an owner or is ownerless whether it is domestic or wild and whether it has a gentle or a vicious temperamentThe moral gravity would be greater in the former three alternatives less in the latter threeIn the killing of human beings the degree of moral blame depends on the personal qualities of the victim to kill a person of superior spiritual stature or ones personal benefactors being more blameworthy than to kill a less developed person or one unrelated to oneselfThe three cases of killing selected as the most culpable are matricide parricide and the murder of an arahant a fully purified saintAnother factor determinative of moral weight is the motivation of the actThis leads to a distinction between premeditated murder and impulsive killingThe former is murder in cold blood intended and planned in advance driven either by strong greed or strong hatredThe latter is killing which is not planned in advance as when one person kills another in a fit of rage or in selfdefenseGenerally premeditated murder is regarded as a graver transgression than impulsive killing and the motivation of hatred as more blameworthy than the motivation of greedThe presence of cruelty and the obtaining of sadistic pleasure from the act further increase its moral weightOther factors determinative of moral gravity are the force of the defilements accompanying the act and the amount of effort involved in its perpetration but limitations of space prohibit a full discussion of their roleThe second precept reads Adinnadana veramani sikkhapadam samadiyami I undertake the training rule to abstain from taking what is not given The word adinna meaning literally what is not given signifies the belongings of another person over which he exercises ownership legally and blamelesslyThus no offense is committed if the article taken has no owner eg if logs are taken to make a fire or stones are gathered to build a wallFurther the other person has to have possession of the article taken legally and blamelessly that is he has to have the legal right over the article and also has to be blameless in his use of itThis latter phrase apparently becomes applicable in cases where a person gains legal possession of an article but does so in an improper way or uses it for unethical purposesIn such cases there might be legitimate grounds for depriving him of the item as when the law requires someone who commits a misdemeanor to pay a fine or deprives a person of some weapon rightfully his which he is using for destructive purposesThe act of taking what is not given is formally defined thus Taking what is not given is the volition with thievish intent arousing the activity of appropriating an article belonging to another legally and blamelessly in one who perceives it as belonging to another As in the case of the first precept the transgression here consists ultimately in a volitionThis volition can commit the act of theft by originating action through body or speech thus a transgression is incurred either by taking something directly by oneself or else indirectly by commanding someone else to appropriate the desired articleThe fundamental purpose of the precept is to protect the property of individuals from unjustified confiscation by othersIts ethical effect is to encourage honesty and right livelihoodAccording to the commentaries for a complete breach of the precept to be committed five factors must be present an article belonging to another legally and blamelessly the perception of it as belonging to another the thought or intention of stealing the activity of taking the article and the actual appropriation of the articleBy reason of the second factor there is no violation in taking anothers article if we mistakenly perceive it as our own as when we might confuse identicallooking coats umbrellas etcThe third factor again provides a safeguard against accidental appropriation while the fifth asserts that to fall into the class of a transgression the action must deprive the owner of his articleIt is not necessary that he be aware that his possession is missing only that it be removed from his sphere of control even if only momentarilyTaking what is not given can be divided into many different kinds of violationWe might mention some of the most prominentOne is stealing that is taking what is not given secretly without the knowledge of the owner as in housebreaking a midnight bank theft pickpocketing etcAnother type is robbery taking what is not given by force either by snatching someones belongings away from him or by compelling him to hand them over by means of threatsA third type is fraudulence laying false claims or telling lies in order to gain someone elses possessionsStill another is deceit using deceptive means to deprive someone of an article or to gain his money as when storekeepers use false weights and measures or when people produce counterfeit bills for useThe violation of this precept need not amount to a major crimeThe precept is subtle and offers many opportunities for its breach some of them seemingly slightFor example transgression will be incurred when employees take goods belonging to their employers pocketing small items to which they have no right with the thought that the company will not miss them when using anothers telephone to make longdistance calls without his consent letting him cover the bill in bringing articles into a country without declaring them to customs in order to avoid paying duty on them in idling away time on the job for which one is being paid in the expectation that one has been working diligently in making ones employees work without giving them adequate compensation etcBy way of its underlying roots the act of taking what is not given can proceed either from greed or hatred both being coupled with delusionStealing by reason of greed is the obvious case but the offense can also be driven by hatredHatred functions as the motive for stealing when one person deprives another of an article not so much because he wants it for himself as because he resents the others possession of it and wants to make him suffer through its lossThe degree of blame attached to acts of stealing is held to be determined by two principal factors the value of the article taken and the moral qualities of the ownerIn stealing a very valuable article the degree of blame is obviously greater than in stealing an article of little worthBut where the value of the article is the same the blameworthiness of the action still varies relative to the individual against whom the offense is committedAs determined by this factor stealing from a person of high virtuous qualities or a personal benefactor is a more serious transgression than stealing from a person of lesser qualities or from an unrelated personThis factor in fact can be even more important than the cash value of the objectThus if someone steals an almsbowl from a meditative monk who needs the bowl to collect his food the moral weight of the act is heavier than that involved in cheating a racketeer out of several thousand dollars owing to the character of the person affected by the deedThe motivation behind the action and the force of the defilements are also determinative of the degree of moral gravity hatred being considered more culpable than greedThe third precept reads Kamesu micchacara veramani sikkhapadam samadiyami I undertake the training rule to abstain from misconduct in regard to sense pleasures The word kama has the general meaning of sense pleasure or sensual desire but the commentaries explain it as sexual relations an interpretation supported by the suttasMicchacara means wrong modes of conductThus the precept enjoins abstinence from improper or illicit sexual relationsMisconduct is regard to sense pleasures is formally defined as the volition with sexual intent occurring through the bodily door causing transgression with an illicit partnerThe primary question this definition elicits is who is to qualify as an illicit partnerFor men the text lists twenty types of women who are illicit partnersThese can be grouped into three categories a woman who is under the protection of elders or other authorities charged with her care eg a girl being cared for by parents by an older brother or sister by other relatives or by the family as a whole a woman who is prohibited by convention that is close relatives forbidden under family tradition nuns and other women vowed to observe celibacy as a spiritual discipline and those forbidden as partners under the law of the land and a woman who is married or engaged to another man even one bound to another man only by a temporary agreementIn the case of women for those who are married any man other than a husband is an illicit partnerFor all women a man forbidden by tradition or under religious rules is prohibited as a partnerFor both men and women any violent forced or coercive union whether by physical compulsion or psychological pressure can be regarded as a transgression of the precept even when the partner is not otherwise illicitBut a man or woman who is widowed or divorced can freely remarry according to choiceThe texts mention four factors which must be present for a breach of the precept to be incurred an illicit partner as defined above the thought or volition of engaging in sexual union with that person the act of engaging in union and the acceptance of the unionThis last factor is added for the purpose of excluding from violation those who are unwillingly forced into improper sexual relationsThe degree of moral gravity involved in the offense is determined by the force of the lust motivating the action and the qualities of the person against whom the transgression is committedIf the transgression involves someone of high spiritual qualities the lust is strong and force is used the blame is heavier than when the partner has less developed qualities the lust is weak and no force is usedThe most serious violations are incest and the rape of an arahantThe underlying root is always greed accompanied by delusionThe fourth precept reads Musavada veramani sikkhapadam samadiyami I undertake the training rule to abstain from false speech False speech is defined as the wrong volition with intent to deceive occurring through the door of either body or speech arousing the bodily or verbal effort of deceiving another The transgression must be understood as intentionalThe precept is not violated merely by speaking what is false but by speaking what is false with the intention of representing that as true thus it is equivalent to lying or deceptive speechThe volition is said to arouse bodily or verbal actionThe use of speech to deceive is obvious but the body too can be used as an instrument of communication  as in writing hand signals and gestures  and thus can be used to deceive othersFour factors enter into the offense of false speech an untrue state of affairs the intention of deceiving another the effort to express that either verbally or bodily and the conveying of a false impression to anotherSince intention is required if one speaks falsely without aiming at deceiving another as when one speaks what is false believing it to be true there is no breach of the preceptActual deception however is not needed for the precept to be brokenIt is enough if the false impression is communicated to anotherEven though he does not believe the false statement if one expresses what is false to him and he understands what is being said the transgression of speaking falsehood has been committedThe motivation for false speech can be any of the three unwholesome rootsThese yield three principal kinds of falsehood false speech motivated by greed intended to increase ones gains or promote ones status or that of those dear to oneself false speech motivated by hatred intended to destroy the welfare of others or to bring them harm and suffering and false speech of a less serious kind motivated principally by delusion in association with less noxious degrees of greed or hatred intended neither to bring special benefits to oneself nor to harm othersSome examples would be lying for the sake of a joke exaggerating an account to make it more interesting speaking flattery to gratify others etcThe principal determinants of the gravity of the transgression are the recipient of the lie the object of the lie and the motivation of the lieThe recipient is the person to whom the lie is toldThe moral weight of the act is proportional to the character of this person the greatest blame attaching to falsehoods spoken to ones benefactors or to spiritually developed personsThe moral weight again varies according to the object of the lie the person the lie affects being proportional to his spiritual qualities and his relation to oneself in the same way as with the recipientAnd thirdly the gravity of the lie is contingent on its motivation the most serious cases being those with malicious intent designed to destroy the welfare of othersThe worst cases of false speech are lying in a way that defames the Buddha or an arahant and making false claims to have reached a superior spiritual attainment in order to increase ones own gains and statusIn the case of a bhikkhu this latter offense can lead to expulsion from the SanghaThe fifth precept reads Suramerayamajjapamadatthana veramani sikkhapadam samadiyami I undertake the training rule to abstain from fermented and distilled intoxicants which are the basis for heedlessness The word meraya means fermented liquors sura liquors which have been distilled to increase their strength and flavorThe world majja meaning an intoxicant can be related to the rest of the passage either as qualified by surameraya or as additional to themIn the former case the whole phrase means fermented and distilled liquors which are intoxicants in the latter it means fermented and distilled liquors and other intoxicantsIf this second reading is adopted the precept would explicitly include intoxicating drugs used nonmedicinally such as the opiates hemp and psychedelicsBut even on the first reading the precept implicitly proscribes these drugs by way of its guiding purpose which is to prevent heedlessness caused by the taking of intoxicating substancesThe taking of intoxicants is defined as the volition leading to the bodily act of ingesting distilled or fermented intoxicantsIt can be committed only by ones own person and only occurs through the bodily doorFor the precept to be violated four factors are required the intoxicant the intention of taking it the activity of ingesting it and the actual ingestion of the intoxicantThe motivating factor of the violation is greed coupled with delusionNo gradations of moral weight are givenIn taking medicines containing alcohol or intoxicating drugs for medical reasons no breach of the precept is committedThere is also no violation in taking food containing a negligible amount of alcohol added as a flavoringThis fifth precept differs from the preceding four in that the others directly involve a mans relation to his fellow beings while this precept ostensibly deals solely with a persons relation to himself  to his own body and mindThus whereas the first four precepts clearly belong to the moral sphere a question may arise whether this precept is really ethical in character or merely hygienicThe answer is that it is ethical for the reason that what a person does to his own body and mind can have a decisive effect on his relations to his fellow menTaking intoxicants can influence the ways in which a man interacts with others leading to the violation of all five preceptsUnder the influence of intoxicants a man who might otherwise be restrained can lose selfcontrol become heedless and engage in killing stealing adultery and lyingAbstinence from intoxicants is prescribed on the grounds that it is essential to the selfprotection of the individual and for establishing the wellbeing of family and societyThe precept thus prevents the misfortunes that result from the use of intoxicants loss of wealth quarrels and crimes bodily disease loss of reputation shameless conduct negligence and madnessThe precept it must be stressed does not prohibit merely intoxication but the very use of intoxicating substancesThough occasional indulgences may not be immediately harmful in isolation the seductive and addictive properties of intoxicants are well knownThe strongest safeguard against the lure is to avoid them altogetherBeyond the five precepts Buddhism offers a higher code of moral discipline for the laity consisting of eight preceptsThis code of eight precepts is not entirely different in content from the fivefold code but includes the five precepts with one significant revisionThe revision comes in the third precept where abstaining from sexual misconduct is changed to abstaining from incelibacyThe third precept of the eightfold set thus reads Abrahmacariya veramani sikkhapadam samadiyami I undertake the training rule to abstain from incelibacy To these basic five three further precepts are addedNacca gita vadita visukhadassanamala gandha vilepana dharanamandana vibhusanatthana veramani sikkhapadam samamadiyami I undertake the training rule to abstain from dancing singing instrumental music unsuitable shows and from wearing garlands using scents and beautifying the body with cosmeticsUccasayana mahasayana veramani sikkhapadam samadiyami I undertake the training rule to abstain from high and luxurious beds and seatsThere are two ways in which these precepts are observed  permanently and temporarilyPermanent observance far the less common of the two is undertaken generally by older people who having completed their family duties wish to deepen their spiritual development by devoting the later years of their life to intensified spiritual practiceEven then it is not very widespreadTemporary observance is usually undertaken by lay people either on Uposatha days or on occasions of a meditation retreatUposatha days are the new moon and full moon days of the lunar month which are set aside for special religious observances a custom absorbed into Buddhism from ancient Indian custom going back even into the preBuddhistic period of Indian historyOn these days lay people in Buddhist countries often take the eight precepts especially when they go to spend the Uposatha at a temple or monasteryOn these occasions the undertaking of the eight precepts lasts for a day and a nightThen secondly on occasions of retreat lay people take the eight precepts for the duration of their retreat which might last anywhere from several days to several monthsThe formulation of two distinct ethical codes follows from the two basic purposes of the Buddhist moral disciplineOne is the fundamental ethical purpose of putting a brake on immoral actions actions which are harmful either directly or indirectly to othersThis purpose falls into the province of the fivefold code of precepts which deals with the restraint of actions that cause pain and suffering to othersIn enjoining abstinence from these unwholesome actions the five precepts also protect the individual from their undesirable repercussions on himself  some immediately visible in this present life some coming to manifestation only in future lives when the kamma they generate bears its fruitThe other purpose of the Buddhist training in moral discipline is not so much ethical as spiritualIt is to provide a system of selfdiscipline which can act as a basis for achieving higher states of realization through the practice of meditationIn serving this purpose the code functions as a kind of ascesis a way of conduct involving selfdenial and renunciation as essential to the ascent to higher levels of consciousnessThis ascent culminating in nibbana or final liberation from suffering hinges upon the attenuation and ultimate eradication of craving which with its multiple branches of desire is the primary force that holds us in bondageTo reduce and overcome craving it is necessary to regulate not only the deleterious types of moral transgressions but also modes of conduct which are not harmful to others but sill give vent to the craving that holds us in subjectionThe Buddhist code of discipline expounded in the eight precepts represents the transition from the first level of moral discipline to the second that is from sila as a purely moral undertaking to sila as a way of ascetic selftraining aimed at progress along the path to liberationThe five precepts also fulfill this function to some extent but they do so only in a limited way not as fully as the eight preceptsWith the eight precepts the ethical code takes a pronounced turn towards the control of desires which are not socially harmful and immoralThis extension of the training focuses upon desires centering around the physical body and its concernsThe change of the third precept to abstinence from incelibacy curbs the sexual urge regarded in itself not as a moral evil but as a powerful expression of craving that has to be held in check to advance to the higher levels of meditationThe three new precepts regulate concern with food entertainment selfbeautification and physical comfortTheir observance nurtures the growth of qualities essential to the deeper spiritual life  contentment fewness of wishes modesty austerity renunciationAs these qualities mature the defilements are weakened aiding the effort to reach attainment in serenity and insightThe benefits sila brings to the one who undertakes it can be divided into three classes the benefits pertaining to the present life the benefits pertaining to future lives and the benefit of the ultimate goodThese we will discuss in turnAt the most elementary level the observance of the five precepts protects one from coming into trouble with the law ensuring immunity from temporal punishment at least with regard to those actions covered by the preceptsKilling stealing adultery bearing false testimony and irresponsible behavior caused by drunkenness being offenses punishable by law one who undertakes the five precepts avoids the penalties consequent upon these actions by abstaining from the actions which entail themFurther temporal benefits accrue through the observance of the preceptsFollowing the precepts helps to establish a good reputation among the wise and virtuousAt a more inward level it leads to a clear conscienceRepeated violations of the basic principles of ethics even if they escape detection still tend to create a disturbed conscience  the pain of guilt uneasiness and remorseBut maintaining the precepts results in freedom from remorse an ease of conscience that can evolve into the bliss of blamelessness when we review our actions and realize them to be wholesome and goodThis clarity of conscience fosters another benefit  the ability to die peacefully without fear or confusionAt the time of death the various actions we have regularly performed in the course of life rise to the surface of the mind casting up their images like pictures upon a screenIf unwholesome actions were prevalent their weight will predominate and cause fear at the approach of death leading to a confused and painful endBut if wholesome actions were prevalent in the course of life the opposite will take place when death comes we will be able to die calmly and peacefullyAccording to the Buddhas teaching the mode of rebirth we take in our next existence is determined by our kamma the willed actions we have performed in this present existenceThe general principle governing the working of the rebirth process is that unwholesome kamma leads to an unfavorable rebirth wholesome kamma to a favorable rebirthMore specifically if the kamma built up by breaking the five precepts becomes the determining cause of the mode of rebirth it will conduce to rebirth in one of the four planes of misery  the hells the realm of tormented spirits the animal world or the world of the asurasIf as a result of some wholesome kamma a person who regularly breaks the five precepts should take rebirth as a human being then when his unwholesome kamma matures it will produce pain and suffering in his human stateThe forms this suffering takes correspond to the transgressionsKilling leads to a premature death stealing to loss of wealth sexual misconduct to enmity false speech to being deceived and slandered by others and the use of intoxicants to loss of intelligenceThe observance of the five precepts on the other hand brings about the accumulation of wholesome kamma tending to rebirth in the planes of happiness ie in the human or heavenly worldsThis kamma again coming to maturity in the course of the life produces favorable results consonant in nature with the preceptsThus abstaining from the taking of life leads to longevity abstaining from stealing to prosperity abstaining from sexual misconduct to popularity abstaining from false speech to a good reputation and abstaining from intoxicants to mindfulness and wisdomThe ultimate good is the attainment of nibbana deliverance from the round of rebirths which can be achieved either in the present life or in some future life depending on the maturity of our spiritual facultiesNibbana is attained by practicing the path leading to deliverance the noble eightfold path in its three stages of moral discipline concentration and wisdomThe most fundamental of these three stages is moral discipline or sila which begins with the observance of the five preceptsThe undertaking of the five precepts can thus be understood to be the first actual step taken along the path to deliverance and the indispensable foundation for the higher attainments in concentration and wisdomSila functions as the foundation for the path in two waysFirst the observance of sila promotes a clear conscience essential to the development of concentrationIf we often act contrary to the precepts our actions tend to give rise to remorse which will swell up to the surface of the mind when we sit in meditation creating restlessness and feelings of guiltBut if we act in harmony with the precepts our minds will be imbued with a bliss and clarity of conscience which allows concentration to develop easilyThe observance of the precepts conduces to concentration in a second way it rescues us from the danger of being caught in a crossfire of incompatible motives disruptive of the meditative frame of mindThe practice of meditation aimed at serenity and insight requires the stilling of the defilementsBut when we deliberately act in violation of the precepts our actions spring from the unwholesome roots of greed hatred and delusionThus in committing such actions we are arousing the defilements while at the same time when sitting in meditation we are striving to overcome themThe result is inner conflict disharmony a split right through the center of our being obstructing the unification of the mind needed for meditative attainmentAt the outset we cannot expect to eliminate the subtle forms of the defilements all at onceThese can only be tackled later in the deeper stages of meditationIn the beginning we have to start by stopping the defilements in their coarser modes of occurrence and this is achieved by restraining them from reaching expression through the channels of body and speechSuch restraint is the essence of silaWe therefore take up the precepts as a form of spiritual training as a way of locking in the defilements and preventing them from outward eruptionsAfter they have been shut in and their effusions stopped we can then work on eliminating their roots through the development of concentration and wisdomThe Buddhist tradition recognizes three distinct ways of observing the preceptsOne is called immediate abstinence which means abstaining from unwholesome actions naturally through an ingrained sense of conscience resulting either from an innately keen ethical disposition or from education and trainingThe second is called abstinence through undertaking which means abstaining as a result of having undertaken rules of training with a determination to follow those rules as guidelines to right actionThe third way is called abstinence through eradication which means abstaining from the transgressions covered by the precepts as a result of having cut off the defilements out of which transgressions ariseFor purposes of selftraining Buddhism emphasizes the importance of the second type of abstinenceImmediate abstinence is seen as praiseworthy in itself but not sufficient as a basis for training since it presupposes the prior existence of a strong conscience which is not a reality in the overwhelming majority of menIn order to develop the mental strength to resist the upsurge of the defilements it is essential to undertake the precepts by a deliberate act of will and to form the determination to observe them diligentlyThere are two ways of formally undertaking the five precepts the initial and the recurrent corresponding to the two ways of going for refugeThe initial undertaking takes place immediately after the initial going for refugeWhen the aspirant receives the three refuges from a bhikkhu in a formal ceremony this will then be followed by the administering of the five precepts the monk reciting each of the precepts in turn and the lay disciple repeating them after himIf there is no monk available to administer the refuges and precepts the aspirant can take them upon himself by a strong and fixed mental resolution preferably doing so before an image of the BuddhaThe presence of a monk is not necessary but is generally desired to give a sense of the continuity of the lineageThe undertaking of the precepts is not a oneshot affair to be gone through once and then dropped off into the storage bank of memoriesRather like the going for refuge the precepts should be undertaken repeatedly preferably on a daily basisThis is the recurrent undertaking of the preceptsJust as the disciple repeats the three refuges each day to strengthen his commitment to the Dhamma so he should recite the five precepts immediately after the refuges in order to express his determination to embody the Dhamma in his conductHowever the practice of sila is not to be confused with the mere recitation of a verbal formulaThe recitation of the formula helps reinforce ones will to carry out the training but beyond all verbal recitations the precepts have to be put into practice in daytoday life especially on the occasions when they become relevantUndertaking the precepts is like buying a ticket for a train the purchase of the ticket permits us to board the train but does not take us anywhere by itselfSimilarly formally accepting the precepts enables us to embark upon the training but after the acceptance we have to translate the precepts into actionOnce we have formed the initial determination to cultivate sila there are certain mental factors which then help to protect our observance of the preceptsOne of these is mindfulnessMindfulness is awareness constant attention and keen observationMindfulness embraces all aspects of our being  our bodily activities our feelings our states of mind our objects of thoughtWith sharpened mindfulness we can be aware exactly what we are doing what feelings and states of mind are impelling us towards particular courses of action what thoughts form our motivationsThen by means of this mindfulness we can avoid the unwholesome and develop the wholesomeAnother factor which helps us maintain the precepts is understandingThe training in moral discipline should not be taken up as a blind dogmatic submission to external rules but as a fully conscious process guided by intelligenceThe factors of understanding give us that guiding intelligenceTo observe the precepts properly we have to understand for ourselves which kinds of actions are wholesome and which are unwholesomeWe also have to understand the reason why  why they are wholesome and unwholesome why the one should be pursued and the other abandonedThe deepening of understanding enables us to see the roots of our actions ie the mental factors from which they spring and the consequences to which they lead their longterm effects upon ourselves and othersUnderstanding expands our vision not only into consequences but also into alternatives into the different courses of action offered by any objective situationThence it gives us knowledge of the various alternatives open to us and the wisdom to choose some in preference to othersA third factor that helps in maintaining the precepts is energyThe training in right conduct is at base a way of training the mind since it is the mind that directs our actionsBut the mind cannot be trained without effort without the application of energy to steer it into wholesome channelsEnergy works together with mindfulness and understanding to bring about the gradual purification of silaThrough mindfulness we gain awareness of our states of mind through understanding we can ascertain the tendencies of these states their qualities roots and consequences then through energy we strive to abandon the unwholesome and to cultivate the wholesomeThe fourth factor conducive to the training in sila is patiencePatience enables us to endure the offensive actions of others without becoming angry or seeking retaliationPatience also enables us to endure disagreeable circumstances without dissatisfaction and dejectionIt curbs our desires and aversions restraining us from transgressions through greedy pursuits or violent reprisalsAbstinence through eradication the highest form of observing the precepts comes about automatically with the attainment of the state of an ariyan one who has reached direct realization of the DhammaWhen the disciple reaches the stage of streamentry the first of the ariyan stages he becomes bound to reach full liberation in a maximum of seven more livesHe is incapable of reverting from the course of forward progress towards enlightenmentSimultaneously with his attainment of streamentry the disciple acquires four inalienable qualities called the four factors of streamentryThe first three are unshakable faith in the Buddha the Dhamma and the SanghaThe fourth is completely purified silaThe noble disciple has cut off the defilements which motivate transgressions of the preceptsThus he can never deliberately violate the five preceptsHis observance of the precepts has become untorn unrent unblotched unmotiled liberating praised by the wise not clung to conducive to concentrationTo undertake the precepts is to make a determination to live in harmony with them not to ensure that one will never break themDespite our determination it sometimes happens that due to carelessness or the force of our conditioning by the defilements we act contrary to the preceptsThe question thus comes up as to what to do in such casesOne thing we should not do if we break a precept is to let ourselves become ridden by guilt and selfcontemptUntil we reach the planes of liberation it is to be expected that the defilements can crop up from time to time and motivate unwholesome actionsFeelings of guilt and selfcondemnation do nothing to help the matter but only make things worse by piling on an overlay of selfaversionA sense of shame and moral scrupulousness are central to maintaining the precepts but they should not be allowed to become entangled in the coils of guiltWhen a breach of the precepts takes place there are several methods of making amendsOne method used by monks to gain exoneration in regard to infringements on the monastic rules is confessionFor certain classes of monastic offenses a monk can gain clearance simply by confessing his transgression to another monkPerhaps with suitable modifications the same procedure could be applied by the laity at least with regard to more serious violationsThus if there are a number of lay people who are earnestly intent on following the path and one falls into a breach of a precept he can confess his lapse to a Dhamma friend or if one is not available he can confess it privately before an image of the BuddhaIt must be stressed however that confession does not aim at gaining absolutionNo one is offended by the ethical lapse nor is there anyone to grant forgivenessAlso confession does not abrogate the kamma acquired by the transgressionThe kamma has been generated by the deed and will produce its due effect if it gains the opportunityThe basic purpose of confession is to clear the mind of the remorse bearing upon it as a consequence of the breachConfession especially helps to prevent the concealment of the lapse a subtle maneuver of the ego used to bolster its pride in its own imagined perfectionAnother method of making amends is by retaking the five precepts reciting each precept in turn either in the presence of a monk or before an image of the BuddhaThis new undertaking of the precepts can be reinforced by a third measure namely making a strong determination not to fall into the same transgression again in the futureHaving applied these three methods one can then perform more virtuous actions as a way of building up good kamma to counteract the unwholesome kamma acquired through the breach of the preceptKamma tends to produce its due result and if this tendency is sufficiently strong there is nothing we can do to blot it outHowever kamma does not come to fruition always as a matter of strict necessityKammic tendencies push and tug with one another in complex patterns of relationshipSome tend to reinforce the results of others some to weaken the results some to obstruct the resultsIf we build up wholesome kamma through virtuous actions this pure kamma can inhibit the unwholesome kamma and prevent it from reaching fruitionThere is no guarantee that it will do so since kamma is a living process not a mechanical oneBut the tendencies in the process can be understood and since one such tendency is for the wholesome to counteract the unwholesome and hinder their undesired results a helpful power in overcoming the effects of breaking the precepts is the performance of virtuous actionsThe texts illustrate the qualities of sila with numerous similes but as with the three refuges we must again limit ourselves to only a fewSila is compared to a stream of clear water because it can wash off the stains of wrong actions which can never be removed by the waters of all other riversSila is like sandalwood because it can remove the fever of the defilements just as sandalwood can be used to allay bodily feverAgain sila is like an ornament made of precious jewels because it adorns the person who wears itIt is like a perfume because it gives off a pleasant scent the scent of virtue which unlike ordinary perfume travels even against the windIt is like moonbeams because it cools off the heat of passion as the moon cools off the heat of the dayAnd sila is like a staircase because it leads upwards by degrees  to higher states of future existence in the fortunate realms to the higher planes of concentration and wisdom to the supernormal powers to the paths and fruits of liberation and finally to the highest goal the attainment of nibbanaThe Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creedsFounded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topicsIts publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddhas discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practiceThese works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first arose ParivaaraBuddhist friends in Malaysia asked me to explain something about the Vinaya rules that guide the Buddhist monks life  in particular about monks or bhikkhus of the Theravaada lineageWe monks already have several learned texts in English to help us so a simplified lay persons guide now seems in orderfind their place they will be in the best position to explain their own rulesMy aim has been to illustrate those of the monks rules that also affect the lay person in some wayAt first it was going to deal only with a few questions but it has grown with peoples suggestions into a more thorough work of referenceEven so the best introduction remains a good practicing bhikkhu who shows that amid the myriad things of the material world living the simple life is possible with care  hence the many rules  much as in the Buddhas timeThe original Beginners Questions section has been kept and moved to the front as a brief overview of the sort of questions covered in the bookIt refers to later explanations for more detail which can be found not only in the main text but in the End Notes Footnotes Glossary and AppendicesI also have tried to include broader explanations in the main text so that while the actual rule is faithfully reproduced  including some translation variations  the different ways in which monks actually put it into practice are also coveredAlthough one might think one knows all about ones bhikkhus on going elsewhere things are never quite the same and sometimes in quite startling waysBhikkhus do sometimes follow the rules in different ways according to their particular traditions and these pages may help to explain the whys and wherefores of their practiceMy own perspective comes from twenty years as a bhikkhu in the forest monasteries of Thailand so I am very aware that this guide needs more information from the traditions in other countriesAs you read through this book it will become plain how much I have relied on other people and authoritiesI wish especially to mention my gratitude to Venerable Thanissaro Bhikkhu for his great contribution through his commentary on the bhikkhus rules The Buddhist Monastic Code to Venerable Thiradhammo Bhikkhu for his manuscript of The Heritage of the Sangha to Venerable Brahmavangso Bhikkhu for permission to quote from his Vinaya Notes and to the Mahamakut Foundation in Bangkok for the works on the monks rules that they publishLay people in half a dozen countries helped with advice and suggestions and my thanks and appreciation go to all of themI was very pleasantly surprised that they found our rules so fascinating and were willing to give so much of their time to going through the original manuscript with such care and interestYet on reflection they are right to feel part of the DhammaVinaya as the Lord Buddha saidBhikkhus I praise right practice in both whether householder or homeleaverHouseholder bhikkhus and homeleaver if rightly practiced by reason of their right practice are accomplishing the true way the wholesome DhammaHS chPlease remember that tolerance is always important even if one decides to give active support to only one group of monksThe following pages are offered solely to shed the light of understanding so they should not be used to create heat and friction through criticizing other peoples behaviorThis is the essence of the Buddhas TeachingA big heavy law book only too easily can be thrown at others so this guide will try to stay light and nonjudgementalThis gives opportunity for broadmindedness and flexibility so that we can include different interpretationsThereby one may come better to appreciate and support the monastic community of ones choiceFinally I hope that the same tolerance will be given to any faults and omissions found in this bookNot being enlightened or a scholar I can only offer a gathering of other peoples work and hope that the way I have put it all together does not intrude my own views and opinions too muchTherefore any suggestions for improvement offered in Dhamma are always welcomeThe Teaching of the Buddha is concerned with more than intellectual knowledge for it needs to be experienced as truth in ones own lifeThe Buddha often called his Teaching the DhammaVinaya and when he passed away he left these as the guide for all of us who followedAs Venerable Thiradhammo writesFor the bhikkhu the Vinaya helps to highlight actions and speech and show up their significanceIt brings an awareness of how he is intervening in the world how he is affecting other peopleFor betterFor worseWith what intentionOf course such an awareness is necessary for every human being not just Buddhist monksThis is why the Buddha bequeathed to us the Five the Eight and the Ten Precepts  as well as the bhikkhus rules of the PaatimokkhaThese precepts and rules remain as pertinent today as they were years ago for they restore the focus back to the human being to how actions and words affect individuals and the worldWhile the particulars may have changed the fundamentals remain the sameThose who take the Buddhas Teaching seriously become ever more aware of their actions and speech and how they match up against the Five PreceptsThey then might start to realize the advantage in occasionally keeping the Eight Precepts  perhaps on the weekly Observance Day  and become more interested in the bhikkhus Rule and how its precepts come together into a whole way of lifeThis compilation therefore is for anyone interested in bhikkhus and how to relate to themSome might think that the Theravaada lineage follows an overly traditionalist approach but then it does happen to be the oldest living major traditionA slight caution therefore for anyone completely new to the ways of monasticism for it is an approach to dealing with life that may appear radically different for this modern day and ageThe best introduction perhaps essential for a true understanding is meeting with a practicing bhikkhu who should manifest and reflect the peaceful and joyous qualities of the bhikkhus way of lifeBuddhist monks and nuns first received the goingforth into the Holy Life from the Buddha himself more than two and a half thousand years ago in IndiaSince then their influence has been felt over much of AsiaThe countries of Sri Lanka and South East Asia have been profoundly affected by the Theravadin School of Buddhism which looks back to the original Teachings as recorded in the Paali scripturesBuddhism was often first introduced to a new country when bhikkhus were invited to come and teach the new religion by the indigenous rulerThis process now continues throughout the world although the invitation nowadays comes more often from local BuddhistsBuddhism is justly admired for its appreciation of tolerance and broadmindedness with a history generally unblemished by heretical infightingThis has resulted in a wide spectrum of practices from the old Theravaada to the Zen of Japan and the Vajrayana of TibetEven between the different Theravadin countries and Schools there are slight variations in the ways the bhikkhus understand and practice the Vinaya RuleSuch differences have sometimes confused lay devotees so this book is also an attempt to offer a clearer understanding about the responsibilities of the Theravadin bhikkhus life and those of the lay devoteeWhen the Buddha was about to finally pass away and leave his followers rather than appoint an individual to take his place he said thisMore than twentyfive centuries have now gone by empires have come and gone great movements and ideologies have flared up and been lostYet on a deeper level under all of this the Dhamma and Vinaya have been quietly guiding the communities of Buddhist monksWhy has it withstood the test of time so wellWhy has it been so successfulPerhaps it is because the Lord Buddha understood the basic human condition of every time or place he knew our predicament and failings and he could show the way out to those of us who follow so long after him This section illustrates the origins of this book for it is a selection of the unedited questions that were first sent to meI have decided to make it an entrypoint for those people completely new to the Vinaya Rule rather than relegate it to an appendixThe answers often repeat or point to information contained later in the full textThose people already familiar with the rules can skip these Beginners and Frequently Asked Questions and go to the relevant section for more detailsA The Lord Buddha gave this reflection about why a monk wears a robeIn the Lord Buddhas time years ago clothing was made without complex machinerytime So the pattern of the robe is very simple and designed so that it can be made up out of patches of cloth for discarded rags were often used after washing and dyeingThis yellow robe is considered the banner of the arahant and emblem of BuddhismFor the ordinary Theravaadin bhikkhu it is a privilege to be able to wear this robe continuing the tradition and practicing to be worthy of itThere are rules as to the robes size color how they are sewn type of cloth used etc and how bhikkhus can acquire themThe color of the robes depends on the dye usedUntil very recently this would have been natural vegetable dye found in the jungle from roots or treesNowadays chemical dyes are more used and sometimes give that more vivid orange color that one sees in BangkokThe color white is used by Buddhist devotees to show their commitment to keeping the Precepts  usually the Eight Precepts  on Observance DaysA The Lord Buddha gave this reflection about finding and eating foodThe alms bowl is another practical symbol of Buddhism and like the robes another requisite of the bhikkhuAlthough every bhikkhu is given an alms bowl when he becomes a monk not all of them will actually go on an alms round and only a minority  usually they are the forest meditation bhikkhus  will eat from their bowl sitting on the floorTherefore many monks will eat using plates and dishes while some will eat sitting on the floor at a small table and others at a normal westernstyle tableOne should not feel shy about asking a monk as to his normal way of eating and then fit in with thatThose forest bhikkhus who keep the austere practices will be stricter about only using one eating vesselThis can simplify life and remind the bhikkhu that although food is necessary for bodily health he does not have to indulge in an obsession with tasteA In India during the Lord Buddhas time much of the land was covered in forests and groves and this was where the wandering mendicants of the different orders would pursue their religious practicesThe Lord Buddha spoke of the foot of a tree as the basic shelter for bhikkhus and this is usually still affirmed to every newly ordained bhikkhuLater monasteries were established and wellendowed and the focus shifted to a more settled lifeMostly only the forest monks now live in the forest where it is quiet and conducive to meditationMany more monks will live in the village monastery or go to a monastery in the town to study the scripturesThe Lord Buddha said this about the basics of shelter whether in the forest or cityA In fact getting the robes and bowl is not so much a problem for once the candidate is accepted by a preceptor the preceptor will know where suitable requisites may be foundThe question should be more about the qualities necessary to become a monk and I have explained some of these in the section on Becoming a BhikkhuIf the candidates intention is right and he is not disqualified by other factors he should find a senior monk who can advise him on the places where he might ordain and perhaps recommend him to a preceptorIf the candidate lives in a nonBuddhist country he can write for details to the country where he is interested in stayingBhikkhus are often traveling and giving Dhamma talks around the world and they would generally be very happy to make suggestions about thisIn certain communities there is a postulancy period when the candidate first wears white robes as an anagarika and after a year may then be given either novice or full bhikkhu ordinationOnce he is accepted for this all the requisites should be providedSimilarly for the lay person wanting to help supply requisites to the new monk the best way is to ask details from a senior monk who will explain and helpIn some Buddhist countries there are even special shops to supply these requisites but whether this is suitable will depend on the monastery of ordinationAlso see the book Ordination Procedure and the Preliminary Duties of a New BhikkhuA The Theravadin lineage no longer has an officially recognized bhikkhunii ordinationThere are other forms for lay women that still involve leaving the home life and keeping Eight or Ten Precepts as a dasasiila mata nunFinding a suitable place is quite difficult but several groups are trying to develop places conducive to Dhamma practice for such nunsA Some bhikkhus take a daily almsround as a special practice and will normally always want to goMany other monks will be happy to receive food brought to themPlease ask or observe how the monk practicesThere is no harm in offering to bring the food for if the monk prefers to walk on an almsround he can explain about thatA There is a minimum in that the bhikkhu must be properly and modestly dressed especially in publicDuring the cold season in India the Buddha allowed a doublelayered outer robe to be used and so  using the Great Standards as a guide  in even colder climates extra layers may be allowableIn countries where hypothermia may be a danger the use of extra layers seems sensible  especially if this cuts down on heating and medical expensesHowever it is generally felt very important that the traditional robes remain the basic dress and extra layers should not obscure thisA There are definite conditions that allow a bhikkhu to ask for helpThese would be when he is ill or in danger or when he has been formally offered helpSee How to Help a Bhikkhu  Invitation for a fuller explanationA Yes generosity is a virtue highly praised by the Buddha and was often the first virtue he mentionedIt goes against the general modern selfish attitude of getting is better than giving and leads on to contentment and the calm that can lead to deep meditation and wisdomSo if it makes one happy to make an offering then one can do so without asking firstHowever the offering should also be endowed with wisdom so that one gives something that is useful and not beyond ones familys meansA The yellow robe worn by monks is an emblem and reminder of the Triple Gem as is the Buddha StatueTherefore one is really bowing to the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha not to some person or statueThere are two aspects to bowing  the bodily action and the mindIf one bows because it gives one the opportunity to demonstrate ones faith in the Triple Gem because it seems the right thing to do and because it leads the mind to calm then it will be beneficialIf one bows without reason or because one feels that one must do so for appearances sake then it is a rather empty gestureWhen I bow three times to the Buddha Statue or to senior monks I mentally recollect Buddho then Dhammo and then Sangho and also have mindfulness of the bodily posture as it bends forward and the head touches the floorHowever in Western countries this is often misunderstood and can be the source of quite a lot of embarrassmentIt is up to the persons themselves to decide what is appropriate under the different circumstancesA One should show respect from ones heart in the way that seems best to oneself recollecting the Triple Gem and doing it mindfullyNo good monk is going to take offence if one does not bowA When the prince who was to become the Buddha left his palace to seek a way beyond aging sickness and death it is said that one of the first things that he did was to shave off his hair and beard and put on the yellow cloth Buddhist monks always completely shave their head and beard showing their commitment to the Holy Life of one gone forth into the homeless lifeA rule states that a bhikkhu should not allow his hair to grow beyond a certain length or time so he will shave usually at least once a fortnight or month sometimes more frequentlyTo do this he uses his razor which is also one of his requisitesHairofthehead is one of the five parts of the body mentioned in the ordination ceremony and is used to recollect the true nature of the bodyThe bhikkhu is also not allowed to dye or pluck out any gray hairs for they are useful reminders of oldage and impermanenceA  The Vinaya Rule specifies that if a bhikkhu touches or is touched by a woman it is an offence  a very serious offence  only if the bhikkhu is overcome by lust with altered mind However the practicing bhikkhu knows that as his mind changes so quickly he has to be extremely cautious about involving himself in doubtful situationsIt is better to be safe than sorry even if this may seem overscrupulousIn emergency situations the bhikkhu will have to decide for himself and be sure to take care of his thoughtsIn Thailand it is a tradition that the monk uses a receiving cloth to emphasize that there is no touchingA As with the preceding cases with bhikkhus there is no fault if there is no wrong intentionA This has become a complex question with various interpretations because of modern conditionsThe spirit of the rule is very important  avoiding possibilities of intimacy  while the interpretation will depend on the monk and the circumstancesIn countries without proper monasteries there will always have to be something of a compromiseA While it may be a problem or inconvenience the rules are there to protect and remind the monk about dangerous unskillful actionsIf the monk becomes increasingly involved with money there is a tendency for the whole of his bhikkhulife to be compromised  and that would be a far greater problemSoon after the Final Passing Away of the Lord Buddha this sort of question had already become a major controversy and it is now even more complex under modern conditionsHowever modern conditions also have brought their own assistance to keeping these rulesFor instance a bhikkhu can be given an air ticket and travel around the world without having any money or attendantHe will need to be met at the airport and helped in the normal way but that should be natural if he has been invited to come by the lay groupAnd of course a monk can use postage stamps and telephonecards that add convenience to communicating  when it is appropriateA I know of no place in the Vinaya that states a bhikkhu cannot disrobeIf he no longer has any interest in the bhikkhulife the tendency will be for him to become lax and a bad example for othersHis Dhamma friends therefore will try to refire his enthusiasmHowever if that is not possible becoming a good layman may be better than being a bad monkThere is a tradition about a bhikkhu not reordaining more than seven timesA I understand that the zenith here means when the sun reaches the highest point in its arc across the skyIn most habitable areas of the globe this arc may be low to the horizon but it should still be possible to follow the ruleAnd if bhikkhus ever reach the polar regions they will have the Great Standards to guide themA At the time of the Buddha some lay people complained that the monks destroyed the life in seedsTherefore lay people can be asked by the monk if it is allowable for him to eat those fruitsIn some monasteries this is done by the lay people cutting themIt is the Commentary to the Vinaya that mentions about great fruits This practice however is not followed in every monasteryThere is an allowance in the Paali texts that medicinaltonics can be taken in the afternoon while lifetimemedicines may be consumed any time they are neededThere are different interpretations and practices about how ill a bhikkhu has to be for it to be allowable to take such medicines Some bhikkhus will not take anything other than pure water while some will overstretch the Rule to even drinking medicinal fooddrinks in the afternoonSome bhikkhus will consider tealeaves allowable while some will see it as food or as a stimulant and therefore not appropriateAlso the ordinary rural villagers of South East Asia would have had no tea or coffee to drink so such items could be considered quite a luxuryIt will depend on local conditions and interpretations which are allowed for in the Vinaya through the Great StandardsA This is a complicated questionIf there is a steward who does the arranging for the bhikkhu in the proper manner then certain things would be allowableHowever there are very strict guidelines about thisPractically speaking bhikkhus in Thailand are not ordered to renounce all their property etc when they receive ordinationBhikkhus who are serious about dedicating their life to the Holy Life will obviously take the Lord Buddha as their example and like Him renounce all that is worldlyThere are specific rules not covered in this work about Community land and property and the different ways they are managedA The taking of a Teacher by a bhikkhu and living in dependence on him can only be between bhikkhusAnd even according to the bhikkhuniis own Rule in the time of the Lord Buddha she was not allowed to teach bhikkhusHowever this does not mean that a bhikkhu cannot learn from othersA There is a specific rule against bhikkhus owning vehiclesObviously motor vehicles were not available in the Buddhas time and most travel would have been on footHowever there was the casewhen the groupofsix bhikkhus went in a vehicle yoked with cows and bulls they were criticized by the lay peopleThe Buddha then established a fault of Wrongdoing for a bhikkhu to travel in a vehicle later illness was exempted from this guidelineTraveling in a vehicle in the Buddhas time was an extravaganceA strict application of this training in Thailand is not allowing bhikkhus to drive or own vehicles and not to ride on motorcycles Bhikkhus were allowed to use ferry boats etcA In Thailand I understand that one cannot be officially registered as a herbal doctor while still a bhikkhuWhile providing medicines for ones fellow monks is very much allowable it is definitely wrong that a monk dispenses medicine for rewardA If a bhikkhu commits a paaraajika offence he is defeated and no longer a bhikkhu even if he is wearing robesThe Community of bhikkhus will have nothing to do with him and will expel himHowever if the accused bhikkhu does not admit to the offence and it cannot be proved the results of kamma must be allowed to run their own courseBuddhism has never engaged in violent witch huntsAnd for how lay people dealt with stubborn monks in the Buddhas time see DisputesA Generally the rightpracticing bhikkhu will be a person of few wants for he is trying to go to the ending of all desireHowever there may be certain things he may need but may not mention until he is sure that the donors are completely sincere in their invitationIf the donor makes specific suggestions the bhikkhu may refuse he may accept or he may remain silent  and such silence may very well be a positive responseTherefore as the donor gets to know the bhikkhu he or she will become more sensitive about what is needed and what is appropriate  and be able to interpret any silence in the right wayThe awakened mind has gone beyond greed hatred and delusionYet for those of us who are still striving towards this end such unskillful tendencies have to be addressedWe need guidelines to help us become more aware of our actions and speech so that we do not go off the Buddhas Middle WayFor a start there are the Five Precepts then the Eight and the Ten Precepts and then the Paatimokkha Rules of the bhikkhuThe Five Precepts are basic human ethical standards  answering the fundamental questions of what do I do what should I say These standards are further refined by the Eight Precepts which allow the lay person to live a life closer to that of the monk  even if temporarilyThis may then lead to the Ten Precepts of a novice or of a dasasiila mata nunThe Vinaya and Paatimokkha rules were set down by the Buddha in response to specific incidents that occurred either within the Community of bhikkhus or through their interaction with the lay communityAn explanation of the original circumstances that led to the formulation of a rule is usually included in the scriptural text as an introduction to that ruleThe emphasis therefore is always on Dhamma practice with the Precepts or Vinaya as a vital guide and supportWhen a bhikkhu takes up the training rules he might find that past habits and tendencies still cause problems  especially in a nonsupportive environmentOf course staying within a suitable environment will simplify this which is a major reason for some rulesTherefore it is important to remember that the bhikkhu never practices in isolation and always needs the support and understanding of lay BuddhistsThere is the need for mutual support and encouragement between the lay and bhikkhu communitiesKnowing something of the rules should enable the lay person to appreciate thisBuddhism has been said to be deeply rooted in a country when a local young man can become a bhikkhu learn and then recite the Paatimokkha Rule in his own country This originally referred to Sri Lanka thousands of years ago but now that Buddhism is moving to the West such conditions are starting to appear there tooThe Bhikkhu Sangha or Community of monks is probably the oldest of any of the institutions that have remained faithful to their origins and spread worldwideWhile scholars like to track its historical development from country to country we could also start with a particular bhikkhu and trace the thread back through preceptor after preceptor to the Buddha HimselfIts many remarkable features enable men from different classes backgrounds and cultures to live together in harmony and fellowshipMost important it offers ideal conditions for the individual to train and meditate to awaken to Dhamma which is the whole point of the Buddhas TeachingThe first part of the ordination procedure for bhikkhus is known as the Going Forth into HomelessnessIf it finishes with just that  without going on to the Questioning of the candidate and the Acceptance of him by all the gathered bhikkhus into the Bhikkhu Sangha  the candidate is known as a saamanera or noviceThis is usually the case when the candidate is less than the twenty years of age necessary to become a bhikkhuA very young boy is not allowed to become a novice either but the minimum age will vary according to placeA saamanera wears the yellow robe like a full bhikkhu  except he does not have the sanghaati  and leads a very similar lifeIn some places a period as a novice forms part of the preliminary training to become a bhikkhu while some men decide to remain saamanera for various reasonsThe saamanera keeps the Ten Precepts and the Training Rules and some other rules of the bhikkhuLater when he is ready and if he is old enough he can ask the bhikkhu community for full ordinationIn the Pali texts when a man decided to become a bhikkhu he is often quoted as sayingHowever anyone wishing to become a bhikkhu must fulfill certain conditions about which he will be questioned during the actual ordination procedureThe candidate must be male and at least twenty years oldHe must never have committed any grievous crimes and if previously ordained he must not have been guilty of any Defeater offences or have entered some other religion without disrobing firstHe should also be of good reputation fit and healthy enough to carry out the duties of a bhikkhu not in debt not subject to government service and have permission from parents or guardianThe Ordination ceremony requires a prescribed boundary a preceptor and a quorum of bhikkhus to validate the formal Sangha ActIn the formal procedure the candidate is examined as to the necessary qualities and if all the bhikkhus are satisfied they receive him into the Sangha the Community of BhikkhusIt is in this way that yet another link is added to the bhikkhulineageHenceforth the new bhikkhu can participate in future assemblies and help receive other new bhikkhus  as bhikkhus have continued to do for two and a half thousand yearsWhen a candidate requests full admission to the Community he does not make any lifetime vows but offers himself for training and instruction under his Preceptors guidanceAt the end of the ordination ceremony the Preceptor will immediately instruct the new bhikkhu about the Paatimokkha Rule and the other principles that all bhikkhus should follow and observeFor the first five years a bhikkhu is called navaka and he must live dependent on a senior bhikkhu  either his preceptor or teacher  training in the ways of a bhikkhuThe preceptor and the new monk should be kind and helpful to each other in almost a fatherandson relationshipA new bhikkhu who no longer lives under his preceptor must take another senior bhikkhu as his teacher and depend on him insteadFor the next five years after his navaka period the bhikkhu is called majjhima and he is allowed to live by himself if he is accomplished in certain qualitiesWhen a bhikkhu has completed ten Rains he is called Thera which can be translated as an elder who is worthy of respect If he is also accomplished in certain extra qualities he is allowed to give ordination as preceptor to be a teacher and have young monks live in dependence on himThroughout South East Asia it is very common for young men to become bhikkhus for a short period of their lifeTraditionally this occurs during the three months of the Rains Retreat after which they disrobe and return to lay life hopefully knowing and appreciating much more about the bhikkhu life  and probably having friends still in the monastery whom they can visit for adviceIn Thailand this means that while a small proportion of bhikkhus will spend all their life in the robe many more Thai men will have tasted the lifeSuch an ordination is also a rite of passage for it is a family even a village event with many people joining in to see the young man off into this new stage of his lifeThe new monk will frequently visit his former home on his daily alms round so his ordination has a wider influence showing the continuing possibility of living the Holy Life started by the Lord Buddha so long agoIt may also be considered a way for the young man to show his gratitude to his parents and grandparents for they are thought to participate and share in the merit he makes through his ordinationAlso some men might ordain for a time before marriage  one way for the young man to prove his maturity to his fiance  and then again later in life after retirementThe bhikkhus year is structured around the three months from July to OctoberIn Asia this is the time of the monsoon season  the central period of the agricultural year  when the paddy fields are flooded and the main rice crop is plantedIn the Buddhas time people were less likely to travel around during this period because the roads were bad and there was a danger of crop damageSo the bhikkhus likewise suspended their mendicant wanderings and had to settle in one placeA bhikkhu must make a formal determination to be resident at dawn every day in that place for the whole three month periodThese three months are often a special time of study or meditation and so are sometimes known as the Rains Retreat or Rains ResidenceThis is also the normal time when the young men of South East Asia become monks for the traditional three month periodA bhikkhu often measures the length of time he has been a monk according to how many Rains Residences he has undertakenTherefore instead of saying he has been ordained seven years he might say he has been ordained for seven RainsLiving the bhikkhulife properly following the Buddhas Teaching requires full commitment and sustained effortIf this is lost and his Dhamma friends cannot rekindle his interest the bhikkhu is always at liberty to return to lay lifeThere are no lifetime vows so perhaps living a good lay life is better than being lax in keeping the bhikkhus rulesNevertheless in some countries there is a cultural expectation of ordaining for life and a corresponding stigma attached to disrobingDisrobing is finalized by the monk clearly proclaiming his change of status before another bhikkhu or lay personOnce the other person understands his statement he is no longer a bhikkhuIn Thailand there is often a formal ceremony for this that ends with the former monk undertaking the Five Precepts to replace the Paatimokkha RuleIn those countries where temporary ordinations are rites of passage some men may ordain and disrobe several times in their life  before marriage and after retirement for exampleHowever there seems to be a tradition that bhikkhus do not disrobe and go forth again more than seven times but this rarely occursIf a bhikkhu commits a Defeater Offence there is no need for him formally to disrobe because he is automatically expelled by his wrongful action and is no longer a bhikkhu from that momentHe can never reordain during that lifetimeThis book is really only concerned with bhikkhusIn the Theravaada lineage it seems that the bhikkhunii ordination lineage for women given by the Buddha  equivalent to bhikkhuordination for men  was lost in Sri Lanka with the fall of Anuradhapura in Sri Lanka in the eleventh century CEand finally with the fall of Pagan in the thirteenth century CEBhikkhuniis originally observed Paatimokkha Rules and there are whole sections of the Paali Vinaya texts devoted to the their rulesThe Paali Vinaya texts are contained in five large volumesThe Sutta Vibhanga division comprises the two books that contain the Paatimokkha Rules with the stories of their origin and other explanationsThe next two books the Mahaavagga and Cullavagga of the Khandhaka divisionThe last book is a form of appendix or supplementSo the Paatimokkha Rules are a part of the greater VinayaAs VenThiradhammo remarksThe Buddha laid down that on full and new moon days all the bhikkhus in residence in the same community must come together in a formal meetingIf there is a quorum of at least four bhikkhus they should listen to the full Paatimokkha RuleA competent bhikkhu who has learned this by heart will recite it in the Paali language for the Community so that they can remind themselves of their responsibilities in keeping the major RulesThe complete recitation may take anywhere from thirtyfive minutes to an hour depending on the skill of the reciting bhikkhuBefore the Paatimokkha recitation begins each bhikkhu should admit to any offences that he knows he has committed by formally telling another monkOnce this is accomplished the monk is considered pure and can listen to the recitation of the rulesIn many communities it is normal for each bhikkhu to make a general confession of all possible offences to another bhikkhu before listening to the Paatimokkha recitationDifferent offences are of different seriousness but the most common faults committed by carelessness or mistake can be cleared by confession to another bhikkhuAdmitting to ones mistake and agreeing to do better in the future is the way of growth and progress towards the elimination of all carelessness and absentmindednessWhen a bhikkhu breaks his precepts or rules it is called an offenceSuch offences are committed by action or word although intention is a decisive factorJust thinking about doing something wrong is unskillful and may lead to future problems but it is not an offenceWe will be examining some of these rules in the following pagesThe new bhikkhu is told about the Paaraajika Offences immediately after ordination so he fully knows that they are the most serious of all the offences and that the consequences of transgressing them causes him to be no longer a bhikkhuThe nature of the act that breaks any of these four Paaraajika rules clearly reveals that the bhikkhu is no longer interested in developing the subtle and refined way of DhammaThe alternative of voluntarily disrobing is always available if he feels he can no longer keep the Rule and this is considered a much better way to handle this sort of overwhelming desireA monk automatically falls from being a bhikkhu by committing any of these four offences of Defeat sexualintercourse murder majortheft or falsely claiming supernormal abilitiesA bhikkhu who falls into any of these four Defeater offences thereby severs himself irrevocably from the bhikkhu community and is no longer considered a bhikkhuThe text portrays it with some vivid similes showing their irreparable nature as a man with his head cut off as a withered leaf fallen from its stem as a palm tree cut down as a broken stone For while all the other offences can be remedied these four are terminalThis is a very serious class of offenceHowever any offending bhikkhu can be rehabilitated through confession and supervised probationFinally the bhikkhu needs to be reinstated by a specially convened Community meeting of at least twenty monksThe Bhikkhu Community have to decide which rule if any has been infringedThese rules are often concerned with bhikkhus being greedy and excessive in their demand for offerings or with bhikkhus obtaining requisites through improper meansThis oppresses lay donors and classically led them to comment How can these recluses not knowing moderation ask for The rules of this category also guide bhikkhus on how they should take care of requisites and restrain the bhikkhus from obtaining items that by their very nature are inappropriateThis offence can be cleared by forfeiture of the improper item to another bhikkhu and formal confession of the offence The other classes of offences can usually be resolved by a simple confession to another bhikkhuThey areAll these offences can be cleared through confession to another bhikkhuThese are normally classified as offences of wrongdoingThere are two aspects to these rules of training which are mainly about etiquette and good mannersFirst they are a gauge for the bhikkhus mindfulness so that he becomes aware of his behaviorSecond there is the external perspective of an observer watching the bhikkhus activity and noticing the care and refinement with which he moves eats etcThese are general procedures for dealing with disputes accusations offences and duties In the full Vinaya texts there is also the class of grave offenceThis is a derived offence from the most serious rules of Paaraajika and Sanghaadisesa and above to cover those circumstances when the full offence is not quite carried out but the conduct is still grave enough to be at faultThere is also the dubbhaasita offence of wrong speechThe Lord Buddha would not set down a rule until the situation demanded it so the Paali often supplies the origin story about how the different rules came aboutCertain characters often reappear in the thick of misdeeds and mischiefFor instance one keeps on coming across Venerable Udaayin or the notorious groupofsix monksTheir behavior required attention and rectification from the Buddha who then made it into a general rule for all the bhikkhusLater circumstances may have required the Buddha to make amendments or special exceptions and the rule would then have been adjusted accordinglyThere are also many other minor offences mentioned in the original Paali texts which have been further enlarged upon by later CommentariesSo the range of rules has become very extensive and their observance and interpretation correspondingly wide Note that it was often lay peoples criticism that brought the monks wrong doings to the attention of the BuddhaMore than two and a half thousand years have passed since the Vinaya rules were originally set down by the Buddha and many things have markedly changed since thenShould the rules be modernized and brought up to dateHow can this be doneAlready during His lifetime the Buddha made special allowances for different regions outside the Middle Country of North India  where He lived and taughtThese dealt with both the workings of the Community  for example a smaller quorum for ordination is allowed in distant parts where there are fewer monks  and practical measures such as special dispensation for footwear and bathingSo there is a precedent for adapting to conditions but this does not mean the abolishing of any rulesThe Lord Buddha also left us a set of principles that can still be used as a standard to judge new circumstancesThese are known as The Great Standards Properly used they should protect against a wholesale dilution of the RuleThis is how the Great Standards are formulatedBhikkhus whatever I have not objected to saying This is not allowable if it fits in with what is not allowable if it goes against what is allowable that is not allowable for youWhatever I have not objected to saying This is not allowable if it fits in with what is allowable if it goes against what is not allowable that is allowable for youAnd whatever I have not permitted saying This is allowable if it fits in with what is not allowable if it goes against what is allowable that is not allowable for youAnd whatever I have not permitted saying This is allowable if it fits in with what is allowable if it goes against what is not allowable that is allowable for you  Treated with care these Great Standards should enable bhikkhus to live according to the Vinaya Rule in for example isolated communities in nonBuddhist countries with nontropical climatesThey form a touchstone for modern conditions and substancesAmong the unenlightened finding fault with others often seems to be one of our most damaging habitual tendenciesWe are able to twist whatever we want to this purposeFor bhikkhus there are many cautions those who follow the Vinaya blindly tend to be proud and arrogant regarding themselves as better behaved and more strict than others and despising other bhikkhus as inferiorThis in itself is unbecoming and worthy of censure and when such bhikkhus have to associate with others whom they feel to be deficient in observing the Vinaya they do it grudgingly and with a sense of distaste and thus bring even more trouble on themselvesAs for the bhikkhu who behaves in the correct manner he is bound to feel cheerful because he senses that his behavior is becoming But he will remain tolerant and in perfect harmony with those who follow a different practice from his own on matters not clearly covered by the Vinaya alajjiiBut he will remain tolerant and in perfect harmony with those who follow a different practice from his own on matters not clearly covered by the Vinaya Disparate interpretations of the Vinaya rules can lead different communities into claiming that only their understanding is correct and everyone else is wrongThe Buddhist Monastic Code has this to sayVenerable Thanissaro continues by emphasizing In the modern West we find ourselves with the unusual situation of having Buddhist monasteries and temples of so many different countries and traditions so close at handWe should appreciate this abundance and variety deciding which establishment suits our needs and then not worry about the shortcomings of other placesHaving established a background we will now turn to the rules themselvesRather than following the traditional listing we will group rules together under four headings which might pertain to or be of interest to lay peopleFor other Patimokkha Rules not covered here see Appendix B Throughout its history Buddhism has been renowned for its tolerance and compassion towards all living beings and this is reflected in the Buddhist monks VinayaTheir rules cover situations of causing harm ranging from murder  which is universally accepted as a crime  to such things as destroying plant lifeThe third Defeater Offence deals with murderThe original story describes how some bhikkhus wrongly grasped the Buddhas meditation teaching on the loathsome aspects of the body and falling into wrong view committed suicide or asked someone to end their lives for themThe rule can be summarized like this A bhikkhu must not recommend killing suicide or help arrange a murderAlso because in this rule a human being is defined as beginning with the human foetus counting from the time consciousness first arises in the womb he must not advise or arrange an abortionThere is no offence if death is caused accidentally or without intentionThe previous offence was one of Defeat for murder whereas this rule is one of Confession for killing animalsIt originally arose because Venerable Udaayin a frequent delinquent detested crows so much that he shot them with arrows and then displayed their cutoff headsAnimal here is paano literally having breath The Commentary explains that it includes living beings down to the size of a bedbugElsewhere the texts forbid the killing of even an antOne of the bhikkhus requisites is a water filterThis is employed to prevent the killing of waterborne creatures when making use of water from a well or streamPractically this also leads bhikkhus to take extra care that they cover water jars or regularly change water so that mosquito larvae do not have opportunity to breedThis shows how the Vinaya Rule emphasizes care and forethought as preventive medicineThere are two rules concerned with bhikkhus and their use of waterOne of these offences was originally perpetrated by the notorious groupofsix monks who used water that contained living beingsIt can be summarizedIn the second offence the monks of AAlavii were doing repairs and sprinkled grass and clay with water that they knew contained lifeIt is summarizedIntention is an essential factor hereFor example if a bhikkhu only intends to sweep a path but accidentally kills ants in the process there is no offence because it is not deliberateHowever ordering an animal to be killed is an offence The common belief at the time of the Buddha was that plants were onefacultied life Today we have ecologically green beliefs that are often equivalent  at least they seem to lead to much the same attitudesThe eleventh Confession offence concerns destroying plant lifeIt originated because a bhikkhu harmed onefacultied life by cutting down treesHe continued to cut down a tree even when the treedeva asked him to stop so she went and complained to the BuddhaThis led to lay criticism of such behavior and a rule was set downTherefore destroying a living plant  for instance felling a tree uprooting a flower burning grass  is a Confession offence as is picking fruit from a tree a flower from a bush etcIt is an offence of wrongdoing to damage or destroy fertile seeds or pips or viable seedlings Bhikkhus who live in tropical forest monasteries constantly have to protect both the jungle and themselvesWhen paths are overgrown snakes and other dangerous creepycrawlies can be trodden on  and bite backThere also may be a need for firebreaksOne way that forest monks cope with this is a daily routine of sweeping the pathsHowever they are not allowed to dig or clear the landThe tenth Confession offence arose when bhikkhus dug the ground and got others to dig and the local people criticized them because they considered the earth to be onefacultied life The rule is phrased like thisDigging breaking the surface of the earth lighting a fire on it pounding a stake into it are all disallowed It is however allowable for monks to hint to laypeople or novices about what needs doing as long as the words or gestures fall short of a commandWhen bhikkhus need paths to be cleared necessary work done on the ground firebreaks made etc any lay attendant wanting to help should listen out for hints and indications A post hole dug over there would be useful make this ground allowable etcWhat is needed can then be clarified One practical and long term effect of these rules is that they have steered bhikkhus away from involvement in agriculture and land ownershipSuch a development would also have isolated bhikkhus from the lay community because they would no longer have needed to depend on alms foodBhikkhus cannot live in complete isolation from lay people for the mutual support relationship is intrinsic to their way of lifeHowever it should never become an intimate relationship for this goes against the whole purpose of leaving the family life with its endless enclosed complicationsThe Holy Life or Brahmacariya is one that checks the display of any form of sexual desire through the actions and speech of the bhikkhuOnes Dhamma life can then advance towards the ending of all desire through mind development and meditationThe most potent object for such sexual desire that which the mind is most tenaciously grasping after is usually associated with the opposite sex so many rules involve this relationship The first offence of all the listed rules of the Paatimokkha concerns a bhikkhu engaging in sexual intercourseIt remains a hot issue perhaps even more so today going by the number of sexual scandals that rock the Buddhist religious world in both the East and the WestAs Venerable Thiradhammo writesThe rule was originally laid down because of Venerable SudinnaHe was the son of a rich merchant who left home to become a bhikkhu only after great opposition from his familyHe went away to practice Dhamma and when he came back to visit sometime later his parents were overjoyed to see him and plotted to lure him back into the lay life againThey invited him for a meal and then laid out their wealth in front of him piled up in two huge heaps of gold while the wife he had left behind dressed herself in her most irresistibly alluring wayVenerable Sudinna remained unmoved by all of thisAfter telling them to throw the gold away in the river he called his former wife Sister Nevertheless when his elderly mother pleaded with him at least to give them an heir he foolishly gave in and had sexual intercourse with his former wifeThis First Defeater Offence is summarizedEvery form and variety of sexual intercourse with sexual penetration  whether genital oral or anal whether with woman man or animal  is forbiddenThe penalty is the heaviest one of Paaraajika or Defeat The modern West has stories of sexual harassment so the ways that the Buddha dealt with such matters should not seem so very strangeIf a bhikkhu touches a woman in a sexual way he commits a very serious offence requiring formal meetings of the Community and probationThe scrupulous bhikkhu wants to remain above suspicion so if he can he will avoid all physical contactThe rule was first set down by the Buddha after a brahman and his wife had gone to inspect VenUdaayins fine dwellingAs VenUdaayin was showing them around he came up behind the lady and rubbed up against her limb by limb After they had left the husband praised VenUdaayin but the wife was critical and explained what had happenedThe brahman then complained Isnt it even possible to take ones wife to a monastery without her being molested This rule was then set downTo be at fault the bhikkhu must usually do some action to bring contact with a woman while lust overcomes his mindIf he accidentally stumbles and bumps into a woman or viceversa or if he is accosted by a woman as long as there is no intention to come into lustful contact there is no offenceHowever the average bhikkhus mind tends to be so quick and unruly  he is after all still in training and therefore unenlightened  that he may prefer to be supercautious about such situationsIf a bhikkhu touches his mother out of affection then this is still an offence but the lesser one of wrongdoingWhile gratitude to parents was strongly emphasized by the Buddha the bhikkhu having left the homelife and his family should not cling to worldly relationshipsThe only true way for him to fulfill his filial obligations is by gaining insight into Dhamma and then teaching his parentsIf a bhikkhu is acting with lustful intentions he incurs a grave offence for making bodily contact with a pandaka and an offence of wrongdoing for contact with a male The previous rules dealt with the bhikkhus physical actions the next two rules are offences  again of the very serious category  that concern his wrong speech towards womenThis rule came into being when many women visitors came together to look over VenUdaayins dwellingHe spoke to them in a lewd flirtatious way so that some of them said It is improperEven from our husbands we wouldnt like to hear this sort of thing Therefore the Buddha laid down this rule The following rule is very relevant today when some misguidedly believe that submitting to sex with spiritual teachers can help in their spiritual developmentAgain it was originally a lustful VenUdaayin who was the cause of this offenceThis time he suggested to a beautiful and devout woman follower that she make a special offering to him that of sexual intercourseThe Buddha then set forth this rule The major issue today seems more to center around divorce and the breakdown of marriage rather than arranging marriagesHowever one should note how these affairs can involve the bhikkhu and how he should guard against becoming too drawn inVenUdaayin caused this rule to be set down because he involved himself in arranging many marriages and liaisonsWhen some of these failed they blamed him for the failureThe offence is summarizedA bhikkhu should not officiate at weddings except perhaps to chant a blessing afterwards and encourage the newly married couple to lead virtuous and faithful lives together based in generosity virtue and meditationHe also has to be circumspect when counselling couples A bhikkhu not only has to be impeccable but also must be seen to be soHe sets an example for everyone and therefore must be beyond reproachAny doubtful situations have to be clarified which is how the next rules came aboutSome knowledge of these rules may also help to explain the sometimes seemingly antisocial attitude of some bhikkhusThere are two aspects to these particular rules physical closeness and private conversationIf a woman sees a monk who is sitting alone and she wants to sit close to him or she wants to have a onetoone conversation with him the following rules have to be taken into accountFirst the rules dealing with intimate proximityThe Two Aniyata Indefinite or Undetermined Cases were formulated after VenUdaayin went to visit a recently married young womanHe sat privately with her in a secluded place just the two of them talking about worldly affairsThe respected female layfollower Visaakhaa saw them sitting there and said to VenUdaayin This is improper VenSir and unsuitable that the master should sit in private like thisAlthough VenSir the master may have no desire for sexual intercourse there are unbelieving people who are difficult to convinceThe Buddha therefore set this downThe Second Indefinite Offence is similar to the first except that the place is less secluded and therefore not suitable for sexual intercourse although it could still be grounds for the other sexual offences such as addressing a woman with lewd wordsWhen a bhikkhu intentionally sits alone with a woman in a secluded or private place it can lead on to more intimate behavior or at least to misunderstandings from unexpected onlookersTo preclude such problems a bhikkhu needs a companion or chaperoneA secluded place is where a monk and women can sit on a seat together in a place that is hidden from view and out of earshot for example a private room or behind a wall or hedgeIn such circumstances a man or boy old enough to understand what is inappropriate conduct must be also present as chaperoneTherefore if a woman  or women for according to this particular rule it does not matter how many there are  sees a bhikkhu sitting alone in such a very secluded place she should remember about this rule and not go and sit with him but await a more suitable time or find a male to act as chaperoneA less secluded but still private place would be for example a bench in a deserted park or a glassedin porch or any other place that is private but not secluded enough for sexual intercourseIn this case the Commentary allows the chaperone to be either male or female but they must be someone who knows what is and what is not lewd and they must be within sight However if the monk and woman talk together the chaperone must be male because of the relevant rule about that The following Confession Rules connect with the above Indefinite Rules The fortyfourth Confession Offence originated when the husband of a woman denounced VenUpananda for sitting alone in a secluded place with his wifeThe rulingThe next Confession Offence follows on with VenUpananda this time being caught sitting alone with the mans wife in a private place This time the ruling isTherefore as with the Indefinite Offences above there needs to be a chaperone present The previous rules dealt with physical proximity whereas this next rule concerns a bhikkhu and woman talking aloneIt might appear strange that a rule should completely forbid confidential interviews with a bhikkhu aloneYet if one reflects on how things have regularly gone wrong with such private spiritual counselling it is easier to see that being safe is better than sorry  for the sake of everyone involvedEven if their conduct is completely pure it still may lead to rumour and criticismThe seventh Confession offence arose when VenUdaayin went to visit lay supportersHe sat close to the mother of the family at the front door teaching her Dhamma in a quiet confidential manner and then approached the daughterinlaw who was by the side door and spoke to her in the same wayBoth women mistakenly thought that he was flirting with the other and criticized him saying that Dhamma should be given in a clear and open wayAs a result the Buddha eventually laid down thatThere are different interpretations as to exactly what is meant by six sentences for the Paali word vaacaa can mean word saying or speech Even if there are many women but no other man it is still considered an offence One can see from the origin of this rule that the point is not that women cannot be taught Dhamma but that it should be done in a way that is completely open and above misinterpretation The next rule deals with the proximity of bhikkhus and women at nightThere are different interpretations of this rule and as it is a frequently asked question extra translations with some discussion will be includedThis rule originally arose when VenAnuruddha  one of the most highly accomplished disciples of the Buddha  was traveling and asked the woman who owned a travelers rest house if he could stay the nightShe readily agreed and when more travelers arrived and VenAnuruddha let them share the room she invited him to come and sleep inside insteadShe had however become infatuated with him and tried to seduce himWhen she saw that VenAnuruddha was completely unmoved she came to her senses and asked his forgivenessVenAnuruddha then gave her a Dhamma talk which so delighted her that she took refuge in the Triple GemHere are several translationsIf a bhikkhu sleeps in a place where there is a surrounding wall and under the same roof with a woman even for one night it is  A monk who lies down with a female in the same building under the same roof and within walls which are complete or almost complete commits  Lying down at the same time in the same lodging with a woman is  There are complications concerning how this rule should be applied to modern conditions for exampleHouses in tropical climates are often constructed without the system of doors and rooms found in colder climates hence the importance of this ruleBhikkhus obliged to stay in a Westerntype house with lockable rooms in places where no exists as must sometimes happen during Dhammaduta work will hardly be included here The Commentary further explains that when there are many rooms in a single building  such as in a block of flats or apartments  the same sleeping place is only those rooms which have a common entranceIt continues by explaining that an entrance is where one washes ones feet before entering a set of roomsNow each flatapartment usually has a doormat on which one wipes ones feet before entering the flatapartment and therefore following the Commentary the doormat marks the entrance of a single samesleepingplace In other words separate flatsapartments become separate sleeping places for the purposes of this ruleSo there are different interpretations as to exactly what is meant by same place For example does a locked door make a room a separate placeThe Commentary suggests that if a building is divided into units that are not connected and each has a separate entrance then each unit counts as a place Therefore apartment blocks would be allowableAnd hospitalsIn the West where there are few monasteries visiting bhikkhus have to decide how to follow these rulesIt is not just a question of being strict but also about how it looks to lay peopleWill they be suspicious about a bhikkhu staying too close to womenHow will they feel if he stays in an expensive hotel roomA good standard is probablyThe next point to deal with is that of a bhikkhu traveling with a womanThis is also a very practical question and is often asked aboutIn the Buddhas time a bhikkhu was about to set out on a journey when he met a woman who has just quarreled with her husbandShe asked where he was going and if she could accompany himHe agreedThe husband then appeared searching for his wifeHe heard that she had gone off with a monk and assumed that they were lovers so when he caught up with the pair he thrashed the bhikkhu before explanations could be madeWhen the husband realized his mistake he apologized to the bhikkhuTherefore this rule was set down Modern practice differs according to the Community so lay women should bear this rule in mind when arranging transport for bhikkhus or going to the same place as themReluctance by a bhikkhu to arrange such journeys might also be explained by this ruleThe term bhikkhu is defined as almsman or mendicant He is one who depends on others for his material needsThis relationship of right livelihood incurs responsibilities the bhikkhu must receive and use offerings in the right way whereas the lay devotee should make material offerings in the right way and receive Dhamma teachings in the right wayThe lay person gives material support which the bhikkhu properly receives and uses in his Dhammapractice so he can eventually reciprocate with the highest of gifts  DhammaThe proper needs of a bhikkhu and how they are supplied is extensively covered in the Vinaya RuleIf all bhikkhus were enlightened we obviously would need few guidelinesHowever most monks are still in the process of learning how to completely to eradicate greed anger and delusion so possessions misused can easily lead to unskillful states of mindThe Buddha said that there were four necessities of life  clothing food lodging and medicine  and that they have to be treated properlyProperly considering the robe I use it simply to ward off cold to ward off heat to ward off the touch of flies mosquitoes simply for the purpose of covering the parts of the body that cause shameProperly considering almsfood I use it not playfully nor for intoxication nor for putting on weight nor for beautification but simply for the survival and continuance of this body for ending its afflictions for the support of the chaste life I will destroy old feelings and not create new feelingsThus I will maintain myself be blameless and live in comfortProperly considering the lodging I use it simply to ward off cold to ward off heat to ward off the touch of flies mosquitoes wind sun and reptiles simply for protection from the inclemencies of weather and for the enjoyment of seclusionProperly considering medicinal requisites for curing the sick I use them simply to ward off any pains of illness that have arisen and for the maximum freedom from disease Clothing food shelter and medicine are necessary whether one is a lay person or a bhikkhuThe bhikkhu however should take a completely balanced stance towards these fundamentalsAdvertising and the latest fashion should not draw him for he should be solely concerned with simplicity and lack of attachment towards thingsIt seems that the original requisites were basics that wandering bhikkhus could conveniently carry around for example an alms bowl three robes a sitting cloth a needlecase and a waist bandHowever extra allowances were gradually given as the need arose for instance a water filter a razor and its sheath the stone and strop for sharpening it and then articles such as an umbrella and sandalsLater the commentaries allowed other similar itemsThe Buddha made it clear that bhikkhus should avoid begging if possibleHe gave this story about beggingA bhikkhu came to the Lord Buddha and complained about a great flock of noisy birds that came to roost at night in the forest surrounding his abodeThe Buddha suggested that if he wanted them to go away he should go many times throughout the night and beg a feather from each birdThe birds thinking that monk wants a feather and another and another left the forest and never returnedThe Buddha then explained that begging and hinting were unpleasant even to common animals how much more so to human beingsA bhikkhu who is constantly begging for things displays his greedy state of mindNo one likes to see this and lay supporters may start by criticizing him and then turn to blaming his Community or even the Buddhas TeachingThe Buddha therefore set down many rules to guide the bhikkhus about what is proper conductNormally a bhikkhu will not ask for thingsInstead he will wait for something to be offeredThis is exemplified in the alms round where the bhikkhu makes no request does not even look at people although he may quietly wait to see if an offering is to be made before moving onOne way that lay people enable a bhikkhu to ask them for help is by making an invitation or pavaaranaaThe Buddha allowed a bhikkhu to accept pavaaranaa or invitation Such an invitation is made when lay people decide to commit themselves to supplying medicines if a particular bhikkhu should ever become ill or it can be a broader offer of helpTherefore if lay people meet a bhikkhu who seems worthy of help and support they may make such an invitationQuite a number of the rules deal with what and how much may be asked for when a donor makes this formal invitationAn invitation can therefore be quite specific about what is being offered and how long that invitation will lastA clear invitation will also help prevent misunderstandingsFor instance the bhikkhu will know exactly what has been offered and so will not ask for more than that and the lay person will not be overwhelmed by extravagant requestsThe original circumstances of the fortyseventh Confession Offence were as followsA lay supporter possessed much medicinal ghee so he invited the monks to make use of it during the following four monthsMuch of the medicine was still left so he extended his invitation for another four months and then extended it for lifeThe Buddha allowed thisHowever that same lay donor had once criticized the groupofsix monks because of their previous improper conduct so they decided to take their revenge by asking him for an impossibly large amount of medicine and then criticized him when he could not immediately produce what he had promisedThis rule was set downWhen the invitation is more vague  for example a lay person may just say If you need anything Bhante let me know  the bhikkhu should not exceed the spirit of the invitationIn fact some communities consider that an invitation in which the lay person does not mention any time limit is valid only for four months and that taking up the invitation beyond that time is an offenceA bhikkhu is always allowed to ask for requisites from his relatives without having formal invitation firstRelatives are considered to be those with whom the bhikkhu has common ancestors back through seven generations on both the mothers and fathers sideHere inlaws are not counted as relativesThe ideal possessions of the bhikkhu are just his basic requisites three main robes alms bowl waistband needle and thread razor and water filterThe alms bowl can be made from clay or iron but must be properly fired to harden it and rustproof itThree bowlsizes are mentioned small medium and largeThere are also several rules about begging for a new bowl before ones old one is worn out which entails forfeiture of the wrongly acquired bowlThe waistband became necessary when a monks skirtrobe fell down while he was in a villageThe needle and thread are needed for patching and repairing the robes  and many teachers instruct that it is a wrongdoing for a monk not to repair them the same dayWhile the razor became necessary whenThe water filter is needed to avoid killing small creatures in drinking waterHowever most bhikkhus will have more than this  ranging from everyday items like soap and toothpaste candles and matches pen and books a watch or clock a flashlight or torch to more sophisticated things appropriate to their environmentThe principle is that such things should not be luxurious or expensiveAnything that is given to him is his to keep and he is allowed to give his things away if it is done in the right way and does not cause the donors faith to declineDisposal or appropriation of anything owned by the Community or belonging to the monastery is strictly controlled and is covered by the rules that follow in the next sectionAfter a bhikkhu dies his possessions will normally revert to the SanghaWhen a bhikkhu receives a general gift there are two rules to guard against his misdirecting itThe first of these rules arose when a guild was preparing to make an offering of a meal and some cloth to the whole Community whereupon the groupofsix bhikkhus arrived and pressured the donors into giving the cloth to them insteadShould any bhikkhu knowingly divert to himself gains that had been intended for a Community it is  Gains here refers to robes alms food abodes and medicines and other allowable thingsgifts dedicated as offerings to the Sangha but not yet offeredA bhikkhu diverts such gifts to himself by asking directly for them or by roundabout speech so that the donor will give them to himIn the above rule the wrongly obtained gift must be forfeited to another bhikkhuThe following rule complements the one above but is an offence of ConfessionAs has been mentioned above the Buddha said that there were four necessities for life  Clothing Food or edibles Shelter or lodging and Medicine  so we will use those divisions in the following sections There is also a Sutta where it is mentioned that bhikkhus do not accept gifts of gardens paddyfields and other sorts of land or draught animals and other sorts of animals etcThe basic clothing that the Buddha originally suggested for a bhikkhu was made from discarded cloth sewn together and dyedAfter sewing the pieces together they were just large rectangular pieces of cloth worn wraparound styleIn the beginning it seems that there were two robes a sarong skirtlike robe tied with a belt and a robe to cover the upper part of the bodyWhen the cold weather required more protection the Buddha allowed a third robe which was a doublethickness outer robeSome rules limit the size of robes because cloth in India in those days was expensive due to the simple methods of spinning and weavingAlso so that the robe would not be worth stealing the cloth always had to be cut into panels that were then sewn together based on the design of paddy fields seen from a mountainAfter having received an offering of white cloth and having properly cut and sewn the panels together the bhikkhu must dye it to produce the yellow robe Traditionally vegetable dyes were used in this processDifferent plants and woods when boiled up will produce slightly different shades of dye color  the Paali text calls the standard color kaasaaya or kaasaava translated as duncolored dyewater  so there is some varietyWhen bhikkhus from different communities come together their different shades of yellowdyed robes makes this very noticeableSlightly varied styles of wearing the traditional set of three robes have developed over the years in different countriesBut basically the rectangular shaped robe is put around the body and the two vertical edges are folded or rolled togetherThen either it is tucked in and secured with a belt or for the larger outer robes the edge is thrown or flicked over the left shoulder and pinched under the left arm so that it will not slip offThere are various techniques for thisIn the Lord Buddhas time it was a sign of respect to bare ones right shoulderTherefore when in the monastery the bhikkhu will normally wear his outer robe with the right shoulder visibleOn leaving the monastery for inhabited areas he must cover both shouldersIn addition to this required set of the triple robe which every bhikkhu must have and look after there are extra cloths that can be used occasionallyThe month following the three months of the Rains Retreat  sometime in the OctoberNovember period  is the traditional Kathina time for renewing bhikkhus robesIn ancient times this was when bhikkhus would help one another in handsewing cloth into new robes  using the special wooden kathina frameThis is the time when lay supporters often make a special offering of cloth and other requisites to all the monks at a particular monasteryA sewing machine is normally used but all the monks still try to help in the marking out cutting sewing or dying processThe cloth has to be offered sewn and dyed so that it is a finished robe and ready to wear within the same dayIf this procedure is carried through correctly the bhikkhus are then entitled to special allowances for the next few monthsThe Kathina Ceremony is optional and requires a quorum of five bhikkhusIt has however generally become an important festival and almsgiving occasion As has been mentioned above the Buddha said that there were four necessities of life clothing food shelter and medicineThe Buddha suggested that the basic source of food for bhikkhus was that received on the morning alms roundThis daily dependence on alms food reminds both the bhikkhus and the lay devotees of their interdependence and prevents the bhikkhu from becoming too isolated from the lay communityHe meets them every day and eats the food that they share with himSeveral important rules are concerned with this as well as a major section of the Sekhiya Training rulesAn alms round is not considered begging for the bhikkhu does not solicit anything but is ready mindfully to receive any alms that lay people may wish to giveAlthough alms food may sometimes be meager the bhikkhu is always expected to be grateful for whatever he is givenIt is surprising how particular we can be about what food we like to eat and what complications that can causeThis is reflected in the way rules concerning edibles are arranged which may seem very complex especially when the bhikkhus life is supposed to be so simpleIt should be borne in mind that the rules often deal with extraordinary circumstances and try to prevent them from becoming the normWhen the groupofsix monks in the Buddhas time solicited special foods and ate them themselves the lay people criticized this saying Who isnt fond of good food and sweets The Buddha therefore laid down this ruleThere are these finer staple foods ie ghee fresh butter oil honey sugarmolasses fish meat fresh milk and curdsShould any bhikkhu who is not ill having asked for finer staple foods such as these for his own sake then eat them it is  There are sumptuous foods namely foods mixed with ghee butter oil honey molasses fish meat milk and curd and a monk who though not sick asks for such sumptuous foods for himself and eats them commits  The ancient commentators suggest that these finer foods are actually made when one mixes rice for example with butter or fish etcAn exception is made for a monk who is ill and a bhikkhu can ask for special food for the sake of a fellow monk who is sickHe is always allowed to ask a relative or someone who has offered a Pavaaranaa InvitationA whole section of the seventyfive Sekhiya Training guidelines is concerned with how a bhikkhu receives and eats his alms foodAlthough table manners may differ from country to country and from age to age these Sekhiya rules still largely conform to what is considered good mannersI will receive alms food appreciatively When receiving alms food I will focus my attention on the bowl  This explains why the bhikkhu may not look at the donor when accepting food  he is concentrating on properly receiving itIt is suggested that this was laid down so that bhikkhus on alms round would not pass by people offering plain rice in favor of better quality food However on festival or special occasions the bhikkhus bowl may be emptied so that everyone who wants to join in offering has the opportunity This is also why the bhikkhu should not be expected to talk while he is eating for this will distract his attentionIf donors think that the monk has only plain rice in his bowl they may give him some better foodOther Sekhiya rules seem aimed at bhikkhus eating from their bowl using their fingers in the traditional way of IndiaI will not make up an overlarge mouthful of food nor open my mouth until the portion of food has been brought to it nor put my fingers into my mouth nor speak with my mouth fullI will not eat stuffing out my cheeks shaking my hand about scattering grains of rice about putting out my tongue making a champing sound making a sucking sound licking my hands scraping the bowl licking my lipsI will not take hold of a vessel of water with my hand soiled with food In the West the first meal of the day is breakfast For the bhikkhu this is literally true for he will not have taken any food since the previous morningFood intake is limited to the hours between dawn and noonThe practice of not eating in the afternoon is a very old tradition mentioned in the earliest SuttasIt is also included in the Ten Precepts of the novice and dasasiila mata nun and the Eight Precepts of the lay devoteeFood here refers to things like cooked grains sweets made from flour beans etc fish meat fresh milk and sour milk fruits tubers and all main course foodsWhen these staple foods go beyond their time limit a bhikkhu will incur an offence if he consumes themThe original story shows the complications that can arise from leaving the monastery at the wrong timeThe groupofseventeen bhikkhus  another set of frequent misdoers  went out one afternoon to enjoy themselves at a festival outside the cityWhen lay people saw them they gave them a meal and food to take back to the monasteryThe Buddha therefore laid down this rule This wrong time is defined to be from noon until dawn the following dayA bhikkhu is still at fault even if he genuinely miscalculates the time or mistakes an item of food for a medicine Therefore if donors are preparing food for a bhikkhu they should be careful that they are not late in offering it so that the meal can be finished before noonIt is also noteworthy that an ill bhikkhu has no exemption from this rule so he likewise should not take food in the afternoonAny nutriment that a bhikkhu puts into his mouth is classified in four groups which specify the time limits during which he can consume or store themWhen different kinds of edibles are mixed their category will usually change to that with the shortest life spanFor example ginger can be used as a herbal lifetime medicine for stomach ailmentsHowever gratedginger that has been used for food preparation is classed as food and therefore should not be kept overnight or used as a medicineLikewise if honey is used as a solvent or base for herbal medicines because the honey has a sevenday limit that lifetime medicine becomes a sevenday medicine This is another reason that bhikkhus may be careful about the ingredients of medicines that are offeredWhen offering medicines the donor should try to be aware of what the bhikkhu considers allowable and what will cause him to fall into offenceWe have already mentioned the bhikkhus alms round and his dependence on receiving food from lay supportersBut how is the gift made and how is it properly receivedThis is accomplished in quite a formal way yet it can still be confusing to lay devotees for different monks receive an offering in slightly different waysThe rule that explains about formally having to make an offering to bhikkhus arose when a certain bhikkhu lived in a charnel ground wearing robes made from rags collected from thereHe also subsisted on the food left for departed spirits by relatives of the dead personThe lay people criticized him wrongly suspecting he might also be feeding on human flesh so the Buddha set down this ruleShould a bhikkhu take into his mouth an edible that has not been given  except for water and toothcleaning sticks  it is A monk who puts in his mouth any nutriment which has not been proffered to him commits  Present day practice regarding this rule varies so much because of the intricacy of interpretationHowever usually anything that goes into the mouth  food or medicines  should be properly givenThat means it should begiven by means of the body or by something attached to the body or by throwinggiven so that the donor and the bhikkhu are within arms reach of each otherreceived by means of the body or by something attached to the bodyThe Commentaries then further expand the details of the correct way that food should be giventhe offered food should not be so heavy that an average size man cannot lift itIn many communities this has led to the food having to be literally lifted into the monks hands or onto his receiving clothThe Commentary allows it to be slid along the floor or table into the monks handsthe donor must actually move the food towards the bhikkhuThis has also been understood as meaning that the donor makes a gesture when making the offeringHowever in the West this gesture of respect may be taken according to local customIn some monasteries food is not considered properly given if the lay person wears shoes or sandals when offering to a barefooted bhikkhuAlso in some communities when properly offered food is touched again or moved by lay people even accidentally it has to be reoffered The major point to remember is that in offering food to a monk there is a formal way of doing so  otherwise the bhikkhu may not be able to eat itOnce one gets used to this interaction with the monk it becomes quite a meaningful gestureAfter formally receiving food a bhikkhu is not allowed to store it away for another dayThis is another rule that supports the mendicant ideal and the interdependence of monk and lay person and stops the bhikkhu from becoming attached to his favorite tastesThe case originally arose when a monk coming back from alms round would eat some food and then dry any remaining rice in the sun to store for the next days mealsIn this way he did not have to go on an alms round every dayIt can be summarizedAfter the daily meal  often the monks of the community will gather to share this  all that days excess food may be distributed among whoever is present so that nothing is wasted or left overLay people themselves are also allowed to deposit food in the properly approved storeroom so that it can be offered to the monks on another dayIf the lay people store it there the monks will not be counted as having formally received itIt is traditional for lay devotees on special occasions to invite bhikkhus to go and have a meal at their houseThis is normally a very straightforward matter and the bhikkhu will explain if they are able to go on that particular dayTo show some aspects from the Buddhas time there are these rules The origin of this first rule displays the care that a bhikkhu should take when accepting such an invitationA poor workman was inspired to invite the Buddha and all the bhikkhus of the town for a meal and he insisted they still come even when the Buddha cautioned him about the large number of monks involvedSome bhikkhus assumed that he would not be able to afford very much food so they first went on an alms round and ate beforehandTherefore when they came to go for the poor mans meal they could not eat very much  even though there was in fact plenty of food because other people had helped to support the poor workmans faith by sending round donations of foodThe poor workman became upset saying How can you eat elsewhere am I not competent to give sufficientThe rule is summarized Should a bhikkhu seem somewhat reluctant to accept your invitation be aware that he may not be able to change his acceptance of a previous invitationThere is however an allowance for the bhikkhu to share or transfer his invitation to another bhikkhu or novice so that he can accept a new oneEven so it is considered good manners first to contact the original donors about thisAnother rather obscure rule about meal invitations originated like thisVenDevadatta attempted to take over the Sangha and then tried to kill the BuddhaThe Sangha informed the local inhabitants about VenDevadattas behavior so that it would not reflect on the Sangha as a wholeVenDevadatta then found alms so difficult to obtain that he solicited alms  having asked and asked  and the lay people criticized them for such unseemly conductIt seems that this rather enigmatic rule may forbid bhikkhus from accepting an invitation to a group meal of four or more specified monks at a donors house when the whole local community is not invited  as would have been more normal in the Buddhas daysThis would then have avoided the forming of cliques inside a communityThe Buddha therefore laid down thatAnother interpretation of this obscure rule requires that bhikkhus If the community lives by this second interpretation one should be careful when inviting bhikkhus for a meal not to mention the specific food that one intends to offerIn western countries vegetarianism has recently increased in popularity and this has led to some questioning about bhikkhus and meateatingThe question of monks eating meat is an old one that was originally raised by the renegade monk VenDevadattaHe asked the Buddha to prohibit bhikkhus from eating fish and flesh in what seems was a ploy to take over the leadership of the SanghaThe Buddha had already made a strict rule for both bhikkhus and lay people about not taking life so He did not agree to VenDevadattas new formulationThe Buddha did allow bhikkhus to eat meat and fish except under the following circumstancesIf a bhikkhu is given meat on alms round and he has no knowledge about how the animal died he has to receive it with attentiveness He should be grateful and recollect that the food he is given is what enables him to continue to live the bhikkhu life and that as a mendicant he is not in a position to choose what he getsIf he later comes to know the family and they ask him about Dhamma he will be able to explain the precept about not killingThis may cause them to reflect on their attitude to meat eatingAn individual lay person can choose whether to be a vegetarianProblems usually arise only when vegetarians want to impose their choice on others and as meal times are normally a family or shared affair this can create tensions and misunderstandingsAn individual bhikkhu who lives on alms food cannot make such choicesOften the donors are unknown  perhaps not even Buddhist or just starting to find out about Dhamma  and to refuse their generosity may so offend them that they never have anything to do with Dhamma againFinally it comes down to the lay people who go to the market to buy food to give to the bhikkhusIf they are vegetarian themselves or like to give vegetarian food then the bhikkhu should receive that food with appreciation  especially if it means that fewer animals are being slaughteredNevertheless it should not become a political issue where other people are attacked for their behaviorAt the time of the Buddha some lay people complained that the monks had destroyed the life in seedsDestroying seeds therefore became a minor offence and the monk had to ask the lay people whether they found it allowable for him to eat certain fruitsFruits with seeds that can germinate and roots that can be planted again should be made allowable or kappiya for bhikkhusAn unordained person can do this by touching it with fire by drawing a knife over it or by marking it with a finger nailIn some monasteries there is a ceremony  briefly mentioned in the actual Vinaya but given in detail in the Commentaries  where the lay person offering the fruit makes it allowable for the bhikkhu to eatFor example this may be done with an orange by slightly cutting the peel when the monk says Kappiyam karohi and answering him with Kappiyam BhanteIf there are many oranges and if they are all together and touching making one fruit allowable makes them all allowableit is considered already allowableThere is no need for this ceremony with seedless fruit with fruit if the seeds are unripe so that they cannot regenerate and with fruit offered already cut with all the seeds removedAlso if the bhikkhu carefully eats certain sorts of fruits  for instance mangoes jackfruit plums peaches prunes etc without damaging the seed stone pit or pips there is no offenceThe following rule again shows the interdependence and care which must be cultivated between bhikkhus and those who support themIn the Buddhas time some ladies were ambushed and raped on their way to give food to bhikkhus living in a dangerous jungle areaTheir family criticized the bhikkhus for not warning them of the hazardsIf lay people intend to give food to a bhikkhu in such a danger zone then they must announce that to the bhikkhu beforehand so that the bhikkhu has a chance to warn them or reduce the threatThe rule can be summarizedThe above sections have dealt with food but as has been already mentioned fruit juices are considered under a different categoryAlthough bhikkhus should not eat fruit  which is food  after midday they can drink the fruit juice any time throughout the dayHowever they cannot store fruit juice beyond that single dayThis is called yaamakaalika and is a juicedrink made from crushed fruit which is then carefully strained of any pulp or particlesCommentary suggests that it could not be stored beyond the next dawn because sugar mixed in with the fruit juice might lead to slight fermentationWhen offering fruit juice it is important that it is well strained so that no pulp or fruit particles remain for the fruit itself counts as food and so cannot be consumed in the afternoonSome places in Thailand will strain the juice in a cloth filter seven times to make sure but the main point is that the filter is fine enoughSome communities will not accept fruit juice made from large fruitsWe have dealt above with food and fruit juiceThere is now the category of tonicmedicinesThese can be consumed at any time but cannot be stored longer than seven daysThese tonicmedicines were originally regulated when Venerable Pilindavacchas great feats of psychic power made him so famous that he received many offerings of the five tonics Even though he distributed these among other monks there was so much that the excess had to be stored away and their dwellings were overrun by ratsVisiting lay people criticized the monks for storing up goods in abundance like a king The Buddha therefore set down this rule There are various translations and interpretations about these tonic medicines  according to different Communities and different countriesSome places consider only liquids allowable while a few communities will drink only plain water in the afternoonSome communities will not accept reoffered tonicmedicines some will under certain circumstancesTherefore lay devotees need to enquire about the practice of their local Community and follow that waySome contemporary observationsThe five medicines  ghee navaniitam oil honey and suga  were allowed by the Buddha to be consumed by sick monks at any time of the day or nightAccording to the Mahaavagga these five were agreed upon as medicines and although they served as nutriment for people were not considered as substantial food The degree of infirmity required before a monk is allowed to consume these medicines is a controversial point It seems that feeling rundown or feeling tired after physical exertion would be sufficient cause to be able to make use of the Five MedicinesThe main effectiveness of these medicines seems to be in their nutritional valueThey do not have medicinal value as commonly understood today for example relieving pain or as an antisepticHowever as nutriment they would help to maintain bodily strength and assist in recuperation while since they are so rich would not be a substitute for normal food Also if the tonicmedicine is mixed with a tiny amount of food then it would be acceptable according to this allowanceIf the flour is for more foodlike reasons then it would be counted as foodSee also Mixing Edibles aboveThe fourth category of edibles is that of Lifetime Medicineswhich includes what we generally think of as medicinesThe basic principle set down by the Buddha about all medicines is in this reflectionIn the beginning the basic medicines allowed by the Buddha were those pickled in urineLater nearly all other types came to be considered allowableMedicines that may be consumed without time limitation are called yaavajiivikaThe Texts mention different sorts of herbal medicines such as plant roots eg ginger turmeric sweet flag etc decoctions such as of the neem or nuxvomica treeleaves such as neemleaves tulsi or holy basil fruits such as long peppers myrobalan wormwood resins such as asafoetida salts such as seasalt rock salt etcAny other medicine or herbs similar to these that is not reckoned to be food is included under this lifetime category Modern western medicines are usually included  using the Great Standards  under this category and therefore can be taken at any time of the day and kept as long as necessaryFinally we turn to those substances of abuse that are entirely prohibitedThe fifth of the Five Precepts for all Buddhists is restraint from drinking alcohol and similar substances that destroy mindfulness and are thereby a frequent cause of unskillful actions and speechThe equivalent rule for bhikkhus is the fiftyfirst Confession RuleThe originstory concerns VenSaagata who conquered a fierce naaga  a type of serpent with magical powers  by his meditationdeveloped psychic powersThe townspeople heard about this feat and wanted to make some sort of offering to him upon which the groupofsix bhikkhus impudently suggested that they all should give him alcoholWhen he arrived on his almsround every household offered alcohol and he finally collapsed drunk at the town gate and had to be carried back to the monasteryHe was laid down in a stupor with his head towards the Buddha but in his drunkenness he turned around so that his feet pointed at the BuddhaThe Buddha called attention to his changed behavior remarking that he certainly could not oppose even a salamander in such a stateThe Buddha also said The Four Great Standards may be further used to argue that using narcotics  which also destroy mindfulness and lead to heedlessness  would also be an offence of ConfessionThen there is the general principle of respecting the law of the land so such illegal drugs would be disallowed anywayStealing is universally condemned and is prohibited by one of the basic Five Precepts of any BuddhistFor the bhikkhu it is covered by the heaviest penalty of Defeat being the second PaaraajikaThe rule was originally set down in the Lord Buddhas time when Venerable Dhaniya by deception carried off some of the kings timber to make himself a hutDefeat means the absolute termination of the perpetrators bhikkhulife so his stealing should be more than a petty theftTherefore for this to be an offence the value of the stolen object must be such that as it states in the original kings would banish him saying You are a thief In modern America this is probably equivalent to grand larceny or one of wrongdoingThe bhikkhu must have an intention to steal for this to be an offenceIf an apparent theft happens without his knowledge or connivance or by mistake without any design on his part it is no offenceHowever fraud breach of trust embezzlement tax evasion smuggling breach of copyright etc would be included under this ruleThere are many other important rules covering how bhikkhus deal with wealth and moneyor dasasiila mata nun These came to be set down because donations coming from a lay devotees faith in Dhamma might on misoccasion lead to the corrupting of the bhikkhulifeAlthough these rules might seem relatively straightforward there are various interpretations and ways of actual practiceAnd the practice often does not coincide with the theoryYet it certainly remains a very important aspect of Vinaya guarding against forgetfulness of the real way to happinessBhikkhus in abandoning the use of money make real their abandonment of worldly pursuits and show others by example that the struggle for wealth is not the true way to find happiness The rule about a bhikkhu not accepting money came to be made when VenUpananda went to visit his regular supporters on alms roundThe meat that had been set aside for him that morning had instead been given to the familys hungry sonThe householder wished to give something else to make up for it and asked what he could offer to the value of a kahaapana coinVenUpananda inquired if he was making a gift of a kahaapana coin to him and then took the money awayLay people were disgusted with this saying Just as we lay people accept money so too do these Buddhist monksThis Rule has been variously translatedShould any bhikkhu take gold and silver or have it taken or consent to its being deposited it is to be forfeited and confessedShould any bhikkhu pick up or cause to be picked up or consent to the deposit of gold or silver this entails Confession with Forfeiture A monk who accepts gold or money or gets another to accept for him or acquiesces in its being put near him commits  If a bhikkhu himself receives gold and silver or gets someone else to receive it or if he is glad about money that is being kept for him it is  Note that there are some subtle differences in the way that the rule is translated especially in the last exampleAccording to the Commentary there is no consent if a bhikkhu refuses to accept the money by word  telling the donor that it is not proper to receive money by deed  gesturing to that effect by thought  thinking that this is not properThere may be a problem in communicating this to the donors without causing them offence and without the bhikkhu falling into offence himselfMany of the rules concerning money etc are those of Confession with ForfeitureThis means that the money or articles that are wrongly acquired have to be forfeitedFurthermore it is specified that they cannot be forfeited to a single monk but must be given up to the Community  who must then follow a strict procedure for disposing of those gainsIn practice this rule is understood by various bhikkhus in different waysThis ranges from some monks who seek to circumvent the rule completely by saying that papermoney is just paper and therefore not gold and silver and so falls outside the rule to the following more strict opinionsThe Paali term jaataruupa is defined as gold of any sort and while rajata is also silver in other contexts here it is defined as maasaka of different materials whatever is used in business ie moneyAt present the term would include coins and paper currency but not checks credit cards bank drafts or promissory notes as these  on their own and without further identification of the persons carrying them  do not function as true currency The term jaataruuparajata refers firstly to personal adornments secondly to ingots thirdly to ruupiya which are for buying and selling referring not only to gold and silver but anything which can be used in this wayAll the abovementioned things are included in this termThe phrase be glad at the money kept for him suggests that if it is only cittuppaada he would not so it must refer to the action of receiving it and holding the right over it For Laypeople A layperson should never offer money directly to a bhikkhu even if it is placed inside an envelope or together with other requisitesThey should either deposit the money with the monastery steward put it in a donationbox or into the monastery bank accountThey may then state their invitation to the bhikkhu regarding the kind or amount of requisiteIn Thailand for example knowledgeable laypeople would deposit money with the steward and offer to the bhikkhu an invitation note mentioning the details of the offering  Under modern conditions things other than cash also have to be consideredWhat about bhikkhus using checks or even postage stamps or phone cardsWhat is included in the rule and where does one draw the lineDifferent communities will understand these rules in slightly different ways  although probably all will find ordinary postage stamps acceptableIt seems that although credit cards and checks do not quite function in the same way as cash and therefore may not break that rule about accepting money they would still fall under another offenceSome modern opinionsAt present the term would include coins and paper currency but not checks credit cards bank drafts or promissory notes as these  on their own and without further identification of the persons carrying them  do not function as true currency Checks credit cards and travelers checks are not the same as money because commonly negotiable something that one can take into almost any shop and without any further inkwork or paperwork exchange it for whatever one desires there is no offence for receiving or holding these thingsHowever using checks credit cards and travelers checks or things similar would come under buying and selling and the offences listed under and would be likely to arise The offence is committed when the bhikkhu hands the signed credit card receipt  or has it handed  to the seller  While money is an important commodity in the world  greed and selfishness are the actual root of evil  bhikkhus should not be concerned with itTherefore this again offers an essential role for lay peopleThe bhikkhu stores no food but receives help from lay people who do the bhikkhu stores no money but receives support from lay people who doIn fact this relationship is shown in this next allowance from the Buddhas time when bhikkhus were journeying along a difficult wayFood was difficult to find and He therefore allowed them to seek provisionsHe also made another allowance sayingThere are people of conviction and confidence bhikkhus who place gold and silver in the hand of stewards saying Give the master whatever is allowable I allow you bhikkhus to accept whatever is allowable coming from thatBut in no way at all do I say that money is to be accepted or sought for People who have good faith in bhikkhus may entrust money into the hand of a and order him to purchase allowable things for bhikkhusBhikkhus may be glad at the allowable things bought by the steward with that moneyThis is not regarded as being glad at that moneyThis is called the Bhikkhus should not request suitable things from the steward in excess of the money deposited with him This is a rule which explains more about the relationship between the bhikkhu and the steward who is taking care of funds for himIn the original story VenUpanandas steward had received some money from a chief minister so that when VenUpananda needed a robe he could be supplied with oneVenUpananda eventually asked for a robe on the day when the steward had an important meeting that everyone was obliged to attend or be penalizedVenUpananda refused to wait and forced the steward to get the robe immediately so that the steward came late to the meeting and suffered a penalty fineEveryone there agreed that these monks are impatient and difficult to serve Therefore the Buddha set down this ruleIf someone sends money for the purpose of buying a robe for a bhikkhu and he wants to know who is acting as the bhikkhus attendant and if the bhikkhu wants the robe he should indicate someone connected with the monastery or an upasaka saying This person is the attendant of all the bhikkhus When he has instructed the attendant and told the bhikkhu If you want a robe tell the attendant then later that bhikkhu should go and find the attendant he may tell him I need a robe If he does not get it he may ask up to three times in allIf he still does not get the robe he may go and stand where the attendant can see him up to six timesIf he does not get it and he asks more than three times or stands more than six times and then gets it it is If after asking and standing the full amount he does not get the robe he must go and tell whoever brought the money saying That which you brought did not become available to me and he should also tell him to ask for his money back in case it should be lost Or in SummaryWhen a fund has been set up with a steward indicated by a bhikkhu Obtaining an article from the fund as a result of having prompted the steward more than the allowable number of times is   The robeprice remains the donors money but in the keeping of the bhikkhus stewardIn practice the robeprice may be used for other allowable requisitesIt is important for donors to check about the way of practice of the particular bhikkhu to whom they want to make an offeringBhikkhus who follow the Rule strictly will behave differently from those who are more relaxedThe former will be very careful with their speech concerning the acceptance of money and the intending donor has to make allowance for such indirect talkIn the Buddhas time the groupofsix bhikkhus engaged in buying and selling using moneyLay people seeing this and thinking all bhikkhus did the same started to complain saying How can these Buddhist monks buy and sell using money they are behaving just like lay people who enjoy the pleasures of the senses The rule was then set downIf a bhikkhu engages in buying and selling with money it is Obtaining gold or money through trade is   Note that there the different interpretation in the above translationsAccording to the texts this would include investing money for a monetary return or even changing money into another currencyThe rule about bhikkhus and bartering originated in the Buddhas time like thisThrough fine sewing and dyeing VenUpananda was skilled at turning rags into attractivelooking robesA wandering ascetic wanted one such robe and offered to trade his own costly quality robe for the beautifully turned out ragrobe of VenUpanandaVenUpananda asked him if he was really sure and then they agreed to the exchangeBut later the wandering ascetic changed his mind and went to VenUpananda to get his goodquality robe backVenUpananda refused to give it backThe wandering ascetic became angry and said that even lay people returned unsatisfactory bartered goodsTherefore this ruling was madeShould any bhikkhu engage in various types of trade must be forfeited and confessed In the Buddhas time a bhikkhu went to bathe in the river and found a purse of money lost by a brahmanThe owner returned and to escape having to pay the customary reward pretended that some of the money was suspiciously missingThe rule therefore prohibits a bhikkhu from picking up lost valuablesHowever there is an exception to this ruleThe qualification is that if the bhikkhu finds valuables in the monastery or in the place where he dwells he is required to pick them up and keep them safe for the ownerThis shows that it is not the object as such that is the problem  as if by not touching it one is free of it  but the care one must take that ones greed and attachment are not drawn in to contaminate the object and that one is not the victim of other peoples greedThe Commentary also prohibits bhikkhus from touching unsuitable objects which includes gold silver and valuable thingsShelter is the third of the Requisites The Buddha first suggested that the bhikkhu should normally stay at the root of a sheltering treeHowever later when the Rains Retreat period became established and bhikkhus were more settled after their wanderings through the forest lodgings or kutii came to be offered and builtThe bhikkhu may also voluntarily take on the special dhutanga practicesThese are more usually seen among forest monks and are distinctive of their way of practice for example they will delight in living in the forest in the open in caves in the cemetery or burning ground and when staying in a monastery will be happy to accept whatever lodging is offeredOriginally the kuti or lodging may not have been much more than a hut with a plaster or earthen floorRules were formulated as to their size and luxuryFor example the sixth Sanghaadisesa Rule  remember that this is the second most serious category of rules requiring a formal meeting of the Community  arose when bhikkhus were having extravagant huts built for themselvesThey had no sponsors and were therefore begging materials from lay people saying again and again Give me this give me that The people became burdened by all this begging and when they saw the bhikkhus any bhikkhus coming they would run away and hideThe Commentary explains that it must be quite a permanent structure to come under this rulingDepending on how long one understands the ancient measure of the sugataspan to be the kuti or hut should not be more than approximately bymetresThe commentarial tradition would put it three times this sizeBhikkhus are allowed to have a low bed on which to sleep and a stool on which to sit in order to prevent dampness from the earthen floor but often where the lodgings are wooden floored the bhikkhu will sleep on the floor on an ordinary sleeping matIn cold climates this may have to be adjusted using the Great StandardsAvoiding high and luxurious beds is also a feature of the Eight Precepts for lay people temporarily living the celibate lifeThe bhikkhus life should be wholly preparing him to gain insight into DhammaOnly then will he have the wisdom to communicate anything of real value to others when the time is appropriate and the audience properly receptiveTeaching Dhamma however is not easyIf it is badly done it can cause more misunderstanding than understandingThe fourth Confession Rule came to be set down when the groupofsix monks taught Dhamma to lay people by rote which caused the lay followers to feel disrespect for the monksIf a bhikkhu teaches Dhamma to an unordained person repeating it together word by word it is  To rehearse the Dhamma word by word was the method to teach others to memorize when there were no booksThis method was formerly used in temples and popularly known by the name studying books in the evening The aim of prohibiting pronouncing together is clearly shown in the original story of this trainingrule which was to prevent the pupils from looking down on the teacher Sixteen of the Sekhiya Training rules set down how and to whom a bhikkhu should teach DhammaThese rules are also concerned with the etiquette of showing respect respect not only for the bhikkhu but more importantly for the Dhamma that he is teachingThese rules prohibit a bhikkhu from teaching anyone he considers to be showing disrespect to the DhammaHere is a summary of these Sekhiya TrainingsI will not teach Dhamma to someone who is not sick but who has an umbrella a wooden stick weapon in their hand is wearing sandalsshoes is in a vehicle is on a bed is sitting clasping the knees has a head wrapping whose head is covered who is sitting on a seat while I am sitting on the ground who is sitting on a high seat while I am sitting on a low seat who is sitting while I am standing who is walking in front of me while I am walking behind who is walking on a pathway while I am walking beside the pathway How these rules are observed may diverge in different communitiesSome will strictly follow the above while others will be more flexible according to modern conditionsAs Venerable Brahmavangso remarksThese Sekhiyas ensure that one teaches Dhamma only to an audience which shows respectOne may not expound from a soapbox in the marketplace to the indifference of passers byHowever it is common these days in the West for a seated audience wearing their shoes and maybe even a hat to respectfully listen to a speaker standing at a lectern and as the audience is considered to be behaving respectfully according to the prevailing norms there seems no reason why a monk may not teach Dhamma in such a situation If a bhikkhu lies about his spiritual attainments it may be ground for the offence of Defeat The originating circumstances for this Rule occurred during a famine when food was scarce and many bhikkhus found alms food difficult to obtainA group of these monks devised a scheme where they told lay people of each others attainments of superior human states often deliberately lying to impress themThe faithful lay people gave alms to such special bhikkhus thinking that it would bring greater merit so they and their families went without food in order to feed those monksLater when the Buddha knew of this he rebuked them and described them as the worst of the Five Great Thieves  immoral monks who obtain their alms food as a robber doesHe set downA bhikkhu who boasts of which he has not in fact attained commits  Deliberately lying to another person that one has attained a superior human state is  The Commentary classes superior human states as either meditative absorption and certain psychic powers or the path and fruit leading up to NibbaanaA deliberate lie is normally an offence of Confession but this deliberate false avowal of meditative attainment is classed as the most serious Defeater OffenceThis shows how much more damaging it was considered to beWhen a gurulike bhikkhu falsely puts himself forward as enlightened his lies can be destructive not only to himself and his followers but to the whole of BuddhismIt may be hard to imagine in the present time why falsely claiming superior human conditions should be judged so severelyHowever by reflecting that bhikkhus are totally dependent upon the generosity and goodwill of believing lay people one may be able to appreciate the situation betterBy falsely claiming high spiritual attainments a bhikkhu is equivalent to a swindler or defrauder but in the worst way since this involves spiritual fraud  dealing with the most precious and profound aspects of human existenceA bhikkhu commits no offence when he has no intention to make superior claims even if it is wrongly understood or misconstrued that wayIf a bhikkhu is insane psychotically believing his own delusions of grandeur and making extravagant claims of his own enlightenment he receives exemption from any offenceThe eighth Confession rule is closely connected with this one of Defeat but there the announcement is trueEven so indulging in such disclosures to lay people requires confession especially when as in the originstory a bhikkhu does so just to obtain more almsThe Lord Buddha criticized the showing off of even genuine supernormal attainmentsTo tell an unordained person of ones actual superior human attainments is  A bhikkhu can teach in many ways not just by speechThere is the famous occasion mentioned in the Paali texts when the future righthand disciple of Buddha Saariputta first saw a bhikkhu going on alms roundSaariputta the wanderer saw VenAssaji going for alms in Raajagaha gracious his eyes downcast his every movement consummateOn seeing him the thought occurred to him Surely of those in this world who are arahants or have entered the path to arahantship this is oneWhat if I was to approach him and question him VenAssajis countenance and demeanour were a teaching so impressive that Saariputta went and became a bhikkhu and a great arahantWhen a bhikkhu goes into a public place he stands out because of the robes he wearsWhatever he does is noticed and reflects back on his community and the Sangha in generalAs Venerable Thiradhammo writesThe bhikkhu lifestyle is for the sole purpose of realizing NibbanaIn striving towards this end it was recognized that certain kinds of behavior are detrimental distracting or simply unhelpful and are also unsuitable for an almsmendicantMany kinds of improper behavior are not actually immoral but rather put energy in the wrong direction or are expressions of a careless attitudeSome kinds of behavior can lead to lay peoples loss of faith some are immature or childish some bad or ugly and some quite malicious or nasty Therefore there are a number of training rules to remind the bhikkhu about correct deportmentThe first twentysix Sekhiya Training rules cover proper behavior in public placesThey may also explain the sometimes seemingly antisocial behavior of a bhikkhu who may not look one in the face or immediately say a Good Morning Here is a selectionWhen in inhabited areas I will wear the under and upper robe properly be properly covered go well restrained as to my movements keep my eyes looking down sit with little soundWhen in inhabited areas I will not hitch up my robes go or sit laughing loudly go or sit fidgeting swing my arms shake my head put my arms akimbo cover my head with a cloth walk on tiptoe sit clasping the knees There is always an exception in the Sekhiya Training Rules for one who is ill so that a bhikkhu may for example cover his head when the weather is unbearably cold or the sun dangerously hotThe same applies to footwear which normally should not be worn in inhabited areasGoing out on the town is not appropriate for bhikkhus and is covered in several rulesThe eightyfifth Confession Rule describes how the groupofsix monks went to the village in the afternoon and sat around gossiping so that lay people compared them to householdersGoing outside the monastery was therefore regulated with this rulePersons or places of wrong resort for a bhikkhu are divided into six sortsThese are spending too much time socializing with unmarried women  widows and spinsters or with bhikkhuniisWrong resort also includes keeping company with sexaberrantswith prostitutes and going to tavernsA bhikkhu is prohibited from going to see and hear dancing singing and musicThis is similar to the Eight and Ten PreceptsIn the Buddhas time one could only hear music at a live performance  hence seeing singing and musicHowever following the Great Standards it would seem appropriate to include contemporary forms of entertainment such as dancing singing and music on television videos radios taperecorders and stereosMost comprehensively this applies to seeing or hearing any kind of entertainment like a pleasureenjoying householder Listening or seeing for education is another matter Playful and wrong conduct for a bhikkhu is for example playing like a child with toys or games etc or making garlands of flowers etcBhikkhus are also prohibited from studying or speaking on low animallike knowledgeThe explanation of seems to cover all general subjects which are not related to the Dhamma of bhikkhusknowledge of enchantments making men and women love each other knowledge for making this or that person fall into disaster knowledge for using spirits or showing various kinds of magic knowledge of prediction such as knowing beforehand lottery results knowledge leading to selfdelusion such as transmuting mercury to gain the supernatural as in the transmuting of silver and copper into goldThese knowledges are because they are knowledge of doubtful things which are deceptive or deluding not being true knowledgeA teacher of this is a deceiver and a pupil is one who practices to deceive or he is just a foolish deluded person Wrong livelihood for a bhikkhu is divided into twoOne category concerns a bhikkhu searching for a living in a way that is also considered wrong by worldly normsFor example robbing or deceiving others by claiming to be enlightened and receiving gifts and support because of peoples beliefThe second category involves making a living that is wrong according to the VinayaFor example begging or asking from an unsuitable person or at an unsuitable time thinking to gain something by giving a little but hoping for much in return investing to gain interest making a living by trade for instance giving medical treatment for rewardAlso to seek reward fromthe ceremony for paritta that is making holy water and the sacred thread the blowing of a charmed formula onto a person by a bhikkhu is also prohibited It is allowed only to recite the paritta but this also occurs later and is not found in the Paali bhikkhu who seeks his living in this way is called alajjii one who has no shame The very serious Sanghaadisesa Rule of corrupting families concerns the proper relationship that bhikkhus should develop with lay followersIt originated when two of the ofttransgressing groupofsix monks neglected their Dhamma practice and behaved improperly in order to become popular with lay peopleThe lay people came to enjoy the sociable playful monks so much that when more composed rightpracticing monks came by they were considered snobbish and dullA bhikkhu guilty of habitually indulging in these practices should be banished from his particular Community until he reformsOf course a bhikkhu may concern himself in lay peoples affairs if it relates to religious dutiesAlsoThe relationship between the bhikkhu and his supporter should be a very special oneA bhikkhu who is complete in good conduct does not lower himself to become the intimate of a family in the same way as a lay man may doHe is not aggressive or destructive but shows a heart of lovingkindness and conducts himself in a moderate way thus causing good faith and reverence to arise in them towards himselfHe is then called kulapasaadakoHe is the splendor of theBhikkhus who are not strict lower themselves to become vile men but bhikkhus who are overstrict are not interested in showing in helping householders in various ways A bhikkhus wrong mode of livelihood also includesrunning messages and errands for kings ministers of state householders etcA modern example would be participating in political campaigns The meaning of one of the Confession rules is uncertain  as can be seen by the different translations below  but it might explain why visiting bhikkhus may be reluctant to intrude into a familys spaceThe Fortythird Confession Rule arose from VenUpanandas visit to a man and his wife who were sitting in their bedroom togetherThe husband told his wife to give VenUpananda a meal and when that was finished requested him to leaveThe wife noticed that her husband was becoming sexually excited and not wishing to participate asked VenUpananda to stayHe stayedThis happened three times after which the husband stormed out of the house indignant at VenUpanandas behaviorThe Rule has been understood in rather different waysShould any bhikkhu intrude upon and sit down in a family with both persons it entails Confession To sit down intruding on a man and a woman in their private quarters  when one or both are sexually aroused and when another bhikkhu is not present  is  If a bhikkhu sits down intruding on a family while they are taking food it is  A monk who intrudes into and sits down in a house where husband and wife are by themselves enjoying each others company commits  When the Buddha went to reside at Ghositaaraama in the city of Kosambi he found a dispute had arisen between the bhikkhus thereOne group of monks under a Vinayaexpert had accused the Dhammaexpounder leader of a minor wrongdoing offenceThe Dhammaexpounder bhikkhu would not admit to this so dissension arose between the two groupsEven when the Lord Buddha pointed out to both groups the dangers in this and how to put matters to right they still could not agreeSo the Lord Buddha left them and went to reside by himself in the Rakkhitavan ForestThe lay people of Kosambi blamed the quarreling bhikkhus for causing the Buddha to go away and in consequence they agreed together not to pay respect to those bhikkhusWhen the bhikkhus came to their houses they would not give alms food desiring them to go away disrobe or else return to the way of practice pleasing to the Lord Buddha After this treatment both groups of bhikkhus came to their senses and agreed to see the Lord Buddha where the dispute was properly resolvedA set of formal procedures are set down to resolve disputes within the CommunityThey are summarized in the Adhikaranasamatha rules the last seven of the Rules of the PaatimokkhaFor an outsider one of the most notable features of Buddhism is the number and diversity of Buddhist schoolsWhen disputes are left unresolved there is a tendency for the formation of nikaaya or schools which are passed on through ordination lineage to future generations of bhikkhusHistorically as Buddhism spread over Asia the practice of local Communities gradually adapted to new circumstancesThe originally slight divergences grew so that today not only do we have the major Schools of the South and the North and East but also myriad minor local differencesComing down to later times when the different groups became established in places foreign to the original lands those two became very far apart both in the texts and in the language for chanting all the way to garments and customs  just compare for instance Vietnamese monks with Thai monks  this reached the point where the intonations used in speaking Paali differed such as ours in Thailand those in Sri Lanka Burma and the Mons for exampleEach group holds that their way is better than that of the other groupsEven though they have contact with each other they are not united as a single group and minor arise out of them determined according to nationalityIn these national some would thrive at certain times until other would take them as a model to be followed some bhikkhus requesting entry to their group by taking new ordination or reordination A which takes the methods of another will make further differences in its methods until they are a separateThese call themselves by names different from the nationality such as our Mahaanikaaya and Dhammayuttikanikaaya the Burmese Culaganthii and Mahaaganthii and the Upaalivamsa Marammaavamsa and Raamaññavamsa of Sri Lanka There seems to be a natural tendency for the more strictly practicing Communities to attract more lay respect and therefore more lay support  including more material supportHowever as luxuries tend to become necessities there is often a corresponding decline in Vinaya practiceThe next stage seems to be that when the Vinaya practice has deteriorated into laxness a group of monks will spontaneously be attracted to going back to higher standards and will go and live at a monastery together to put that into effect eventually forming a new group or nikaayaThis stricter practice attracts lay support and that forces the more lax communities to reform their waysAnd then as standards declineAnother way that the local Vinaya practice is rejuvenated is by the import of strictly practicing monks from elsewhere to form a model communityFor example Sri Lankan monks were invited to Siam more than five hundred years ago and some centuries later Thai monks were themselves invited back to Sri Lanka after the local Sangha had died outInviting foreign monks to reform the local practice was often at the instigation of the Buddhist king and seemed to have worked quite wellHowever attempts by central authorities to forcibly rejoin their own local schools of monks have seldom been successful especially as Buddhism has never favored the use of violence in religious suppressionWhat often happens is that instead of merging two nikaayas into one it forces another sect to formThen there are three  the two original plus a new combined sectThis is probably because the Sangha is a local community structure that is oriented to the wider Sangha of bhikkhus by the VinayaThus the Vinaya rather than any central authority is what brings groups togetherThe Buddha allowed several ways of showing respect to others for the beauty and good of the community These includevandanaa  bowing or showing reverence with the five points ie the forehead two forearms and the two kneesutthaana  standing up to welcomeañjalii  joining the palms together in respectsaamiicikamma any other ways of showing respect that are beautiful and goodAnother ancient way of showing respect is circumambulation or walking around the object of veneration three times in a clockwise direction  so that ones right shoulder is towards for example the cetiya bodhi tree or pagodaIn many parts of Asia it is considered extremely rude to point ones feet at anyone or any religious objectAn example is found in the Confession Rule where a highly gifted bhikkhu is made drunk and in his stupor turns and points his feet at the BuddhaBhikkhus use these ways of etiquette to show respect to those who have been bhikkhus for longer than themselves irrespective of their actual ageA younger bhikkhu may call another bhikkhu Bhante and similarly a lay person may use this as a general form of address to bhikkhusEach country will have its own way of addressing older more senior bhikkhus appropriate to their age and experienceDuring his ordination the bhikkhucandidate is asked formally for his nameHis Preceptor will have given him a Paali name and this is what he will useHowever later on less formal occasions he may be addressed differentlyThis variety of terms of address can be quite confusing for outsidersFor example in Thailand the monk will more often use his given name with an honorific preceding it appropriate to his monks seniority and rankThe Paali name and title if any would be added on more formal occasionsI understand that in Sri Lanka and sometimes in Burma it is the bhikkhus place of origin or residence that may be prefixed to his Paali nameSome monks may use the description Bhikkhu before their Paali name while others will use it as a suffixIf they are more than ten years in the robe they may use Thera and if very senior MahaatheraThere are many other titles and ranks for senior bhikkhusThe king or government often confer these in recognition of service or administrative abilityWhen administration of all the bhikkhus of the country is subsumed under central government departments it may then be divided up into regions and districts under the supervision of the local senior respectable monksHowever underlying all of this is the Vinaya Rule that still guides the traditional ways of the bhikkhu life without class or privilege and it remains the foundation for continued Dhamma practice as it has done for the last twentyfive centuries Probably the most universally acceptable form of address for any bhikkhu is Bhante or Venerable SirAnyone of any religion or none can appreciate these fundamental practical guidelines about actions and speech suggested by the BuddhaWhen we are mindful enough to realize that we have a choice about our actions and speech these Precepts are there to help answer questions of What should I do what should I say They are practical and down to earth without requiring one to promise first to believe in anything supernaturalLike the lane markings on the highway they help speed one on ones journey without colliding with any other travelers or going completely off the roadThe Precepts mark the straightforward way of living that harms or hurts no one while offering one the choice to transform ones life through growing mindfulness into perfect virtue wisdom and compassionThe Five Precepts form one of the essential elements of following the Lord Buddhas WayUndertaking these Precepts are often the first formal affirmation of a new BuddhistThis is normally done by repeating after a monk these phrasesI undertake the training preceptThe Five can then be refined into the Eight PreceptsI undertake the training preceptIn the West the Sabbath  either Saturday or Sunday  has been normally the special religious observance day of the weekIn Buddhism which continues to follow the traditional lunar calendar the day set apart for special religious observance is the fortnightly day of the full and new moons with the quarter moon days in betweenThese full and newmoon days called Uposatha Days are when the bhikkhus gather to listen to a recitation of their Paatimokkha RuleThe weekly observance day on the quartermoon day is when lay devotees gather in the local monastery to observe precepts more strictly and listen to and speak about DhammaThe basic minimum standard of precepts for practicing lay Buddhists is the Five Preceptsand upaasikaa However on the Observance day they may decide to train under the Eight Precepts which brings them closer to how the monk or nun practicesThe novice has Ten Precepts as does the dasasiila mata nunThese are the same Eight as above however the seventh precept is split into two and an extra tenth precept is addedThus This book has been mostly focused on those of the Paatimokkha Rules that are of concern to the lay devoteeHere we will include a summary of most of the remaining rules taken from Venerable

knowing that they are thieves  is a paacittiya offenceWhen eating a bhikkhu shouldThis appendix is for those people who are interested in the Paali language and the pronunciation of the various Paali words found in this bookThe Paali alphabet is made up of fortyone lettersThese are divided into eight vowels thirtytwo consonants and one pure nasal sound called niggahitaThe dentals t and d are pronounced with the tip of the tongue placed against the front upper teethThe aspirates kh ghthdh th dh ph bh are pronounced with an h sound immediately following eg in blockhead pighead cathead log head etc where the h in each is combined with the preceding consonant in pronunciationThis appendix illustrates how the bhikkhus rules are actually practiced in different monasteries and communitiesEach example is taken from the communitys own guide or from devotees experienceA Lay Buddhists Guide to the Monks Code of Conduct A bhikkhu must have all eatables and drinkables except plain water formally offered into his hands or placed on or into something in direct contact with his handsIn order to prevent contact with a woman he will generally set down a cloth to receive things offered by a lady In the Forest Tradition of which our resident monks are a part milk is considered to be a food as are malted drinks such as Ovaltine and Milo so none of these would be allowed outside the proper timesIn accordance with the discipline a bhikkhu is prohibited from eating fruit or vegetables containing fertile seedsSo when offering such things a lay person can either remove the seeds or make the fruit allowable by slightly damaging it with a knifeThis is done by piercing the fruit and saying at the same time kappiyam bhanteIt is instructive to note that rather than limiting what can be offered the Vinaya lays emphasis on the mode of offeringIt regards the proper way of offering as being when the lay person approaches within a forearms distance of the bhikkhu has a respectful manner and is offering something that a bhikkhu can manage to carryAll this serves to make the act of offering a mindful and reflective one irrespective of what one is giving  and allows great joy to ariseForest bhikkhus generally make their own robes from the cloth that is givenPlain white cotton is always useful or worsted for the thicker robeIn a cold climate the basic triple robe of the Buddha is supplemented with sweaters beanies socks etc and these of an appropriate brown color can also be offeredThe bhikkhus precepts do not allow him to sleep more than three nights with an unordained male and not even to lie down in the same room with a femaleIn providing a temporary room for a night one need not provide a great deal of furniture a simple spare room that is private is adequateA bhikkhu is allowed to use medicines if they are offered in the same way as foodOnce offered neither food nor medicine should be handled again by a lay person as that renders it no longer allowableMedicines can be considered as those things that are specifically for illness those things that have a tonic or reviving quality and certain items which have a nutritional value in times of debilitation hunger or fatigueThere are different limitations regarding the amount of time that a bhikkhu can store such medicinesOne day allowance Filtered fruit juice of any fruit smaller than an average fistThese juices are allowed to be received and drunk any time between one dawn and the dawn of the next day  this timelimit prevents the danger of fermentationSeven day allowance Ghee animal or vegetable oil honey any kind of sugar and cheese can be kept and consumed any time up to the dawn of the eighth day after which they were receivedLifetime allowance Pharmaceutical medicines vitamins plant roots such as ginger ginseng herbal decoctions such as camomile beverages such as tea coffee and cocoaAt no time does the monk request foodThis principle should be borne in mind when offering food  rather than asking a monk what he would like it is better to ask if you can offer some foodConsidering that the meal will be the one meal of the day offer what seems right recognizing that the bhikkhu will take what he needs and leave the restA good way to offer is to bring bowls of food to the bhikkhu and let him choose what he needs from each bowlOne can also make an invitation pavarana to cover any circumstances that you might not be aware of  a health problem need for a toothbrush etc by saying Bhante if you are in need of any medicine or requisites please let me know To avoid misunderstanding it is better to be quite specific such as  Bhante if you need any more food If you need a new pair of sandals Unless specified an invitation can only be accepted for up to four months after which time it lapses unless renewedSpecifying the time limit or giving some indication of the scope of the offering is good in order to prevent misunderstanding  so that for instance when you are intending to offer some fruit juice the bhikkhu doesnt get the impression you want to buy a washing machine for the monasteryIn practical terms monasteries are financially controlled by lay stewards who then make open invitation for the Sangha to ask for what they need under the direction of the AbbotSo junior monks even have to ask an appointed agent if they may take up the stewards offer  to pay for dental treatment obtain footwear or medicines for exampleThis means that as far as is reasonably possible the donations that are given to the stewards to support the Sangha are not wasted on unnecessary whimsIf a lay person wishes to give to a particular bhikkhu but is uncertain of what he needs he should make invitationAny financial donations should not be made to X Bhikkhu but to the stewards of the monastery perhaps mentioning if its for a particular item or for the needs of a certain bhikkhuFor items such as traveling expenses money can be given to an accompanying anagarika or accompanying lay person who can buy tickets drinks for the journey or anything else that the bhikkhu may need at that timeIt is quite a good training for a lay person to actually consider what items are necessary and offer those rather than moneyBhikkhus should have a male present who can understand what is being said when conversing with a lady and a similar situation holds true for nunsSo to prevent such misunderstandings  however groundless  a bhikkhu has to be accompanied by a man whenever in the presence of a woman  on a journey or sitting alone in a secluded placeGenerally bhikkhus would also refrain from carrying on correspondence with women other than for matters pertaining to the monastery travel arrangements providing basic information etc When teaching Dhamma even in a letter it is easy for inspiration and compassion to turn into attachmentAccordingly for a Dhamma talk it is good to set up a room where the teachings can be listened to with respect being shown to the speakerIn terms of etiquette  graceful conversation rather than rude  this means affording the speaker a seat that is higher than his audience not pointing ones feet at the speaker removing headgear when listening to the talk and not interrupting the speakerQuestions are welcome at the end of the talkAlso as a sign of respect when inviting a bhikkhu it is usual for the person making the invitation to also make the travel arrangements  directly or indirectlyLay people may be interested in applying conventions for their own training in sensitivity but it should not be considered as something that is necessarily expected of themFirstly there is the custom of bowing to the shrine or teacherThis is done when first entering their presence or when taking leaveDone gracefully at the appropriate time this is a beautiful gesture that honors the person who does it at an inappropriate time done compulsively it appears foolishAnother common gesture of respect is to place the hands so that the palms are touching the fingers pointing upwards and the hands held immediately in front of the chestThe gesture of raising the hands to the slightly lowered forehead is called añjalii This is a pleasant means of greeting bidding farewell saluting the end of a Dhamma talk concluding an offeringBody language is something that is well understood in Asian countriesApart from the obvious reminder to sit up for a Dhamma talk rather than loll or recline on the floor one shows a manner of deference by ducking slightly if having to walk between a bhikkhu and the person he is speaking toSimilarly one would not stand looming over a bhikkhu to talk to him or offer him something but rather approach him at the level at which he is sittingAdvice for Guests The Abbot is usually addressed as Ajahn which comes from the Thai and means Teacher Other monks can be addressed as Venerable or the Thai equivalent Tahn These designations may or may not be followed by the ordained name of the individualAlternatively any monk can be called Bhante a more general termIn this tradition it is considered impolite to refer to monks by their ordained names without the appropriate honorific preceding itThe Precepts The Community at Bodhinyanarama is bound by the monastic code of conduct the basis of which is formalized into the following eight preceptsThese are intended as a means of promoting harmony within the community and as a framework for contemplationGuests are requested to undertake these precepts wholeheartedly for the insight they offer and out of consideration for everyone else in the communityTake special care to dress and act with modestyIn a place where chastity is observed it is fitting to tone down the attractive qualities of personal appearance and behaviorWhen in the company of a monk nun or novice keep in mind that their discipline prohibits physical contact with members of the opposite sexThe property of the monastery has come from someones generosity to the Sangha and guests are asked to treat it respectfullyPersonal belongings should be kept tidy particularly in spaces that are being used communallyIf anything needs repair replacing or refilling please let the guest master knowA monastery is a sanctuary from the usual worldly concerns for those who have dedicated themselves to spiritual practiceAs guests are sharing in this life as

These designations may or may not be followed by the Pali name of the individualIt is considered impolite to refer to ordained people by their Pali names without the appropriate honorific preceding itThai culture has an extensive etiquette and varied social customs  stemming largely from the monks Code of Discipline  governing many aspects of physical behavior comprising a form of rules for proper body languageMost apparent are the gestures of respect used within a monastic community which help to open the heart compose the mind and encourage a sense of kindness to othersThese forms of courtesy help to develop a sensitivity towards the others to whom one relates on a daily basis and reduce the number of upsets arising through inconsiderate or aggressive behavioris a customary gesture used by Thais greeting others and also during the time one is speaking with a monkAlso known in Thai as the wai it consists of raising the hands to the chest palms togetherThe gesture is also used after offering something to or receiving something from an ordained personThe formal bow or grahp is another frequently used formality being an excellent means of expressing respect for the Buddha Dhamma Sangha and for cultivating humilityAlways bow before sitting down in the sala Bot or Abbots kutiAt the end of the meetings and when getting up either after the drink or from conversing with a monk remember to bow three timesIn all postures try and be aware of where the body is in relation to a monk especially if he is teaching DhammaWhen walking with a monk it is customary for laypeople to walk a little behind rather than immediately at his sideIf a lay person has occasion to pass in front of a monk who is seated it is polite to stoopIf a monk is sitting lay people should squat or sit down before addressing him it is considered improper for lay people to be on a higher level when speaking with a monkThe Buddha instructed monks not to teach Dhamma to one who is unprepared or showing disrespectWhen sitting and receiving a talk or conversing with a monk it is customary to sit in the puppiap position  one leg bent in front the other folded at the sideSitting with the arms clasped around knees is improperIf sitting on a chair sit attentively and erectIt is inappropriate to lie down in the sala or sit with ones feet outstretched towards a Buddha image or monkBe careful not to touch food or medicines already offered without first informing a monkEating should be done in silence and without a lot of scraping and banging of utensils or making unnecessary messOne should not eat or drink standing upAfter midday all members of the community should refrain from partaking of any food including drinks containing milk cereals eggs etc or any kind of soupThere are certain medicines allowable for consumption under the VinayaThese include fruit juice soft drinks butter and ghee vegetable oil honey and molasses tea coffee cocoa and herbal drinksSuch medicines are kept separately and offered as neededVisitors should be aware of the proper mode of conduct for men and women within the setting of a forest monasteryThey should be aware that some behavior quite acceptable and normal enough for foreigners is open to misinterpretation by the Thai community whose standards naturally differComplete segregation of the sexes is mandatory at all timesNo men should enter the womens lodgings without permission from the AbbotIf any contact is necessary it should be done through the AbbotLaymen should be careful in the kitchen not to get too close to laywomen especially ThaisWomen are asked to be discreet and respectful when relating to monks maintaining an even greater distance than with laymenTake the Thai laywomen as examples in the proper way to behave with monks such as perhaps kneeling down or squatting if conversing with a monkWomen should be aware that it is an offence against his discipline if a monk touches a womanIf offering something to a monk either place it in his bowl or on his special receiving cloth  never directly into his handsMale visitors should be aware that women with shaved heads may prefer not to hand anything to or receive anything directly from youPut it down first and let the other person pick it upWomen must be careful entering rooms where a monk might be present it is an offence for a monk to be alone with a woman in a closed roomYou will find that locker space is provided for your food and there is usually a thermos of ice cubes an ice box for perishables theres a shower room and toiletYou wash your clothes by the well pump  not from the rain water tanksThere is no electricity so you will need a torch and plenty of candles and a good lighter or matchesAsk for a place to put your valuables in a lock up You will be shown where you are to stay which is in a separate area of the monastery away from where the monks stayHowever please remember to dress suitablyThe lay women on eight precepts wear white tops and blackwrap over skirtsIf you are not going to keep the full eight it does not matter much what you wear as long as it is modest and the colors are mutedYou are provided with a mosquito net blankets and pillow and pillow caseI also take antimosquito cream antiseptic wipes bandaids tissue cold water washing powder soap prickly heat powderTorch flipflops sleeping bag sheet towel and such likeAllowables for the afternoon include butterscotch boiled sweets dark chocolate cheese tea or coffeeIt is customary to bow three times when one sees ones teachers and when one goes to the main hallIf you notice what the Thais do you will soon get the hang of itYou will probably feel rather lost for the first hours but then with patience and mindfulness everything should come togetherThe Thais  and especially ones teachers  are so good and generous to us that I feel its important not to offend themIn the afternoon there is usually a chance to listen to a Dhamma talkIn the morning one can prepare food to offer to the monks and to share with ones fellow meditatorsThe rest of the day one can work out a meditation routine which suits oneMost people make a donation  there is no charge at all  before they leaveTan Acharn doesnt like people to give more than they can affordYou must find out exactly how to do itStandard of clothing for women Clothes should not be too revealing such as shorts miniskirt lowcut or sleeveless garmentsBreast feeding is not appropriate in the presence of a monk or even in the same roomIt is not respectful to stretch out ones legs when seated or point them in the direction of the monk or Buddha StatuePeople should not stand and talk to a monk when he is seatedThe norms of good manners should be observed eg people should not talk and laugh loudly or make a noise when the monk is talking to someone in the same roomWomen should not have a private conversation with a monk or be alone in the same room without a male person being presentA bhikkhu should be approached respectfully by the person offering daana who should always try to maintain a bodily position lower than that of the bhikkhuThe person making the offering should be shoeless modestly dressed and should have a generally respectful demeanour towards the bhikkhuAs with any greeting or approach to a bhikkhu the person offering daana should pay respects in the normal way by bowing three times  once for each of the Triple GemIf in doubt as to how to proceed beyond this basic approach other experienced members of the lay community or the bhikkhu themselves are sure to be able to offer helpful directionsAs a general rule one does not speak to a bhikkhu while offering daana unless the bhikkhu initiates some conversationTo move with mindfulness and perhaps a bit more slowly than usual lessens the likelihood of mishapsRemember the best way of learning and of keeping out of potentially embarrassing situations is to seek guidance from others present or if there is a language barrier to follow the example of those around youBut remember too that rules for men and women are very different so make sure you are following the example of a member of the same genderIt is very important for everyone to always maintain a respectful distance from the bhikkhus the SanghaThe two most common situations for offering daana in the form of food is when a line of bhikkhus is seated on a dais accepting daana or when a line of bhikkhus is on alms roundIn this situation the lay person should join the line of people making offerings if there is oneIf they are offering singly then the procedure is basically the sameThe person making the offering should kneel once they are sufficiently close enough to the bhikkhu and signal their intent to offer food drink etc by holding the item above them and to their forehead at the same time mindfully recollecting the inner purpose for the offeringThe usual order is to offer plain cooked rice first followed by other dishesIn this way a person may offer several timesFood is placed with care into the alms bowl beginning with the most senior bhikkhu and then proceeding down the lineOnce the offering has been made the person should move back and away while still facing the bhikkhus and maintaining a low positionThey might also at this stage repeat the respectful greeting of bowing three timesIt is very important to maintain a respectful distance and to place the food carefully and gently in the center of the bowl without touching or interfering with it in any wayAfter all the offerings have been made the bhikkhus will chant and then have their mealWhen the bhikkhus have finished arranging their meal it is usual for the most senior bhikkhu to lead the others in the blessing chanting for the lay community gatheredThe most senior bhikkhu will then indicate that the lay people can now eatWhen offering food to a line of monks making an alms round it is important to be well prepared and ready in position somewhere along their round before they arrive so as not to delay them on their roundWait quietly using the time to reflect on the meaning of the action about to take placeThe food should be kept well off the ground and shoes should be removed in readinessWhen the bhikkhus are seen to be approaching the person should kneel and hold the food above their head in an offering position and reflect on the meaning of the action about to take placeOnce the bhikkhu stops the person should stand and place a portion of the food into the open alms bowl that the bhikkhu will be silently offering while maintaining a position lower than that of the bhikkhuIf the bowl is full the lid of the bowl might be offeredIt is very important to maintain a respectful distance and to place the food carefully and gently in the center of the bowl without touching or interfering with it in any wayKneel again and repeat the procedure until daana has been offered to all the bhikkhusOnce the line moves away it might be appropriate to pay respects in the usual wayWhen a lay woman wishes to offer a bhikkhu some kind of daana other than food the first step is to approach the seated bhikkhu respectfully in the manner outlined above pay respects and let him know that you would like to make the offering indicating exactly what the nature of the offering isThe bhikkhu will place down a piece of cloth and the person can then move forward and carefully place the offering on itThe person should then pay respects again and move back a littleAs with food offerings shoes should be removed and a low position in relation to the bhikkhu should be maintainedLay men can follow the above procedure also except that the item offered can be handed directly to the bhikkhuWhen visiting bhikkhus the lay person should pay respects to them in the usual way by bowing three times to each of the bhikkhus present in the order of their ordination if this is knownThe lay person can then assume a natural comfortable seated position a little back from and if possible lower than the bhikkhuThe only thing to remember here is that if health permits feet should be tucked under and away as it is not polite to point feet directly at a bhikkhuWhen addressing a bhikkhu it is usual to place both hands together at chest height when talking to him or when he is replying  especially when he is expounding dhammaApart from indicating respect for the Sangha this action helps with general mindfulnessIf seeking advice or a dhamma explanation from a bhikkhu a lay person would allow for spaciousness in a conversation ie allow for pauses in the conversation before the bhikkhu speaks or repliesAlthough tempting it is a good idea not to get caught up in conversations about worldly matters with either the bhikkhus or with other lay people when sitting in the presence of the SanghaLay women especially have to exercise great mindfulness when in the presence of the SanghaIf for example a lay woman finds herself left alone in the presence of a bhikkhu eg other friends have moved away or left the most appropriate thing to do is to pay respects to that bhikkhu and leaveWhen walking in the company of bhikkhus lay people should walk a little behind but still within speaking distanceA lay person would not stand too close to a bhikkhu when he is standingIt is better to move a small distance away and assume a squatting position if it feels comfortable to do thisWhile not compulsory in any way to pay respects in the traditional way to either a Buddha image or the Sangha is the most basic sign of a lay persons respect for the Triple GemIt is also an excellent exercise in mindfulnessTo learn the correct and most graceful way to execute this action it is usually easiest to follow the example of an experienced lay person or the bhikkhus themselves who also must pay respects to Buddha images or more senior bhikkhusWhen visiting a Wat or temple it is good to be mindful about the type of clothing one wears  just as when going to a church or sacred building of any kindDress for both men and women should be modest and unrevealing and excessive ornamentation should be avoidedLay women especially should pay attention to what they wear avoiding things like sheer fabrics low necklines sleeveless topsSerious practitioners will consider not wearing perfume makeup or jewellery as wellIt seems that these principles are not for the bhikkhu to consider for himselfIt is for the consideration of his or teacher or of an Elder who is his senior whether it is proper or not for a bhikkhu who lives with them to be released and to stay alone and whether a bhikkhu who is released from is able to be a This need for precision though accounts for the weakness of rules in general as universal guides to behaviorFirst there is the question of where to draw the line between what is and is not an infraction of the ruleA clear breakoff point is needed because rules  unlike principles  deal in two colors black and whiteIn some cases it is difficult to find a clear breakoff point that corresponds exactly to ones sense of what is right and wrong and so it is necessary to include the areas of gray either with the white or the blackIn general but not always the Vibhangas position is to include the gray with the white and to rely on the principles of the Dhamma to encourage the individual bhikkhu to stay away from the gray The Commentary however states that such an offender may go forth as a novice A bhikkhu who has committed any of the Four Paaraajika offences can no longer have with the sanghaHe is one who is condemned for his entire lifetimeThere is no way to remedy itHe must get out of the groupThis is the only way for himIf that person does not give up his status on his own but declares himself a bhikkhu once the sangha knows this it should expel him from the group Perhaps intimate and private telephone conversations should now also be included hereSome communities require that another monk be privy to what is going on whether phone conversations or in letter writingThis guideline would also apply to telephone conversations but not to written communication although careful reflection should be exercised Rule Summary Lying down at the same time in the same lodging with a novice or layman for more than three nights running is Bhikkhus who seek a living without violating the traditions of bhikkhus gain offerings in the right wayThey should know how to make use of these offerings properly and not do anything with them which will make the donors faith decline The son of a great merchant was so inspired by VenUpanandas Dhamma talk that he made an invitation of the four requisites whereupon VenUpananda asked for one of the pieces of cloth that the lay man was actually wearingThe lay man replied that he would bring another cloth from home because walking around with only one cloth was not proper for himNevertheless VenUpananda became very insistent so the lay man had to give up the clothPeople criticized the monks for being greedy and not being reasonable in their requestsThe rule that resulted can be summarizedIf he does beg and obtain the robe he must forfeit it to another bhikkhu and confess the offenceWhen the circumstances are such that he is allowed to ask for a robe he should not ask for more than two robesThis is covered by the next RuleThe Eighth Rule arose because a bhikkhu overheard one of VenUpanandas supporters saying that he intended to give VenUpananda a robeThe bhikkhu went and told VenUpananda whereupon VenUpananda visited the donor and specified exactly which kind of robe he wantedThe lay supporter commented these monks are insatiable and not easily contentedHow can he without having first been invited by me make stipulations about a robeIt is no offence for the bhikkhu to request them to reduce the amount they were planning to spendThe twentysixth Confession with Forfeiture RuleThe twentyseventh Confession with Forfeiture Rule Although these Rules are about robematerial conscientious bhikkhus would regard other requisites in the same spiritto distribute things among fellow Dhammafriends is suitable as well as giving to laymen who work in the monastery or those who help with a bhikkhus workThey should be given to such people as the cost of food and as the cost of labor or they should be given the things which a bhikkhu has received so that they can be used and not wasted for this will be proper However telling a lay person to take ones belongings as hisher own is a theft of faith  ie a misuse of the donations that lay supporters have sacrificed for the bhikkhus use Though five panels are shown in this figure there can be seven nine or more depending on the size of the clothIn Thailand this color is considered to be yellow mixed with much red or the ochre yellow which is the color obtained from the heartwood of the Jackfruit tree The heartwood of the jackfruit tree  is now difficult to find due to deforestationCertain other medicines may be interpreted by applying the Great Standards from some of those mentioned specifically in the VinayaThus soyabean milk may be a form of thin mungbean broth miso may be a form of salted sour gruel A study of the allowance to eat meat pure in the three respects in other Vinaya recensions shows that despite minor differences in defining terms there is not any material difference in the meaning and scope of the rule It has been suggested that the development of vegetarianism amongst certain Mahayanists may have close connexions to the theory of the tathaagatagarbha However another commentator notes that Tibetan Buddhists  who also follow the Mahayana  do eat meatHe suggests that not eating meat came more from the Taoist influence in ChinaThe bhikkhu should also not eat raw or undercooked meat or the flesh of elephants horses dogs snakes lions tigers leopards bears hyenas or of course human flesh One of the tonicmedicines is called navaniitam in PaaliSome communities consider that it is butter and some cheeseIt is a controversial pointRemembering that each local community of monks may practice differently the lay person will need to check what is considered allowableOther comments on the tonicmedicinesSome say that navaniitam is butter some say that it is cheeseHowever there is a reasonable argument following the Buddhas Four Great Standards to state that butter and cheese are sufficiently similar to the real navaniitam and dissimilar to what has been disallowed by the Buddha to make both butter and cheese also allowable along with navaniitam as one of the Five TonicsIn the West cheese is sometimes considered as a food and monks seen eating it in the afternoon or evening may be looked down upon by some lay peopleIt seems better in such situations only to make use of the allowance to eat cheese in the afternoon or evening when there is more than mere tiredness but a debilitating illness insteadIt may be that the medicine is given up with no expectation of its return before seven days have passed in which case if without any prompting by the monk it should be offered again that medicine may be accepted and kept a further seven days These five medicines are defined asMade from churning curds This is similar to modernday creamery butter and since cheese is also processed from curds many bhikkhus would include cheese under this name as wellOne complication with this is that in the West cheese is considered a substantial foodThus if used as a tonic should be taken in moderation  Under this would be included sugarwater and so many communities would allow lemonade and other soft drinks The first standard is somewhat ambiguous and relative to social values at different places and at different timesThe second is more specific  if one knows how much a paada is worthA subcommentary says that one paada is equal to the value of gold weighing unhusked ricegrainsThis has been determined as approximately  oztroy of goldOf course it must also be recognized that the price of gold fluctuates over timeThis seems like a reasonable amount to constitute a theft serious enough to warrant Defeat Whoever agrees to gold or money headman also agrees to the five strands of sensual pleasure and whoever agrees to the five strands of sensual pleasure headman you may take for certain that this is not the way of a recluse that this is not the way of a Buddhist monk A Bhikkhu who does not accept money inspires great faith in Buddhism amongst the laity according to the following quote he is likened unto a shining example  whereas the bhikkhu who does accept money is likened unto a blemish or stainBhikkhus there are these four stains because of which samanas and brahmans glow not shine not blaze notWhat are these fourDrinking alcoholic beverages indulging in sexual intercourse accepting gold and money obtaining requisites through a wrong mode of livelihood  In the act of accepting money or having it accepted in ones name one is accepting all the cares responsibilities and dangers that come with its ownership in the act of arranging a trade one is accepting responsibility for the fairness of the trade that it undervalues neither the generosity of the person who donated the money nor the goods and services of the person receiving the money in exchange the Buddha permitted money to be entrusted by a donor to a steward who may be a monastery attendant or a lay follower for the personal benefit of an individual bhikkhu thusThere are bhikkhus people of faith and confidence who entrust money into the hands of monastery stewards saying With this provide the bhikkhu soandso with what is allowable I permit you bhikkhus to accept an allowable item obtained therebyBut this bhikkhus I do not say that in any circumstances may gold silver or money be accepted be looked about forWhen the donors ask the bhikkhu Has the Venerable One a steward or Is there an appropriate place where I may deposit this money or some similar question then the bhikkhu may point out a suitable steward or he may indicate an appropriate placeShould the donor deposit the money with that steward or in that place then it is properly deposited When a fund has been properly established and the bhikkhu is in need of a requisite he may approach that steward and state what he is in need ofShould a bhikkhu command the steward to Buy me this it is considered a case of dubbhicaritata and that bhikkhu may not make use of any article obtained therefrom although other bhikkhus may use itIt is a fault of Acknowledgement with Forfeiture for a bhikkhu who receives a requisite by badgering the steward beyond verbally reminding him three times and standing silently up to six timesIf the required requisite is not forthcoming the bhikkhu is obliged to inform the donor that the invitation to requisites has not been fulfilledThe Commentary says that if the bhikkhu does not inform the donor it is a fault of Wrong Doing for breaking a customThe donor may then take up the matter with the steward A bhikkhu may not command either the donor or the steward what to do with regard to the gift of gold or moneyHowever he may give them hints or suggestions or any information as long as these fall short of ordering the donor or stewardAlso a bhikkhu may not accept the ownership of gold or money offered to him indirectly for example should a donor say to him In such and such a place is a certain amount of money I give it to you then the bhikkhu is obliged to reject the gift by words or by a gesture of refusal or by mental resolve otherwise he incurs There are monks who are not insane but who believe in their own delusions of grandeurThey are not exempt from offencesWhen the Buddha referred to tending the sick he was referring to fellow monasticsThe Commentary a bhikkhu may prescribe and supply medicine to his parents to those caring for his parents to layattendants of the monastery and to those residing in the monastery preparing to ordain a bhikkhu may also prescribe medicines for brothers sisters aunts uncles and grandparents if they are not able to supply their own medicines a bhikkhu can loan these to them if travelers bandits wounded soldiers important people and those with no relatives come to the monastery for help they should be given medicine without reimbursement medicine may be given indirectly to brothers and sistersinlaw either through their children or through the bhikkhus brother or sister monastery supporters and faithful people may be helped by mentioning what medicines will cure their particular ailment prescribing or supplying beyond this is a Wrongdoing To bow correctly bring the forehead all the way to the floor have elbows near the knees which should be about three inches apartBow slowly being mindful of the bodyAs nearly as possible the buttocks should be kept on the heels It is a tradition of bhikkhus that whoever enters the area around a cetiya which is a place for the recollection of the Master should behave in a respectful manner neither opening his umbrella nor putting on sandals nor wearing the covering both shouldersThey should not speak loudly there or sit with their legs spread apart with their feet pointing thus not showing respect for that placeThey must not stool or urinate spit upon the terraces of the cetiya before an image of the Exalted Buddha their good behavior thus showing respect for the Master Sanskrit renditions of the Paatimokkha Rule contain extra Sekhiya Training rules often concerned with ways of showing respectFor example Rules to are all concerned with BuddhaStupasThe theme of a hierarchy of respect first came up for serious consideration in regard to obtaining lodgingsOne time the Buddha set out from Savatthi with a large following of bhikkhusThe bhikkhus who were pupils of the group of six bhikkhus went ahead and appropriated all the and sleepingplaces for their preceptors teachers and for themselvesVenerable Sariputta coming along behind was unable to find a suitable lodging and sat down at the foot of a treeThe Buddha found him there and finding the reason asked the assembled bhikkhusBhikkhus who is worthy of the principle seat the best water the best almsfood Some bhikkhus said that one gone forth from a noble family was most worthy of these things some said one gone forth from a brahmana family a merchant family one versed in the suttas  a Vinaya expert a teacher of Dhamma one having the first jhana the second the third the fourth jhana a streamenterer a oncereturner a nonreturner an arahant one with the Threefold Knowledge one with the six Psychic PowersThe Buddha then related the story of a partridge a monkey and a bullelephant who were friends and agreed to respect and heed the advice of the eldestThe Buddha concluded by sayingWell then bhikkhus if breathing animals can live mutually respectful deferential and courteous so do you bhikkhus shine forth so that you gone forth in this welltaught DhammaVinaya live likewise mutually respectful deferential and courteous WWW

request a printed copy of this book please write to Metta Forest Monastery POBox Valley Center CA USASeveral months ago I went for a twoweek retreat to a hermitage in the low country highly respected for the austere meditative life of its monksEach day a different group of dayakas comes to the monastery bringing almsfood often from remote towns and villagesThey arrive the previous evening prepare an early breakfast which is sent up to the refectory and then in the forenoon offer alms directly to the monks when they come down on alms roundAfter the other monks have collected their food and gone back up one elder stays behind to give the Refuges and Precepts preach a short sermon and conduct the dedication of meritOne day during my retreat I noticed some of the male dayakas behaving rather oddly near the abbots quartersI asked my friend a German monk about their strange behavior and the explanation he gave me jolted my mindThey were drunk he told meBut that wasnt allHe continued The only thing unusual about yesterdays incident was that the men had gotten drunk early in the dayUsually they put on their best behavior until the formalities are done then they break out the bottlesThis stark revelation aroused in me both indignation and sorrowIndignation at the idea that people who consider themselves Buddhists should flaunt the most basic precepts even in the sacred precincts of a monastery  indeed one of the few in Sri Lanka where the flame of arduous striving still burnsSorrow because this was only the latest evidence I had seen of how deeply the disease of alcoholism has eaten into the entrails of this nation whose Buddhist heritage goes back over two thousand yearsBut Sri Lanka is far from being the only Buddhist country to be engulfed by the spreading wave of alcohol consumptionThe wave has already swept over far too much of the shrinking Buddhist world with Thailand and Japan ranking especially high on the fatality listThe reasons for this ominous trend vary widelyOne is rising affluence which for the rich makes of liquor a visible symbol of newly acquired wealth and powerAnother is a burgeoning middle class which blindly imitates the social conventions of the WestStill another is poverty which turns the bottle into an easy escape route from the grim face of everyday realityBut whatever the reason it is more than our woes and worries that alcohol is dissolvingIt is gnawing away at the delicate fabric of Buddhist values on every level  personal family and socialFor his lay followers the Buddha has prescribed five precepts as the minimal moral observance abstinence from killing stealing sexual misconduct false speech and the use of intoxicantsHe did not lay down these precepts arbitrarily or out of compliance with ancient customs but because he understood with his omniscient knowledge which lines of conduct lead to our welfare and happiness and which lead to harm and sufferingThe fifth precept it should be stressed is not a pledge merely to abstain from intoxication or from excessive consumption of liquorIt calls for nothing short of total abstinenceBy this rule the Buddha shows that he has understood well the subtle pernicious nature of addictionAlcoholism rarely claims its victims in a sudden swoopUsually it sets in gradually beginning perhaps with the social icebreaker the drink among friends or the cocktail after a hard days workBut it does not stop there slowly it sinks its talons into its victims hearts until they are reduced to its helpless preyTo dispel any doubt about his reasons for prescribing this precept the Buddha has written the explanation into the rule itself one is to refrain from the use of intoxicating drinks and drugs because they are the cause of heedlessnessHeedlessness means moral recklessness disregard for the bounds between right and wrongIt is the loss of heedfulness moral scrupulousness based on a keen perception of the dangers in unwholesome statesHeedfulness is the keynote of the Buddhist path the way to the Deathless running through all three stages of the path morality concentration and wisdomTo indulge in intoxicating drinks is to risk falling away from each stageThe use of alcohol blunts the sense of shame and moral dread and thus leads almost inevitably to a breach of the other preceptsOne addicted to liquor will have little hesitation to lie or steal will lose all sense of sexual decency and may easily be provoked even to murderHard statistics clearly confirm the close connection between the use of alcohol and violent crime not to speak of traffic accidents occupational hazards and disharmony within the homeAlcoholism is indeed a most costly burden on the whole societyWhen the use of intoxicants eats away at even the most basic moral scruples little need be said about its corrosive influence on the two higher stages of the pathA mind besotted by drink will lack the alertness required for meditative training and certainly wont be able to make the fine distinctions between good and bad mental qualities needed to develop wisdomThe Buddhist path in its entirety is a discipline of sobriety a discipline which demands the courage and honesty to take a long hard utterly sober look at the sobering truths about existenceSuch courage and honesty will hardly be possible for one who must escape from truth into the glittering but fragile fantasyland opened up by drink and drugsIt may well be that a mature reasonably welladjusted person can enjoy a few drinks with friends without turning into a drunkard or a murderous fiendBut there is another factor to consider namely that this life is not the only life we leadOur stream of consciousness does not terminate with death but continues on in other forms and the form it takes is determined by our habits propensities and actions in this present lifeThe possibilities of rebirth are boundless yet the road to the lower realms is wide and smooth the road upward steep and narrowIf we were ordered to walk along a narrow ledge overlooking a sharp precipice we certainly would not want to put ourselves at risk by first enjoying a few drinksWe would be too keenly aware that nothing less than our life is at stakeIf we only had eyes to see we would realize that this is a perfect metaphor for the human condition as the Buddha himself the One with Vision confirmsAs human beings we walk along a narrow ledge and if our moral sense is dulled we can easily topple over the edge down to the plane of misery from which it is extremely difficult to reemergeBut it is not for our own sakes alone nor even for the wider benefit of our family and friends that we should heed the Buddhas injunction to abstain from intoxicantsTo do so is also part of our personal responsibility for preserving the Buddhas SasanaThe Teaching can survive only as long as its followers uphold it and in the present day one of the most insidious corruptions eating away at the entrails of Buddhism is the extensive spread of the drinking habit among those same followersIf we truly want the Dhamma to endure long to keep the path to deliverance open for all the world then we must remain heedfulIf the current trend continues and more and more Buddhists succumb to the lure of intoxicating drinks we can be sure that the Teaching will perish in all but nameAt this very moment of history when its message has become most urgent the sacred Dhamma of the Buddha will be irreparably lost drowned out by the clinking of glasses and our rounds of merry toastsThe Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creedsFounded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topicsIts publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddhas discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practiceThese works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first aroseToday in both East and West a general breakdown of law and order has planted in us an implacable sense of uneasiness that creeps up on us on the streets in our workplace and even in our homesThe rising number of drug addicts the increase in petty crime the decline of respect for others  all these have jointly infected our most ordinary human encounters with an intensified atmosphere of suspicionMany people only feel at ease behind doublelocked doors with windows secured by metal bars and gates guarded by highalert sensorsYet it is often only when we have armored ourselves with the most impregnable defense systems that we discover a still more intrusive source of insecurityThis sense of fear and dread which can eat away at our most precious moments of enjoyment does not stem from outside threats but swells up inexplicably from withinThough it may wrap itself around our everyday affairs and send us into flurries of concern its true cause is not so much external dangers as an unlocalized anxiety floating dizzily along the edges of the mindA little known sutta tucked away in the Devaputtasamyutta gives us an insight into the nature of this hidden anguish far more poignant and realistic than our most astute existentialist philosophersIn his short sutta only eight lines of print in the Pali a young god named Subrahma appears before the Awakened One and explains the problem weighing on his heartIt is perhaps ironic that it takes a deva to express so succinctly with such elegant simplicity the dilemma at the crux of the human conditionSubrahmas confession also makes it clear that neither the deva world nor any other set of outer conditions offers a final refuge from anguishLuxurious mansions lucrative jobs unchallenged authority highalert security systems none of these can guarantee inner stillness and peaceFor the source of all problems is the mind itself which follows us wherever we may goTo understand Subrahmas distress we need only sit down quietly draw our attention inward and watch our thoughts as they tumble byIf we do not fix on any one thought but simply observe each thought as it passes by we will almost surely find waves of anxiety care and worry running through and beneath this ceaseless processionOur fears and concerns need not assume vast proportions booming forth bold metaphysical decreesBut beneath the melody of constantly changing thoughts punctuating them like the thumping of the bass in a jazz quintet is the persistent throb of worry and care the second rhythm of the heartSubrahma underscores the predicament he faced  the predicament faced by all unenlightened worldlings  by repeating the words always in the first two linesThis repetition is significantIt does not mean that every thought we think is plagued by worry and dread nor does it rule out the joy of successful achievement the pleasure of requited love or courage in the face of lifes daunting challengesBut it does underscore the stubborn persistence of anxious dread which trails behind us like a gruffy mongrel  growling when we cast a backward glance ready to snap at our heels when were off guardFear and anxiety haunt the corridors of the mind because the mind is a function of time a rolling glimmer of awareness that flows inexorably from a past that can never be undone into a future that teases us with a perpetual undecipherable not yet It is just because the mind attempts to clamp down on the passage of time wrapping its tentacles around a thousand projects and concerns that the passage of time appears so formidableFor time means change and change brings dissolution the breaking of the bonds that we have forged with so much toilTime also means the uncertainty of the future plummeting us into unexpected challenges and inevitable old age and deathWhen Subrahma came to the Buddha with his urgent plea for help he was not seeking a prescription of Prozacs that would tide him through his next round of business deals and his dalliance with celestial nymphsHe wanted nothing less than total release from fear and thus the Buddha did not have to pull any punches with his answerIn four piquant lines he told Subrahma the only effective way to heal his inner wound to heal it with no danger of relapseThe ultimate escape from anxiety the Buddha makes clear is summed up in four simple measuresThe most decisive are awakening and relinquishment wisdom and releaseThese however do not arise in a vacuum but only as a consequence of training in virtue and meditation expressed here as restraint of the sense faculties and austerity the energy of contemplative endeavorThe entire programme is directed to digging up the hidden root of anguish which the existentialists with all their philosophical acumen could not discernThat root is clingingAsleep in the deep night of ignorance we cling to our possessions our loved ones our position and status and most tenaciously of all we cling to these five aggregates of form feeling perception volitional activity and consciousness taking them to be permanent pleasurable and a truly existent selfTo cling to anything is to aim at preserving it at sealing it off from the ravenous appetite of timeYet to make such an attempt is to run smack up against the fixed decree written into the texture of being that whatever comes to be must pass awayIt is not only the object of clinging that must yield to the law of impermanenceThe subject too the one who clings and the very act of clinging are also bound to dissolve perish and pass awayTo sit back trying to shape a world that will conform to our hearts desires is to fight against the inflexible law of changeBut try as we may there is no escape the sonorous truth swells up from the depths of being and we can either heed its message or continue to stuff our earsThe cutting irony in the solution the Buddha holds out to Subrahma lies in the fact that the prescription requires a voluntary assent to the act we instinctively try to avoidThe final escape from anxiety and care is not a warm assurance that the universe will give us a cheerful hugIt is rather a call for us to take the step that we habitually resistWhat we fear above all else what causes the tremors of anxiety to ripple through our heart is the giving up of what we cherishYet the Buddha tells us that the only way to reach true safety is by giving up all Not apart from relinquishing all do I see any safety for living beings In the end we have no choice we must give up all for when death comes to claim us everything we identify with will be taken awayBut to go beyond anxiety we must let go now  not of course by a premature act of renunciation which in many cases might even be harmful or selfdestructive  but by wearing away the clinging attachment and acquisitiveness that lie within as the buried root of fearThis relinquishment of clinging cannot come about through the forcible rejection of what we love and cherishIt arises from wisdom from insight from awakening from breaking through the deep dark sleep of ignoranceThe sovereign remedy is to see that right now at this very moment there is nothing we can truly claim as ours for in reality All this is empty of self and of what belongs to self Form feeling perception volition and consciousness all are to he given up by seeing them as they really are as not mine not I not my self To see the truth that all conditioned things are impermanent disintegrating and bound to perish is to turn away from clinging to relinquish allAnd to relinquish all is to find ourselves not barren and emptyhanded but rich with the wealth of the noble onesFor one without clinging there is no fear no tremor or agitation no dark winds of anxietyThe one without clinging is akutobhaya one who faces no danger from any quarterThough dwelling in the midst of aging sickness and death he has reached what lies beyond aging sickness and deathThough the leaves fall and world systems shimmer he sees security everywhereThe Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creedsFounded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topicsIts publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddhas discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practiceThese works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first aroseIdeally education is the principal tool of human growth essential for transforming the unlettered child into a mature and responsible adultYet everywhere today both in the developed world and the developing world we can see that formal education is in serious troubleClassroom instruction has become so routinized and pat that children often consider school an exercise in patience rather than an adventure in learningEven the brightest and most conscientious students easily become restless and for many the only attractive escape routes lie along the dangerous roads of drugs sexual experimentation and outbursts of senseless violenceTeachers too find themselves in a dilemma dissatisfied with the system which they serve but unable to see a meaningful alternative to itOne major reason for this sad state of affairs is a loss of vision regarding the proper aims of educationThe word education literally means to bring forth which indicates that the true task of this process is to draw forth from the mind its innate potential for understandingThe urge to learn to know and comprehend is a basic human trait as intrinsic to our minds as hunger and thirst are to our bodiesIn todays turbulent world however this hunger to learn is often deformed by the same moral twists that afflict the wider societyIndeed just as our appetite for wholesome food is exploited by the fastfood industry with tasty snacks devoid of nutritional value so in our schools the minds of the young are deprived of the nutriment they need for healthy growthIn the name of education the students are passed through courses of standardized instruction intended to make them efficient servants of a demeaning social systemWhile such education may be necessary to guarantee societal stability it does little to fulfill the higher end of learning the illumination of the mind with the light of truth and goodnessA major cause of our educational problems lies in the commercialization of educationThe industrial growth model of society which today extends its tentacles even into the largely agrarian societies of South and Southeast Asia demands that the educational system prepare students to become productive citizens in an economic order governed by the drive to maximize profitsSuch a conception of the aim of education is quite different from that consistent with Buddhist principlesPractical efficiency certainly has its place in Buddhist education for Buddhism propounds a middle path which recognizes that our loftiest spiritual aspirations depend on a healthy body and a materially secure societyBut for Buddhism the practical side of education must be integrated with other requirements designed to bring the potentialities of human nature to maturity in the way envisioned by the BuddhaAbove all an educational policy guided by Buddhist principles must aim to instill values as much as to impart informationIt must be directed not merely toward developing social and commercial skills but toward nurturing in the students the seeds of spiritual nobilitySince todays secular society dictates that institutional education is to focus on preparing students for their careers in a Buddhist country like Sri Lanka the prime responsibility for imparting the principles of the Dhamma to the students naturally falls upon the Dhamma schoolsBuddhist education in the Dhamma schools should be concerned above all with the transformation of characterSince a persons character is molded by values and values are conveyed by inspiring ideals the first task to be faced by Buddhist educators is to determine the ideals of their educational systemIf we turn to the Buddhas discourses in search of the ideals proper to a Buddhist life we find five qualities that the Buddha often held up as the hallmarks of the model disciple whether monk or laypersonThese five qualities are faith virtue generosity learning and wisdomOf the five two  faith and generosity  relate primarily to the heart they are concerned with taming the emotional side of human natureTwo relate to the intellect learning and wisdomThe second virtue or morality partakes of both sides of the personality the first three preceptsabstinence from killing stealing and sexual abuse govern the emotions the precepts of abstinence from falsehood and intoxicants help to develop the clarity and honesty necessary for realization of truthThus Buddhist education aims at a parallel transformation of human character and intelligence holding both in balance and ensuring that both are brought to fulfillmentThe entire system of Buddhist education must be rooted in faith  faith in the Triple Gem and above all in the Buddha as the Fully Enlightened One the peerless teacher and supreme guide to right living and right understandingBased on this faith the students must be inspired to become accomplished in virtue by following the moral guidelines spelled out by the Five PreceptsThey must come to know the precepts well to understand the reasons for observing them and to know how to apply them in the difficult circumstances of human life todayMost importantly they should come to appreciate the positive virtues these precepts represent kindness honesty purity truthfulness and mental sobrietyThey must also acquire the spirit of generosity and selfsacrifice so essential for overcoming selfishness greed and the narrow focus on selfadvancement that dominates in presentday societyTo strive to fulfill the ideal of generosity is to develop compassion and renunciation qualities which sustained the Buddha throughout his entire careerIt is to learn that cooperation is greater than competition that selfsacrifice is more fulfilling than selfaggrandizement and that our true welfare is to be achieved through harmony and good will rather than by exploiting and dominating othersThe fourth and fifth virtues work closely togetherBy learning is meant a wide knowledge of the Buddhist texts which is to be acquired by extensive reading and persistent studyBut mere learning is not sufficientKnowledge only fulfills its proper purpose when it serves as a springboard for wisdom direct personal insight into the truth of the DhammaOf course the higher wisdom that consummates the Noble Eightfold Path does not lie within the domain of the Dhamma schoolThis wisdom must be generated by methodical mental training in calm and insight the two wings of Buddhist meditationBut Buddhist education can go far in laying the foundation for this wisdom by clarifying the principles that are to be penetrated by insightIn this task learning and wisdom are closely interwoven the former providing a basis for the latterWisdom arises by systematically working the ideas and principles learned through study into the fabric of the mind which requires deep reflection intelligent discussion and keen investigationIt is wisdom that the Buddha held up as the direct instrument of final liberation as the key for opening the doors to the Deathless and also as the infallible guide to success in meeting lifes mundane challengesThus wisdom is the crown and pinnacle of the entire system of Buddhist education and all the preliminary steps in a Buddhist educational system should be geared toward the flowering of this supreme virtueIt is with this step that education reaches completion that it becomes illumination in the truest and deepest sense as exclaimed by the Buddha on the night of his Awakening There arose in me vision knowledge wisdom understanding and lightThe Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creedsFounded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topicsIts publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddhas discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practiceThese works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first aroseThe Buddha often speaks of life in the world as an uneven path that constantly challenges us to walk evenlyEach day countless obstacles threaten to obstruct us to divert us to knock us off balance and steady mindfulness and firm determination are needed to avoid losing our way in the dark sidetracks of greed and angerTo stumble may be inevitable until we reach the great highway of the noble ones but with a clear vision of the goal and diligent effort we can avoid tumbling into the ditches that line the roadIf the task of practicing the Dhamma while living in the world has always been difficult our modern commercial culture has increased that difficulty acutelyNo longer is it the case that the desires to be tamed by Dhamma practice are the simple relatively innocent urges implanted in us by nature or stimulated by a basic subsistence economyLike unsuspecting fish caught in a net we move within the coils of a global social and economic order predicated on the premise that the essential human activity is the production and consumption of commoditiesFrom the standpoint of this system the final good of human life is to enjoy goods and the combined ingenuity of laboratory researchers and business magnates ensures that the goods to be enjoyed pour forth in inexhaustible varietyThe law that governs the global economic order is a simple one never allow desire to abateThe media of communication our modern miracle workers employ every strategy at their disposal to ensure that this calamity will not befall usThrough an uninterrupted series of messages they contrive to inflame our fantasies and titillate our appetites with an intensity that would banish the word enough from our vocabularyBut despite its mammoth dimensions and global reach the entire corporate culture rests upon a pervasive illusion that has become so widespread that it seems almost a selfevident truthThis is the idea that happiness is proportional to the quantity and monetary value of our possessionsWe are led to believe that by extending our financial assets by acquiring ownership over more and more goods we thereby come closer to the good to becoming happier more contented more deeply fulfilled human beingsYet this belief this assumption so rarely questioned is precisely the magical trick the sleightofhand deception that creates the prison cage of our miseryFor so long as we seek happiness by trying to quench desire the more we strengthen our bondage to the implacable demands of desireThe Suttas compare this process to the attempt to slake thirst by drinking sea water far from eliminating thirst the sea water will only increase itAt the heart of the consumerist culture we find this puzzling paradox that when we pursue wealth as an end in itself instead of arriving at true happiness we only seem further removed from itThis conclusion is easily confirmed if we examine the lives of those who come closest to fulfilling the consumerist dreamThose who enjoy the most abundant wealth and exercise the greatest power are rarely models of contentmentTo the contrary they often live on the edge of despair and can avoid slipping over the edge only by kindling again and again the quest for more wealth more power and more pleasure in a viciously degrading cycleWhen we reflect on this situation in the light of the Buddhas Teaching the reason for the perpetual failure of consumerism stands forth in clear reliefThe reason as the Buddha tells us so succinctly is that craving is the cause of sufferingBy its own nature craving is insatiable and thus the more our personal lives are governed by the assumption that the gratification of craving is the way to happiness the more we are bound to reap disappointmentWhen an entire society is founded upon the principles of consumerism upon the drive to produce and sell without concern for genuine human needs the outcome may well be catastrophicAccording to the Buddhas Teaching the way to genuine happiness does not lie in the indulgence of desire but in uncovering and eliminating the cause of suffering which in practical terms means the control and removal of cravingTo adopt such an approach is not a matter of forcing oneself into the mold of a cold puritanical asceticismThe Dhamma is a gradual teaching which instructs us how to order our lives in ways that are immediately rewarding and gratifyingIt does not promote personal development by demands for repression and selfaffliction but by gently offering us practical guidelines applicable to our present circumstances guidelines that help us grow toward genuine happiness and peaceFor those involved in civilian life seeking to raise a family and to forge their fortune within the world the Buddha does not enjoin ascetic withdrawal from social and civil obligationsHe recommends rather a life regulated by moral values aimed at the cultivation of wholesome qualities of mindTo his lay disciples he does not even decry the accumulation of wealth or extol poverty as a preferred alternativeHe recommends only that wealth be acquired by right livelihood and be utilized in meaningful ways to promote the happiness of oneself and othersIn his advice to the village headman Rasiya the Buddha describes three praiseworthy qualities in a householder who enjoys sense pleasures he acquires wealth righteously he makes himself happy and comfortable with the wealth thus earned and he shares his wealth and does meritorious deedsThe practice of meritorious deeds introduces a spiritual dimension to the proper employment of wealth a dimension based on the recognition that greater happiness comes from giving than from gainingTo give is not only a way to reduce our greed and attachment not only a way to acquire merit productive of future benefits but a directly visible source of joy which provides immediate confirmation of the central pillar on which the entire Dhamma rests that the path to happiness is one of relinquishment rather than one of accumulationBut while the Buddha praises the virtuous householder who possesses the above three qualities he does not stop thereHe introduces a fourth quality which distinguishes the virtuous lay followers into two groups on one side those who enjoy sense pleasures while remaining tied to them blind to the danger and unaware of an escape on the other those who enjoy sense pleasures without being tied to them seeing the danger and aware of an escapeIt is the second of these that the Buddha declares superiorThis pronouncement offers us an insight into the Buddhas final solution to the challenge posed by consumerismThe final solution is not a limp compromise between indulgence and virtue but a bold decisive step in the direction of detachment an inner renunciation that enables one to rise above the whole round of production and consumption even while living within its boundariesThe incentive for this movement comes from seeing the danger that there is no stable happiness to be gained by the pursuit of sense pleasures that sense pleasures give little satisfaction and are productive of much suffering Its completion comes from recognizing an escape that the removal of desire and lust brings an unshakable peace and freedom that is not contingent upon external circumstancesWhile it may be difficult to master desire for material things within the confines of household life the Buddha in his wisdom created a model for the greater Buddhist community to emulate indeed a model for the world as a wholeThis is the Sangha the order of monks and nuns pledged to a mode of living in which needs are reduced to the most basic and their satisfaction provided in the simplest waysWhile only a few may have the opportunity and urge to leave behind the household life in order to devote their energies unhindered to the task of selfpurification the ideal Buddhist social order forms a pyramid in which those at the apex dedicated to the ultimate goal of deliverance serve as the models and teachers for those still enmeshed in the demands of economic subsistenceBy their purity peacefulness and wisdom the mature monastics demonstrate to the lay community and to all those who have eyes to see where true happiness is to be foundThey show that happiness is to be found not in acquisition and selfindulgence but in freedom from desire in renunciation and detachmentWhether as lay disciple or as monk to enter the course of training that culminates in such freedom is to walk evenly within the uneven terrain of the worldIt is to recover even with ones initial steps a balance of living so sorely needed amidst the loud demands and hollow promises of our rapacious consumerist cultureThe Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creedsFounded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topicsIts publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddhas discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practiceThese works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first aroseThe traditional legend of the Buddhas quest for enlightenment tells us that throughout his youth and early manhood Prince Siddhattha the Bodhisatta lived in complete ignorance of the most elementary facts of human lifeHis father anxious to protect his sensitive son from exposure to suffering kept him an unwitting captive of nescienceIncarcerated in the splendor of his palace amply supplied with sensual pleasures and surrounded by merry friends the prince did not entertain even the faintest suspicion that life could offer anything other than an endless succession of amusements and festivitiesIt was only on that fateful day in his twentyninth year when curiosity led him out beyond the palace walls that he encountered the four divine messengers that were to change his destinyThe first three were the old man the sick man and the corpse which taught him the shocking truths of old age illness and death the fourth was a wandering ascetic who revealed to him the existence of a path whereby all suffering can be fully transcendedThis charming story which has nurtured the faith of Buddhists through the centuries enshrines at its heart a profound psychological truthIn the language of myth it speaks to us not merely of events that may have taken place centuries ago but of a process of awakening through which each of us must pass if the Dhamma is to come to life within ourselvesBeneath the symbolic veneer of the ancient legend we can see that Prince Siddhatthas youthful sojourn in the palace was not so different from the way in which most of us today pass our entire lives  often sadly until it is too late to strike out in a new directionOur homes may not be royal palaces and the wealth at our disposal may not approach anywhere near that of a North Indian rajah but we share with the young Prince Siddhattha a blissful oblivion to stark realities that are constantly thrusting themselves on our attentionIf the Dhamma is to be more than the bland humdrum background of a comfortable life if it is to become the inspiring sometimes grating voice that steers us on to the great path of awakening we ourselves must emulate the Bodhisatta in his process of maturationWe must join him on that journey outside the palace walls  the walls of our own selfassuring preconceptions  and see for ourselves the divine messengers we so often miss because our eyes are fixed on more important things ie on our mundane preoccupations and goalsThe Buddha says that there are few who are stirred by things that are truly stirring compared to those people far more numerous who are not so stirredThe spurs to awakening press in on us from all sides yet too often instead of acknowledging them we respond simply by putting on another layer of clothes to protect ourselves from their stingThis statement is not disproved even by the recent deluge of discussion and literature on aging lifethreatening illnesses and alternative approaches to death and dyingFor open and honest awareness is still not sufficient for the divine messengers to get their message acrossIn order for them to convey their message the message that can goad us on to the path to liberation something more is neededWe must confront aging illness and death not simply as inescapable realities with which we must somehow cope at the practical level but as envoys from the beyond from the far shore disclosing new dimensions of meaningThis disclosure takes place at two levelsFirst to become divine messengers the facts of aging illness and death must jolt us into an awareness of the fragile precarious nature of our normal daytoday livesThey must impress upon our minds the radical deficiency that runs through all our worldly concerns extending to conditioned existence in its totalityThereby they become windows opening upon the first noble truth the noble truth of suffering which the Buddha says comprises not only birth aging illness and death not only sorrow grief pain and misery but all the five aggregates of clinging that make up our beingintheworldWhen we meet the divine messengers at this level they become catalysts that can induce in us a profound internal transformationWe realize that because we are frail and inescapably mortal we must make drastic changes in our existential priorities and personal valuesInstead of letting our lives be consumed by transient trivia by things that are here today and gone tomorrow we must give weight to what really counts to aims and actions that will exert a lasting influence upon our longrange destinies  upon our final destiny in this life and upon our ultimate direction in the cycle of repeated birth and deathBefore such a revaluation takes place we generally live in a condition that the Buddha describes by the term pamada negligence or heedlessnessImagining ourselves immortal and the world our personal playground we devote our energies to the accumulation of wealth the enjoyment of sensual pleasures the achievement of status the quest for fame and renownThe remedy for heedlessness is the very same quality that was aroused in the Bodhisatta when he met the divine messengers in the streets of KapilavatthuThis quality called in Pali samvega is a sense of urgency an inner commotion or shock which does not allow us to rest content with our habitual adjustment to the worldInstead it drives us on out of our cozy palaces and into unfamiliar jungles to work out with diligence an authentic solution to our existential plightIt is at this point that the second function of the divine messengers comes to prominenceFor aging sickness and death are not only emblems of the unsatisfactory nature of mundane existence but pointers to a deeper reality that lies beyondIn the traditional legend the old man the sick man and the corpse are gods in disguise they have been sent down to earth from the highest heaven to awaken the Bodhisatta to his momentous mission and once they have delivered their message they resume their celestial formsThe final word of the Dhamma is not surrender not an injunction to resign ourselves stoically to old age sickness and deathThis is the preliminary message the announcement that our house is ablazeThe final message is other an ebullient cry that there is a place of safety an open field beyond the flames and a clear exit sign pointing the way of escapeIf in this process of awakening we must meet old age sickness and death face to face that is because the place of safety can be reached only by honest confrontation with the stark truths about human existenceWe cannot reach safety by pretending that the flames that engulf our home are nothing but bouquets of flowers we must see them as they are as real flamesWhen however we do look at the divine messengers squarely without embarrassment or fear we will find that their faces undergo an unexpected metamorphosisBefore our eyes by subtle degrees they change into another face  the face of the Buddha with its serene smile of triumph over the army of Mara over the demons of Desire and DeathThe divine messengers point to what lies beyond the transient to a dimension of reality where there is no more aging no more sickness and no more deathThis is the goal and final destination of the Buddhist path  Nibbana the Unaging the Unailing the DeathlessIt is to direct us there that the divine messengers have appeared in our midst and the good news of deliverance is their messageThe Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creedsFounded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topicsIts publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddhas discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practiceThese works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first aroseOver the past three decades the world has been dramatically transformed in ways that none but a handful of prophets and visionaries could have foreseen even a hundred years agoFrom a multitude of loosely connected nationstates it has quickly evolved into a tightly knit global community linked together by rapid means of transportation and instantaneous media of communicationOld barriers of space and time have dropped away confronting us with new vistas of selfunderstanding and forcing us to recognize the hard truth that we all face a common human destinyThe claims to special privilege of a particular people nation race or religion now sound hollowAs occupants of the same planet  a bright blue jewel suspended in the frigid blackness of infinite space  we either flourish together or perish togetherIn the long run between these two alternatives no middle ground is feasibleBut while our proud technology has enabled us to split the atom and unscramble genetic codes the daily newspapers remind us that our mastery over the external world has not ushered in the utopia that we had so confidently anticipatedTo the contrary the shrinking of global boundaries has given rise to fresh problems of enormous scope  social political and psychological problems so grave that they throw into question the continued survival of our planet and our raceThe problems that challenge the global community today are legionThey include the depletion of the earths natural resources and the despoliation of the environment regional tensions of ethnic and religious character the continuing spread of nuclear weapons disregard for human rights the widening gap between the rich and the poorWhile such problems have been extensively discussed from social political and economic points of view they also cry out for critical examination from a religious viewpoint as wellA spiritually sensitive mind would not look upon these problems as isolated phenomena to be treated by piecemeal solutions but would insist on probing into unexplored areas for hidden roots and subtle interconnectionsFrom such a perspective what is most striking when we reflect upon our global ailments as a whole is their essentially symptomatic characterBeneath their outward diversity they appear to be so many manifestations of a common root of a deep and hidden spiritual malignancy infecting our social organismThis common root might be briefly characterized as a stubborn insistence on placing shortterm narrowly considered selfinterests above the longrange vital good of the broader human communityThe multitude of social ills that assail us cannot be adequately accounted for without bringing into view the powerful human drives that lie behind themAnd what is distinctive about these drives is that they derive from a pernicious distortion in the functioning of the human mind which sends us blindly in pursuit of factional divisive circumscribed ends even when such pursuits threaten to be ultimately selfdestructiveThe most valuable contribution that the Buddhas teaching can make to helping us resolve the great dilemmas facing us today is twofold first its uncompromisingly realistic analysis of the psychological springs of human suffering and second the ethically ennobling discipline it proposes as the solutionThe Buddha explains that the hidden springs of human suffering in both the personal and social dimensions of our lives consist of three mental factors called the unwholesome rootsThese three roots  which may be regarded as the three prongs of the egoconsciousness  are greed hatred and delusionThe aim of the Buddhist spiritual path is to gradually subdue these three evil roots by cultivating the mental factors that are directly opposed to themThese are the three wholesome roots namely nongreed which is expressed as generosity detachment and contentment nonhatred which becomes manifested as lovingkindness compassion patience and forgiveness and nondelusion which arises as wisdom insight and understandingIf we contemplate in the light of the Buddhist analysis the dangers that hang over us in our globalized world order it will become clear that they have assumed such precarious proportions due to the unrestrained proliferation of greed hatred and delusion as the basis of human conductIt is not that these dark forces of the mind were first awakened with the Industrial Revolution they have indeed been the deep springs of so much suffering and destructiveness since time immemorialBut the onesided development of humankind  the development of outward control over nature coupled with the almost complete neglect of any attempts to achieve selfunderstanding  has today given the unwholesome roots an awesome unprecedented power that veers ever closer to the catastrophicThrough the prevalence of greed the world has become transformed into a global marketplace where human beings are reduced to the status of consumers even commodities and where materialistic desires are provoked at volatile intensitiesThrough the prevalence of hatred which is often kindled by competing interests governed by greed national and ethnic differences become the breeding ground of suspicion and enmity exploding in violence and destruction in cruelty and brutality in endless cycles of revengeDelusion sustains the other two unwholesome roots by giving rise to false beliefs dogmatic views and philosophical ideologies devised in order to promote and justify patterns of conduct motivated by greed and hatredIn the new era marked by the triumph of the freemarket economy the most pernicious delusion that hangs over us is the belief that the path to human fulfillment lies in the satisfaction of artificially induced desiresSuch a project can only provoke more and more greed leading to more and more reckless degrees of selfishness and from the clash of selfseeking factions the result will necessarily be strife and violenceIf there is any validity in the Buddhist diagnosis of the human situation the task incumbent on humankind today is clearThe entire drive of contemporary civilization has been toward the conquest and mastery of the external worldScience probes ever more deeply into the hidden secrets of matter and life while technology and industry join hands to harness the discoveries of science for their practical applicationsNo doubt science and technology have made appreciable contributions toward alleviating human misery and have vastly improved the quality of our livesYet because the human mind the ultimate agent behind all the monumental achievements of science has pitifully neglected itself our patterns of perception motivations and drives still move in the same dark channels in which they moved in earlier centuries  the channels of greed hatred and delusion  only now equipped with more powerful instruments of destructionAs long as we continue to shirk the task of turning our attention within toward the understanding and mastery of our own minds our impressive accomplishments in the external sphere will fail to yield their proper fruitsWhile at one level they may make life safer and more comfortable at another they will spawn baneful consequences of increasing severity and peril even despite our best intentionsFor the human race to flourish in the global age and to live together happily and peacefully on this shrinking planet the inescapable challenge facing us is that of coming to understand and transform ourselvesIt is here that the Buddhas Teaching becomes especially timely even for those who are not prepared to embrace the full range of Buddhist religious faith and philosophical doctrineIn its diagnosis of greed hatred and delusion as the underlying causes of human suffering the BuddhaDhamma enables us to see the hidden roots of our private and collective predicamentsBy defining a practical path of training which helps us to remove what is harmful and to foster the growth of what is beneficial the Teaching offers us an effective remedy for tackling the problems of the globe in the one place where they are directly accessible to us in our own mindsBecause it places the burden of responsibility for our redemption on ourselves calling for personal effort and energetic application to the taming of the mind the Buddhas Teaching will inevitably have a bitter edgeBut by providing an acute diagnosis of our illness and a precise path to deliverance it also offers us in this global era an elevating message of hopeThe Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message

Nyanaponika Mahathera passed away peacefully at his residence the Forest Hermitage in the Udawattakele Reserve KandyHis death took place on the last day of the Vassa the annual rains retreat observed by Buddhist monks since the days of the Buddha in the quiet of the forest he loved so much before the screeching of the fruit bats and the chatter of the monkeys could herald the approach of dawnThree months earlier VenNyanaponika had celebrated his rd birthday frail but still in remarkably good health for his advanced ageIn late August however the wheel of aging accelerated rapidly ushering in a combination of illnesses that ended two months later in his demiseThe passing away of VenNyanaponika marks the end of an era both in the annals of the Western encounter with Buddhism and in the history of the BPSAmong Western Buddhists he was perhaps the last survivor of what might be called the second generation of pioneers comprising those who forged their initial contacts with the Dhamma during the s and sOrdained as a pupil of the illustrious German elder VenNyanatiloka Mahathera in VenNyanaponika was for decades the seniormost Theravada Buddhist monk of Western origin in the worldOn

which he belongedThrough his own writings and in his editorship of the BPS VenNyanaponika played a momentous role in shaping the expression of Theravada Buddhism appropriate for the latter half of the twentieth centuryGifted with keen intelligence a profound grasp of the Dhamma and extraordinary sensitivity to the needs of his fellow human beings he endeavored both in his personal writings and in his publication policy to articulate a vision of the Buddhas teachings that underscored its crucial relevance to humanity in the present ageThe early decades of the century provided the background to this visionIn his own mature years he had witnessed two world wars countless smallscale social conflicts and the breakdown of existential meaning in the lives of so many thoughtful wellintentioned peopleAgainst this background he constantly sought to emphasize from different angles those aspects of the Buddhas teachings that speak most directly and meaningfully to men and women earnestly searching for clear spiritual directionHis writings though sparse and compact in expression constitute a veritable Guide for the Perplexed in this age of confusion when it often seems that the only alternative to rampant materialism and religious fundamentalism is the bewildering potpourri of cults and fads that make up the spiritual supermarketVenNyanaponika did not pursue his aim of sharing the Dhamma by sweetening and diluting the original doctrine in order to make it more palatableHis interpretations of the Dhamma always flowed from a clear personal discernment of its innermost essence  the Four Noble Truths and the three characteristics  and were built upon a solid respect for the commentarial tradition that has come down from the ancient eldersHe based his writings not only upon sound and thorough scholarship but also upon a penetrative understanding of the human condition rooted in a deep sympathy with his fellow human beingsHence his books and essays go far beyond the repetition of stale stereotyped formulations of the teachingThey refract the Dhamma through the prism of a highly astute Western mind shaped by the best qualities of the European intellectual heritage presenting it in a way intended to teach to transform and to edify his readers at the very core of their beingHis appreciation of the Buddhas teachings was as comprehensive as it was profound as vitally direct as it was systematic and orderlyIn his view the Dhamma offers a sublime ethics that can provide a psychological basis for morality in place of a theological oneHe found the teaching fully acceptable to the most critical demands of rational thought yet capable of providing sustenance for the nourishment of our emotional life so badly impoverished by scientific objectivism and economic consumerismAbove all he stressed the importance of selfknowledge and inner selftransformation and the role of Buddhist meditation as a means for knowing developing and liberating the mindHis book The Heart of Buddhist Meditation translated into seven languages still remains today after years the clearest most thorough and most convincing contemporary account of the Buddhas way of mindfulnessThe supreme expression of VenNyanaponikas endeavor to share the Dhamma with others was his commitment to the work of the BPS which he helped to found and served as its first Secretary first President and longtime EditorFrom the inception of the BPS in VenNyanaponika dedicated himself completely to the work of the SocietyDuring the first three years of its life in fact the Society was quartered entirely in his study at the Forest HermitageDuring this period he himself personally shouldered a large portion of the routine paperwork though he soon divested himself of this when Richard Abeyasekera assumed the position of General Secretary leaving him more time to attend to the editorial sideAs Editor he carefully examined every manuscript to ensure that BPS publications accurately reflect the spirit of the original Buddhist teachingsIt was above all his sagacious guidance his overflowing compassion and his dedication to the Dhamma that transformed the BPS into a major Buddhist publisher bringing the teachings of the Buddha to over eighty countries around the worldEven after his retirement from the editorship and from the presidency as our Patron he continued to take an active interest in the Societys developmentWe always apprised him of any important decision or line of policy that required consideration and he was always ready to offer his wise adviceOn a personal note I must state that with the passing of VenNyanaponika I have lost my lifes closest friend my teacher and spiritual guideThe last ten years during which I had the privilege to live with him and to look after him at the Forest Hermitage were indeed a blessing hard to encounter in the round of rebirthsYet although we shall miss his wise and loving presence his subtle humor and sympathetic counsel it is not sorrow and grief that we should feel at his parting but rather a serene joy over a noble character that embodied the most worthy human traits and immense gratitude for a life supremely well lived for the welfare and happiness of manyBy the vast merits of his lifes achievements may VenNyanaponika be able to pursue his aspiration unhindered in future existences and may he attain the supreme bliss of NibbanaThe Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creedsFounded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topicsIts publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddhas discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practiceThese works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first aroseThe Buddhas teaching repeatedly cautions us about the dangers in clinging  in clinging to possessions clinging to pleasures clinging to people clinging to viewsThe Buddha sounds such words of warning because he discerns in clinging a potent cause of suffering and he thus advises us that the price we must pay to arrive at the far shore of liberation is the relinquishment of every type of clingingIn a move that at first glance may even seem selfdestructive on the part of a religious founder the Buddha says that we should not cling even to his teachings that even the wholesome principles of the Dhamma have to be treated like the makeshift raft used to carry us across the streamSuch astringent words of advice can easily be misconstrued and if misconstrued the consequences may be even more bitter than if we simply disregard themOne particular misinterpretation into which newcomers to the Dhamma are especially prone to fall is to hold that the Buddhas counsel to transcend all views means that even the doctrines of Buddhism are ultimately of no vital importanceFor these doctrines too it is said are merely views intellectual constructs filaments of thought which may have been meaningful in the context of ancient Indian cosmology but have no binding claims on us todayAfter all arent the words and phrases of the Buddhist texts simply that  words and phrases  and arent we admonished to get beyond words and phrases in order to arrive at direct experience the only thing that really countsAnd doesnt the Buddha enjoin us in the Kalama Sutta to judge things for ourselves and to let our own experience be the criterion for deciding what we will acceptSuch an approach to the Dhamma may be sweet to chew upon and easy to digest but we also need to beware of its effect upon our total spiritual organismToo often this kind of slippery reasoning provides simply a convenient excuse for adhering at a subtle level of the mind to ideas which are fundamentally antithetical to the DhammaWe hang on to such ideas not because they are truly edifying but in order to protect ourselves from the radical challenge with which the Buddhas message confronts usIn effect such claims though apparently aimed at safeguarding living experience from the encroachment of stodgy intellectualism may be in reality a clever intellectual ploy for refusing to examine cherished assumptions  assumptions we cherish primarily because they shield deeprooted desires we do not want to expose to the tonic influence of the DhammaWhen we approach the Buddhas teachings we should bear in mind that its vast array of doctrines have not been devised as elaborate exercises in philosophical sleight of handThey are propounded because they constitute right view and right view stands at the head of the Noble Eightfold Path the chisel to be used to cut away the dross of wrong views and confused thoughts that impede the light of wisdom from illumining our mindsIn the presentday world far more than in the ancient Ganges Valley wrong views have gained widespread currency and assumed more baneful forms than earlier epochs ever could have imaginedToday they are no longer the province of a few eccentric philosophers and their cliquesThey have become rather a major determinant of cultural and social attitudes a molder of the moral spirit of the age a driving force behind economic empires and international relationsUnder such circumstances right view is our candle against the dark our compass in the desert our isle above the floodWithout a clear understanding of the truths enunciated by right view and without a keen awareness of the areas where these truths collide with popular opinion it is only too easy to stumble in the dark to get stranded among the sand dunes to be swept away from ones position above the delugeBoth right view and wrong view though cognitive in character do not remain locked up in a purely cognitive space of their ownOur views exercise an enormously potent influence upon all areas of our lives and the Buddha in his genius recognized this when he placed right view and wrong view respectively at the beginning of the good and evil pathways of lifeViews flow out and interlock with the practical dimension of our lives at many levels they determine our values they give birth to our goals and aspirations they guide our choices in morally difficult dilemmasWrong view promotes wrong intentions wrong modes of conduct leads us in pursuit of a deceptive type of freedomIt draws us toward the freedom of license by which we feel justified in casting off moral restraint for the sake of satisfying transient but harmful impulsesThough we may then pride ourselves on our spontaneity and creativity may convince ourselves that we have discovered our true individuality one with clear sight will see that this freedom is only a more subtle bondage to the chains of craving and delusionRight view even in its elementary form as a recognition of the moral law of kamma the capacity of our deeds to bring results becomes our gentle guide toward true freedomAnd when it matures into an accurate grasp of the three signs of existence of dependent arising of the Four Noble Truths it then becomes our navigator up the mountain slope of final deliveranceIt will lead us to right intentions to virtuous conduct to mental purification and to the cloudless peak of unobstructed visionAlthough we must eventually learn to let go of this guide in order to stand confidently on our own feet without its astute eye and willing hand we would only meander in the foothills oblivious to the peakThe attainment of right view is not simply a matter of assenting to a particular roster of doctrinal formulas or of skill in juggling an impressive array of cryptic Pali termsThe attainment of right view is at its core essentially a matter of understanding  of understanding in a deeply personal way the vital truths of existence upon which our lives devolveRight view aims at the big pictureIt seeks to comprehend our place in the total scheme of things and to discern the laws that govern the unfolding of our lives for better or for worseThe ground of right view is the Perfect Enlightenment of the Buddha and by striving to rectify our view we seek nothing less than to align our own understanding of the nature of existence with that of the Buddhas EnlightenmentRight view may begin with concepts and propositional knowledge but it does not end with themThrough study deep reflection and meditative development it gradually becomes transmuted into wisdom the wisdom of insight that can cut asunder the beginningless fetters of the mindThe Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creedsFounded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topicsIts publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddhas discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practiceThese works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first aroseLike the Roman god Janus every person faces simultaneously in two opposite directionsWith one face of our consciousness we gaze in upon ourselves and become aware of ourselves as individuals motivated by a deep urge to avoid suffering and to secure our own wellbeing and happinessWith the other face we gaze out upon the world and discover that our lives are thoroughly relational that we exist as nodes in a vast net of relationships with other beings whose fate is tied up with our ownBecause of the relational structure of our existence we are engaged in a perpetual twoway interaction with the world the influence of the world presses in upon ourselves shaping and altering our own attitudes and dispositions while our own attitudes and dispositions flow out into the world a force that affects the lives of others for better or for worseThis seamless interconnection between the inner and outer domains acquires a particular urgency for us today owing to the rampant deterioration in ethical standards that sweeps across the globeSuch moral decline is as widespread in those societies which enjoy a comfortable measure of stability and prosperity as it is in those countries where poverty and desperation make moral infringements an integral aspect of the struggle for survivalOf course we should not indulge in pastelcolored fantasies about the past imagining that we lived in a Garden of Eden until the invention of the steam engineThe driving forces of the human heart have remained fairly constant through the ages and the toll they have taken in human misery surpasses calculationBut what we find today is a strange paradox that would be interesting if it were not sinister while there appears to be a much wider verbal acknowledgment of the primacy of moral and human values there is at the same time more blatant disregard for the lines of conduct such values implyThis undermining of traditional ethical values is in part a result of the internationalization of commerce and the global penetration of virtually all media of communicationVested interests in quest of wider loops of power and expanding profits mount a sustained campaign aimed at exploiting our moral vulnerabilityThis campaign proceeds at full pace invading every nook and corner of our lives with little regard for the longterm consequences for the individual and societyThe results are evident in the problems that we face problems that respect no national boundaries rising crime rates spreading drug addiction ecological devastation child labor and prostitution smuggling and pornography the decline of the family as the unit of loving trust and moral educationThe Buddhas teaching at its core is a doctrine of liberation that provides us with the tools for cutting through the fetters that keep us bound to this world of suffering the round of repeated birthsAlthough the quest for liberation by practice of the Dhamma depends on individual effort this quest necessarily takes place within a social environment and is thus subject to all the influences helpful or harmful imposed upon us by that environmentThe Buddhist training unfolds in the three stages of morality concentration and wisdom each the foundation for the other purified moral conduct facilitates the attainment of purified concentration and the concentrated mind facilitates the attainment of liberating wisdomThe basis of the entire Buddhist training is thus purified conduct and firm adherence to the code of training rules one has undertaken  the Five Precepts in the case of a lay Buddhist  is the necessary means for safeguarding the purity of ones conductLiving as we do in an era when we are provoked through every available channel to deviate from the norms of rectitude and when social unrest economic hardships and political conflict further fuel volatile emotions the need for extra protection becomes especially imperative protection for oneself protection for the worldThe Buddha points to two mental qualities as the underlying safeguards of morality thus as the protectors of both the individual and society as a wholeThese two qualities are called in Pali hiri and ottappaHiri is an innate sense of shame over moral transgression ottappa is moral dread fear of the results of wrongdoingThe Buddha calls these two states the bright guardians of the worldHe gives them this designation because as long as these two states prevail in peoples hearts the moral standards of the world remain intact while when their influence wanes the human world falls into unabashed promiscuity and violence becoming almost indistinguishable from the animal realmWhile moral shame and fear of wrongdoing are united in the common task of protecting the mind from moral defilement they differ in their individual characteristics and modes of operationHiri the sense of shame has an internal reference it is rooted in selfrespect and induces us to shrink from wrongdoing out of a feeling of personal honorOttappa fear of wrongdoing has an external orientationIt is the voice of conscience that warns us of the dire consequences of moral transgression blame and punishment by others the painful kammic results of evil deeds the impediment to our desire for liberation from sufferingAcariya Buddhaghosa illustrates the difference between the two with the simile of an iron rod smeared with excrement at one end and heated to a glow at the other end hiri is like ones disgust at grabbing the rod in the place where it is smeared with excrement ottappa is like ones fear of grabbing it in the place where it is red hotIn the presentday world with its secularization of all values such notions as shame and fear of wrong are bound to appear antiquated relics from a puritanical past when superstition and dogma manacled our rights to uninhibited selfexpressionYet the Buddhas stress on the importance of hiri and ottappa was based on a deep insight into the different potentialities of human natureHe saw that the path to deliverance is a struggle against the current and that if we are to unfold the minds capacities for wisdom purity and peace then we need to keep the powderkeg of the defilements under the watchful eyes of diligent sentinelsThe project of selfcultivation which the Buddha proclaims as the means to liberation from suffering requires that we keep a critical watch over the movements of our minds both on occasions when they motivate bodily and verbal deeds and when they remain inwardly absorbed with their own preoccupationsTo exercise such selfscrutiny is an aspect of heedfulness which the Buddha states is the path to the DeathlessIn the practice of selfexamination the sense of shame and fear of wrongdoing play a crucial roleThe sense of shame spurs us to overcome unwholesome mental states because we recognize that such states are blemishes on our characterThey detract from the inward loftiness of character to be fashioned by the practice of the Dhamma the stature of the ariyans or noble ones who shine resplendent like lotus flowers upon the lake of the worldFear of wrongdoing bids us to retreat from morally risky thoughts and actions because we recognize that such deeds are seeds with the potency to yield fruits fruits that inevitably will be bitterThe Buddha asserts that whatever evil arises springs from a lack of shame and fear of wrong while all virtuous deeds spring from the sense of shame and fear of wrongBy cultivating within ourselves the qualities of moral shame and fear of wrongdoing we not only accelerate our own progress along the path to deliverance but also contribute our share toward the protection of the worldGiven the intricate interconnections that hold between all living forms to make the sense of shame and fear of wrong the guardians of our own minds is to make ourselves guardians of the worldAs the roots of morality these two qualities sustain the entire efficacy of the Buddhas liberating path as the safeguards of personal decency they at the same time preserve the dignity of the human raceThe Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creedsFounded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topicsIts publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddhas discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practiceThese works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first aroseThe practice of the Buddhas teaching is most commonly depicted by the image of a journey the eight factors of the Noble Eightfold Path constituting the royal roadway along which the disciple must travelThe Buddhist scriptures however illustrate the quest for liberation in a variety of other ways each of which throws a different spotlight on the nature of the practiceAlthough the alternative formulations inevitably draw upon the same basic set of mental factors as those that enter into the eightfold path they structure these factors around a different root metaphor  an image which evokes its own particular range of associations and highlights different aspects of the endeavor to reach the cessation of sufferingOne of the groups of factors given special prominence in the Suttas included by the Buddha among the thirtyseven requisites of enlightenment is the five spiritual faculties the faculties of faith energy mindfulness concentration and wisdomThe term indriya faculties applied to this group as a whole is derived from the name of the ancient Vedic god Indra ruler of the devas and the term accordingly suggests the divinelike quality of control and dominationThe five faculties are so designated because they exercise control in their own specific compartments of the spiritual lifeAs the god Indra vanquished the demons and attained supremacy among the gods so each of the five faculties is called upon to subdue a particular mental disability and to marshal the corresponding potency of mind toward the breakthrough to final enlightenmentThe notion of faculty is partly akin to the ancient Greek conception of the virtuesLike the virtues the faculties are active powers which coordinate and canalize our natural energies directing them toward the achievement of an inward harmony and balance essential to our true happiness and peaceSince the faculties are to serve as agents of inward control this implies that apart from their restraining influence our nature is not under our own controlLeft to itself without the guidance of a superior source of instruction the mind is a prey to forces that swell up from within itself dark forces which hold us in subjection and prevent us from attaining our own highest welfare and genuine goodThese forces are the defilementsAs long as we live and act under their dominion we are not our own masters but passive pawns driven by our blind desires into courses of conduct that promise fulfillment but in the end lead only to misery and bondageTrue freedom necessarily involves the attainment of inner autonomy the strength to withstand the pushes and pulls of our appetites and this is accomplished precisely by the development of the five spiritual facultiesThe qualities that exercise the function of faculties are of humble origin appearing initially in mundane roles in the course of our everyday livesIn these humble guises they manifest as trustful confidence in higher values as vigorous effort toward the good as attentive awareness as focused concentration and as intelligent understandingThe Buddhas teaching does not implant these dispositions into the mind from scratch but harnesses those preexistent capacities of our nature toward a supramundane goal  toward the realization of the Unconditioned  thereby conferring upon them a transcendental significanceBy assigning them a task that reveals their immense potential and by guiding them along a track that can bring that potential to fulfillment the Dhamma transforms these commonplace mental factors into spiritual faculties mighty instruments in the quest for liberation that can fathom the profoundest laws of existence and unlock the doors to the DeathlessIn the practice of the Dhamma each of these faculties has simultaneously to perform its own specific function and to harmonize with the other faculties to establish the balance needed for clear comprehensionThe five come to fullest maturity in the contemplative development of insight the direct road to awakeningIn this process the faculty of faith provides the element of inspiration and aspiration which steers the mind away from the quagmire of doubt and settles it with serene trust in the Triple Gem as the supreme basis of deliveranceThe faculty of energy kindles the fire of sustained endeavor that burns up obstructions and brings to maturity the factors that ripen in awakeningThe faculty of mindfulness contributes clear awareness the antidote to carelessness and the prerequisite of penetrationThe faculty of concentration holds the beam of attention steadily focused on the rise and fall of bodily and mental events calm and composedAnd the faculty of wisdom which the Buddha calls the crowning virtue among all the requisites of enlightenment drives away the darkness of ignorance and lights up the true characteristics of phenomenaJust as much as the five faculties considered individually each perform their own unique tasks in their respective domains as a group they accomplish the collective task of establishing inner balance and harmonyTo achieve this balanced striving the faculties are divided into two pairs in each of which each member must counter the undesirable tendency inherent in the other thus enabling it to actualize its fullest potentialThe faculties of faith and wisdom form one pair aimed at balancing the capacities for devotion and comprehension the faculties of energy and concentration form a second pair aimed at balancing the capacities for active exertion and calm recollectionAbove the complementary pairs stands the faculty of mindfulness which protects the mind from extremes and ensures that the members of each pair hold one another in a mutually restraining mutually enriching tensionBorn of humble origins in everyday functions of the mind through the Dhamma the five faculties acquire a transcendent destinyWhen they are developed and regularly cultivated says the Master they lead to the Deathless are bound for the Deathless culminate in the DeathlessThe Buddhist Publication Society is an approved

practiceThese works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first aroseOne of the most challenging issues facing Theravada Buddhism in recent years has been the encounter between classical Theravada vipassana meditation and the nondualistic contemplative traditions best represented by Advaita Vedanta and Mahayana BuddhismResponses to this encounter have spanned the extremes ranging from vehement confrontation all the way to attempts at synthesis and hybridizationWhile the present essay cannot pretend to illuminate all the intricate and subtle problems involved in this sometimes volatile dialogue I hope it may contribute a few sparks of light from a canonically oriented Theravada perspectiveMy first preliminary remark would be to insist that a system of meditative practice does not constitute a selfcontained disciplineAny authentic system of spiritual practice is always found embedded within a conceptual matrix that defines the problems the practice is intended to solve and the goal toward which it is directedHence the merging of techniques grounded in incompatible conceptual frameworks is fraught with riskAlthough such mergers may appease a predilection for experimentation or eclecticism it seems likely that their longterm effect will be to create a certain cognitive dissonance that will reverberate through the deeper levels of the psyche and stir up even greater confusionMy second remark would be to point out simply that nondualistic spiritual traditions are far from consistent with each other but comprise rather a wide variety of views profoundly different and inevitably colored by the broader conceptual contours of the philosophies which encompass themFor the Vedanta nonduality means the absence of an ultimate distinction between the Atman the innermost self and Brahman the divine reality the underlying ground of the worldFrom the standpoint of the highest realization only one ultimate reality exists  which is simultaneously Atman and Brahman  and the aim of the spiritual quest is to know that ones own true self the Atman is the timeless reality which is Being Awareness BlissSince all schools of Buddhism reject the idea of the Atman none can accept the nondualism of VedantaFrom the perspective of the Theravada tradition any quest for the discovery of selfhood whether as a permanent individual self or as an absolute universal self would have to be dismissed as a delusion a metaphysical blunder born from a failure to properly comprehend the nature of concrete experienceAccording to the Pali Suttas the individual being is merely a complex unity of the five aggregates which are all stamped with the three marks of impermanence suffering and selflessnessAny postulation of selfhood in regard to this compound of transient conditioned phenomena is an instance of personality view the most basic fetter that binds beings to the round of rebirthsThe attainment of liberation for Buddhism does not come to pass by the realization of a true self or absolute I but through the dissolution of even the subtlest sense of selfhood in relation to the five aggregates the abolition of all Imaking minemaking and underlying tendencies to conceitThe Mahayana schools despite their great differences concur in upholding a thesis that from the Theravada point of view borders on the outrageousThis is the claim that there is no ultimate difference between samsara and Nirvana defilement and purity ignorance and enlightenmentFor the Mahayana the enlightenment which the Buddhist path is designed to awaken consists precisely in the realization of this nondualistic perspectiveThe validity of conventional dualities is denied because the ultimate nature of all phenomena is emptiness the lack of any substantial or intrinsic reality and hence in their emptiness all the diverse apparently opposed phenomena posited by mainstream Buddhist doctrine finally coincide All dharmas have one nature which is nonatureThe teaching of the Buddha as found in the Pali canon does not endorse a philosophy of nondualism of any variety nor I would add can a nondualistic perspective be found lying implicit within the Buddhas discoursesAt the same time however I would not maintain that the Pali Suttas propose dualism the positing of duality as a metaphysical hypothesis aimed at intellectual assentI would characterize the Buddhas intent in the Canon as primarily pragmatic rather than speculative though I would also qualify this by saying that this pragmatism does not operate in a philosophical void but finds its grounding in the nature of actuality as the Buddha penetrated it in his enlightenmentIn contrast to the nondualistic systems the Buddhas approach does not aim at the discovery of a unifying principle behind or beneath our experience of the worldInstead it takes the concrete fact of living experience with all its buzzing confusion of contrasts and tensions as its starting point and framework within which it attempts to diagnose the central problem at the core of human existence and to offer a way to its solutionHence the polestar of the Buddhist path is not a final unity but the extinction of suffering which brings the resolution of the existential dilemma at its most fundamental levelWhen we investigate our experience exactly as it presents itself we find that it is permeated by a number of critically important dualities with profound implications for the spiritual questThe Buddhas teaching as recorded in the Pali Suttas fixes our attention unflinchingly upon these dualities and treats their acknowledgment as the indispensable basis for any honest search for liberating wisdomIt is precisely these antitheses  of good and evil suffering and happiness wisdom and ignorance  that make the quest for enlightenment and deliverance such a vitally crucial concernAt the peak of the pairs of opposites stands the duality of the conditioned and the Unconditioned samsara as the round of repeated birth and death wherein all is impermanent subject to change and liable to suffering and Nibbana as the state of final deliverance the unborn ageless and deathlessAlthough Nibbana even in the early texts is definitely cast as an ultimate reality and not merely as an ethical or psychological state there is not the least insinuation that this reality is metaphysically indistinguishable at some profound level from its manifest opposite samsaraTo the contrary the Buddhas repeated lesson is that samsara is the realm of suffering governed by greed hatred and delusion wherein we have shed tears greater than the waters of the ocean while Nibbana is irreversible release from samsara to be attained by demolishing greed hatred and delusion and by relinquishing all conditioned existenceThus the Theravada makes the antithesis of samsara and Nibbana the starting point of the entire quest for deliveranceEven more it treats this antithesis as determinative of the final goal which is precisely the transcendence of samsara and the attainment of liberation in NibbanaWhere Theravada differs significantly from the Mahayana schools which also start with the duality of samsara and Nirvana is in its refusal to regard this polarity as a mere preparatory lesson tailored for those with blunt faculties to be eventually superseded by some higher realization of nondualityFrom the standpoint of the Pali Suttas even for the Buddha and the arahants suffering and its cessation samsara and Nibbana remain distinctSpiritual seekers still exploring the different contemplative traditions commonly assume that the highest spiritual teaching must be one which posits a metaphysical unity as the philosophical foundation and final goal of the quest for enlightenmentTaking this assumption to be axiomatic they may then conclude that the Pali Buddhist teaching with its insistence on the sober assessment of dualities is deficient or provisional requiring fulfillment by a nondualistic realizationFor those of such a bent the dissolution of dualities in a final unity will always appear more profound and completeHowever it is just this assumption that I would challengeI would assert by reference to the Buddhas own original teaching that profundity and completeness need not be bought at the price of distinctions that they can be achieved at the highest level while preserving intact the dualities and diversity so strikingly evident to mature reflection on the worldI would add moreover that the teaching which insists on recognizing real dualities as they are is finally more satisfactoryThe reason it is more satisfactory despite its denial of the minds yearning for a comprehensive unity is because it takes account of another factor which overrides in importance the quest for unityThis something else is the need to remain grounded in actualityWhere I think the teaching of the Buddha as preserved in the Theravada tradition surpasses all other attempts to resolve the spiritual dilemmas of humanity is in its persistent refusal to sacrifice actuality for unityThe Buddhas Dhamma does not point us toward an allembracing absolute in which the tensions of daily existence dissolve in metaphysical oneness or inscrutable emptinessIt points us rather toward actuality as the final sphere of comprehension toward things as they really areAbove all it points us toward the Four Noble Truths of suffering its origin its cessation and the way to its cessation as the liberating proclamation of things as they really areThese four truths the Buddha declares are noble truths and what makes them noble truths is precisely that they are actual undeviating invariableIt is the failure to face the actuality of these truths that has caused us to wander for so long through the long course of samsaraIt is by penetrating these truths exactly as they are that one can reach the true consummation of the spiritual quest making an end to sufferingIn this sequel to the previous essay I intend to discuss three major areas of difference between the Buddhas Teaching which we may refer to here as the Ariyan Dhamma and the philosophies of nondualityThese areas correspond to the three divisions of the Buddhist path  virtue concentration and wisdomIn regard to virtue the distinction between the two teachings is not immediately evident as both generally affirm the importance of virtuous conduct at the start of trainingThe essential difference between them emerges not at the outset but only later in the way they evaluate the role of morality in the advanced stages of the pathFor the nondual systems all dualities are finally transcended in the realization of the nondual reality the Absolute or fundamental groundAs the Absolute encompasses and transcends all diversity for one who has realized it the distinctions between good and evil virtue and nonvirtue lose their ultimate validitySuch distinctions it is said are valid only at the conventional level not at the level of final realization they are binding on the trainee not on the adeptThus we find that in their historical forms philosophies of nonduality hold that the conduct of the enlightened sage cannot be circumscribed by moral rulesThe sage has transcended all conventional distinctions of good and evilHe acts spontaneously from his intuition of the Ultimate and therefore is no longer bound by the rules of morality valid for those still struggling toward the lightHis behavior is an elusive incomprehensible outflow of what has been called crazy wisdomFor the Ariyan Dhamma the distinction between the two types of conduct moral and immoral is sharp and clear and this distinction persists all the way through to the consummation of the path Bodily conduct is twofold I say to be cultivated and not to be cultivated and such conduct is either the one or the otherThe conduct of the ideal Buddhist sage the arahant necessarily embodies the highest standards of moral rectitude both in the spirit and in the letter and for him conformity to the letter is spontaneous and naturalThe Buddha says that the liberated one lives restrained by the rules of the Vinaya seeing danger in the slightest faultsHe cannot intentionally commit any breach of the moral precepts nor would he ever pursue any course of action motivated by desire hatred delusion or fearIn the sphere of meditation practice or concentration we again find a striking difference in outlook between the nondual systems and the Ariyan DhammaSince for the nondual systems distinctions are ultimately unreal meditation practice is not explicitly oriented toward the removal of mental defilements and the cultivation of virtuous states of mindIn these systems it is often said that defilements are mere appearances devoid of intrinsic reality even manifestations of the AbsoluteHence to engage in a programme of practice to overcome them is an exercise in futility like fleeing from an apparitional demon to seek to eliminate defilements is to reinforce the illusion of dualityThe meditative themes that ripple through the nondual currents of thought declare no defilement and no purity the defilements are in essence the same as transcendent wisdom it is by passion that passion is removedIn the Ariyan Dhamma the practice of meditation unfolds from start to finish as a process of mental purificationThe process begins with the recognition of the dangers in unwholesome states they are real pollutants of our being that need to be restrained and eliminatedThe consummation is reached in the complete destruction of the defilements through the cultivation of their wholesome antidotesThe entire course of practice demands a recognition of the differences between the dark and bright qualities of the mind and devolves on effort and diligence One does not tolerate an arisen unwholesome thought one abandons it dispels it abolishes it nullifies itThe hindrances are causes of blindness causes of ignorance destructive to wisdom not conducive to NibbanaThe practice of meditation purges the mind of its corruptions preparing the way for the destruction of the cankersFinally in the domain of wisdom the Ariyan Dhamma and the nondual systems once again move in contrary directionsIn the nondual systems the task of wisdom is to break through the diversified appearances in order to discover the unifying reality that underlies themConcrete phenomena in their distinctions and their plurality are mere appearance while true reality is the One either a substantial Absolute or a metaphysical zeroFor such systems liberation comes with the arrival at the fundamental unity in which opposites merge and distinctions evaporate like dewIn the Ariyan Dhamma wisdom aims at seeing and knowing things as they really areHence to know things as they are wisdom must respect phenomena in their precise particularityWisdom leaves diversity and plurality untouchedIt instead seeks to uncover the characteristics of phenomena to gain insight into their qualities and structuresIt moves not in the direction of an allembracing identification with the All but toward disengagement and detachment release from the AllThe cultivation of wisdom in no way undermines concrete phenomena by reducing them to appearances nor does it treat them as windows opening to some fundamental groundInstead it investigates and discerns in order to understand things as they are And what does one understand as it really isOne understands Such is form such its arising and passing awaySuch is feeling perception formations consciousness such its arising and passing away When one sees All formations are impermanent all are suffering everything is not self one turns away from suffering this is the path to puritySpiritual systems are colored as much by their favorite similes as by their formulated tenetsFor the nondual systems two similes stand out as predominantOne is space which simultaneously encompasses all and permeates all yet is nothing concrete in itself the other is the ocean which remains selfidentical beneath the changing multitude of its wavesThe similes used within the Ariyan Dhamma are highly diverse but one theme that unites many of them is acuity of vision  vision which discerns the panorama of visible forms clearly and precisely each in its own individuality It is just as if there were a lake in a mountain recess clear limpid undisturbed so that a man with good sight standing on the bank could see shells gravel and pebbles and also shoals of fish swimming about and restingHe might think There is this lake clear limpid undisturbed and there are these shells gravel and pebbles and also these shoals of fish swimming about and resting So too a monk understands as it actually is This is suffering this is the origin of suffering this is the cessation of suffering this is the way leading to the cessation of suffering When he knows and sees thus his mind is liberated from the cankers and with the minds liberation he knows that he is

a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topicsIts publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddhas discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practiceThese works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first aroseThe Mahamangala Sutta the Great Discourse on Blessings is one of the most popular Buddhist suttas included in all the standard repertories of Pali devotional chantsThe sutta begins when a deity of stunning beauty having descended to earth in the stillness of the night approaches the Blessed One in the Jeta Grove and asks about the way to the highest blessingsIn the very first stanza of his reply the Buddha states that the highest blessing comes from avoiding fools and associating with the wiseSince the rest of the sutta goes on to sketch all the different aspects of human felicity both mundane and spiritual the assignment of association with the wise to the opening stanza serves to emphasize a key point that progress along the path of the Dhamma hinges on making the right choices in our friendshipsContrary to certain psychological theories the human mind is not a hermetically sealed chamber enclosing a personality unalterably shaped by biology and infantile experienceRather throughout life it remains a highly malleable entity continually remolding itself in response to its social interactionsFar from coming to our personal relationships with a fixed and immutable character our regular and repeated social contacts implicate us in a constant process of psychological osmosis that offers precious opportunities for growth and transformationLike living cells engaged in a chemical dialogue with their colleagues our minds transmit and receive a steady barrage of messages and suggestions that may work profound changes even at levels below the threshold of awarenessParticularly critical to our spiritual progress is our selection of friends and companions who can have the most decisive impact upon our personal destinyIt is because he perceived how susceptible our minds can be to the influence of our companions that the Buddha repeatedly stressed the value of good friendship in the spiritual lifeThe Buddha states that he sees no other thing that is so much responsible for the arising of unwholesome qualities in a person as bad friendship nothing so helpful for the arising of wholesome qualities as good friendshipAgain he says that he sees no other external factor that leads to so much harm as bad friendship and no other external factor that leads to so much benefit as good friendshipIt is through the influence of a good friend that a disciple is led along the Noble Eightfold Path to release from all sufferingGood friendship in Buddhism means considerably more than associating with people that one finds amenable and who share ones interestsIt means in effect seeking out wise companions to whom one can look for guidance and instructionThe task of the noble friend is not only to provide companionship in the treading of the wayThe truly wise and compassionate friend is one who with understanding and sympathy of heart is ready to criticize and admonish to point out ones faults to exhort and encourage perceiving that the final end of such friendship is growth in the DhammaThe Buddha succinctly expresses the proper response of a disciple to such a good friend in a verse of the Dhammapada If one finds a person who points out ones faults and who reproves one one should follow such a wise and sagacious counselor as one would a guide to hidden treasureAssociation with the wise becomes so crucial to spiritual development because the example and advice of a nobleminded counselor is often the decisive factor that awakens and nurtures the unfolding of our own untapped spiritual potentialThe uncultivated mind harbors a vast diversity of unrealized possibilities ranging from the depths of selfishness egotism and aggressivity to the heights of wisdom selfsacrifice and compassionThe task confronting us as followers of the Dhamma is to keep the unwholesome tendencies in check and to foster the growth of the wholesome tendencies the qualities that lead to awakening to freedom and purificationHowever our internal tendencies do not mature and decline in a vacuumThey are subject to the constant impact of the broader environment and among the most powerful of these influences is the company we keep the people we look upon as teachers advisors and friendsSuch people silently speak to the hidden potentials of our own being potentials that will either unfold or wither under their influenceIn our pursuit of the Dhamma it therefore becomes essential for us to choose as our guides and companions those who represent at least in part the noble qualities we seek to internalize by the practice of the DhammaThis is especially necessary in the early stages of our spiritual development when our virtuous aspirations are still fresh and tender vulnerable to being undermined by inward irresolution or by discouragement from acquaintances who do not share our idealsIn this early phase our mind resembles a chameleon which alters its color according to its backgroundJust as this remarkable lizard turns green when in the grass and brown when on the ground so we become fools when we associate with fools and sages when we associate with sagesInternal changes do not generally occur suddenly but slowly by increments so slight that we ourselves may not be aware of them our characters undergo a metamorphosis that in the end may prove to be dramatically significantIf we associate closely with those who are addicted to the pursuit of sense pleasures power riches and fame we should not imagine that we will remain immune from those addictions in time our own minds will gradually incline to these same endsIf we associate closely with those who while not given up to moral recklessness live their lives comfortably adjusted to mundane routines we too will remain stuck in the ruts of the commonplaceIf we aspire for the highest  for the peaks of transcendent wisdom and liberation  then we must enter into association with those who represent the highestEven if we are not so fortunate as to find companions who have already scaled the heights we can well count ourselves blessed if we cross paths with a few spiritual friends who share our ideals and who make earnest efforts to nurture the noble qualities of the Dhamma in their heartsWhen we raise the question how to recognize good friends how to distinguish good advisors from bad advisors the Buddha offers us crystalclear adviceIn the Shorter Discourse on a FullMoon Night he explains the difference between the companionship of the bad person and the companionship of the good personThe bad person chooses as friends and companions those who are without faith whose conduct is marked by an absence of shame and moral dread who have no knowledge of spiritual teachings who are lazy and unmindful and who are devoid of wisdomAs a consequence of choosing such bad friends as his advisors the bad person plans and acts for his own harm for the harm of others and the harm of both and he meets with sorrow and miseryIn contrast the Buddha continues the good person chooses as friends and companions those who have faith who exhibit a sense of shame and moral dread who are learned in the Dhamma energetic in cultivation of the mind mindful and possessed of wisdomResorting to such good friends looking to them as mentors and guides the good person pursues these same qualities as his own ideals and absorbs them into his characterThus while drawing ever closer to deliverance himself he becomes in turn a beacon light for othersSuch a one is able to offer those who still wander in the dark an inspiring model to emulate and a wise friend to turn to for guidance and adviceThe Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creedsFounded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topicsIts publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddhas discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practiceThese works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first aroseToday all the major religions of the world must respond to a double challengeOn one side is the challenge of secularism a trend which has swept across the globe battering against the most ancient strongholds of the sacred and turning all mans movements toward the Beyond into a forlorn gesture poignant but devoid of senseOn the other side is the meeting of the great religions with each otherAs the most farflung nations and cultures merge into a single global community the representatives of humankinds spiritual quest have been brought together in an encounter of unprecedented intimacy an encounter so close that it leaves no room for retreatThus at one and the same time each major religion faces in the amphitheater of world opinion all the other religions of the earth as well as the vast numbers of people who regard all claims to possess the Great Answer with a skeptical frown or an indifferent yawnIn this situation any religion which is to emerge as more than a relic from humanitys adolescence must be able to deal in a convincing and meaningful manner with both sides of the challengeOn the one hand it must contain the swelling tide of secularism by keeping alive the intuition that no amount of technological mastery over external nature no degree of proficiency in providing for humanitys mundane needs can bring complete repose to the human spirit can still the thirst for a truth and value that transcends the boundaries of contingencyOn the other hand each religion must find some way of disentangling the conflicting claims that all religions make to understand our place in the grand scheme of things and to hold the key to our salvationWhile remaining faithful to its own most fundamental principles a religion must be able to address the striking differences between its own tenets and those of other creeds doing so in a manner that is at once honest yet humble perspicacious yet unimposingIn this brief essay I wish to sketch the outline of an appropriate Buddhist response to the second challengeSince Buddhism has always professed to offer a middle way in resolving the intellectual and ethical dilemmas of the spiritual life we may find that the key to our present problematic also lies in discovering the response that best exemplifies the middle wayAs has often been noted the middle way is not a compromise between the extremes but a way that rises above them avoiding the pitfalls into which they leadTherefore in seeking the proper Buddhist approach to the problem of the diversity of creeds we might begin by pinpointing the extremes which the middle way must avoidThe first extreme is a retreat into fundamentalism the adoption of an aggressive affirmation of ones own beliefs coupled with a proselytizing zeal toward those who still stand outside the chosen circle of ones coreligionistsWhile this response to the challenge of diversity has assumed alarming proportions in the folds of the great monotheistic religions Christianity and Islam it is not one toward which Buddhism has a ready affinity for the ethical guidelines of the Dhamma naturally tend to foster an attitude of benign tolerance toward other religions and their followersThough there is no guarantee against the rise of a militant fundamentalism from within Buddhisms own ranks the Buddhas teachings can offer no sanctification not even a remote one for such a malignant developmentFor Buddhists the more alluring alternative is the second extremeThis extreme which purchases tolerance at the price of integrity might be called the thesis of spiritual universalism the view that all the great religions at their core espouse essentially the same truth clothed merely in different modes of expressionSuch a thesis could not of course be maintained in regard to the formal creeds of the major religions which differ so widely that it would require a strenuous exercise in wordtwisting to bring them into accordThe universalist position is arrived at instead by an indirect routeIts advocates argue that we must distinguish between the outward face of a religion  its explicit beliefs and exoteric practices  and its inner nucleus of experiential realizationOn the basis of this distinction they then insist we will find that beneath the markedly different outward faces of the great religions at their heart  in respect of the spiritual experiences from which they emerge and the ultimate goal to which they lead  they are substantially identicalThus the major religions differ simply in so far as they are different means different expedients to the same liberative experience which may be indiscriminately designated enlightenment or redemption or Godrealization since these different terms merely highlight different aspects of the same goalAs the famous maxim puts it the roads up the mountain are many but the moonlight at the top is oneFrom this point of view the Buddha Dhamma is only one more variant on the perennial philosophy underlying all the mature expressions of mans spiritual questIt may stand out by its elegant simplicity its clarity and directness but a unique and unrepeated revelation of truth it harbors notOn first consideration the adoption of such a view may seem to be an indispensable steppingstone to religious tolerance and to insist that doctrinal differences are not merely verbal but real and important may appear to border on bigotryThus those who embrace Buddhism in reaction against the doctrinaire narrowness of the monotheistic religions may find in such a view  so soft and accommodating  a welcome respite from the insistence on privileged access to truth typical of those religionsHowever an unbiased study of the Buddhas own discourses would show quite plainly that the universalist thesis does not have the endorsement of the Awakened One himselfTo the contrary the Buddha repeatedly proclaims that the path to the supreme goal of the holy life is made known only in his own teaching and therefore that the attainment of that goal  final deliverance from suffering  can be achieved only from within his own dispensationThe best known instance of this claim is the Buddhas assertion on the eve of his Parinibbana that only in his dispensation are the four grades of enlightened persons to be found that the other sects are devoid of true ascetics those who have reached the planes of liberationThe Buddhas restriction of final emancipation to his own dispensation does not spring from a narrow dogmatism or a lack of good will but rests upon an utterly precise determination of the nature of the final goal and of the means that must be implemented to reach itThis goal is neither an everlasting afterlife in a heaven nor some nebulously conceived state of spiritual illumination but the Nibbana element with no residue remaining release from the cycle of repeated birth and deathThis goal is effected by the utter destruction of the minds defilements  greed aversion and delusion  all the way down to their subtlest levels of latencyThe eradication of the defilements can be achieved only by insight into the true nature of phenomena which means that the attainment of Nibbana depends upon the direct experiential insight into all conditioned phenomena internal and external as stamped with the three characteristics of existence impermanence suffering and nonselfnessWhat the Buddha maintains as the ground for his assertion that his teaching offers the sole means to final release from suffering is that the knowledge of the true nature of phenomena in its exactitude and completeness is accessible only in his teachingThis is so because theoretically the principles that define this knowledge are unique to his teaching and contradictory in vital respects to the basic tenets of other creeds and because practically this teaching alone reveals in its perfection and purity the means of generating this liberative knowledge as a matter of immediate personal experienceThis means is the Noble Eightfold Path which as an integrated system of spiritual training cannot be found outside the dispensation of a Fully Enlightened OneSurprisingly this exclusivistic stance of Buddhism in regard to the prospects for final emancipation has never engendered a policy of intolerance on the part of Buddhists toward the adherents of other religionsTo the contrary throughout its long history Buddhism has displayed a thoroughgoing tolerance and genial good will toward the many religions with which it has come into contactIt has maintained this tolerance simultaneously with its deep conviction that the doctrine of the Buddha offers the unique and unsurpassable way to release from the ills inherent in conditioned existenceFor Buddhism religious tolerance is not achieved by reducing all religions to a common denominator nor by explaining away formidable differences in thought and practice as accidents of historical developmentFrom the Buddhist point of view to make tolerance contingent upon whitewashing discrepancies would not be to exercise genuine tolerance at all for such an approach can tolerate differences only by diluting them so completely that they no longer make a differenceTrue tolerance in religion involves the capacity to admit differences as real and fundamental even as profound and unbridgeable yet at the same time to respect the rights of those who follow a religion different from ones own to continue to do so without resentment disadvantage or hindranceBuddhist tolerance springs from the recognition that the dispositions and spiritual needs of human beings are too vastly diverse to be encompassed by any single teaching and thus that these needs will naturally find expression in a wide variety of religious formsThe nonBuddhist systems will not be able to lead their adherents to the final goal of the Buddhas Dhamma but that they never proposed to do in the first placeFor Buddhism acceptance of the idea of the beginningless round of rebirths implies that it would be utterly unrealistic to expect more than a small number of people to be drawn toward a spiritual path aimed at complete liberationThe overwhelming majority even of those who seek deliverance from earthly woes will aim at securing a favorable mode of existence within the round even while misconceiving this to be the ultimate goal of the religious questTo the extent that a religion proposes sound ethical principles and can promote to some degree the development of wholesome qualities such as love generosity detachment and compassion it will merit in this respect the approbation of BuddhistsThese principles advocated by outside religious systems will also conduce to rebirth in the realms of bliss  the heavens and the divine abodesBuddhism by no means claims to have unique access to these realms but holds that the paths that lead to them have been articulated with varying degrees of clarity in many of the great spiritual traditions of humanityWhile the Buddhist will disagree with the belief structures of other religions to the extent that they deviate from the Buddhas Dhamma he will respect them to the extent that they enjoin virtues and standards of conduct that promote spiritual development and the harmonious integration of human beings with each other and with the worldThe Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creedsFounded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topicsIts publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddhas discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practiceThese works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first aroseThe most common and widely known formulation of the Buddhas teaching is that which the Buddha himself announced in the First Sermon at Benares the formula of the Four Noble TruthsThe Buddha declares that these truths convey in a nutshell all the essential information that we need to set out on the path to liberationHe says that just as the elephants footprint by reason of its great size contains the footprints of all other animals so the Four Noble Truths by reason of their comprehensiveness contain within themselves all wholesome and beneficial teachingsHowever while many expositors of Buddhism have devoted attention to explaining the actual content of the four truths only rarely is any consideration given to the reason why they are designated noble truthsYet it is just this descriptive word noble that reveals to us why the Buddha chose to cast his teaching into this specific format and it is this same term that allows us to experience even from afar the unique flavor that pervades the entire doctrine and discipline of the Enlightened OneThe word noble or ariya is used by the Buddha to designate a particular type of person the type of person which it is the aim of his teaching to createIn the discourses the Buddha classifies human beings into two broad categoriesOn one side there are the puthujjanas the worldlings those belonging to the multitude whose eyes are still covered with the dust of defilements and delusionOn the other side there are the ariyans the noble ones the spiritual elite who obtain this status not from birth social station or ecclesiastical authority but from their inward nobility of characterThese two general types are not separated from each other by an impassable chasm each confined to a tightly sealed compartmentA series of gradations can be discerned rising up from the darkest level of the blind worldling trapped in the dungeon of egotism and selfassertion through the stage of the virtuous worldling in whom the seeds of wisdom are beginning to sprout and further through the intermediate stages of noble disciples to the perfected individual at the apex of the entire scale of human developmentThis is the arahant the liberated one who has absorbed the purifying vision of truth so deeply that all his defilements have been extinguished and with them all liability to sufferingWhile the path from bondage to deliverance from worldliness to spiritual nobility is a graded path involving gradual practice and gradual progress it is not a uniform continuumProgress occurs in discrete steps and at a certain point  the point separating the status of a worldling from that of a noble one  a break is reached which must be crossed not by simply taking another step forward but by making a leap by jumping across from the near side to the further shoreThis decisive event in the inner development of the practitioner this radical leap that propels the disciple from the domain and lineage of the worldling to the domain and lineage of the noble ones occurs precisely through the penetration of the Four Noble TruthsThis discloses to us the critical reason why the four truths revealed by the Buddha are called noble truthsThey are noble truths because when we have penetrated them through to the core when we have grasped their real import and implications we cast off the status of the worldling and acquire the status of a noble one drawn out from the faceless crowd into the community of the Blessed Ones disciples united by a unique and unshakable visionPrior to the penetration of the truths however well endowed we may be with spiritual virtues we are not yet on secure groundWe are not immune from regression not yet assured of deliverance not invincible in our striving on the pathThe virtues of a worldling are tenuous virtuesThey may wax or they may wane they may flourish or decline and in correspondence with their degree of strength we may rise or fall in our movement through the cycle of becomingWhen our virtues are replete we may rise upward and dwell in bliss among the gods when our virtues decline or our merit is exhausted we may sink again to miserable depthsBut with the penetration of the truths we leap across the gulf that separates us from the ranks of the noble onesThe eye of Dhamma has been opened the vision of truth stands revealed and though the decisive victory has not yet been won the path to the final goal lies at our feet and the supreme security from bondage hovers on the horizonOne who has comprehended the truths has changed lineage crossed over from the domain of the worldlings to the domain of the noble onesSuch a disciple is incapable of regression to the ranks of the worldling incapable of losing the vision of truth that has flashed before his inner eyeProgress toward the final goal the complete eradication of ignorance and craving may be slow or rapid it may occur easily or result from an uphill battleBut however long it may take with whatever degree of facility one may advance one thing is certain such a disciple who has seen with immaculate clarity the Four Noble Truths can never slide backward can never lose the status of a noble one and is bound to reach the final fruit of arahantship in a maximum of seven livesThe reason why the penetration of the Four Noble Truths can confer this immutable nobility of spirit is implied by the four tasks the noble truths impose on usBy taking these tasks as our challenge in life  our challenge as followers of the Enlightened One  from whatever station of development we find ourselves beginning at we can gradually advance toward the infallible penetration of the noble onesThe first noble truth the truth of suffering is to be fully understood the task it assigns us is that of full understandingA hallmark of the noble ones is that they do not flow along thoughtlessly with the stream of life but endeavor to comprehend existence from within as honestly and thoroughly as possibleFor us too it is necessary to reflect upon the nature of our lifeWe must attempt to fathom the deep significance of an existence bounded on one side by birth and on the other by death and subject in between to all the types of suffering detailed by the Buddha in his discoursesThe second noble truth of the origin or cause of suffering implies the task of abandonmentA noble one is such because he has initiated the process of eliminating the defilements at the root of suffering and we too if we aspire to reach the plane of the noble ones must be prepared to withstand the seductive lure of the defilementsWhile the eradication of craving can come only with the supramundane realizations even in the mundane course of our daily life we can learn to restrain the coarser manifestation of defilements and by keen selfobservation can gradually loosen their grip upon our heartsThe third noble truth the cessation of suffering implies the task of realizationAlthough Nibbana the extinction of suffering can only be personally realized by the noble ones the confidence we place in the Dhamma as our guideline to life shows us what we should select as our final aspiration as our ultimate ground of valueOnce we have grasped the fact that all conditioned things in the world being impermanent and insubstantial can never give us total satisfaction we can then lift our aim to the unconditioned element Nibbana the Deathless and make that aspiration the pole around which we order our everyday choices and concernsFinally the fourth noble truth the Noble Eightfold Path assigns us the task of developmentThe noble ones have reached their status by developing the eightfold path and while only the noble ones are assured of never deviating from the path the Buddhas teaching gives us the meticulous instructions that we need to tread the path culminating in the plane of the noble onesThis is the path that gives birth to vision that gives birth to knowledge that leads to higher comprehension enlightenment and Nibbana the crowning attainment of nobilityThe Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creedsFounded in the BPS

as relevant today as it was when it first aroseDuring the month of July two of the BPSs guiding lights since its inception passed important milestones in their livesOne of these is VenNyanaponika Mahathera  our cofounder longterm president and editor and current patron  who on July reached his ninetieth birthdayFortunately despite weak legs and impaired vision VenNyanaponika has enjoyed general good health and thus was able to welcome the many visitors who called on him that day to pay their respects and to express to him their gratitude for his lucid exposition of the Dhamma and selfless service to the spread of the teachings over an illustrious career of so many yearsTo commemorate the occasion the management and staff of the Buddhist Publication Society held an alms offering and felicitation meeting at the Mahatheras residence the Forest Hermitage in the Udawattakele Forest Reserve near KandyAfter the meal offering speaking on behalf of the BPS Board of Management MrHarilal Wickremeratne announced to the Mahathera that as a token of our appreciation for him the BPS has established a scholarship fund at the University of Peradeniya to be called The VenNyanaponika Mahathera Scholarship Fund for Postgraduate Research into Theravada Buddhism The scholarship to be generated by the interest earned from a fixed deposit set up in a commercial bank in Kandy is to be awarded to a scholar selected by the University for postgraduate studies in the philosophy ethics or literature of Theravada BuddhismFelicitation for VenNyanaponika was especially prominent in his native Germany the land he left so long ago in order to embrace the monks life here in Sri LankaThe University of Konstanz in its Buddhist Modernism series has issued a volume of writings talks texts photos and other documents to mark the Mahatheras completion of his ninth decadeThe book compiled by Professor Detlof Kantowsky is entitled Nicht derselbe und nicht ein anderer the famous line from the Milindapañha which VenNyanaponika quoted to the editor when reviewing photographs of himself as a boy and as a young manIn Sri Lanka his adopted home VenNyanaponika was recently accorded special honor when the Prime Ministers office selected him as one of a hundred outstanding Sri Lankans whose image is to be preserved in bronze in a planned national Hall of FameAccordingly in late June MrHarold Peiris of the Ministry of Finance who is in charge of the project came to Kandy with the talented sculptor MrSarath Chandrajiva to fashion a bust of the MahatheraThe clay model the sculptor molded in less than two hours was strikingly faithful to VenNyanaponikas features and was used to create on the spot a plasterofparis mold from which the finished bust is to be cast out of bronzeThe bust will be exhibited temporarily in the national art gallery in Colombo along with those of the other nominees until a permanent exhibition hall is built for themThe other guiding light of the BPS to achieve distinction this past July is VenPiyadassi Mahathera the editor of our Sinhala Damsak Series and author of numerous BPS titles both in English and SinhalaBy unanimous acclamation in appreciation of his indefatigable services to the BuddhaSasana the Mahanayaka Theras of the Sangha Council of the Amarapura Nikaya selected VenPiyadassi to be appointed as a Sangha Nayaka Thera  a leading elder of the Order  with the honorary designation Vishvakirti Sri Sasanasobhana universally famous glorious ornament of the Teaching On July at a ceremony held at his alma mater Nalanda College in Colombo the new Nayaka Thera received his formal notice of appointment from Prime Minister DBWijetunga before a large gathering led by the Mahanayaka Theras and President Ranasingha PremadasaAlthough such honors rest lightly on the shoulders of a monk like VenPiyadassi it is gratifying to us at the BPS to see this glorious ornament of our own Society receive the recognition he so rightly deservesAt the age of VenNyanaponika is now in his th year in the Sangha at the age of VenPiyadassi is now in his th yearAn inveterate traveler and preacher VenPiyadassi has circled the globe twelve times and at home can be scheduled to give three or four sermons a day  sometimes on one side of the island in the morning and on the other side in the eveningVenNyanaponika in contrast has remained almost consistently in Sri Lanka since his arrival here in yet from the quietude of his hermitage through the agency of his publications he has sent his words of wisdom and consolation to the far corners of the earth translated into more than half a dozen languagesMay these two great elders who have both in their different ways toiled selflessly for the welfare of the many enjoy abundant good health and happinessAnd may they be with us as noble friends and advisors for a long time yet to comeThe Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creedsFounded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topicsIts publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddhas discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practiceThese works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first aroseThe sudden entry into general circulation of a familiar term with a new ambience of meaning often has a significance that goes beyond mere philological curiositySince language is molded by thought at a level prior to and more basic than that of deliberate design such changes in linguistic currency may well signal deeper changes taking place in the mental makeup of those who use the termThey can be seen as barometric indicators of transformations in the sphere of consciousness  in our patterns of thinking in our attitudes in our goalsIf there is one term that might be chosen to characterize the intellectual and moral climate of the present day it would be the word openness This seemingly colorless word has come to mark the fulfillment of the centurieslong struggle against the oppressive weight of established tradition in so many diverse departments of human concernIts three syllables are a hymn of victory for the triumph of the empirical method over formulated dogma as the key to knowledge for the primacy of individual conscience over prescribed morality in the domain of ethics and in our private lives for the replacement of the reign of the superego by a newfound liberty to explore the subterranean channels of impulse and desire in whatever direction they might leadPerhaps most importantly the notion of openness also points to a particular attitude toward experience an attitude which has quietly permeated our culture so thoroughly that it now seems almost an innate human dispositionBriefly this attitude might be described as a soft and affable affirmation of experience in its totality coupled with a pliant receptivity to its full range of formsThis attitude it must be stressed only rarely solidifies into a consciously held conviction more typically it lingers in the background of the mind as an unverbalized intuition a fluid and shifting orientation toward the worldHistorically rooted in the widespread decline of belief structures centered upon a transcendent goal of human life and an objectively grounded scale of values the philosophy of openness takes all truth to be relative all values personal and subjectiveThus it holds that our task in life is to open ourselves as fully as we can to the unfolding miracle of existence and to celebrate its infinite possibilitiesThe spread of this attitude through the general culture has left its stamp on current interpretations of Buddhism as wellWe thus find that for many of todays Buddhist teachers the Dhamma is essentially a method for arriving at the consummation of all that the notion of openness impliesFrom this perspective Buddhism is not a doctrine with its own distinct body of tenets not a discipline guiding us to a supramundane goal but a tool for opening to the here and nowThe most basic flaw at the bottom of human suffering it is held is our tendency to close ourselves off from experience to lock ourselves with our concepts and judgments into a limited compartment of realityBy developing through meditation a nondiscriminating choiceless awareness which allows whatever arises to hold its ground we are enabled to break through our constraints and merge with the stream of events to dance with the ten thousand things  accepting them all yet without clinging to themWhile the advocates of openness are usually adroit in assimilating their principles to the classical Dhamma a careful examination would reveal gaping differences between the twoHere I want to focus only on some crucial differences in their respective orientations toward experienceIt should be noted at once that whereas the school of openness bids us to drop our discriminations judgments and restraints in order to immerse ourselves in the dynamic flow of immediate experience the Buddha prescribes an attitude toward experience that arises from carefully wrought judgments employs precise discriminations and issues in detachment and restraintThis attitude the classical Buddhist counterfoil to the modern program of openness might be summed up by one word found everywhere in the ancient textsThat word is heedfulnessHeedfulness denotes an attitude of critical scrutiny directed toward ones own mind both in its internal movement and in its reactions to external affairsThe term suggests diligent effort and acute attentiveness and it further sounds a note of moral caution and careIt thus implies as the Buddha intended it to imply that we are constantly exposed to danger  a danger born from within that becomes ever more imminent to the degree that we allow heedfulness to slip and we slide into its opposite into heedlessness or negligenceSuch caution is necessary because deeds have consequences that extend beyond themselvesWhereas the school of openness tends to subordinate concern with the consequential aspect of action to a stress on abiding in the present moment the classical Dhamma taught by the Buddha asks us to recognize that all willed actions even our fleeting thoughts and impulses are seeds with roots buried deep in the minds beginningless past and with the potency to generate results in the distant horizons of the futureThese longrange consequences of action are of enormous importance to us for however far they might lie from our vision now when the time comes for our deeds to ripen it is we ourselves who must experience their fruitsAs these fruits are invariably determined by the moral quality of our actions diligent selfexamination  that is heedfulness  is urgently needed so that we may restrain ourselves from those deeds that seem pleasant but bear painful results and so that we may apply ourselves to those deeds that may be difficult but yield longterm benefitsThe mode of thinking based on openness rejects duality as a product of discrimination and deluded conceptsIt tacitly presupposes that existence as such is ultimately benign that beyond our deluded concepts the rich and vivid diversity of forms has a single taste a taste that is sweetIn contrast the attitude of heedfulness is grounded upon the view that existence is textured through and through by dualities that are profound and inescapably realThe world bears testimony to this vision in the contrast between the charming delightful surfaces of things and their underlying hollowness and inadequacy our minds bear testimony in the ongoing contest between the wholesome mental factors and the unwholesome ones between the upward urge for purification and the downward pull of the defilementsThat this duality is not trivial is seen by the consequences the one leads to Nibbana the state of deliverance the Deathless while the other leads back into the round of repeated birth samsara which is also the realm of Mara the Lord of DeathTo practice heedfulness is to take full account of these dualities with their profound implicationsThe heedful person does not aim at a choiceless awareness open to existence in its totality for to open oneself thus is to risk making oneself vulnerable to just those elements in oneself that keep one bound to the realm of MaraThe awareness developed through heedfulness is built upon a choice  a wellconsidered choice to abandon those qualities one understands to be detrimental and to develop in their place those qualities one understands to be beneficial the states that lead to purity and peaceBoth in our outer involvements in the world and in the minds internal procession of thought imagination and emotion there continually spreads before us a forked roadOne branch of this fork beckons with the promise of pleasure and satisfaction but in the end leads to pain and bondage the other steep and difficult to climb leads upward to enlightenment and liberationTo discard discrimination and judgment for an easygoing openness to the world is to blur the important distinction between these two quite different pathsTo be heedful is to be aware of the dichotomy and to strive to avoid the one and pursue the otherAs the Buddha reminds us heedfulness is the path to the Deathless heedlessness is the path of DeathThe Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creedsFounded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topicsIts publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddhas discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practiceThese works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first aroseThe first step in entering the Buddhist path is going for refuge to the Triple Gem and the first of the three gems that we approach as refuge is the Buddha the Enlightened OneBecause the act of going for refuge to the Buddha marks the beginning of a new chapter in our life it is worth our while to repeatedly pause and reflect upon the significance of this momentous stepToo often we are prone to take our first steps for grantedYet it is only if we review these steps from time to time in a deepening awareness of their implications that we can be sure the following steps we take will bring us closer to our desired destinationThe going for refuge to the Buddha is not a single action which occurs only once and is then completed with absolute finalityIt is or should be a continually evolving process which matures in tandem with our practice and understanding of the DhammaTo go for refuge does not imply that at the outset we already possess a clear grasp of the dangers that make a refuge necessary or of the goal toward which we aspireComprehension of these matters grows gradually over timeBut to the extent that we have actually gone for refuge with sincere intent we should make an earnest effort to sharpen and deepen our understanding of the objects to which we have turned as the basis for our deliveranceIn going for refuge to the Buddha it is most essential at the outset to clarify our conception of what a Buddha is and how he functions as a refugeIf such clarification is lacking our sense of refuge can easily become tainted by erroneous viewsWe may ascribe to the Buddha a status he never claimed for himself as when we regard him as the incarnation of a god as the emanation of the Absolute or as a personal saviorOn the other hand we may detract from the exalted status to which the Buddha is properly entitled as when we regard him simply as a benevolent sage as an unusually astute Asiatic philosopher or as a genius of meditative technologyA correct view of the Buddhas nature would see him in terms of the title he assigned to himself as a Fully SelfEnlightened OneHe is selfenlightened because he has awakened to the essential truths of existence entirely on his own without a teacher or guideHe is fully enlightened because he has comprehended these truths completely in all their ramifications and implicationsAnd as a Buddha he has not only fathomed these truths himself but has also taught them to the world so that others may awaken from the long sleep of ignorance and attain the fruits of liberationTaking refuge in the Buddha is an act anchored in a particular historical individual the recluse Gotama the scion of the Sakyan clan who lived and taught in the Ganges valley in the fifth century BWhen we take refuge in the Buddha we rely upon this historical individual and the body of instruction that stems from himIt is important to stress this point in view of the fashionable notion that taking refuge in the Buddha means that we take refuge in the Buddhamind within ourselves or in the universal principle of enlightenment Such ideas allowed to go unchecked can lead to the belief that anything we contrive in the flights of our imagination can qualify as true DhammaTo the contrary the Buddhist tradition insists that when we go for refuge to the Buddha we place ourselves under the guidance of one who is distinctly different from ourselves one who has scaled heights that we have barely begun to glimpseBut when we rely upon the recluse Gotama as our refuge we do not apprehend him merely as a particular individual a wise and sensible sageWe apprehend him rather as a BuddhaIt is his Buddhahood  his possession of the full range of excellent qualities that come with perfect enlightenment  that makes the recluse Gotama a refugeIn any cosmic epoch a Buddha is that being who first breaks through the dark mass of ignorance encompassing the world and rediscovers the lost path to Nibbana the cessation of sufferingHe is the pioneer the trailblazer who discovers the path and proclaims the path so that others by following his tracks may extinguish their ignorance arrive at true wisdom and break the fetters that tie them to the round of repeated birth and deathFor the refuge in the Buddha to be genuine it must be accompanied by a commitment to the Buddha as an incomparable teacher as unexcelled and unsurpassedStrictly speaking the historical Buddha is not unique since there have been earlier Fully Enlightened Ones who have arisen in past epochs and there will be others who will arise in future epochs as wellBut in any one world system it is impossible for a second Buddha to arise while the teaching of another Buddha is still extant and thus in terms of human history we are justified in regarding the Buddha as a unique teacher unequalled by any other spiritual teacher known to humanityIt is this readiness to recognize the Buddha as the unsurpassed trainer of persons to be tamed the teacher of gods and humans that is the hallmark of an authentic act of taking refuge in the BuddhaThe Buddha serves as a refuge by teaching the DhammaThe actual and final refuge embedded within the Dhamma as refuge is Nibbana the deathless element free from clinging the sorrowless state that is void of stainThe Dhamma as refuge comprises the final goal the path that leads to that goal and the body of teachings that explain the practice of the pathThe Buddha as refuge has no capacity to grant us liberation by an act of willHe proclaims the path to be traveled and the principles to be understoodThe actual work of walking the path is then left to us his disciplesThe proper response to the Buddha as refuge is trust and confidenceTrust is required because the doctrine taught by the Buddha runs counter to our innate understanding of ourselves and our natural orientation toward the worldTo accept this teaching thus tends to arouse an inner resistance even to provoke a rebellion against the changes it requires us to make in the way we lead our livesBut when we place trust in the Buddha we open ourselves to his guidanceBy going to him for refuge we show that we are prepared to recognize that our inherent tendencies to selfaffirmation and grasping are in truth the cause of our sufferingAnd we are ready to accept his counsel that to become free from suffering these tendencies must be controlled and eliminatedConfidence in the Buddha as our refuge is initially awakened when we contemplate his sublime virtues and his excellent teachingIt grows through our undertaking of the trainingAt first our confidence in the Buddha may be hesitant punctured by doubts and perplexityBut as we apply ourselves to the practice of his path we find that our defilements gradually lessen that wholesome qualities increase and with this comes a growing sense of freedom peace and joyThis experience confirms our initial trust disposing us to advance a few steps furtherWhen at last we see the truth of the Dhamma for ourselves the refuge in the Buddha becomes inviolableConfidence then becomes conviction the conviction that the Blessed One is the speaker the proclaimer the bringer of the good the giver of the Deathless the lord of the Dhamma the TathagataThe Buddhist Publication

Buddhist thought and practiceThese works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first aroseIt may be a truism of psychology that the desire for happiness is the most fundamental human drive but it is important to note that this desire generally operates within the bounds set by another drive just as deep and pervasiveThis other drive is the need for securityHowever insistent the raw itch for pleasure and gain may be it is usually held in check by a cautious concern for our personal safetyWe only feel at ease when we are sealed off from manifest danger comfortably at home with ourselves and with our world snugly tucked into familiar territory where everything seems friendly and dependableWhen we come across the Buddhas teaching and begin to take that teaching seriously we often find that it provokes in us disturbing waves of disquietudeThis feeling arises from a clash  a sensed incompatibility  between the picture of the world that we hold to as the essential basis for our normal sense of security and the new perspectives on existence opened up to us by the DhammaWe may try to shun the vistas that trouble us we may pick and choose from the Dhamma what we like but to the extent that we are prepared to take the teaching in earnest  on its own terms rather than on ours  we may discover that the insights which the Buddha wants to impart to us can be quite unsettling in their impactThe first noble truth was never intended to be a comfortable truth indeed it is the discomforting quality of this truth that makes it nobleIt tells us frankly that the routinely placid and predictable surface of our everyday lives is extremely fragile  a shared delusion with which we lull ourselves and each other into a false sense of securityJust beneath the surface hidden from view turbulent currents are stirring which at any time can break the surface calmFrom the moment we are born we are sliding toward old age and death susceptible to various diseases and accidents that may hasten our arrival at the appointed endDriven by our desires we wander from life to life across the sand dunes of samsara elated by our rises shaken by our fallsThe very stuff of our lives consists of nothing more than a conglomeration of five heaps of psychophysical processes without any permanence or substancePerhaps the Buddhas most poignant statement on the human condition is his image of a man being swept along by a mountain torrent he grasps for safety at the grasses along the banks only to find that they break off just as he takes hold of themHowever though the Buddha begins by drawing our attention to the uncertainty that encompasses us even in the midst of comfort and enjoyment he by no means ends thereThe discourse on suffering is expounded not to lead us to despair but to awaken us from our complacent slumbers and to set us moving in the direction where our ultimate welfare can be foundFar from undercutting our need to feel secure the Buddhas teaching unfolds from that very same need turning it into a sustained inquiry into what genuine security actually meansOrdinarily our benighted attempts to achieve security are governed by a myopic but imperious selfinterest oriented around the standpoint of selfWe assume that we possess a solid core of individual being an inherently existent ego and thus our varied plans and projects take shape as so many maneuvers to ward off threats to the self and promote its dominance in the overall scheme of thingsThe Buddha turns this whole point of view on its head by pointing out that anxiety is the dark twin of egoHe declares that all attempts to secure the interests of the ego necessarily arise out of clinging and that the very act of clinging paves the way for our downfall when the object to which we hold perishes as it must by its very natureThe Buddha maintains that the way to true security lies precisely in the abolition of clingingWhen all clinging has been uprooted when all notions of I and mine have lost their obsessive sting we will have no more fear no more worry no more anxious concernTouched by the fluctuations of worldly events the mind remains stable sorrowless stainless and secureWhile ultimate security lies only in the unconditioned in Nibbana the supreme security from bondage as we wend our way through the rough terrain of our mundane lives we have available a provisional source of security that will help us deal effectively with the dangers and difficulties that beset usThis provisional security lies in firmly committing ourselves to the Dhamma as our source of solace and guidance as our incomparable refugeThe word dhamma itself means that which upholds and supportsThe Buddhas teaching is called the Dhamma because it upholds those who live by it it wards off the dangers to which we would be exposed if we were to flout it it sustains us in our endeavor for the final good if we revere it and make it the foundation of our livesThe Dhamma provides protection not by any mystical blessing or downpour of saving grace but by indicating the sure and certain guidelines that enable us to protect ourselvesBeneath the apparent randomness of visible events there runs an invisible but indomitable law which ensures that all goodness finds its due recompenseTo act counter to this law is to invite disasterTo act in harmony with it is to tap its reserves of energy to yoke them to ones spiritual growth and to make oneself a channel of help for others who likewise roam in search of a refugeThe essential counsel that the Buddha gives us to secure our selfprotection is to shun all evil to practice the good and to purify our mindsBy the pursuit of nonviolence honesty righteousness and truth we weave around ourselves an impenetrable net of virtue that ensures our well being even in the midst of violence and commotionBy cultivating the good we sow the seeds of wholesome qualities that will come to maturity as we continue on our path throughout the samsaric journeyAnd by purifying our minds of greed hatred and delusion by mindfulness and diligent effort we will find for ourselves an island that no flood can overwhelm  the island of the DeathlessThe Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the

accurate annotated translations of the Buddhas discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practiceThese works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first aroseThe textbooks of history come into our hands bound in decorative covers and set in crisp clear typesTo the discerning reader however their glossy pages are stained with blood and wet with streams of tearsThe story of mans sojourn on this planet has generally not been a very pretty oneFor sure deeds of virtue and flashes of the sublime light up the tale like meteorites shooting across the night time skyBut the pageant of events that the records spell out for us unfolds according to a repeated pattern in which the dominant motifs are greed and ambition deceit and distrust aggression destruction and revengeEach age when the dust of its own battles clears tends to see itself as standing at the threshold of a new era in which peace and harmony will at last prevailThis appears to be particularly true of our own time with its high ideals and great expectations aroused by dramatic shifts in international relationsIt would be ingenuous however to think that a package solution to the tensions inherent in human coexistence can be devised as easily as a solution to a problem in data managementTo cherish the dream that we have arrived at the brink of a new world order in which all conflict in obedience to our good intentions will be relegated to the past is to lose sight of the grim obstinacy of those deep dark drives that stir in the human heart the defilements of greed hatred and delusionIt is these drives that have brought us into this world of strife and suffering and it is these same drives that keep the wheel of history turning erupting periodically in orgies of senseless violenceLike any other stream the stream of mundane existence inevitably flows in the direction of least resistance downwardThe task the Buddha sets before us is not the impossible one of reversing the direction of the flow but the feasible one of crossing the stream of arriving safely at the far shore where we will be free from the dangers that beset us as we are swept along by the streamTo cross the stream requires a struggle not against the current itself but against the forces that carry us down the current a struggle against the defilements lodged in the depths of our own mindsThough violence either overt or subtle may hold sway over the world in which we are afloat the Buddhas path to freedom requires of us that we make a total break with prevailing normsThus one of the essential steps in our endeavor to reach the abode of safety is to lay down the rod to put away violence aggression and harmfulness toward all living beingsIn the Buddhas teaching the laying down of the rod is not merely an ethical principle a prescription for right actionIt is a comprehensive strategy of selftraining that spans all stages of the Buddhist path enabling us to subdue our inclinations toward ill will animosity and crueltyThe key to developing a mind of harmlessness is found in the ancient maxim stated in the Dhammapada Putting oneself in the place of another one should not slay or incite others to slay The reason we should avoid harming others is because all living beings in their innermost nature share the same essential concern for their own well being and happinessWhen we look into our own minds we can immediately see with intuitive certainty that the fundamental desire at the root of our being is the desire to be well and happy to be free from all harm danger and distressWe see at once that we wish to live not to die that we wish to be happy not to suffer that we wish to pursue our goals freely without hindrance and obstruction by othersWhen we see that this wish for well being and happiness is the most basic desire at the root of our own being by a simple imaginative projection we can then recognize again with intuitive certainty that the same fundamental desire animates the minds of all other living beings as wellJust as we wish to be well so every other being wishes to be well just as we wish to be happy so every other being wishes to be happy just as we wish to pursue our goals freely so all other beings wish to pursue their goals freely without hindrance and obstructionThis fundamental identity of aim that we share with all other beings has implications for each stage of the threefold Buddhist training in morality mental purification and wisdomSince all other beings like ourselves are intent on their welfare and happiness by putting ourselves in their place we can recognize the need to regulate our conduct by principles of restraint that hold in check all harmful bodily and verbal deedsBecause afflictive deeds originate from the mind from thoughts of animosity and cruelty it becomes necessary for us to purify our minds of these taints through the practice of concentration developing as their specific antidotes the divine abodes of lovingkindness and compassionAnd because all defiled thoughts tending toward harm for others arise from roots lodged deep in the recesses of the mind we need to undertake the development of wisdom which alone can extricate the hidden roots of evilSince the state of the world is a manifestation and reflection of the minds of its inhabitants the achievement of a permanent universal peace would require nothing short of a radical and widespread transformation in the minds of these inhabitants  a beautiful but unrealistic fantasyWhat lies within the scope of real possibility is the attainment of a lasting individual peace within ourselves a peace that comes with the fulfillment of the Buddhas threefold trainingThis internal peace however will not remain locked up in our heartsOverflowing its source it will radiate outward exercising a gentle and uplifting influence upon the lives of those who come within its rangeAs the old Indian adage says one can never make the earth safe for ones feet by sweeping away all thorns and gravel but if one wears a pair of shoes ones feet will be comfortable everywhereOne can never be free from enmity by eliminating all ones foes but if one strikes down one thing  the thought of hate  one will see no enemies anywhereThe Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all

reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practiceThese works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first aroseHowever much the modern world may pride itself on its triumphs over the follies and foibles of the past it appears that the progress we credit ourselves with has been bought at a price so steep as to throw into question the worth of our achievementsThis price has been nothing less than the shared conviction that our lives are endowed with ultimate meaningThough in earlier ages men and women lived in a space populated largely by figments of the collective imagination they could still claim a precious asset that we sorely lack a firm and buoyant belief that their everyday lives were encompassed by a penumbra of enduring significance stemming from their relation to a transcendent goalPresentday attitudes however molded by scientific reductionism and technocratic audacity have combined forces to sweep away from our minds even the faint suspicion that our lives may possess any deeper meaning than material prosperity and technological innovationFor an increasing number of people today the consequence of this militancy has been a pervasive sense of meaninglessnessCut loose from our moorings in a living spiritual tradition we find ourselves adrift on a sea of confusion where all values seem arbitrary and relativeWe float aimlessly along the waves of caprice without any supreme purpose to serve as the polestar for our ideals as the wellspring for inspired thought and actionBut just as little as nature can tolerate a vacuum so humankind can little tolerate a complete loss of meaningThence to escape the plunge into the abyss of meaninglessness we grasp after flotsam attempting to immerse ourselves in distractionsWe pursue pleasure and power seek to augment our wealth and status surround ourselves with contraptions invest our hopes in personal relationships that only conceal our own inner povertyAt the same time however that our absorption in distractions helps us to cope with the psychological void it also stifles in us a deeper and still more insistent need  the longing for a peace and freedom that does not depend upon external contingenciesOne of the great blessings of the Buddhas teaching is the remedy it can offer for the problem of meaninglessness so widespread in human life todayThe Dhamma can serve as a source of meaning primarily because it provides us with the two requisites of a meaningful life an ultimate goal for which to live and a clearcut but flexible set of instructions by which we can advance toward that goal from whatever station in life we start fromIn the Buddhas teaching the quest for ultimate meaning does not begin as in the theistic religions with propositions about a supernatural scheme of salvation to be assented to in faithIt begins rather by focusing upon an experiential problem right at the crux of human existenceThe problem of course is the problem of suffering the boundaries of which are shown to extend beyond our immediate subjection to pain misery and sorrow and to encompass all that is conditioned precisely because of its impermanence its vulnerability its lack of abiding substanceThe goal of the teaching the unconditioned element which is Nibbana then comes to have a decisive bearing upon our vital concerns because it is apprehended as the cessation of sufferingThough in its own nature it defies all the limiting categories of conceptual thought as the cessation of suffering Nibbana provides the final answer to our innermost yearnings for an imperishable peace for complete freedom from sorrow anxiety and distressThe way that the quest for this goal intersects with the course of our everyday life is made plain by the Buddhas analysis of the cause of sufferingThe cause of suffering the Buddha holds lies within ourself in our selfish craving conjoined with blinding ignorance in the three evil roots that taint our normal engagement with the world greed hate and delusionThence the freedom from suffering that we seek lies in the eradication of these three rootsTo orient our life toward the goal of deliverance from suffering requires that we tread the path that leads to and merges with the goalThis path is the Noble Eightfold Path which brings an end to suffering and bondage by enabling us to extricate the causes of suffering embedded in our heartsWe begin the path exactly where we are in the midst of error and defilement and by clarifying our views transforming our attitudes and purifying our minds we advance by stages toward the direct realization of the ultimate goodIf the goal toward which the path points lies beyond the pale of conditioned existence to walk the eightfold path is to discover within the confines of conditioned existence dimensions of meaning previously unknownThis richness of meaning stems from a twofold sourceOne is the recognition that the following of the path brings a diminishment of suffering for ourselves as well as others and at the same time an enhancement of joy mental equipoise and peaceThe other source of meaning is the conviction that the values we are pursuing are not merely subjective and arbitrary but are grounded in an absolutely objective order in the very nature of thingsAs we embark on the way to the end of suffering the final goal no longer appears merely as a distant shore but becomes refracted in our experience as the challenge of overcoming the unwholesome roots and of assisting our fellow beings to do the sameThis challenge the task of actualizing our own good and the good of others becomes at the same time lifes inner core of meaning to transmute greed into generosity and relinquishment to replace hate with love and compassion and to dispel delusion with the light of liberative wisdomThe Buddhist Publication

Buddhist thought and practiceThese works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first aroseIt is one of the bitterest ironies of human life that although virtually all human beings cherish a desire to live in peace we continually find ourselves embroiled in conflict pitted against others in relationships marred by tension distrust or open hostilityThis irony is particularly poignant because it is immediately evident to us that cordial harmonious relations with others are a necessary condition for our own genuine happinessNot only do such relations allow us to pursue undisturbed the goals we consider essential to our personal fulfillment but they bring us the deeper joy of meaningful communion with our fellow human beingsContentious living in contrast is always intrinsically painful involving a hardening of our subjective armor a tightening of the knots of anger and hateIndeed whatever the outcome of conflict may be  whether victory or defeat  the result itself is ultimately detrimental for both victor and victim alikeNevertheless although harmonious living promises such rich blessings while discordant relations entail so much harm and misery for the most part our lives  and the lives of those around us  are entangled in a raveled net of quarrels and disputesConflict may simmer within as silent suspicion and resentment or it may explode into violent rage and devastationIt may implicate us at the level of personal relationships or as members of an ethnic group a political party a social class or a nationBut in one or another of its many manifestations the presence of conflict in our lives seems inescapablePeace and harmony hover in the distance as beautiful dreams for a summers night or noble ideals to which we pledge formal allegianceBut when reality knocks and dreams are dispelled we find ourselves drawn usually against our better judgment into an arena where the pleasures that we seek exact as their price the hard cash of struggle and contentionThe teachings of the Buddha while framed around the goal of individual deliverance from suffering are also expounded for the purpose of instructing us in how we can live in harmony with othersSuch harmony is desirable not only as a source of satisfaction in itself but also because it is a prerequisite for treading the path to the higher freedomThe final peace of enlightenment can arise only in a mind that is at peace with others and the mind can only be at peace with others when we are actively committed to a course of training that enables us to extricate the roots of conflict that lie buried deep within our heartsOnce in ancient India Sakka the ruler of the gods came to the Buddha and asked By what bonds are people bound whereby though they wish to live in peace without hate and hostility they yet live in conflict with hate and hostility The Master replied It is the bonds of envy and avarice that so bind people that though they wish to live in peace they live in conflict with hate and hostility If we trace external conflicts back to their source we will find that they originate not in wealth position or possessions but in the mind itselfThey spring up because we envy others for the qualities they possess which we desire for ourselves and because we are driven by an unquenchable avarice to extend the boundaries of what we can label mineEnvy and avarice in turn are grounded in two more fundamental psychological conditionsEnvy arises because we identify things as I because we perpetually seek to establish a personal identity for ourselves internally and to project that identity outward for others to recognize and acceptAvarice arises because we appropriate we attempt to carve out a territory for ourselves and to furnish that territory with possessions that will titillate our greed and sense of selfimportanceConflict being thus rooted in envy and avarice it follows that the path to nonconflict must be a course of relinquishment of removing the constrictive thoughts and desires that pivot around the notions of I and mine the drives to identify and to possessThis course reaches consummation with the full maturity of wisdom with insight into the empty egoless nature of all phenomena for it is this insight which exposes the hollowness of the notions of I and mine that underlie envy and avariceHowever although the final liberation from clinging may lie far away the path leading to it is a gradual one growing out of simpler more basic steps that lie very close to our feetTwo such necessary steps are changes in attitude with the power to transmute envy and avariceOne is altruistic joy the ability to view the success of others with the same gladness we experience at our own successThe other is generosity the readiness to give and to relinquishThe former is the specific antidote for envy the latter the antidote for avariceWhat is common to both is a lifting of the sense of identity from its narrow fixation on the self and a broadening of it to encompass others who share our desire to be happy and free from sufferingAs private individuals we cannot hope to resolve by our will the larger patterns of conflict that engulf the societies and nations to which we belongWe live in a world that thrives on conflict and in which the forces that nurture conflict are pervasive obstinate and terribly powerfulBut as followers of the Enlightened One what we can do and must do is to testify by our conduct to the supremacy of peace to avoid words and actions that engender animosity to heal divisions to demonstrate the value of harmony and concordThe model we must emulate is that provided by the Master in his description of the true disciple He is one who unites the divided who promotes friendships enjoys concord rejoices in concord delights in concord and who speaks words that promote concordThe

contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practiceThese works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first aroseMost of us live in the cramped cold cages of our private projects frantically struggling to stake out our own little comfortable place in the sunDriven in circles by anxious yearnings and beckoning desires we rarely ever glance aside to see how our neighbor is faring and when we do it is usually only to assure ourselves that he is not trying to encroach upon our own domain or to find some means by which we might extend our dominion over hisOccasionally however it somehow happens that we manage to detach ourselves from our obsessive pursuits long enough to arrive at a wider clearingHere our focus of concern undergoes a remarkable shiftLifted above our habitual fixation on myopic goals we are brought to realize that we share our journey from birth to death with countless other beings who like ourselves are each intent on a quest for the goodThis realization which often topples our egocentric notions of the good broadens and deepens our capacity for empathyBy breaking down the walls of selfconcern it allows us to experience with a particularly inward intimacy the desire all beings cherish to be free from harm and to find an inviolable happiness and securityNevertheless to the extent that this flowering of empathy is not a mere emotional effusion but is accompanied by a facility for accurate observation it can easily turn into a chute plunging us down from our newfound freedom into a chasm of anguish and despairFor when with eyes unhindered by emotively tinged blinkers we turn to contemplate the wide expanse of the world we find ourselves gazing into a mass of suffering that is vertiginous in its volume and ghastly in its intensityThe guarantor of our complacency is the dumb thoughtless glee with which we acquiesce in our daily ration of sensual excitation and egoenhancing kudosLet us raise our heads a little higher and cast our eyes about and we behold a world steeped in pain where the ills inherent in the normal lifecycle are compounded still more by the harshness of nature the grim irony of accident and the cruelty of human beingsAs we grope about for a handle to prevent ourselves from plummeting down into the pits of despondency we may find the support we need in a theme taught for frequent recollection by the Buddha Beings are the owners of their kamma the heirs of their kamma they are molded formed and upheld by their kamma and they inherit the results of their own good and bad deeds Often enough this reflection has been proposed as a means to help us adjust to the vicissitudes in our personal fortunes to accept gain and loss success and failure pleasure and pain with a mind that remains unperturbedThis same theme however can also serve a wider purpose offering us succor when we contemplate the immeasurably greater suffering in which the multitudes of our fellow beings are embroiledConfronted with a world that is ridden with conflict violence exploitation and destruction we feel compelled to find some way to make sense out of their evil consequences to be able to see in calamity and devastation something more than regrettable but senseless quirks of fateThe Buddhas teaching on kamma and its fruit gives us the key to decipher the otherwise unintelligible stream of eventsIt instructs us to recognize in the diverse fortunes of living beings not caprice or accident but the operation of a principle of moral equilibrium which ensures that ultimately a perfect balance obtains between the happiness and suffering beings undergo and the ethical quality of their intentional actionsContemplation on the operation of kamma is not a cold and calculated expedient for justifying a stoical resignation to the status quoThe pathways of kamma are labyrinthine in their complexity and acceptance of this causal order does not preclude a battle against human avarice brutality and stupidity or stifle beneficent action intended to prevent unwholesome deeds from finding the opportunity to ripenDeep reflection on kammic retribution does however brace us against the shocks of calamity and disappointment by opening up to our vision the stubborn unwieldiness of a world ruled by greed hate and delusion and the deep hidden lawfulness connecting its turbulent undercurrents with the backandforth swing of surface eventsWhile on the one hand this contemplation awakens a sense of urgency a drive to escape the repetitive round of deed and result on the other it issues in equanimity an unruffled inner poise founded upon a realistic grasp of our existential plightGenuine equanimity which is far from callous indifference sustains us in our journey through the rapids of samsaraBestowing upon us courage and endurance it enables us to meet the fluctuations of fortune without being shaken by them and to look into the face of the worlds sufferings without being shattered by themThe Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the

a collection of reflections primarily on issues of Christian faith but the book also features the Popes assessment of other religions including a short chapter on BuddhismThe Pontiffs words in this chapter are far from appreciativeThe release of the book in Sri Lanka on the eve of the Popes visit to this country this past January stirred up waves of indignation in the Buddhist community that spread as far as the VaticanThe Buddhist prelates announced that they would not attend an interreligious meeting requested by the Pope unless he formally retracted his unfavorable remarks about BuddhismAlthough on arrival the Pope tried to appease the feelings of Buddhist leaders by declaring his esteem for their religion even quoting the Dhammapada he fell short of proffering a full apology and this did not satisfy the Sangha eldersThe following essay is intended as a short corrective to the Popes demeaning characterization of BuddhismIt addresses the issues solely at the level of ideas without delving into the question whether ulterior motives lay behind the Popes pronouncementsThe essay is based on an article written for a Polish publisher Source which is presently compiling a book on the Buddhist response to the Popes bookThe Pope states that the Buddhist tradition and the methods deriving from it have an almost exclusively negative soteriology Such a view of the Buddhist teachings was widespread among Christian missionaries in Asia during the th century serving to justify their evangelical incursions into the heartlands of BuddhismSerious scholars of comparative religion have long recognized this view to be a misrepresentation rooted in the case of the early missionaries partly in misunderstanding partly in deliberate distortionIt is therefore puzzling that the present head of the Catholic Church otherwise so well informed should repeat these wornout lines particularly at a time when greater mutual understanding is expected from the leaders of different religionsThe Pope does not explain exactly why he regards Buddhist soteriology as negativeMost likely he takes this view because the Buddhist path of deliverance does not recognize a personal God as the agent and end of salvationLike beauty however what is negative and what is positive lies in the eye of the beholder and what is negative for one may turn out to be anothers supreme idealIf one seeks an everlasting union between ones eternal soul and a creator God then a doctrine that denies the existence of an eternal soul and a Divine Creator will inevitably appear negativeIf one regards everything conditioned as impermanent and devoid of self and seeks deliverance in Nibbana the Deathless Element then a doctrine of everlasting union between God and the soul will seem  not negative perhaps  but founded upon wishful thinking and unacceptable articles of faithFor the ordinary reader however the word negative when applied to Buddhism will suggest something far different from a philosophically acute way of approaching the Ultimate conjuring up pictures of a bleak doctrine of escapism aimed at personal annihilationBehind the Popes words we can detect echoes of the ancient texts There are monks some recluses and brahmans who charge me with being an annihilationist saying that the recluse Gotama teaches the annihilation of an existent beingThat is false misrepresentationWhat I teach in the past as also now is suffering and the cessation of sufferingEven more worrisome than the Popes characterization of the Buddhist doctrine of salvation as negative is his contention that the Buddhist doctrine of salvation constitutes the central point or rather the only point of this system The conclusion implied by this pronouncement left hanging silently behind the lines is that Buddhism is incapable of offering meaningful guidance to people immersed in the problems of everyday life it is an otherworldly religion of escape suited only for those of an ascetic bentWhile Western scholars in the past have focused upon the Buddhist doctrine of salvation as their main point of interest the living traditions of Buddhism as practiced by its adherents reveal that this attitude being onesided to begin with must yield onesided resultsThe Buddhist texts themselves show that Buddhism addresses as wide a range of concerns as any other of humanitys great religionsNibbana remains the ultimate goal of Buddhism and is certainly the central point of the Dhamma but it is by no means the only point for which the Buddha proclaimed his TeachingAccording to the Buddhist texts the Dhamma is intended to promote three types of good each by way of different but overlapping sets of principlesThese three goals though integrated into the framework of a single internally consistent teaching enable the Dhamma to address individuals at different stages of spiritual development with varying capacities for comprehensionThe three goods areFor most Buddhists in their daytoday lives the pursuit of Nibbana is a distant rather than an immediate goal to be approached gradually during the long course of rebirthsUntil they are ready for a direct assault on the final good they expect to walk the path for many lives within samsara pursuing their mundane welfare while aspiring for the UltimateTo assist them in this endeavor the Buddha has taught numerous guidelines that pertain to ethically upright living within the confines of the worldIn the Sigalovada Sutta for example he enumerates the reciprocal duties of parents and children husband and wife friends and friends employers and employees teachers and students religious and laityHe made right livelihood an integral part of the Noble Eightfold Path and explained what it implies in the life of a busy lay personDuring his long ministry he gave advice to merchants on the prudent conduct of business to young wives on how to behave toward their husbands to rulers on how to administer their stateAll such guidance issuing from the Buddhas great compassion is designed to promote the welfare and happiness of the world while at the same time steering his followers toward a pleasant rebirth and gradual progress toward final liberationYet while the Buddha offers a graduated teaching adjusted to the varying life situations of his disciples he does not allow any illusion to linger about the ultimate aim of his DoctrineThat aim is Nibbana which is not a consoling reconciliation with the world but irreversible deliverance from the worldSuch deliverance cannot be gained merely by piety and good works performed in a spirit of social sympathyIt can be won only by renunciation by the relinquishment of all acquisitions including among such acquisitions the bodily and mental processes that we identify as our selfThe achievement of this end is necessarily individualIt must be arrived at through personal purification and personal insight as the fruit of sustained effort in fulfilling the entire course of trainingHence the Buddha did not set out to found a church capable of embracing all humanity within the fold of a single creedHe lays down a path  a path perfect in its ideal formulation  to be trodden by imperfect human beings under the imperfect conditions that life within the world affordsWhile the quest for the highest goal culminates in deliverance from the world this same ideal bends back toward the world and spells out standards of conduct and a scale of values to guide the unenlightened manyfolk in their daily struggles against the streams of greed hatred and delusionNibbana remains the chief point and the omega point of the DhammaBut as this goal is to be experienced as the extinction of greed hatred and delusion it defines the condition for its realization as a life devoted to overcoming greed through generosity to overcoming hatred through patience and loving kindness and to overcoming delusion through wisdom and understandingIn Crossing the Threshold of Hope Pope John Paul asserts that the enlightenment experienced by the Buddha comes down to the conviction that the world is bad that it is the source of evil and suffering for manNo doubt the fact that the book consistently encloses the word enlightenment in quotation marks already suggests that the Popes attitude to Buddhism is not an appreciative oneThis suggestion is confirmed by his manner of characterizing the content of the enlightenment which reduces the Buddhas great awakening beneath the Bodhi tree to a caricatureBy way of rejoinder it should first be said that Buddhism does not regard the world in itself as either good or bad and the Buddha never described the world as the source of evil for manThe Buddhist texts scrupulously use terms with moral connotations such as good and evil solely to evaluate intentional actions and the persons and states of mind from which such actions springThey do not ascribe moral qualities to entities that are incapable of moral initiativeThus actions are bad when they intend harm and suffering for oneself and others good when they aim at promoting happiness and wellbeingThe Buddhas analysis of the roots of good and evil also proceeds entirely within the sphere of psychological ethics without overstepping the bounds of that domainAccording to the Buddha the roots of evil are the unwholesome springs of action greed hatred and delusion the roots of good are nongreed nonhatred and nondelusion ie detachment lovingkindness and understandingThe process of spiritual development in Buddhism can be described from one angle as the attenuation and eradication of the unwholesome roots by the cultivation of their wholesome oppositesThe entire process centers upon the mind as the sole source of both good and evil with the world set well in the background of this striving for internal purificationIn his formula of the Four Noble Truths the Buddha does declare that worldly existence is dukkha but dukkha does not mean evilIt means rather unsatisfactory inadequate subject to sufferingTo understand why the Buddha states that all worldly existence is dukkha one must view this statement in its wider contextAccording to the Buddhas teaching our individual lives unfold within a beginningless cycle of rebirths samsara wherein all living beings except the enlightened ones wander on driven by the thirst for continued becomingEach individual life beginning with birth and ending with death is thus but a link in an infinite chain of lives a single turn of the wheel of existenceAs we move within samsara again and again we undergo birth aging illness and death again and again we experience pain and sorrow anxiety and stress conflict and disappointmentIt is for this reason that the Buddha declares that life within the confines of samsara is dukkhaBuddhism locates the cause of our suffering not in the world considered as an objective reality but in our own mindsThe root of suffering is ignorance coupled with craving because we fail to understand the true nature of things our lives are propelled by blind desires for pleasure power and renewed becoming desires which eventuate in pain and griefThe Buddhas teaching is concerned not with the obliteration of the world but with the obliteration of ignorance and cravingWhen greed hatred and delusion are quenched one then experiences the perfect peace of Nibbana throughout the duration of ones life in the world and with the end of life one is permanently released from the round of rebirths into the UnconditionedThe Pontiff describes Nibbana as a state of perfect indifference with regard to the world adding that in Buddhism salvation means above all to free oneself from evil by becoming indifferent to the world which is the source of evilBy such statements he represents Buddhism to his readers as a quietistic doctrine of withdrawal which can address the momentous problems that face humanity today only by politely turning its back on themThis is hardly a satisfactory depiction of Early Buddhism in which transcendence of the world is stressed let alone of Mahayana Buddhism in which the bodhisattvas compassionate activity on behalf of the world becomes the guiding idealThe Pali word that the Pope interprets as indifference is presumably upekkhaThe real meaning of this word is equanimity not indifference in the sense of unconcern for othersAs a spiritual virtue upekkha means equanimity in the face of the fluctuations of worldly fortuneIt is evenness of mind unshakeable freedom of mind a state of inner equipoise that cannot be upset by gain and loss honor and dishonor praise and blame pleasure and painUpekkha is freedom from all points of selfreference it is indifference only to the demands of the egoself with its craving for pleasure and position not to the wellbeing of ones fellow human beingsTrue equanimity is the pinnacle of the four social attitudes that the Buddhist texts call the divine abodes boundless lovingkindness compassion altruistic joy and equanimityThe last does not override and negate the preceding three but perfects and consummates themIf Buddhism in practice has not always lived up to the high ideals posited by the original Teaching this is to be understood as a result of the downward gravitational pull of human nature not as a consequence of any emphasis on apathy and indifference in the pristine DhammaThe Buddhist texts provide ample evidence that the attainment of Nibbana does not issue in a stolid indifference to the worldThe Buddha himself the ideal model for his followers led an active life of years after his enlightenment dedicated to the uplift of humanityThroughout Buddhist history the great spiritual masters of the Dhamma have emulated the Awakened Ones example heeding his injunction to wander forth for the welfare and happiness of many out of compassion for the world for the good welfare and happiness of devas and humansIt is not only enlightened monks and nuns who have displayed this sense of spiritual missionAs a corporate whole Buddhism has inspired and animated all the Asian cultures in which it has taken rootIt spread without violence and bloodshed without forcible conversions winning adherents entirely by its lofty teachings and the exemplary lives of its followersWherever the Dhamma took root it has provided hope and encouragement pointing to lofty ethical and spiritual ideals spelling out concrete codes of moral guidance for the whole societyIt needs only a little reflection to decide whether such a result is possible in a doctrine that advocates total apathy or callous selfabsorption as the highest goodThe Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creedsFounded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topicsIts publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddhas discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practiceThese works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first aroseIt is perhaps symptomatic of the fallen nature of the ordinary human condition that few of us pass the full extent of our lives comfortably reconciled to our natural selvesEven in the midst of prosperity and success grinding notes of discontent trouble our days and disturbing dreams come to haunt our sleepAs long as our eyes remain coated with dust we incline to locate the cause of our discontent outside ourselves  in spouse neighbor or job in implacable fate or fluky chanceBut when the dust drops off and our eyes open we soon find that the real cause lies withinWhen we discover how deeply the cause of our unhappiness is lodged in the mind the realization dawns that cosmetic changes will not be anywhere near enough that a fundamental internal transformation is requiredThis desire for a transformed personality for the emergence of a new man from the ashes of the old is one of the perennial lures of the human heartFrom ancient times it has been a potent wellspring of the spiritual quest and even in the secular lifeaffirming culture of our own cosmopolitan age this longing has not totally disappearedWhile such concepts as redemption salvation and deliverance may no longer characterize the transformation that is sought the urge for a radical reshaping of the personality persists as strong as ever appearing in guises that are compatible with the secular worldviewWhere previously this urge sought fulfillment in the temple ashram and monastery it now resorts to new venues the office of the psychoanalyst the weekend workshop the panoply of newly spawned therapies and cultsHowever despite the change of scene and conceptual framework the basic pattern remains the sameDisgruntled with the ruts of our ingrained habits we long to exchange all that is dense and constrictive in our personalities for a new lighter freer mode of beingSelftransformation is also a fundamental goal of the Buddhas teaching an essential part of his program for liberation from sufferingThe Dhamma was never intended for those who are already perfect saintsIt is addressed to fallible human beings beset with all the shortcomings typical of unpolished human nature conduct that is fickle and impulsive minds that are tainted by greed anger and selfishness views that are distorted and habits that lead to harm for oneself and othersThe purpose of the teaching is to transform such people  ourselves  into accomplished ones into those whose every action is pure whose minds are calm and composed whose wisdom has fathomed the deepest truths and whose conduct is always marked by a compassionate concern for others and for the welfare of the worldBetween these two poles of the teaching  the flawed and knotted personality that we bring with us as raw material into the training and the fully liberated personality that emerges in the end  there lies a gradual process of selftransformation governed by highly specific guidelinesThis transformation is effected by the twin aspects of the path abandoning the removal from the mind of all that is harmful and unwholesome and development the cultivation of qualities that are wholesome pure and purifyingWhat distinguishes the Buddhas program for selftransformation from the multitude of other systems proposing a similar end is the contribution made by another principle with which it is invariably conjoinedThis is the principle of selftranscendence the endeavor to relinquish all attempts to establish a sense of solid personal identityIn the Buddhist training the aim of transforming the personality must be complemented by a parallel effort to overcome all identification with the elements that constitute our phenomenal beingThe teaching of anatta or notself is not so much a philosophical thesis calling for intellectual assent as a prescription for selftranscendenceIt maintains that our ongoing attempt to establish a sense of identity by taking our personalities to be I and mine is in actuality a project born out of clinging a project that at the same time lies at the root of our sufferingIf therefore we seek to be free from suffering we cannot stop with the transformation of the personality into some sublime and elevated mode as the final goalWhat is needed rather is a transformation that brings about the removal of clinging and with it the removal of all tendencies to selfaffirmationIt is important to stress this transcendent aspect of the Dhamma because in our own time when immanent secular values are ascendent the temptation is great to let this aspect drop out of sightIf we assume that the worth of a practice consists solely in its ability to yield concrete thisworldly results we may incline to view the Dhamma simply as a means of refining and healing the divided personality leading in the end to a renewed affirmation of our mundane selves and our situation in the worldSuch an approach however would ignore the Buddhas insistence that all the elements of our personal existence are impermanent unsatisfactory and not self and his counsel that we should learn to distance ourselves from such things and ultimately to discard themIn the proper practice of the Dhamma both principles that of selftransformation and that of selftranscendence are equally crucialThe principle of selftransformation alone is blind leading at best to an ennobled personality but not to a liberated oneThe principle of selftranscendence alone is barren leading to a cold ascetic withdrawal devoid of the potential for enlightenmentIt is only when these two complementary principles work in harmony blended and balanced in the course of training that they can bridge the gap between the actual and ideal and bring to a fruitful conclusion the quest for the end of sufferingOf the two principles that of selftranscendence claims primacy both at the beginning of the path and at the endFor it is this principle that gives direction to the process of selftransformation revealing the goal toward which a transformation of the personality should lead and the nature of the changes required to bring the goal within our reachHowever the Buddhist path is not a perpendicular ascent to be scaled with picks ropes and studded boots but a stepbystep training which unfolds in a natural progressionThus the abrupt challenge of selftranscendence  the relinquishing of all points of attachment  is met and mastered by the gradual process of selftransformationBy moral discipline mental purification and the development of insight we advance by stages from our original condition of bondage to the domain of untrammeled freedomThe Buddhist

books and booklets covering a great range of topicsIts publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddhas discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practiceThese works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first aroseAt the same time that Buddhism has begun to gain a firm foothold in the West its fate in its traditional Asian homelands has been moving sadly in the opposite direction toward atrophy and declineAlready in several Asian Buddhist countries Buddhism has been forcibly suppressed while even in those countries which have preserved their political integrity the Dhamma no longer occupies the same sovereign place in peoples hearts that it held in an earlier eraAlthough devotional piety and a sense of Buddhist personal identity still remain strong throughout the breadth of Buddhist Asia cultural and ideological forces of great power have been unleashed which daily challenge the hegemony of the Dhamma as the key to meaning and value for those who profess it as their refugeAmong the changes taking place in current patterns of thinking perhaps the most detrimental to the Dhamma has been the rise to prominence of a materialistic world view which focuses upon the present life as the only field for all human endeavorThis world view need not be assented to intellectually with full awareness of its implications for it to become a major determinant of our attitudes and conductOften a curious ambivalence prevails in our minds where with one part of the mind we profess our confidence in the lofty principles of the Dhamma while with the other we think and act as if the present life were the sole occasion for human happiness and the achievement of worldly success were the true mark of the accomplished individualThe rapid spread of the materialistic world view has in turn brought about a farranging secularization of values that invades every nook and cranny of our livesThis transformation of values gives precedence to goals and attitudes diametrically opposed to those advocated by the Dhamma and under its impact the scales have tipped far away even from a reasonable balance between material and spiritual goodsNow we see acquisitiveness replacing contentment as the reigning ideal competition taking the place of cooperation fast efficiency the place of compassionate concern and selfish indulgence the place of abstinence and selfcontrolThe attempt to live simultaneously by two conflicting sets of principles  those being ushered in by secular materialism and those grounded in the Dhamma  generates a tension that contains within it a seed of very destructive potentialOften the tension is only dimly felt by those in the older generation who accept the new outlook and values without clearly perceiving the challenge they pose to traditional Buddhist idealsIt is when the contradiction is pushed down to the next generation to the Buddhist youth of today that the inherent incompatibility of the two perspectives comes into the open as a clearcut choice between two alternative philosophies of life  one proposing a hierarchy of values which culminates in the spiritual and sanctions restraint and renunciation the other holding up the indulgence and gratification of personal desire as the highest conceivable goalSince the latter appeals to strong and deepseated human drives it is hardly puzzling that so many young people today have turned away from the guidance of the Dhamma to pursue the new paths to instant pleasure opened up by the consumer society or in their frustration at missed opportunities to take to the path of violenceSince it is the younger generation that forms the vital link in the continuity of Buddhism connecting its past with its future it is of paramount importance that the Buddhist youth of today should retain their fidelity to the DhammaThe Dhamma should be for them not merely a symbol of cultural and ethnic identity not merely a focus point of sentimental piety but above all a path to be taken to heart personally applied and adhered to in those critical choices between present expediency and longrange spiritual gainThe problem however is precisely how to inspire the young to look to the Dhamma as their guide and infallible refugeIt must be stressed that our present dilemma goes far deeper than a breakdown of moral standards and thus that it cannot be easily rectified by pious preaching and moral exhortationIf conduct deviating from the Dhamma has become widespread among todays youth this is because the Buddhist vision has ceased to be meaningful to them and it has ceased to be meaningful not because it has lost its relevance but because it is not being presented in ways which highlight its timeless and everimmediate relevanceThe most urgent task facing those concerned with the preservation of Buddhism must be the attempt to communicate to the young the central vision at the heart of the Dhamma the vision from which all the specific doctrines and practices of Buddhism issue forthThis does not require a mastery of the technical details of the Dhamma but it does require that we ourselves understand the Dhammas essence and are actively striving to make that understanding the foundation of our livesBoth by precept and example we must show that true freedom is to be found not in uncontrolled license but in the control and mastery of desire that true happiness lies not in a proliferation of goods but in peace and contentment that our relations with others are most rewarding when they are governed not by conflict and competition but by kindness and compassion and that true security is to be achieved not by the acquisition of wealth and power but by the conquest of self with all its ambitions and conceitsThe Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creedsFounded in the BPS has

original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practiceThese works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first aroseLike a bird in flight borne by its two wings the practice of Dhamma is sustained by two contrasting qualities whose balanced development is essential to straight and steady progressThese two qualities are renunciation and compassionAs a doctrine of renunciation the Dhamma points out that the path to liberation is a personal course of training that centers on the gradual control and mastery of desire the root cause of sufferingAs a teaching of compassion the Dhamma bids us to avoid harming others to act for their welfare and to help realize the Buddhas own great resolve to offer the world the way to the DeathlessConsidered in isolation renunciation and compassion have inverse logics that at times seem to point us in opposite directionsThe one steers us to greater solitude aimed at personal purification the other to increased involvement with others issuing in beneficent actionYet despite their differences renunciation and compassion nurture each other in dynamic interplay throughout the practice of the path from its elementary steps of moral discipline to its culmination in liberating wisdomThe synthesis of the two their balanced fusion is expressed most perfectly in the figure of the Fully Enlightened One who is at once the embodiment of complete renunciation and of allembracing compassionBoth renunciation and compassion share a common root in the encounter with sufferingThe one represents our response to suffering confronted in our own individual experience the other our response to suffering witnessed in the lives of othersOur spontaneous reactions however are only the seeds of these higher qualities not their substanceTo acquire the capacity to sustain our practice of Dhamma renunciation and compassion must be methodically cultivated and this requires an ongoing process of reflection which transmutes our initial stirrings into fullfledged spiritual virtuesThe framework within which this reflection is to be exercised is the teaching of the Four Noble Truths which thus provides the common doctrinal matrix for both renunciation and compassionRenunciation develops out of our innate urge to avoid suffering and painBut whereas this urge prior to reflection leads to an anxious withdrawal from particular situations perceived as personally threatening reflection reveals the basic danger to lie in our existential situation itself  in being bound by ignorance and craving to a world which is inherently fearsome deceptive and unreliableThence the governing motive behind the act of renunciation is the longing for spiritual freedom coupled with the recognition that selfpurification is an inward task most easily accomplished when we distance ourselves from the outer circumstances that nourish our unwholesome tendenciesCompassion develops out of our spontaneous feelings of sympathy with othersHowever as a spiritual virtue compassion cannot be equated with a sentimental effusion of emotion nor does it necessarily imply a dictum to lose oneself in altruistic activityThough compassion surely includes emotional empathy and often does express itself in action it comes to full maturity only when guided by wisdom and tempered by detachmentWisdom enables us to see beyond the adventitious misfortunes with which living beings may be temporarily afflicted to the deep and hidden dimensions of suffering inseparable from conditioned existenceAs a profound and comprehensive understanding of the Four Noble Truths wisdom discloses to us the wide range diverse gradations and subtle roots of the suffering to which our fellow beings are enmeshed as well as the means to lead them to irreversible release from sufferingThence the directives of spontaneous sympathy and mature compassion are often contradictory and only the latter are fully trustworthy as guides to beneficent action effective in the highest degreeThough often the judicious exercise of compassion will require us to act or speak up sometimes it may well enjoin us to retreat into silence and solitude as the course most conducive to the longrange good of others as well as of ourselvesIn our attempt to follow the Dhamma one or the other of these twin cardinal virtues will have to be given prominence depending on our temperament and circumstancesHowever for monk and householder alike success in developing the path requires that both receive due attention and that deficiencies in either gradually be remediedOver time we will find that the two though tending in different directions eventually are mutually reinforcingCompassion impels us toward greater renunciation as we see how our own greed and attachment make us a danger to othersAnd renunciation impels us toward greater compassion since the relinquishing of craving enables us to exchange the narrow perspectives of the ego for the wider perspectives of a mind of boundless sympathyHeld together in this mutually strengthening tension renunciation and compassion contribute to the wholesome balance of the Buddhist path and to the completeness of its final fruitThe Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creedsFounded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topicsIts publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddhas discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practiceThese works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first aroseThough in principle the Buddhist path leads straight and unerringly from bondage to freedom when we apply it to ourselves it often seems to take a tortuous route as imposed by the twists and turns of our own contorted mental topographyUnless we have exceptionally mature wholesome roots we cannot expect to approach the goal as the crow flies soaring unhindered through the quick and blissful skyways of the jhanas and higher insightsInstead we must be prepared to tread the path at ground level moving slowly steadily and cautiously through the winding mountain roads of our own mindsWe begin at the inevitable point of departure  with the unique constellation of personal qualities habits and potentials that we bring with us into the practiceOur ingrained defilements and obstinate delusions as well as our hidden reserves of goodness inner strength and wisdom  these are at once the material out of which the practice is forged the terrain to be passed through and the vehicle that takes us to our destinationConfidence in the Buddhist path is a prerequisite for persisting on this journeyYet it often happens that though we may be fully convinced of the liberating efficacy of the Dhamma we stumble along perplexed as to how we can apply the Dhamma fruitfully to ourselvesOne major step toward reaping the benefits of Dhamma practice consists in making an honest assessment of ones own characterIf we are to utilize effectively the methods the Buddha has taught for overcoming the minds defilements we first must take stock of those particular defilements that are prevalent in our individual makeupIt will not suffice for us to sit back and console ourselves with the thought that the path leads infallibly to the end of greed hate and delusionFor the path to be effective in our own practice we have to become familiar with our own persistent greeds hates and delusions as they crop up in the round of daily lifeWithout this honest confrontation with ourselves all our other pursuits of Dhamma may be to no avail and can actually lead us astrayThough we may gain extensive knowledge of the Buddhist scriptures clarify our view and sharpen our powers of thought invest so many hours on the meditation cushion and walkway if we do not attend to the blemishes in our characters these other achievements far from extricating the defilements may instead only go to reinforce themYet though honest selfassessment is one of the most vital steps in Dhamma practice it is also one of the most difficultWhat makes it so difficult is the radically new perspective that must be adopted to undertake an investigation of oneself and the dense barriers that must be penetrated to arrive at truthful selfunderstandingIn attempting to assess ourselves we are no longer observing an external entity which we can treat as an adventitious object to be evaluated in terms of our subjective purposesWe are observing instead the seat of observation itself that most elusive center from which we gaze out upon the world and we are doing so in a mode which casts all its motives and projects in a critical lightTo enter this domain of inquiry is to run smack up against our very sense of personal identity and thus to have to pierce the thick screens of delusion and blind emotivity which keep that sense of identity intactNormally in subservience to our need to confirm to ourselves our uniqueness and irreplaceable importance we proceed to construct mental pictures  indeed a picture gallery  of what we imagine ourselves to beThe selfimage that emerges from these pictures becomes simultaneously a mainstay which we cling to in order to maintain our selfesteem and a standpoint from which we orient ourselves toward others and launch our projects in the worldTo secure its tenuous status the mind employs a variety of tactics behind the back of our conscious awarenessIt throws up blinders which keep out disturbing information it flatters us with fantasied projections it drives us to manipulate people and situations in ways that will seem to validate our tacit assumptions about our virtues and identityAll these projects born of the quest to substantiate our sense of identity only increase our sufferingThe more we lock ourselves into the images we form of ourselves the more we alienate ourselves from others and close off our access to liberating truthThence release from suffering requires that we gradually discard our delusive selfimages through rigorous examination of our mindsThe venerable Sariputta in the Discourse on No Blemishes stresses the role of honest selfassessment as a prerequisite of spiritual growthHe points out that just as a dirty bronze bowl deposited in a dusty place and utterly neglected only becomes dirtier and dustier so if we fail to recognize the blemishes of our minds we will not make any effort to eliminate them but will continue to harbor greed hate and delusion and will die with a corrupted mindAnd just as a dirty bronze bowl which is cleaned and polished will in time become bright and radiant so if we recognize the blemishes of our minds we will arouse our energy to purify them and having purged ourselves of blemishes we will die with an undefiled mindThe task of selfknowledge is always a difficult one but it is only by knowing our minds that we will be able to shape them and it is only by shaping our minds that we can liberate themThe Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creedsFounded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topicsIts publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddhas discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practiceThese works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first aroseThe recent upsurge of interest in Buddhism both East and West has been marked by a vigorous practical orientation and a drive to discover the peace and freedom to which the practice of Dhamma leadsThis zeal for practice however has often been accompanied by another trait which may not be so fruitful namely a tendency to neglect or even belittle the methodical study of the Buddhas teachingsThe arguments offered in defense of this attitude have already become familiar currency among usIt is said for example that study is concerned with words and concepts not with realities that it leads only to learning not to wisdom that it can change only our ideas but fails to touch us at the deeper levels of our livesTo clinch the case the testimony of the Buddha himself is enlisted with his famous remarks that to learn much without practicing is like counting the cows of others or like carrying a raft on ones head instead of using it to cross the streamThis contention to be sure has its aspect of truth but also suffers from a onesided emphasis which may actually thwart rather than aid our progress on the Buddhist pathIt is certainly true that learning without practice is fruitless but the other side of the issue also should be consideredShould a person gather cows if he knows nothing about how to take care of themShould he try to cross a rough and dangerous river without knowing how to operate a raftThe Buddha himself insisted that his followers learn and transmit the Dhamma both in the letter and the spirit but rather than appealing to traditional formulations let us inquire ourselves into the value and function of Dhamma studyThe point at issue it must be stressed is not study as an academic discipline or the accumulation of a wealth of learning but the acquisition of a sound and solid working knowledge of the basic Buddhist doctrinesNow to see why this is so essential we must recall that the entire practice of the proper Buddhist path develops out of the act through which we enter the path  the going for refuge to the Triple GemIf we have taken this step honestly with correct motivation it implies that we have acknowledged our need for spiritual guidance and have entrusted ourselves to the Buddha as our guide and to his teaching as our vehicle of guidanceBy taking refuge in the Dhamma we accept not merely a technique of meditation that we can use at liberty for our own selfappointed purposes but a profound and comprehensive teaching on the true nature of the human condition a teaching designed to awaken in us a perception of this truth as the means for reaching the full and final end of sufferingThe liberation offered by the Dhamma comes not from simply practicing meditation in the context of our own preconceptions and desires but from practicing upon the groundwork of the right understanding and right intentions communicated to us by the BuddhaThis cognitive character of the Buddhist path elevates doctrinal study and intellectual inquiry to a position of great importanceThough the knowledge that frees the mind from bondage emerges only from intuitive insight and not from a mass of doctrinal facts genuine insight always develops on the basis of a preliminary conceptual grasp of the basic principles essential to right understanding in the absence of which its growth will inevitably be obstructedThe study and systematic reflection through which we arrive at this preparatory right view necessarily involve concepts and ideasBut before we hasten to dismiss Dhamma study as being therefore only a worthless tangle of verbiage let us consider that concepts and ideas are our indispensable tools of understanding and communicationConcepts however can be valid and invalid tools of understanding ideas can be fruitful or useless capable of bringing immense benefit or of entailing enormous harmThe object of studying the Dhamma as part of our spiritual quest is to learn to comprehend our experience correctly to be able to distinguish the valid from the invalid the true from the false the wholesome from the unwholesomeIt is only by making a thorough and careful investigation that we will be in a position to reject what is detrimental to our growth and to apply ourselves with confidence to cultivating what is truly beneficialWithout having reached this preliminary conceptual clarification without having succeeded in straightening out our views there can indeed be the earnest practice of Buddhist meditation techniques but there will not be the practice of the meditation pertaining to the integral Noble Eightfold PathAnd while such freebased meditation may bring its practitioners the mundane benefits of greater calm awareness and equanimity lacking the guidance of right view and the driving power of right motivation it is questionable whether it can lead to the penetrative realization of the Dhamma or to its final goal the complete cessation of sufferingIt is almost impossible to give a single word of counsel on the subject of study applicable to all followers of the DhammaNeeds and interests vary so greatly from one person to another that each will have to strike the balance between study and practice that suits his or her own dispositionBut without hesitation it can be said that all who earnestly endeavor to live by the Buddhas teaching will find their practice strengthened by the methodical study of his DhammaSuch an undertaking of course will not be easy but it is just through facing and surmounting the challenges we meet that our understanding will ripen and mature in the higher wisdomThe Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creedsFounded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topicsIts publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddhas discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practiceThese works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first aroseAn ancient maxim found in the Dhammapada sums up the practice of the Buddhas teaching in three simple guidelines to training to abstain from all evil to cultivate good and to purify ones mindThese three principles form a graded sequence of steps progressing from the outward and preparatory to the inward and essentialEach step leads naturally into the one that follows it and the culmination of the three in purification of mind makes it plain that the heart of Buddhist practice is to be found herePurification of mind as understood in the Buddhas teaching is the sustained endeavor to cleanse the mind of defilements those dark unwholesome mental forces which run beneath the surface stream of consciousness vitiating our thinking values attitudes and actionsThe chief among the defilements are the three that the Buddha has termed the roots of evil  greed hatred and delusion  from which emerge their numerous offshoots and variants anger and cruelty avarice and envy conceit and arrogance hypocrisy and vanity the multitude of erroneous viewsContemporary attitudes do not look favorably upon such notions as defilement and purity and on first encounter they may strike us as throwbacks to an outdated moralism valid perhaps in an era when prudery and taboo were dominant but having no claims upon us emancipated torchbearers of modernityAdmittedly we do not all wallow in the mire of gross materialism and many among us seek our enlightenments and spiritual highs but we want them on our own terms and as heirs of the new freedom we believe they are to be won through an unbridled quest for experience without any special need for introspection personal change or selfcontrolHowever in the Buddhas teaching the criterion of genuine enlightenment lies precisely in purity of mindThe purpose of all insight and enlightened understanding is to liberate the mind from the defilements and Nibbana itself the goal of the teaching is defined quite clearly as freedom from greed hatred and delusionFrom the perspective of the Dhamma defilement and purity are not mere postulates of a rigid authoritarian moralism but real and solid facts essential to a correct understanding of the human situation in the worldAs facts of lived experience defilement and purity pose a vital distinction having a crucial significance for those who seek deliverance from sufferingThey represent the two points between which the path to liberation unfolds  the former its problematic and starting point the latter its resolution and endThe defilements the Buddha declares lie at the bottom of all human sufferingBurning within as lust and craving as rage and resentment they lay to waste hearts lives hopes and civilizations and drive us blind and thirsty through the round of birth and deathThe Buddha describes the defilements as bonds fetters hindrances and knots thence the path to unbonding release and liberation to untying the knots is at the same time a discipline aimed at inward cleansingThe work of purification must be undertaken in the same place where the defilements arise in the mind itself and the main method the Dhamma offers for purifying the mind is meditationMeditation in the Buddhist training is neither a quest for selfeffusive ecstasies nor a technique of homeapplied psychotherapy but a carefully devised method of mental development  theoretically precise and practically efficient  for attaining inner purity and spiritual freedomThe principal tools of Buddhist meditation are the core wholesome mental factors of energy mindfulness concentration and understandingBut in the systematic practice of meditation these are strengthened and yoked together in a program of selfpurification which aims at extirpating the defilements root and branch so that not even the subtlest unwholesome stirrings remainSince all defiled states of consciousness are born from ignorance the most deeply embedded defilement the final and ultimate purification of mind is to be accomplished through the instrumentality of wisdom the knowledge and vision of things as they really areWisdom however does not arise through chance or random good intentions but only in a purified mindThus in order for wisdom to come forth and accomplish the ultimate purification through the eradication of defilements we first have to create a space for it by developing a provisional purification of mind  a purification which though temporary and vulnerable is still indispensable as a foundation for the emergence of all liberative insightThe achievement of this preparatory purification of mind begins with the challenge of selfunderstandingTo eliminate defilements we must first learn to know them to detect them at work infiltrating and dominating our everyday thoughts and livesFor countless eons we have acted on the spur of greed hatred and delusion and thus the work of selfpurification cannot be executed hastily in obedience to our demand for quick resultsThe task requires patience care and persistence  and the Buddhas crystal clear instructionsFor every defilement the Buddha in his compassion has given us the antidote the method to emerge from it and vanquish itBy learning these principles and applying them properly we can gradually wear away the most stubborn inner stains and reach the end of suffering the taintless liberation of the mindThe Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a

influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first aroseIn this issue of the newsletter we have combined the feature essay with the Sutta Study column as we take a fresh look at an often quoted discourse of the Buddha the Kalama SuttaThe discourse  found in translation in Wheel No has been described as the Buddhas Charter of Free Inquiry and though the discourse certainly does counter the decrees of dogmatism and blind faith with a vigorous call for free investigation it is problematic whether the sutta can support all the positions that have been ascribed to itOn the basis of a single passage quoted out of context the Buddha has been made out to be a pragmatic empiricist who dismisses all doctrine and faith and whose Dhamma is simply a freethinkers kit to truth which invites each one to accept and reject whatever he likesBut does the Kalama Sutta really justify such viewsOr do we meet in these claims just another set of variations on that egregious old tendency to interpret the Dhamma according to whatever notions are congenial to oneself  or to those to whom one is preachingLet us take as careful a look at the Kalama Sutta as the limited space allotted to this essay will allow remembering that in order to understand the Buddhas utterances correctly it is essential to take account of his own intentions in making themThe passage that has been cited so often runs as follows Come KalamasDo not go upon what has been acquired by repeated hearing nor upon tradition nor upon rumor nor upon scripture nor upon surmise nor upon axiom nor upon specious reasoning nor upon bias toward a notion pondered over nor upon anothers seeming ability nor upon the consideration The monk is our teacher When you yourselves know These things are bad blamable censured by the wise undertaken and observed these things lead to harm and ill abandon them When you yourselves know These things are good blameless praised by the wise undertaken and observed these things lead to benefit and happiness enter on and abide in themNow this passage like everything else spoken by the Buddha has been stated in a specific context  with a particular audience and situation in view  and thus must be understood in relation to that contextThe Kalamas citizens of the town of Kesaputta had been visited by religious teachers of divergent views each of whom would propound his own doctrines and tear down the doctrines of his predecessorsThis left the Kalamas perplexed and thus when the recluse Gotama reputed to be an Awakened One arrived in their township they approached him in the hope that he might be able to dispel their confusionFrom the subsequent development of the sutta it is clear that the issues that perplexed them were the reality of rebirth and kammic retribution for good and evil deedsThe Buddha begins by assuring the Kalamas that under such circumstances it is proper for them to doubt an assurance which encourages free inquiryHe next speaks the passage quoted above advising the Kalamas to abandon those things they know for themselves to be bad and to undertake those things they know for themselves to be goodThis advice can be dangerous if given to those whose ethical sense is undeveloped and we can thus assume that the Buddha regarded the Kalamas as people of refined moral sensitivityIn any case he did not leave them wholly to their own resources but by questioning them led them to see that greed hate and delusion being conducive to harm and suffering for oneself and others are to be abandoned and their opposites being beneficial to all are to be developedThe Buddha next explains that a noble disciple devoid of covetousness and ill will undeluded dwells pervading the world with boundless lovingkindness compassion appreciative joy and equanimityThus purified of hate and malice he enjoys here and now four solaces If there is an afterlife and kammic result then he will undergo a pleasant rebirth while if there is none he still lives happily here and now if evil results befall an evildoer then no evil will befall him and if evil results do not befall an evildoer then he is purified anywayWith this the Kalamas express their appreciation of the Buddhas discourse and go for refuge to the Triple GemNow does the Kalama Sutta suggest as is often held that a follower of the Buddhist path can dispense with all faith and doctrine that he should make his own personal experience the criterion for judging the Buddhas utterances and for rejecting what cannot be squared with itIt is true the Buddha does not ask the Kalamas to accept anything he says out of confidence in himself but let us note one important point the Kalamas at the start of the discourse were not the Buddhas disciplesThey approached him merely as a counselor who might help dispel their doubts but they did not come to him as the Tathagata the Truthfinder who might show them the way to spiritual progress and to final liberationThus because the Kalamas had not yet come to accept the Buddha in terms of his unique mission as the discloser of the liberating truth it would not have been in place for him to expound to them the Dhamma unique to his own Dispensation such teachings as the Four Noble Truths the three characteristics and the methods of contemplation based upon themThese teachings are specifically intended for those who have accepted the Buddha as their guide to deliverance and in the suttas he expounds them only to those who have gained faith in the Tathagata and who possess the perspective necessary to grasp them and apply themThe Kalamas however at the start of the discourse are not yet fertile soil for him to sow the seeds of his liberating messageStill confused by the conflicting claims to which they have been exposed they are not yet clear even about the groundwork of moralityNevertheless after advising the Kalamas not to rely upon established tradition abstract reasoning and charismatic gurus the Buddha proposes to them a teaching that is immediately verifiable and capable of laying a firm foundation for a life of moral discipline and mental purificationHe shows that whether or not there be another life after death a life of moral restraint and of love and compassion for all beings brings its own intrinsic rewards here and now a happiness and sense of inward security far superior to the fragile pleasures that can be won by violating moral principles and indulging the minds desiresFor those who are not concerned to look further who are not prepared to adopt any convictions about a future life and worlds beyond the present one such a teaching will ensure their present welfare and their safe passage to a pleasant rebirth  provided they do not fall into the wrong view of denying an afterlife and kammic causationHowever for those whose vision is capable of widening to encompass the broader horizons of our existence this teaching given to the Kalamas points beyond its immediate implications to the very core of the DhammaFor the three states brought forth for examination by the Buddha  greed hate and delusion  are not merely grounds of wrong conduct or moral stains upon the mindWithin his teachings own framework they are the root defilements  the primary causes of all bondage and suffering  and the entire practice of the Dhamma can be viewed as the task of eradicating these evil roots by developing to perfection their antidotes  dispassion kindness and wisdomThus the discourse to the Kalamas offers an acid test for gaining confidence in the Dhamma as a viable doctrine of deliveranceWe begin with an immediately verifiable teaching whose validity can be attested by anyone with the moral integrity to follow it through to its conclusions namely that the defilements cause harm and suffering both personal and social that their removal brings peace and happiness and that the practices taught by the Buddha are effective means for achieving their removalBy putting this teaching to a personal test with only a provisional trust in the Buddha as ones collateral one eventually arrives at a firmer experientially grounded confidence in the liberating and purifying power of the DhammaThis increased confidence in the teaching brings along a deepened faith in the Buddha as teacher and thus disposes one to accept on trust those principles he enunciates that are relevant to the quest for awakening even when they lie beyond ones own capacity for verificationThis in fact marks the acquisition of right view in its preliminary role as the forerunner of the entire Noble Eightfold PathPartly in reaction to dogmatic religion partly in subservience to the reigning paradigm of objective scientific knowledge it has become fashionable to hold by appeal to the Kalama Sutta that the Buddhas teaching dispenses with faith and formulated doctrine and asks us to accept only what we can personally verifyThis interpretation of the sutta however forgets that the advice the Buddha gave the Kalamas was contingent upon the understanding that they were not yet prepared to place faith in him and his doctrine it also forgets that the sutta omits for that very reason all mention of right view and of the entire perspective that opens up when right view is acquiredIt offers instead the most reasonable counsel on wholesome living possible when the issue of ultimate beliefs has been put into bracketsWhat can be justly maintained is that those aspects of the Buddhas teaching that come within the purview of our ordinary experience can be personally confirmed within experience and that this confirmation provides a sound basis for placing faith in those aspects of the teaching that necessarily transcend ordinary experienceFaith in the Buddhas teaching is never regarded as an end in itself nor as a sufficient guarantee of liberation but only as the starting point for an evolving process of inner transformation that comes to fulfillment in personal insightBut in order for this insight to exercise a truly liberative function it must unfold in the context of an accurate grasp of the essential truths concerning our situation in the world and the domain where deliverance is to be soughtThese truths have been imparted to us by the Buddha out of his own profound comprehension of the human conditionTo accept them in trust after careful consideration is to set foot on a journey which transforms faith into wisdom confidence into certainty and culminates in liberation from sufferingThe

contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practiceThese works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first aroseAll human activity can be viewed as an interplay between two contrary but equally essential factors  vision and repetitive routineVision is the creative element in activity whose presence ensures that over and above the settled conditions pressing down upon us from the past we still enjoy a margin of openness to the future a freedom to discern more meaningful ends and to discover more efficient ways to achieve themRepetitive routine in contrast provides the conservative element in activityIt is the principle that accounts for the persistence of the past in the present and that enables the successful achievements of the present to be preserved intact and faithfully transmitted to the futureThough pulling in opposite directions  the one toward change the other toward stability  vision and routine intermesh in a variety of ways and every course of action can be found to participate to some extent in bothFor any particular action to be both meaningful and effective the attainment of a healthy balance between the two is necessaryWhen one factor prevails at the expense of the other the consequences are invariably undesirableIf we are bound to a repetitive cycle of work that deprives us of our freedom to inquire and understand we soon bog down crippled by the chains of routineIf we are spurred to act by elevating ideals but lack the discipline to implement them eventually we find ourselves wallowing in dreams or exhausting our energies on frivolous pursuitsIt is only when accustomed routines are infused from within by vision that they become springboards to discovery rather than deadening rutsAnd it is only when inspired vision gives birth to a course of repeatable actions that we can bring our ideals down from the ethereal sphere of imagination to the somber realm of factIt took a flash of genius for Michelangelo to behold the figure of David invisible in a shapeless block of stone but it required years of prior training and countless blows with hammer and chisel to work the miracle that would leave us a masterpiece of artThese reflections concerning the relationship between vision and routine apply with equal validity to the practice of the Buddhist pathLike all other human activities the treading of the way to the cessation of suffering requires that the intelligent grasp of new disclosures of truth be fused with the patient and stabilizing discipline of repetitionThe factor of vision enters the path under the heading of right view  as the understanding of the undistorted truths concerning our existence and as the continued penetration of those same truths through deepening contemplation and reflectionThe factor of repetition enters the path as the onerous task imposed by the practice itself the need to undertake specific modes of training and to cultivate them diligently in the prescribed sequence until they yield their fruitThe course of spiritual growth along the Buddhist path might in fact be conceived as an alternating succession of stages in which during one phase the element of vision is dominant during the next the element of routineIt is a flash of vision that opens our inner eye to the essential meaning of the Dhamma gradual training that makes our insight secure and again the urge for still more vision that propels the practice forward to its culmination in final knowledgeThough the emphasis may alternate from phase to phase ultimate success in the development of the path always hinges upon balancing vision with routine in such a way that each can make its maximal contributionHowever because our minds are keyed to fix upon the new and distinctive in our practice we are prone to place a onesided emphasis on vision at the expense of repetitive routineThus we are elated by expectations concerning the stages of the path far beyond our reach while at the same time we tend to neglect the lower stages  dull and drab but far more urgent and immediate  lying just beneath our feetTo adopt this attitude however is to forget the crucial fact that vision always operates upon a groundwork of previously established routine and must in turn give rise to new patterns of routine adequate to the attainment of its intended aimThus if we are to close the gap between ideal and actuality  between the envisaged aim of striving and the lived experience of our everyday lives  it is necessary for us to pay greater heed to the task of repetitionEvery wholesome thought every pure intention every effort to train the mind represents a potential for growth along the Noble Eightfold PathBut to be converted from a mere potential into an active power leading to the end of suffering the fleeting wholesome thoughtformations must be repeated fostered and cultivated made into enduring qualities of our beingFeeble in their individuality when their forces are consolidated by repetition they acquire a strength that is invincibleThe key to development along the Buddhist path is repetitive routine guided by inspirational visionIt is the insight into final freedom  the peace and purity of a liberated mind  that uplifts us and impels us to overcome our limitsBut it is by repetition  the methodical cultivation of wholesome practices  that we cover the distance separating us from the goal and draw ever closer to deliveranceThe Buddhist

expositions of Buddhist thought and practiceThese works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first aroseThis year has been a time for the BPS to initiate new undertakingsHaving outgrown our home of the last twenty years we recently moved into spacious new quarters equipped with the larger facilities our expanding work requiresAnother new undertaking inspired by our growth is the issuing of this newsletter to accompany each of our future mailingsThe newsletter gives expression to our wish to establish closer contact with you  our members readers and friendsIn these columns we will be providing you with information concerning our activities and publications as well as book reviews news notices and short Buddhist essaysPerhaps we can best begin this regular essay column by exploring the purpose which guides our work at the BPS todayPut quite simply that purpose is to offer to the world the teaching of the Buddha as set forth in the oldest collection of Buddhist scriptures the Pali canonHowever we do not aim merely at providing objective factual accounts of the Buddhas teachings of interest solely to Oriental scholars and their studentsOur purpose we candidly admit is advocative and prescriptive we are convinced that the Dhamma communicates a message which is still very much alive and relevant and through our publications we seek to make that message widely knownIn line with this aim it is essential for us that the Dhamma be addressed not only to its original and primary task of indicating the timeless path to deliverance but also to those vexing existential problems posed by the particular circumstances of our ageProminent among these is the widespread moral and spiritual deterioration evident in so many spheres of human lifeFor increasing numbers of people both East and West cynicism skepticism and a narrow fixation on material goals have toppled traditional views and values without offering any satisfactory alternatives to replace themThus while our sciences unlock the most obscure secrets of nature and yield its powers to our control we find ourselves beset with a sense of inner poverty destitute of those fundamental guiding principles which can give a deeper and richer meaning to our livesAt the root of our current spiritual disorder lies a distorted conception of value which locates the ultimate end of human activity in the satisfaction of personal desireTacitly accepted and adhered to without reflective awareness this thesis has become the dominant working basis for contemporary civilizationMobilizing individuals ethnic groups and nations alike it draws them into an enervating chase after the achievement of power wealth and pleasure and pits them against one another in a struggle for supremacy marked either by cool suspicion or by vehement hateGiven a creed of selffulfillment in an age of declining moral vigor it is not astonishing that in the midst of plenty we witness all around us a frantic search for instant gratification and a rising tide of destructiveness unconstrained by even the least human sympathyTo remedy this disturbing situation moralistic preaching will not suffice nor can much be expected from economic social and political reforms isolated from more fundamental changesFor at its core our crisis is a crisis of consciousnessIts real origins go deeper than our institutions deeper than our cultural norms deeper than our avowed motives and goalsIts origins lie in the hidden strata of the mind in the breeding place of those tumultuous emotional and volitional forces which the Buddha summed up in the three roots of evil  greed hatred and delusionWhat is most crucial therefore if there is to be any change in the direction of the world is a change in those who make up the world that is in ourselvesTo achieve our own genuine welfare and effectively promote the welfare of others we require the acumen to distinguish clearly what is truly in our interest and what may be immediately pleasurable but ultimately harmful and we require too the stamina to undertake the work of liberating our minds from the bonds of greed hatred and delusionAdmittedly the number of those who will see the need for inward change and make the appropriate effort will always be smallHowever the difficulty does not annul the necessityFor those of clear vision who are responsive to the call of the good there can be no choice but to take up the long hard task of selftransformationIf the work of inner cultivation is to come to full fruition it must begin with and be guided by correct understanding by that discernment of the true nature of existence which is called in the language of the Dhamma right view The unfailing pointer which the Buddha has provided for right view is the teaching of the Four Noble TruthsIt is this perspective of the Four Noble Truths with the light it sheds on the perplexing relationship between desire happiness and suffering which may be the most important contribution the Dhamma can make toward dispelling the rampant confusion of our timeIn contrast to the whole world which stands on the assumption that happiness is to be achieved through the satisfaction of desire the Buddha teaches that the entire enterprise aimed at appeasing desire is doomed to futility that the pursuit of desire leads not to happiness but to sufferingIn the teaching of the Enlightened One the way to genuine and unshakable happiness lies in the restraint and mastery of desireIt is only by training ourselves to resist the lure of pleasure and power to abandon the quest for selfaggrandizement and to relinquish our hold on our attachments that we can find for ourselves the indestructible peace of deliveranceAnd it is only thus that we can act with true compassion for the benefit of others for the good welfare and happiness

original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practiceThese works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first aroseThis story was told by the Buddha while at Jetavana Monastery about a tremendously rich royal treasurer who lived in a town called Sakkara near the city of RajagahaHe had been so tightfisted that he never gave away even the tiniest drop of oil you could pick up with a blade of grassWorse than that he wouldnt even use that minuscule amount for his own satisfactionHis vast wealth was actually of no use to him to his family or to the deserving people of the landMoggallana however led this miser and his wife to Jetavana where they served a great meal of cakes to the Buddha and five hundred bhikkhusAfter hearing words of thanks from the Buddha the royal treasurer and his wife attained streamentryThat evening the bhikkhus gathered together in the Hall of TruthHow great is the power of the Venerable Moggallana they saidIn a moment he converted the miser to charity brought him to Jetavana and made possible his attainmentHow remarkable is the elder While they were talking the Buddha entered and asked the subject of their discussionWhen they told him the Buddha replied This is not the first time bhikkhus that Moggallana has converted this miserly treasurerIn previous days too the elder taught him how deeds and their effects are linked together Then the Buddha told this story of the pastInterestingly enough however for seven generations back his ancestors had been bountiful giving freely of their bestWhen this treasurer inherited the family riches he broke that tradition and began hoarding his wealthOne day as he was returning from an audience with the king he saw a weary peasant sitting on a bench and drinking a mug of cheap liquor with great gustoThe sight made the treasurer thirsty for a drink of liquor himself but he thought If I drink others will want to drink with meThat would mean a ruinous expense The more he tried to suppress his thirst the stronger the craving grewThe effort to overcome his thirst made him as yellow as old cottonHe became thinner and thinner until the veins stood out on his emaciated frameAfter a few days still unable to forget about the liquor he went into his room and lay down hugging his bedHis wife came in rubbed his back and asked Husband what is wrongNothing he saidPerhaps the king is angry with you she suggestedNo he is notHave your children or servants done anything to annoy you she queriedNot at allWell then do you have a craving for somethingBecause of his preposterous fear that he might waste his fortune he still would not say a wordSpeak husband she pleadedTell me what you have a craving forWell he said slowly I do have a craving for one thingWhat is that my husbandI want a drink of liquor he whisperedWhy didnt you say so before she exclaimed with reliefIll brew enough liquor to serve the whole townNo he criedDont bother about other peopleLet them earn their own drinkWell then Ill make just enough for our streetHow rich you areThen just for our householdHow extravagantAll right only us and our childrenWhy fuss about themVery well let it be just enough for the two of usDo you need anyOf course notIll brew a little liquor only for youWaitIf you brew any liquor in the house many people will see youIn fact its out of the question to drink any here at all Producing one single penny he sent a slave to buy a jar of liquor from the tavernWhen the slave returned Illisa ordered him to carry the liquor out of town to a remote thicket near the riverNow leave me alone Illisa commandedAfter the slave had walked some distance away the treasurer crawled into the thicket filled his cup and began drinkingAt that moment the treasurers own father who had been reborn as Sakka king of the devas happened to be wondering whether the tradition of generosity was still kept up in his house and became aware of his sons outrageous behaviorHe realized that his son had not only broken with the customary magnanimity of his family but that he had also burned down the alms houses and beaten the poor to drive them away from his gateSakka saw that his son unwilling to share even a drop of cheap liquor with anyone else was sitting in a thicket drinking by himselfWhen he saw this Sakka cried I must make my son see that deeds always have their consequencesI will make him charitable and worthy of rebirth in the realm of the devasInstantly Sakka disguised himself as his son complete with his limp hunchback and squint and entered the city of BaranasiHe went directly to the palace gate and asked to be announced to the kingLet him approach said the kingSakka entered the kings chamber and paid his respectsWhat brings you here at this unusual hour my lord high treasurer asked the kingI have come sire because I would like to add my eighty crores of wealth to your royal treasuryNo my lord high treasurer answered the kingI have ample treasureI have no need of yoursSire if you will not take it I will give it all away to othersBy all means treasurer do as you wishSo be it sire Sakka saidThen bowing again to the king he went to the treasurers houseNone of the servants could tell that he was not their real masterHe sent for the porter and ordered If anybody resembling me should appear and claim to be master of this house that person should be severely beaten and thrown out Then he went upstairs sat down on a brocaded couch and sent for Illisas wifeWhen she arrived he smiled and said My dear let us be bountifulWhen his wife his children and all the servants heard this they thought We have never seen the treasurer in this frame of mindHe must have drunk a lot to have become so goodnatured and generousHis wife answered Be as charitable as you please my husbandSend for the town crier Sakka orderedI want him to announce to all the citizens of the city that anybody who wants gold silver diamonds pearls or other gems should come to the house of Illisa the treasurerHis wife obeyed him and a large crowd of people carrying baskets and sacks soon gatheredSakka instructed the servants to open the doors to the store rooms and announced to the people These are my gifts to youTake what you likeGood luck to youTownspeople filled their bags and carried away all the treasure they could manageOne farmer yoked two of Illisas oxen to a beautiful cart filled it with valuable things and drove out of the cityAs he rode along humming a tune in praise of the treasurer he happened to pass near the thicket where Illisa was hidingMay you live to be a hundred my good lord Illisa sang the farmerWhat you have done for me this day will enable me to live without ever toiling againWho owned these oxenYou didWho gave me this cartYou didWho gave me the wealth in the cartAgain it was youNeither my father nor my mother gave me any of thisNo it came solely from you my lordThese words chilled the treasurer to the boneWhy is this fellow mentioning my name he wondered to himselfHas the king been giving away my wealth He peeped out of the thicket and immediately recognized his own cart and oxenScrambling out of the bushes as fast as he could he grabbed the oxen by their nose rings and cried StopThese oxen belong to meThe farmer leaped from the cart and began beating the intruderYou rascal he shoutedThis is none of your businessIllisa the treasurer is giving his wealth away to all the city He knocked the treasurer down climbed back on the cart and started to drive awayShaking with anger Illisa picked himself up hurried after the cart and seized hold of the oxen againOnce more the farmer jumped down grabbed Illisa by the hair and beat him severelyThen he got back on the cart and rumbled offThoroughly sobered up by this rough handling Illisa hurried homeWhen he arrived he saw the people carrying away his treasureWhat are you doinghe shoutedHow dare you do this He seized first one man then another but every man he grabbed knocked him downBruised and bleeding he tried to go into his own house claiming that he was Illisa but the porters stopped himYou villain they criedWhere do you think you are going Following orders they beat him with bamboo staves took him by the neck and threw him down the stepsOnly the king can help me now groaned Illisa and he dragged himself to the palaceSire he criedWhy oh why have you plundered me like thisI havent plundered you my lord high treasurer said the kingYou yourself first offered me your wealthThen you yourself offered your property to the citizens of the townSire I never did such a thingYour majesty knows how careful I am about moneyYou know I would never give away so much as the tiniest drop of oilMay it please your majesty to send for the person who has squandered my richesPlease interrogate him about this matterThe king ordered his guards to bring Illisa and they returned with SakkaThe two treasurers were so exactly alike that neither the king nor anyone else in the court could tell which was the real treasurerSire pleaded IllisaI am the treasurerThis is an imposterMy dear sir replied the kingI really cant say which of you is the real IllisaIs there anybody who can distinguish for certain between the two of youYes sire answered Illisa my wife canThe king sent for Illisas wife and asked her which of the two was her husbandShe smiled at Sakka and went to stand beside himWhen Illisas children and servants were brought and asked the same question they all answered that Sakka was the real treasurerSuddenly Illisa remembered that he had a wart on the top of his head hidden under his hair known only to his barberAs a last resort he asked that his barber be calledThe barber came and was asked if he could distinguish the real Illisa from the falseOf course I can tell sire he said if I may examine their headsBy all means look at both their heads ordered the kingThe barber examined Illisas head and found the wartAs he started to examine Sakkas head the king of the devas quickly caused a wart to appear on his own head so that the barber exclaimed Your Majesty both squint both limp and both are hunchbacks tooBoth have warts in exactly the same place on their headsEven I cannot tell which is the real IllisaWhen Illisa heard this he realized that his last hope was gone and he began to quake at the loss of his beloved richesOverpowered by his emotions he collapsed senseless on the floorAt this Sakka resumed his divine form and rose into the airO king I am not Illisa he announcedI am SakkaThe kings courtiers quickly splashed water on Illisas face to revive himAs soon as he had recovered his wits the treasurer staggered to his feet and bowed before SakkaIllisa Sakka shoutedThat wealth was mine not yoursI was your fatherIn my lifetime I was bountiful towards the poor and rejoiced in doing goodBecause of my charity I was reborn in this great grandeurBut you foolish man are not walking in my footstepsYou have become a terrible miserIn order to hoard my riches you burned my alms houses to the ground and drove away the poorYou are getting no enjoyment from your wealth nor is it benefiting any other human beingYour treasury is like a pool haunted by demons from which no one may satisfy his thirstIf you rebuild my alms houses however and show charity to the poor you will gain great meritIf you do not I will take away everything you have and I will split your head with my thunderboltWhen Illisa heard this threat he shook with fear and cried out From now on I will be bountifulI swear itAccepting this promise Sakka established his son in the precepts preached the Dhamma to him and returned to the realm of the devasTrue to his word Illisa became diligent in charity and performed many good worksHe even attained rebirth in heavenYou see bhikkhus the Buddha said this is not the first time that Moggallana has converted this miserly treasurerAt that time the treasurer was Illisa Moggallana was Sakka king of the devas Ananda was the king and I myself was the barberThe Buddha told this story while at Jetavana about one of Anathapindikas friends a man named Curse The two had played together as children and had gone to the same schoolAs the years passed however the friend became extremely poor and could not make a living for himself no matter what he didIn desperation he approached Anathapindika who welcomed him kindly and employed him to look after his property and to manage all of his business for himFrom that time on it was a common thing to hear someone shouting Curse each time a member of the household spoke to himOne day some of Anathapindikas friends and acquaintances came and said Treasurer dont let this sort of thing go on in your houseIts enough to scare an ogre to hear such inauspicious speech as Come here Curse Sit down Curse or Have your dinner Curse The man is a miserable wretch dogged by misfortuneHes not your social equalWhy do you have anything to do with himNonsense replied Anathapindika firmly rejecting their adviceA name only denotes a manThe wise do not measure a man by his nameIt is useless to be superstitious about mere soundsI will never abandon the friend with whom I made mudpies as a child simply because of his nameNot long after that Anathapindika went with many of his servants to visit a village of which he was headmanHe left his old friend in chargeHearing of his departure a band of robbers decided to break into the houseThat night they armed themselves to the teeth and surrounded itCurse had suspected that burglars might try something so he stayed awakeAs soon as he knew that the robbers were outside he ran about noisily as though he were rousing the entire householdHe shouted for one person to sound the conch and for another to beat the drumSoon it seemed that the house contained a whole army of servantsWhen the robbers heard the din they said to one another The house is not as empty as we thought it would beThe master must still be at home after all They threw down their clubs and other weapons and fledIn the morning the discarded weapons were found lying scattered outside the houseWhen the townspeople realized what had happened they lauded Curse to the skiesIf such a wise man hadnt been guarding the house they said those robbers would have walked in and plundered as they pleasedAnathapindika owes this good luck to his staunch friend Curse As soon as Anathapindika returned from his trip they told him the whole storyMy friends Anathapindika answered this is the trusty guardian I was urged to get rid ofIf I had taken your advice and sent him away I would be a poorer man todayIts not the name but the heart within that makes the man In appreciation of his friends services he even raised his wagesThinking that this was a good story to tell the Buddha Anathapindika went to the Master and gave him a complete accountThis is not the first time sir the Buddha said that a man named Curse has saved his friends wealth from robbersThe same thing happened in bygone days as well Then at Anathapindikas request the Buddha told this story of the pastHis lesson ended the Buddha identified the Birth by saying At that time Ananda was Curse and I myself was the treasurer of BaranasiThe Buddha told this story at Jetavana Monastery about the Venerable AnandaOne day the wives of the King of Kosala were talking together saying It is very rare for a Buddha to appear in the world they saidIt is also rare to be born a human beingWe have been born humans during a Buddhas lifetime but we are not free to go to the monastery to pay our respects to hear his teaching and to make offerings to himWe might as well be living in a cage as in this palaceLets ask the king to allow someone to come here to teach us the DhammaWe should learn what we can be charitable and do good worksIn that way we will truly benefit from living at this happy time They went to the king and made their requestThe king listened and gave his consentThat same morning the king decided to enjoy himself in the royal gardens so he gave orders that the grounds should be preparedAs the gardener was finishing he saw the Buddha seated at the foot of a treeHe immediately went to the king and reported that everything was ready but that the Buddha was there sitting under a treeVery good said the king we will go and hear the Master Then he went to the garden by royal chariotWhen he got there he found a lay disciple Chattapani sitting at the Buddhas feet listening to his wordsWhen the king saw this lay disciple he hesitatedRealizing however that this must be a virtuous man or he would not be sitting by the Buddha for instruction the king approached bowed and seated himself on one sideOut of his profound respect for the Buddha Chattapani neither rose to honor the king nor saluted himThis made the king very angryAware of the kings displeasure the Buddha praised the merits of the layman who had in fact entered the path of nonreturningSire the Buddha said this lay disciple knows by heart the scriptures that have been handed down and he has set himself free from the bondage of passionSurely the king thought this can be no ordinary person who is being so praised by the Buddha He turned to Chattapani and said Let me know if you are in need of anythingThank you Chattapani repliedThe king listened to the Masters teachingWhen it was time he rose and left ceremoniouslyA few days later the king met Chattapani again as he was on his way to Jetavana and had him summonedI hear sir that you are a man of great learningMy wives are eager to hear the truthI would be very glad to have you teach themIt would not be proper sire for a layman to expound the truth in the kings haremThat is the prerogative of the bhikkhusThe king immediately realized that this was correct so he called his wives together and announced that he would ask the Buddha to appoint one of the elders to become their instructor in the DoctrineHe asked them which of the eighty chief disciples they would preferThe women unanimously chose Ananda the Treasurer of the DoctrineThe king went to the Buddha greeted him courteously sat down and stated his wives wish that Ananda might be their teacherThe Buddha assented and the Venerable Ananda began teaching the kings wives regularlyOne day when Ananda arrived at the palace as usual he found that the women who had always before been so attentive were all troubled and agitatedWhats wrong he askedWhy do you seem anxious todayOh venerable sir they replied the jewel from the kings turban is missingHe has called his ministers and ordered them to apprehend the thief and to find the jewel without failThey are interrogating and searching everybody even all of us womenThe entire court is in an uproar and we have no idea what might happen next to any of usThat is why we are so unhappyDont worry said Ananda cheerfully as he went to find the kingTaking the seat which the king prepared for him Ananda asked if it was true that his majesty had lost his jewelQuite true venerable sir said the kingI have had everyone in the palace searched and questioned but I can find no trace of the gemThere is a way to find it sire Ananda said without upsetting people unnecessarilyWhat way is that venerable sirBy wispgiving sireWispgiving asked the kingWhat do you meanCall everyone you suspect Ananda instructed and give him or her a wisp of strawSay to each of them Take this and put it in a certain place before daybreak tomorrow The person who took the jewel will be afraid of getting caught and will give the gem back with the strawIf it is not returned on the first day the same thing must be done for one or two more daysYou will undoubtedly get your jewel back With these words the elder departedFollowing Anandas advice the king distributed straw and designated the place where it was to be returnedEven though he did this for three days the jewel was not recoveredOn the third day the elder came again and asked whether the jewel had been returnedNo venerable sir replied the king it has notIn that case sire Ananda said have a large waterpot filled with water and placed in a secluded corner of your courtyardPut a screen around it and give orders that all who frequent the palace both men and women are to take off their outer garments and one by one to step behind the screen and wash their hands Again the king did exactly as Ananda had suggestedAnanda has seriously taken charge of the matter thought the thiefHe is not going to stop until the jewel is foundThe time has come to give it up He concealed the jewel in his underclothes went behind the screen and dropped it in the waterAfter everyone had finished the pot was emptied and the jewel was foundBecause of the Elder Ananda exclaimed the king joyfully I have gotten my jewel backBecause of the Elder Ananda exclaimed all the residents of the palace we have been saved from a lot of troubleThe story of how his wisdom had returned the jewel spread throughout the city and reached Jetavana MonasteryA few days later while the bhikkhus were talking together in the Hall of Truth one of them said The great wisdom of the Elder Ananda led to recovering the lost jewel and restoring calm to the palace While all of them were singing the praises of Ananda the Buddha entered and asked the subject of their conversationMonks he said after they had told him this is not the first time that stolen gems have been found nor is Ananda the only one who has brought about such a discoveryIn bygone days too the wise and good discovered stolen valuables and saved a lot of people from trouble Then he proceeded to tell this story of the pastAs the queen was taking off her jewels and ornaments a female monkey that was hiding in the branches of a nearby tree watched her intentlyThe monkey conceived a longing to wear the queens pearl necklace and waited for a chance to snatch itAt first the queens attendant stayed alert looking all around to protect the jewels but after a while she began to nodAs soon as the monkey saw this she jumped down as swift as the windThen just as swiftly she leaped up into the tree with the pearls around her neckFearing that other monkeys would see her treasure she hid the string of pearls in a hole in the tree and sat demurely keeping guard as though nothing had happenedBy and by the girl awoke and saw that the jewels were goneTerrified at her own negligence she shouted A man has run off with the queens pearl necklaceSentries ran up from every side and questioned herThe king ordered his guards to catch the thief and they rushed around the pleasure garden searching high and lowA poor timid peasant who happened to be nearby became frightened when he heard the uproar and started to run awayThere he goes cried the guardsThey chased the poor man caught him began beating him and asked why he stole such precious jewelsThe peasant thought If I deny the charge these brutes will beat me to deathId better say I took them He immediately confessed to the theft and was hauled off in chains to the kingDid you take those precious jewels asked the kingYes your majestyWhere are they nowYour majesty Im a poor man he explainedIve never owned anything of any value not even a bed or a chair much less a jewelIt was the treasurer who made me take that expensive necklaceI took it and gave it to himHe knows all about itThe king sent for the treasurer and asked whether the peasant had passed the necklace on to himAlso afraid to deny the charge the treasurer answered Yes sireWhere is it thenI gave it to your majestys high priestThe high priest was sent for and interrogated in the same wayHe said he had given it to the chief musician who in his turn said he had given it as a present to a courtesanThe courtesan however utterly denied having received it and the questioning continued until sunsetIts too late now said the king we will look into this tomorrow He handed the suspects over to his officers and went back into the cityThe Bodhisatta began thinking These jewels were lost inside the grounds but the peasant was outsideThere was a strong guard at the gateIt would have been impossible for anyone inside to have gotten away with the necklaceI dont see how a person inside or out could have stolen itI dont believe that any of these five had anything to do with it but I understand why they falsely confessed and implicated the othersAs for the necklace these grounds are swarming with monkeysIt must have been one of the female monkeys that took itHaving arrived at this conclusion the minister went to the king and requested that the suspects be handed over to him so that he could look into the matter personallyBy all means my wise friend said the king go aheadThe minister ordered his servants to take charge of the five prisonersKeep strict watch over them he saidI want you to listen to everything they say and report it all to meAs the prisoners sat together the treasurer said to the peasant Tell me you wretch where you and I have ever met before todayHow could you have given me that necklaceHonorable sir said the peasant I have never owned anything valuableEven the stool and the cot I have are ricketyI said what I did because I thought that with your help I would get out of this troublePlease dont be angry with me sirWell then the high priest indignantly asked the treasurer how did you pass on to me what this fellow never gave to youI said that explained the treasurer because I thought that you and I both being high ranking officials would be able to get out of trouble togetherBrahman the chief musician asked the high priest when do you think you gave the jewel to meI only said I did answered the chaplain because I thought you would help to make the time in prison pass more agreeablyFinally the courtesan complained You wretch of a musician you have never visited me and I have never visited youWhen could you have given me the necklaceDont be angry my dear said the musicianI just wanted you to be here to keep us companyCheer upLets all be lighthearted together for a whileAs soon as his servants had reported this conversation to the Bodhisatta he saw that all his suspicions were correctHe was convinced that a female monkey had taken the necklaceNow I must find a way to make her drop it he said to himselfHe ordered his servants to catch some monkeys to deck them out with strings of beads and then to release them again in the pleasure gardenThe men were to carefully watch every monkey in the groundsAs soon as they saw one wearing the missing pearl necklace they were to frighten her into dropping itThe monkeys strutted about with their beads strung around their necks their wrists and their anklesThey flaunted their splendor in front of the guilty monkey who sat quietly guarding her treasureAt last jealousy overcame her prudenceThose are only beads she screeched and foolishly put on her own necklace of real pearlsAs soon as the servants saw this they began making loud noises and throwing things at herThe monkey became so frightened that she dropped the necklace and scampered awayThe men took it to their masterThe minister immediately took it to the kingHere sire he said is the queens necklaceThe five prisoners are innocentIt was a female monkey in the pleasure garden that took itWonderful exclaimed the kingBut tell me how did you find that outAnd how did you manage to get it backWhen he had heard the whole story the king praised his ministerYou certainly are the right man in the right place he proclaimedIn appreciation the king showered the minister with immeasurable treasureThe king continued to follow the Bodhisattas advice and counselAfter a long life of generosity and meritorious acts he passed away to fare according to his desertsHis lesson ended the Buddha again praised Venerable Anandas merits and identified the birthAnanda was the king of those days he said and I was his wise counselorThe Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creedsFounded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topicsIts publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddhas discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practiceThese works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first aroseAt our meditation retreats yogis practice mindfulness in four different posturesThey practice mindfulness when walking when standing when sitting and when lying downThey must sustain mindfulness at all times in whatever position they are inThe primary posture for mindfulness meditation is sitting with legs crossed but because the human body cannot tolerate this position for many hours without changing we alternate periods of sitting meditation with periods of walking meditationSince walking meditation is very important I would like to discuss its nature its significance and the benefits derived from its practiceThe practice of mindfulness meditation can be compared to boiling waterIf one wants to boil water one puts the water in a kettle puts the kettle on a stove and then turns the heat onBut if the heat is turned off even for an instant the water will not boil even though the heat is turned on again laterIf one continues to turn the heat on and off again the water will never boilIn the same way if there are gaps between the moments of mindfulness one cannot gain momentum and so one cannot attain concentrationThat is why yogis at our retreats are instructed to practice mindfulness all the time that they are awake from the moment they wake up in the morning until they fall asleep at nightConsequently walking meditation is integral to the continuous development of mindfulnessUnfortunately I have heard people criticize walking meditation claiming that they cannot derive any benefits or good results from itBut it was the Buddha himself who first taught walking meditationIn the Great Discourse on the Foundations of Mindfulness the Buddha taught walking meditation two timesIn the section called Postures he said that a monk knows I am walking when he is walking knows I am standing when he is standing knows I am sitting when he is sitting and knows I am lying down when he is lying downIn another section called Clear Comprehension the Buddha said A monk applies clear comprehension in going forward and in going back Clear comprehension means the correct understanding of what one observesTo correctly understand what is observed a yogi must gain concentration and in order to gain concentration he must apply mindfulnessTherefore when the Buddha said Monks apply clear comprehension we must understood that not only clear comprehension must be applied but also mindfulness and concentrationThus the Buddha was instructing meditators to apply mindfulness concentration and clear comprehension while walking while going forward and back Walking meditation is thus an important part of this processAlthough it is not recorded in this sutta that the Buddha gave detailed and specific instructions for walking meditation we believe that he must have given such instructions at some timeThose instructions must have been learned by the Buddhas disciples and passed on through successive generationsIn addition teachers of ancient times must have formulated instructions based on their own practiceAt the present time we have a very detailed set of instructions on how to practice walking meditationLet us now talk specifically about the practice of walking meditationIf you are a complete beginner the teacher may instruct you to be mindful of only one thing during walking meditation to be mindful of the act of stepping while you make a note silently in the mind stepping stepping stepping or left right left right You may walk at a slower speed than normal during this practiceAfter a few hours or after a day or two of meditation you may be instructed to be mindful of two occurrences stepping and putting down the foot while making the mental note stepping putting down You will try to be mindful of two stages in the step stepping putting down stepping putting down Later you may be instructed to be mindful of three stages lifting the foot moving or pushing the foot forward and putting the foot downStill later you would be instructed to be mindful of four stages in each step lifting the foot moving it forward putting it down and touching or pressing the foot on the groundYou would be instructed to be completely mindful and to make a mental note of these four stages of the foots movement lifting moving forward putting down pressing the groundAt first yogis may find it difficult to slow down but as they are instructed to pay close attention to all of the movements involved and as they actually pay closer and closer attention they will automatically slow downThey do not have to slow down deliberately but as they pay closer attention slowing down comes to them automaticallyWhen driving on the freeway one may be driving at sixty or seventy or even eighty miles per hourDriving at that speed one will not be able to read some of the signs on the roadIf one wants to read those signs it is necessary to slow downNobody has to say Slow down but the driver will automatically slow down in order to see the signsIn the same way if yogis want to pay closer attention to the movements of lifting moving forward putting down and pressing the ground they will automatically slow downOnly when they slow down can they be truly mindful and fully aware of these movementsAlthough yogis pay close attention and slow down they may not see all of the movements and stages clearlyThe stages may not yet be welldefined in the mind and they may seem to constitute only one continuous movementAs concentration grows stronger yogis will observe more and more clearly these different stages in one step the four stages at least will be easier to distinguishYogis will know distinctly that the lifting movement is not mixed with the moving forward movement and they will know that the moving forward movement is not mixed with either the lifting movement or the putting down movementThey will understand all movements clearly and distinctlyWhatever they are mindful and aware of will be very clear in their mindsAs yogis carry on the practice they will observe much moreWhen they lift their foot they will experience the lightness of the footWhen they push the foot forward they will notice the movement from one place to anotherWhen they put the foot down they will feel the heaviness of the foot because the foot becomes heavier and heavier as it descendsWhen they put the foot on the ground they will feel the touch of the heel of the foot on the groundTherefore along with observing lifting moving forward putting down and pressing the ground yogis will also perceive the lightness of the rising foot the motion of the foot the heaviness of the descending foot and then the touching of the foot which is the hardness or softness of the foot on the groundWhen yogis perceive these processes they are perceiving the four essential elementsThe four essential elements are the element of earth the element of water the element of fire and the element of airBy paying close attention to these four stages of walking meditation the four elements in their true essence are perceived not merely as concepts but as actual processes as ultimate realitiesLet us go into a little more detail about the characteristics of the elements in walking meditationIn the first movement that is the lifting of the foot yogis perceive lightness and when they perceive lightness they virtually perceive the fire elementOne aspect of the fire element is that of making things lighter and as things become lighter they riseIn the perception of the lightness in the upward movement of the foot yogis perceive the essence of the fire elementBut in the lifting of the foot there is also besides lightness movementMovement is one aspect of the air elementBut lightness the fire element is dominant so we can say that in the stage of lifting the fire element is primary and the air element is secondaryThese two elements are perceived by yogis when they pay close attention to the lifting of the footThe next stage is moving the foot forwardIn moving the foot forward the dominant element is the air element because motion is one of the primary characteristics of the air elementSo when they pay close attention to the moving forward of the foot in walking meditation yogis are virtually perceiving the essence of the air elementThe next stage is the movement of putting the foot downWhen yogis put their foot down there is a kind of heaviness in the footHeaviness is a characteristic of the water element as is trickling and oozingWhen liquid is heavy it oozesSo when yogis perceive the heaviness of the foot they virtually perceive the water elementIn pressing the foot on the ground yogis will perceive the hardness or softness of the foot on the groundThis pertains to the nature of the earth elementBy paying close attention to the pressing of the foot against the ground yogis virtually perceive the nature of the earth elementThus we see that in just one step yogis can perceive many processesThey can perceive the four elements and the nature of the four elementsOnly those who practice can ever hope to see these thingsAs yogis continue to practice walking meditation they will come to realize that with every movement there is also the noting mind the awareness of the movementThere is the lifting movement and also the mind that is aware of that liftingIn the next moment there is the moving forward movement and also the mind that is aware of the movementMoreover yogis will realize that both the movement and the awareness arise and disappear in that momentIn the next moment there is the putting down movement and so also the awareness of the movement and both arise and disappear in that moment of putting the foot down on the groundThe same process occurs with the pressing of the foot there is the pressing and the awareness of pressingIn this way yogis understand that along with the movement of the foot there are also the moments of awarenessThe moments of awareness are called in Pali nama mind and the movement of the foot is called rupa matterSo yogis will perceive mind and matter rising and disappearing at every momentAt one moment there is the lifting of the foot and the awareness of the lifting and at the next moment there is the movement forward and the awareness of that movement and so onThese can be understood as a pair mind and matter which arise and disappear at every momentThus yogis advance to the perception of the pairwise occurrence of mind and matter at every moment of observation that is if they pay close attentionAnother thing that yogis will discover is the role of intention in effecting each movementThey will realize that they lift their foot because they want to move the foot forward because they want to put it down because they want to press the foot against the ground because they want toThat is they realize that an intention precedes every movementAfter the intention to lift lifting occursThey come to understand the conditionality of all of these occurrences  these movements never occur by themselves without conditionsThese movements are not created by any deity or any authority and these movements never happen without a causeThere is a cause or condition for every movement and that condition is the intention preceding each movementThis is another discovery yogis make when they pay close attentionWhen yogis understand the conditionality of all movements and that these movements are not created by any authority or any god then they will understand that they are created by intentionThey will understand that intention is the condition for the movement to occurThus the relationship of conditioning and conditioned of cause and effect is understoodOn the basis of this understanding yogis can remove doubt about nama and rupa by understanding that nama and rupa do not arise without conditionsWith the clear understanding of the conditionality of things and with the transcendence of doubt about nama and rupa a yogi is said to reach the stage of a lesser sotapannaA sotapanna is a streamenterer a person who has reached the first stage of enlightenmentA lesser sotapanna is not a true streamenterer but is said to be assured of rebirth in a happy realm of existence such as in the realms of human beings and devasThat is a lesser sotapanna cannot be reborn in one of the four woeful states in one of the hells or animal realmsThis state of lesser sotapanna can be reached just by practicing walking meditation just by paying close attention to the movements involved in a stepThis is the great benefit of practicing walking meditationThis stage is not easy to reach but once yogis reach it they can be assured that they will be reborn in a happy state unless of course they fall from that stageWhen yogis comprehend mind and matter arising and disappearing at every moment then they will come to comprehend the impermanence of the processes of lifting the foot and they will also comprehend the impermanence of the awareness of that liftingThe occurrence of disappearing after arising is a mark or characteristic by which we understand that something is impermanentIf we want to determine whether something is impermanent or permanent we must try to see through the power of meditation whether or not that thing is subject to the process of coming into being and then disappearingIf our meditation is powerful enough to enable us to see the arising and disappearing of phenomena then we can decide that the phenomena observed are impermanentIn this way yogis observe that there is the lifting movement and awareness of that movement and then that sequence disappears giving way to the pushing forward movement and the awareness of pushing forwardThese movements simply arise and disappear arise and disappear and this process yogis can comprehend by themselves  they do not have to accept this on trust from any external authority nor do they have to believe in the report of another personWhen yogis comprehend that mind and matter arise and disappear they understand that mind and matter are impermanentWhen they see that they are impermanent they next understand that they are unsatisfactory because they are always oppressed by constant arising and disappearingAfter comprehending impermanence and the unsatisfactory nature of things they observe that there can be no mastery over these things that is yogis realize that there is no self or soul within that can order them to be permanentThings just arise and disappear according to natural lawBy comprehending this yogis comprehend the third characteristic of conditioned phenomena the characteristic of anatta the characteristic that things have no selfOne of the meanings of anatta is no mastery  meaning that nothing no entity no soul no power has mastery over the nature of thingsThus by this time yogis have comprehended the three characteristics of all conditioned phenomena impermanence suffering and the nonself nature of things  in Pali anicca dukkha and anattaYogis can comprehend these three characteristics by observing closely the mere lifting of the foot and the awareness of the lifting of the footBy paying close attention to the movements they see things arising and disappearing and consequently they see for themselves the impermanent unsatisfactory and nonself nature of all conditioned phenomenaNow let us examine in more detail the movements of walking meditationSuppose one were to take a moving picture of the lifting of the footSuppose further that the lifting of the foot takes one second and let us say that the camera can take thirtysix frames per secondAfter taking the picture if we were to look at the separate frames we would realize that within what we thought was one lifting movement there are actually thirtysix movementsThe image in each frame is slightly different from the images in the other frames though the difference will usually be so slight that we can barely notice itBut what if the camera could take one thousand frames per secondThen there would be one thousand movements in just one lifting movement although the movements would be almost impossible to differentiateIf the camera could take one million frames per second  which may be impossible now but someday may happen  then there would be one million movements in what we thought to be only one movementOur effort in walking meditation is to see our movements as closely as the camera sees them frame by frameWe also want to observe the awareness and intention preceding each movementWe can also appreciate the power of the Buddhas wisdom and insight by which he actually saw all of the movementsWhen we use the word see or observe to refer to our own situation we mean that we see directly and also by inference we may not be able to see directly all of the millions of movements as did the BuddhaBefore yogis begin practicing walking meditation they may have thought that a step is just one movementAfter meditation on that movement they observe that there are at least four movements and if they go deeper they will understand that even one of these four movements consists of millions of tiny movementsThey see nama and rupa mind and matter arising and disappearing as impermanentBy our ordinary perception we are not able to see the impermanence of things because impermanence is hidden by the illusion of continuityWe think that we see only one continuous movement but if we look closely we will see that the illusion of continuity can be brokenIt can be broken by the direct observation of physical phenomena bit by bit segment by segment as they originate and disintegrateThe value of meditation lies in our ability to remove the cloak of continuity in order to discover the real nature of impermanenceYogis can discover the nature of impermanence directly through their own effortAfter realizing that things are composed of segments that they occur in bits and after observing these segments one by one yogis will realize that there is really nothing in this world to be attached to nothing to crave forIf we see that something which we once thought beautiful has holes that it is decaying and disintegrating we will lose interest in itFor example we may see a beautiful painting on a canvasWe think of the paint and canvas conceptually as a whole solid thingBut if we were to put the painting under a powerful microscope we would see that the picture is not solid  it has many holes and spacesAfter seeing the picture as composed largely of spaces we would lose interest in it and we would cease being attached to itModern physicists know this idea wellThey have observed with powerful instruments that matter is just a vibration of particles and energy constantly changing  there is nothing substantial to it at allBy the realization of this endless impermanence yogis understand that there is really nothing to crave for nothing to hold on to in the entire world of phenomenaNow we can understand the reasons for practicing meditationWe practice meditation because we want to remove attachment and craving for objectsIt is by comprehending the three characteristics of existence  impermanence suffering and the nonself nature of things  that we remove cravingWe want to remove craving because we do not want to sufferAs long as there is craving and attachment there will always be sufferingIf we do not want to suffer we must remove craving and attachmentWe must comprehend that all things are just mind and matter arising and disappearing that things are insubstantialOnce we realize this we will be able to remove attachment to thingsAs long as we do not realize this however much we read books or attend talks or talk about removing attachment we will not be able to get rid of attachmentIt is necessary to have the direct experience that all conditioned things are marked by the three characteristicsHence we must pay close attention when we are walking just as we do when we are sitting or lying downI am not trying to say that walking meditation alone can give us ultimate realization and the ability to remove attachment entirely but it is nevertheless as valid a practice as sitting meditation or any other kind of vipassana meditationWalking meditation is conducive to spiritual developmentIt is as powerful as mindfulness of breathing or mindfulness of the rising and falling of the abdomenIt is an efficient tool to help us remove mental defilementsWalking meditation can help us gain insight into the nature of things and we should practice it as diligently as we practice sitting meditation or any other kind of meditationBy the practice of vipassana meditation in all postures including the walking posture may you and all yogis be able to attain total purification in this very lifeThe

variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topicsIts publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddhas discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practiceThese works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first aroseFor over twentyfive centuries Buddhist ideas and ideals have guided and influenced the lives and thoughts of countless human beings in many parts of the worldAs lay Buddhists our own experiences and discoveries in life are not enough to give a true perspective on lifeTo bring ourselves closer to the ideal of a wellbalanced man or woman we need to acquire at least in outline what is called a cultural grounding in the BuddhaDhammaCulture reveals to ourselves and others what we areIt gives expression to our nature in our manner of living and of thinking in art religion ethical aspirations and knowledgeBroadly speaking it represents our ends in contrast to meansA cultured man has grown for culture comes from a word meaning to grow In Buddhism the arahant is the perfect embodiment of cultureHe has grown to the apex to the highest possible limit of human evolutionHe has emptied himself of all selfishness  all greed hatred and delusion  and embodies flawless purity and selfless compassionate serviceThings of the world do not tempt him for he is free from the bondage of selfishness and passionsHe makes no compromises for the sake of power individual or collectiveIn this world some are born great while others have greatness thrust on themBut in the BuddhaDhamma one becomes great only to the extent that one has progressed in ethical discipline and mental culture and thereby freed the mind of self and all that it impliesTrue greatness then is proportional to ones success in unfolding the perfection dormant in human natureWe should therefore think of culture in this way Beginning with the regular observance of the Five Precepts positively and negatively we gradually reduce our greed and hatredSimultaneously we develop good habits of kindness and compassion honesty and truthfulness chastity and heedfulnessSteady wholesome habits are the basis of good character without which no culture is possibleThen little by little we become great and cultured BuddhistsSuch a person is rightly trained in body speech and mind  a disciplined wellbred refined humane human being able to live in peace and harmony with himself and othersAnd this indeed is DhammaIn order to grow we also have to be active and energetic diligent in wholesome conductThere is no place for laziness and lethargy in BuddhismWe must be diligent in cultivating all aspects of the Dhamma in ourselves at all timesIf we develop as good individuals we automatically become cultured members of our society mindful both of rights and dutiesBuddhism addresses itself only to the individual thinking personIt has nothing to do with mass movements for masses are just collections of individual men and womenAny true social development must therefore begin with the transformation of each individual personIn this way the ethical dilemmas of an economically developing country like Sri Lanka with a background of Buddhist culture are resolved for a true lay Buddhist will aim at personal progress in worldly matters only on the foundation of the Noble Eightfold PathProgress by way of adhamma  unrighteousness  well inevitably bring in its trail disaster pain and suffering to individual community and nationSuch a misguided policy implies disbelief in kamma and its effectsReject kamma and one is rootlessRejection is the result of blinding greed for quick material gain and sensual pleasures conjoined with delusion about the true nature and destiny of man and lifeIt also signifies acceptance of the philosophy of expediency  that one should get the most that one can out of this single fleeting life on earth guided largely by ones instincts subject to the laws of society which the affluent and powerful often circumvent with impunitySuch a shortsighted and mistaken view ultimately leads to individual and social tensions to restlessness and conflict and to the spread of indiscipline lawlessness and crimeBuddhism distinguishes between emotions that are constructive such as metta and karuna and those that are destructive anger and jealousy for instanceIt encourages the cultivation of the former to eliminate the latterHuman beings can both think and feelWhen the Buddha taught the Dhamma sometimes he appealed to reason sometimes to the emotions and sometimes to the imagination using such means of instruction as fables stories and poetryBuddhist culture too manifests in other forms than that of a fine character such as in the field of literature  the Jatakas the Theragatha and Therigatha for examples  philosophy art architecture and sculptureArt is basically a medium of human communicationIt can help in the education of the emotions and is one of the civilizing agencies of humankindThe work of the artist whether painter dramatist sculptor or writer is worthy of study because it has a certain expressiveness that both reveals and stimulates fresh insightsThe artist sees new meanings in objects and experience that ordinarily escape the rest of us and thus he creates new values and insights in lifeRightly viewed as the expression of the good life and as an aid to living it  and not for mere enjoyment and appreciation  art can therefore ennoble usFor example the tranquillity and peace that one sees in the Samadhi statue of the Buddha elevates the mind stimulates confidence and induces reverence for the DhammaIn all Buddhist lands the images of the Buddha and the Bodhisatta have become the typical form of artistic expressionBuddhist culture is perennial and so is as fresh today as it was in the Buddhas time years agoIt is also selfsufficient selfconsistent and selfsustainingBased as it is on eternal verities verifiable by individual experience it is never obsolete and animates the progress that seems to kill itNor does its content change with contextThe impact of Buddhism on world culture was truly significantIn it there is no intellectual error based as it is on reason and on the bedrock of personal experienceIt is free from moral blindness for its ethics is truly lofty guided by a rational basis for such an ethic namely personal evolution in terms of ones own kammaIt engendered no social perversity  hate and intolerance were for none limitless lovingkindness and compassion were for allThe doors to deliverance were open to anyone who wished to enter themIts thrilling message of reason universal benevolence flaming righteousness social justice hope and deliverance in this very existence by ones own exertion  all had a fertilizing and liberating influence on thought and action wherever Buddhism spreadTo the thinking person Buddhism offered a rational practical and balanced way of deliverance from all lifes sorrows and the certainty of the perfectibility of man here and now solely by ones own effortTo the humanist it gave an allembracing compassionate vision inspiring ameliorative action as a precondition for the realization of the highest spiritual attainmentsEven to have a general idea of its achievements in the manifold ways it has expressed itself in society is an education in the art of livingBuddhism gives perspective to the whole of lifeNothing in life is seen as more important than it really isA cultured Buddhist can tell the good from the bad the right from the wrong the true from the falseHe can weigh the evidence skillfully and his Buddhist cultural background makes his judgment a wise oneThe BuddhaDhamma is not a fiction to be read and forgottenIt deals with life  with real life the life that you and I lead every day the value and worth of which is greatly enhanced when the Dhamma is translated into action and built into our character by constant effort and practiceThe ultimate aim of the BuddhaDhamma is Nibbana  emancipation from sufferingThe immediate objective is to help us to understand and solve the problems that confront us in our daily life to make us wellrounded happy and balanced men and women able to live in harmony with our environment and our fellow beingsBalance however though it is an aim worth striving for is not easily struck in the contemporary world with its false ideologies and illusory valuesIn contrast to the relative often false values of our age the Buddhas teaching is a revelation of true and absolute valuesIts truth can be tested and tried in ones own experienceBuddhism teaches clear thinking selfcontrol and mental culture as means to these endsOne who builds his daily life upon this firm foundation of appropriate knowledge and clearsighted ideals is assured of progress and success even as a laymanThe BuddhaDhamma is then a guide to daily life and its basic principles are of great practical value in the art of livingThe householder while involved in his responsibilities and commitments will not lose sight of the ultimate goal NibbanaRather he should consider lay life as a preparation and training ground for its realizationThe Discourse on Blessings states that one of lifes true blessings is to have a mind properly directedThis means that one must discover ones proper place in the world decide on a proper aim and find the proper way to achieve itA happy and balanced person is one who has a worthy aim in life a clear course of action to follow and a simple but sound philosophy of life as a guidePhilosophy here is a keen desire to understand the nature and destiny of man in the universeWithout a philosophy life is stale flat unprofitable and meaninglessA philosophy enables one to live harmoniously with the world and ones fellow beings by a process of adjustment based on true knowledgeIn Buddhism mind predominates over matterA characteristic feature of mind is purposeTo make the best use of our life and our kammic inheritance we must choose a practical aim in life and devise a plan to achieve this aimThen we will become what we want to beThe more we find out about ourselves by means of selfobservation and selfanalysis the better will be our chances of selfimprovementIn addition we should ask ourselves how far and to what degree we are generous eventempered natural kind considerate honest sober truthful heedful and observant industrious energetic cautious patient tolerant and tactfulThese are some of the qualities of a welladjusted BuddhistWe should try to improve ourselves where necessary  a little practice every day is all that is neededWe should be aware that the more often we perform a right action the more easily will it become a habitBy force of habit it ultimately becomes part of our characterSati or bare attention is an important aspect of mindfulnessSati is the objective seeing of things stripped bare of likes and dislikes bias and prejudiceIt is viewing things and events as they really are  the naked factsThe ability to do this is a sign of true Buddhist maturityThe principle of bare attention should be applied vigorously to everyday thinkingThe results will be clearer thinking and saner living a marked reduction in the pernicious influence of mass media propaganda and advertisements and an improvement in our interpersonal relationshipsA wellbalanced Buddhist therefore must make up his own mind form his own opinions and arrive at his own conclusions in facing lifes difficulties according to Buddhist principlesHe must not be a moral and intellectual cowardHe must be prepared to stand alone to go his own way irrespective of what others think or sayOf course he will take advice  it is no interference with ones freedom to seek advice from a more experienced and knowledgeable person  but the decision should be his ownSeeing the relationship between craving and suffering we must maintain a certain degree of detachment from worldly things and in addition regulate our lives by strictly observing the Five PreceptsThereby we preserve the wellbeing of our whole personality both here and in the hereafter by living in harmony with the universal laws governing our mental and moral lifeThe development of moral and ethical character is a prerequisite for mindcontrol and for obtaining the wisdom needed to attain NibbanaChange being inherent in life disappointments and disasters are likely to happen and when they do come we should meet them with equanimity and a balanced responseThis is evidence of right understanding of seeing clearly that everything happens because of causes that effects correspond to their causes and that we ourselves are responsible for generating the causes  if not in the present life then in some past lifeLikewise we should be able to overcome unfounded irrational and exaggerated fears and worries as we obtain some degree of emotional controlThus the apparent injustices of life grievances both personal and social emotional maladjustments and so on are all explained fully and rationally by the twin principles of kamma and rebirthThere is another reason the Buddhist preserves his philosophical demeanourHe has strength derived from other unseen resources  his store of wholesome actions the qualities of his character the happiness derived from meditative practices all of which are independent of material thingsThus he is the owner of an increasingly selfreliant and selfsufficient mindHe has learned simplicity of life and wants material things have now become his servants and not his masterHe is free from the tyranny of external thingsHe has realized that while seen things are temporary and passing the unseen is realIn sum he now possesses a calm controlled and contented mindAnd contentment says the Buddha is the greatest wealth one of the four sources of happiness Dhammapada vBy understanding he thus learns to adjust himself to new circumstances without rancor or bitternessIf we have saddha confidence in the BuddhaDhamma based on knowledge we must act on itEvery true Buddhist should constantly practice the four great efforts namely to overcome and avoid unhealthy states of mind and to stimulate and maintain healthy states of mind such as thoughts of metta and karunaThese states not only protect the practitioner but help others as wellWe must acquire the habit of questioning whether a thought or action done is honest or not for honesty with ourselves is the one sure way to mental healthIn addition we should set apart a few minutes every day for the purpose of quiet reflection or meditation for reviewing the days happenings and to see how far we may have deviated from the essential principles of the Masters Teachings in order to avoid future lapsesWe might also read a passage of the Buddhas discourses dailyThis useful habit would enable us to forget our little worries and troubles develop our minds and put our whole life into perspectiveIn these ways as lay disciples of the Buddha we grow in all aspects of Dhamma molding our whole personality instructing the intellect training the emotions and disciplining the will in the interests both of ourselves and of othersIn the ultimate sense to know oneself is to understand ones changing personality truly and fully so that one distinguishes clearly the real from the unrealThen one lives every moment of ones life keenly aware of each thought word and deedSome selfknowledge however is necessary even for a Buddhist layman with a more limited objective in life personal progress in worldly matters based on the foundation of the Noble Eightfold PathThe human being in the Buddhist sense is a flux of mind and matter of five component groups each of which is impermanent and changingNothing whatever of a lasting nature can be found within them or behind themEach conflux is energized by craving and is capable of doing both good and evilViewed in another way a human being is the sum total of his or her thoughts and actions in this and in previous livesAt birth we bring with us an inheritance of instincts as well as other qualities such as intelligence temperament an embryonic character and a bodyLater on many factors combine to shape our present characterMore important than upbringing and education at home and school and the qualities of our kammic inheritance is what we do with these factorsCharacter decides thisCharacter is not staticIt changes from day to dayEvery willed action affects it for good or bad mind is responsible for actionsCharacter uses the intelligence temperament and instincts with which we are bornThe strongest force which molds a persons character is his ideal which in the case of a Buddhist is the arahant idealSuch an ideal coordinates our warring impulses unifies our personality and eliminates wastage and conflictAny activity that brings us nearer to this ideal is skillful while anything that takes us away from it is unskillfulA worthy aim should be achieved by worthy meansThe wisest course to adopt is to develop further the good points in ones kammic inheritance and to deal with any weaknessesApart from this if we are to be happy secure and successful in life we must rely on ourselves and hold ourselves responsible for our actions  or inactionThe Buddhist law of kamma teaches us not only selfresponsibility for our deeds but also that the results of past deeds can be nullified partly or wholly by present skillful energetic actionWe must forget the past assume responsibility for present action and determine to shape our life in the way we want according to the principles of the BuddhaDhammaIn this way we can face the future with confidenceTo do this realistically we have to accept the fact that there are some unalterable things in lifeThus the three basic marks of conditioned existence  impermanence suffering and nonself  cannot be changedIllness and decay are unavoidable and death is our final destinyThe only remedy is to accept these facts and learn to live with them without grumbling and worrying and devote our limited time and energy to things we can change and improveThere are for instance character traits and instinctive impulses  tendencies to acquisition aggression selfassertion sex and fear  that can be controlled and even uprooted by a process of understanding adjustment and sublimationThe key elements in this process are observance of the Five Precepts and the systematic practice of mindfulnessTo use mindfulness as a key to selfimprovement one must see oneself as an impartial observer would and mentally note This character trait is present in meIt is part of me but it can be changedWhat must I do to remedy it now The sensible attitude is to recognize what can be altered and to remedy unwholesome traits and habits by discipline and trainingIn both accepting and adjusting one may have to abandon previous ideas habits and ways of living but the sooner this is done the more effectively it will lead to our welfare and happinessFurther to make the best use of our powers and potentialities we should draw up an objective evaluation of all our qualities and capacities by patient selfanalysis and selfobservationSpecial attention should be given to the emotional qualities for the emotions are generally a stronger force than the intellectMan is far from being the rational creature he is supposed to beHe often acts quite contrary to his own true interestsHis rational decisions are often subverted by gusts of passion and emotion passing whims and fancies apathy and lazinessTo know oneself then is to understand that there is room for changeWe can change for the good by deliberate action using the raw material of our kammic endowment based on an idealThis means that one should develop a philosophy of life and such a philosophy presupposes a purpose which for a Buddhist is growth in the DhammaThe BuddhaDhamma or Buddhism can be related to other religions in many waysHere only a few main points of comparison will be sketchedBuddhism is a graduated system of moral and mental training with Nibbana the highest happiness as its goalIt is founded upon the principle of causality the law of cause and effect in the moral domain that is in the field of human behaviorAbove all it is a path to liberation from suffering a goal to be won by cultivating the Noble Eightfold Path in its three stages of morality concentration and wisdomReligion lays down the general lines of conduct by which a person will live his daily life it lays down rules in such matters as respect for the lives of others intoxicating liquors marriage divorce and means of livelihoodFor the believer it thus colors his or her whole attitude towards matters like birth sex family limitation death and the afterlifeTransgression of the religious code entails feelings of guilt so the religion that one follows has a profound influence shaping ones entire outlook on life as well as ones attitudes whether in wholesome ways or in unwholesome waysAgainst this background we can now see how the BuddhaDhamma is related to other religionsAs stated earlier the Buddhist way to Nibbana is the Noble Eightfold PathThe question then arises as to whether arahantship  perfect holiness  or Nibbana is possible outside this pathThe Buddhas answer to Subhaddas question just before he passed away clarifies our problem In whatever teaching O Subhadda there exists the Noble Eightfold Path there is the first saint there is the second saint there is the third saint there is the fourth saintAn arahant is a perfect saintElsewhere there are mere semblances of saints As the Noble Eightfold Path is found only in Buddhism in the Buddhas own words the other teachings are empty of true saintsThey therefore err who say that all spiritual paths lead to the same summit and that the view from the top is identical for allThe reason is simple the Buddha saw the true nature of things clearly and completely with his own independent supramundane insight  his perfect enlightenment  and so his teaching is an exact reflection of reality while other religious teachers had only an imperfect view of reality with eyes dimmed by various forms and degrees of ignoranceThis however does not imply that Buddhism is intolerant of other religionsNeither the Buddha nor his followers ever imposed his system of thought or his way of life on anyone who would not accept it of his or her own volitionAcceptance was a purely voluntary matterEven if accepted how much of it one should practice is ones own responsibilityBut regardless of ones personal inclinations the universal moral laws operate objectively  action being followed by due reaction deeds by their fruitsThe Buddha merely reveals the laws of life and the more faithfully we follow them the better it is for us for then we act according to the DhammaThis peaceful policy of noncompulsion and tolerance characteristic of the Masters teaching is born partly of compassion and partly of understanding human nature and the nature of truthIf the vision of some is dimmed as to the merits of the teaching it is ones duty to help them to seeBut one must stop there one should not coerce others or persecute those who refuse to accept ones own beliefsWisdom the ability to see things as they truly are cannot be imposed on others from the outsideIt must grow from within the individual out of the developing sensitivity and refinement of human natureThis takes timeAt any given period only few will be capable of genuinely appreciating understanding and realizing the Buddhas teaching as human beings vary widely in their intellectual moral and spiritual capabilitiesUnethical conversions are therefore unheard of in BuddhismBuddhist tolerance however should not mean apathy and indifferenceThat would be a misinterpretation of the termWhen erroneous statements about Buddhism were made by people in the Buddhas time the Master kindly corrected themHe even expelled his cousin Devadatta from the Sangha when occasion demanded it to preserve the purity of the Doctrine and the unity of the SanghaYet the Buddha was the perfect example of tolerance and compassionLikewise monk and laity should be always watchful and should emulate the BuddhaOtherwise their case would go by default for which they alone are to be blamedToday various proposals are being made to create an allembracing system of religion the idea being simply to absorb all other religions into ones ownHowever a universal religious consciousness can never be created because the various religions have fundamentally different conceptions of reality the concept and content of the good life vary between different religions  the good means one thing to a Buddhist and another to a Christian and yet another to a Muslim and no adherent of a religion wants his religion to be absorbed by another bodyIs it not deeply rooted in human nature to believe that no other religion in the world compares with ones ownTaking Buddhism specifically  and in detail  it is unique a thing apart from all other religions in the worldIt teaches the formula of conditioned arising and its reversal by human effort craving as the creator of life instead of a creator God a becoming without a self personal evolution according to the quality of ones own deeds an impersonal moral order with moral values and moral responsibility free will within limits and therewith the possibility of a good life survival after death by the continuity of the individual lifeflux without transmigration of an individual immutable immortal soul and a transcendental reality realizable here and now solely by ones own effortAs such there are major and unbridgeable differences between Buddhism and the other world religions and spiritual philosophiesThe attempt to find a common denominator in the uncommon or to adapt the Dhamma so that it does not differ from the other religions must necessarily failIt will only end in the debasement of the BuddhaDhamma or in its total extinction by painless absorptionThe idea of a universal religion is both unrealistic and impracticable a mere mirage and an idle delusionIn contrast over years ago the Buddha offered another way of relating religions to each other based on mutual respect yet maintaining the separate identity of each religionTo practice this method one need not become a BuddhistIt is also very practical effective and does no violence or offense to anyoneIt is simply to cultivate regularly four basic social and ethical attitudes metta  a friendly feeling of lovingkindness to all beings in every situation regardless of race creed or caste karuna  compassion for all who suffer and to take practical steps whenever possible to eliminate or alleviate those sufferings mudita  altruistic joy to be happy in others happiness in their prosperity and success thereby counteracting feelings of jealousy and unhealthy rivalry between individuals and groups and upekkha  equanimity the maintenance of an even mind when faced with the ups and downs inherent in lifeBy practicing these virtues daily a Christian becomes a better Christian a Hindu a better Hindu a Muslim a better MuslimAll of these qualities convey a universal message that make the practitioners universal human beingsSurely this is universalism in religion par excellenceThis is the most satisfactory way of living harmoniously with ones fellow men and women of all faiths fostering interreligious goodwill and avoiding religious conflictsBy pursuing this policy for over years there have been no religious wars in BuddhismIt is also the best method of relating the Buddhas Teaching to other religionsBuddhism to repeat is unique  a thing apart from all other religions in the worldWhile at all times maintaining its separate identity it should peacefully coexist with other religions following a policy of liveandletliveSuch a policy has paid rich dividends in the past and will continue to do so in the futureMonks and laypersons in Sri Lanka should remember this for the good of the Sasana and the wellbeing of the countryIn addition every Buddhist shouldRobert Bogoda was born in in Colombo the business capital of Sri LankaHis secondary education was cut short by the sudden demise of his father which compelled him to work at a modest job as a teacherWhile engaged in teaching he obtained by selfstudy the BScand MScdegrees from the University of London specializing in Social AdministrationNow retired he pursues his interests in Buddhism and social welfareHis essay A Simple Guide to Life is published by BPSThe Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creedsFounded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topicsIts publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddhas discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practiceThese works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first aroseOnce while the Buddha was staying at Jetavana Monastery in Savatthi Visakha the wealthy and devout lay Buddhist was invited by five hundred women she knew to join in celebrating a festival in the cityThis is a drinking festival Visakha repliedI do not drinkAll right the women said go ahead and make an offering to the BuddhaWe will enjoy the festivalThe next morning Visakha served the Buddha and the Order of bhikkhus at her house and made great offerings of the four requisitesThat afternoon she proceeded to Jetavana to offer incense and beautiful flowers to the Buddha and to hear the teachingAlthough the other women were already quite drunk they accompanied herEven at the gate of the monastery itself they continued drinkingWhen Visakha entered the hall she bowed reverently to the Buddha and sat respectfully on one sideHer five hundred companions however were oblivious to proprietyThey seemed in fact not to notice where they wereEven in front of the Buddha some of them danced some sang some stumbled around drunkenly and some bickeredIn order to inspire a sense of urgency in them the Buddha emitted a dark blue radiance from his eyebrows and everything suddenly became darkThe women were terrified with the fear of death and instantly became soberThe Buddha then disappeared from his seat and stood on top of Mount MeruFrom the curl of white hair between his eyebrows he emitted a ray of light as bright as if one thousand moons and suns were risingWhy are you laughing and enjoying yourselves he demanded you who are always burning and surrounded by darknessWhy dont you seek lightThe Buddhas words touched their nowreceptive minds and all five hundred women became streamenterersThe Buddha then returned and sat down in his chamberVisakha bowed to him once more and asked Venerable sir what is the origin of this custom of drinking alcohol which destroys a persons modesty and sense of shameIn answer to Visakhas question the Buddha revealed this story of the distant pastIn the hot season flocks of thirsty birds went there to drinkSwiftly becoming intoxicated they wildly spiraled upwards only to fall drunkenly at the foot of the treeAfter sleeping for a short time they woke up and flew away chirping merrilyA similar thing happened to monkeys and other treeclimbing animalsThe hunter observed all this and wondered What is in the hollow of that treeIt cant be poison for if it were the birds and animals would die He drank some of the liquid and became intoxicated the same as theyAs he drank he felt a strong desire to eat meatHe kindled a small fire wrung the necks of some of the partridges fowls and other creatures lying unconscious at the foot of the tree and roasted them over the coalsHe gesticulated drunkenly with one hand as he stuffed his mouth with the otherWhile he was drinking and eating he remembered a hermit named Varuna who lived near thereWishing to share his discovery with the hermit Sura filled a bamboo tube with the liquor wrapped up some of the roast meat and set out for the hermits leaf hutAs soon as he arrived he offered the hermit some of the beverage and both of them ate and drank with gustoThe hunter and the hermit realized this drink could be the way to make their fortuneThey poured it into large bamboo tubes which they balanced on poles slung across their shoulders and carried to KasiFrom the first border outpost they sent a message to the king that drinkmakers had arrivedWhen they were summoned they took the alcohol and offered it to the kingThe king took two or three drinks and became intoxicatedAfter a few days he had consumed all that the two men had carried and asked if there was any moreYes sire they answeredWhere asked the kingIn the HimalayasGo and fetch it ordered the kingSura and Varuna went back to the forest but they soon realized how much trouble it was to return to the mountains every time they ran outThey took note of all the ingredients and gathered everything needed so that they were able to brew the alcohol in the cityThe citizens began drinking the liquor forgot about their work and became poorThe city soon looked like a ghost townAt that point the two drinkmakers left and took their business to Baranasi where they sent a message to the kingThere too the king summoned them and offered them supportAs the habit of drinking spread ordinary business deteriorated and Baranasi declined in the same way as Kasi hadSura and Varuna next went to Saketa and after abandoning Saketa proceeded to SavatthiAt that time the king of Savatthi was named SabbamittaHe welcomed the two merchants and asked them what they wantedThey asked for large quantities of the main ingredients and five hundred huge jarsAfter everything had been combined they put the mixture in the jars and tied a cat to each jar to guard against ratsAs the brew fermented it began to overflowThe cats happily lapped up the potent drink that ran down the sides became thoroughly intoxicated and lay down to sleepRats came and nibbled on their ears noses and tailsThe kings men were shocked and reported to the king that the cats tied to the jars had died from drinking the escaping liquorSurely these men must be making poison the king concluded and he immediately ordered them both beheadedAs Sura and Varuna were being executed their last words were Sire this is liquorIt is deliciousAfter putting the drink merchants to death the king ordered that the jars be brokenBy then however the effects of the alcohol had worn off and the cats were playing merrilyThe guards reported this to the kingIf it had been poison the king said the cats would have diedIt may be delicious after allLet us drink itHe ordered that the city be decorated and that a pavilion be set up in the courtyardHe took his seat on a royal throne under a white umbrella and surrounded by his ministers prepared to drinkAt that moment Sakka the king of the gods was surveying the world and wondering Who is dutifully taking care of his parentsWho is conducting himself well in thought word and deedWhen he saw the king seated in his royal pavilion ready to drink the brew he thought If King Sabbamitta drinks that the whole world will perishI will make sure that he does not drink itSakka instantly disguised himself as a brahman and carrying a jar full of liquor in the palm of his hand appeared standing in the air in front of the kingBuy this jarBuy this jar he criedKing Sabbamitta saw him and asked Where do you come from brahmanWho are youWhat jar is that you haveListen Sakka repliedThis jar does not contain butter oil molasses or honeyListen to the innumerable vices that this jar

gratitudeBrahman he cried you have outdone even my mother and father in caring for meIn gratitude for your excellent words let me give you five choice villages a hundred serving women seven hundred cows and ten chariots with purebred horsesYou have been a great teacherAs chief of the thirtythree gods Sakka replied revealing his identity I have no need of anythingYou may keep your villages servants and cattleEnjoy your delicious food and be content with sweet cakesTake delight in the truths Ive preached to youIn this way you will be blameless in this world and will attain a glorious heavenly rebirth in the nextWith these words Sakka returned to his own abodeKing Sabbamitta vowed to abstain from alcohol and ordered that the jars be smashedFrom that day on he kept the precepts and generously dispensed almsHe lived a good life and was indeed reborn in heavenLater however the habit of drinking alcohol spread across India and many people were affectedThe Buddha here ended his lesson and identified the Birth At that time Ananda was the king and I myself was SakkaThe Buddha told this story at Jetavana Monastery about a pious lay followerOne evening when this faithful disciple came to the bank of the Aciravati River on his way to Jetavana to hear the Buddha there was no boat at the landing stageThe ferrymen had pulled their boats onto the far shore and had gone themselves to hear the BuddhaThe disciples mind was so full of delightful thoughts of the Buddha however that even though he walked into the river his feet did not sink below the surface and he walked across the water as if he were on dry landWhen however he noticed the waves on reaching the middle of the river his ecstasy subsided and his feet began to sinkBut as soon as he again focused his mind on the qualities of the Buddha his feet rose and he was able to continue walking joyously over the waterWhen he arrived at Jetavana he paid his respects to the Master and took a seat on one sideGood layman the Buddha said addressing the disciple I hope you had no mishap on your wayVenerable sir the disciple replied while coming here I was so absorbed in thoughts of the Buddha that when I came to the river I was able to walk across it as though it were solidMy friend the Blessed One said youre not the only one who has been protected in this wayIn olden days pious laymen were shipwrecked in midocean and saved themselves by remembering the virtues of the Buddha At the mans request the Buddha told this story of the pastA week after the ship left the port it sank in midoceanThe two friends saved themselves by clinging to a plank and were at last cast up on a deserted islandFamished the barber killed some birds cooked them and offered a share of his meal to the follower of the BuddhaNo thank you he answered I am fine Then he thought to himself In this isolated place there is no help for us except the Triple Gem As he sat meditating on the Triple Gem a naga king who had been born on that island transformed himself into a beautiful ship filled with the seven precious thingsThe three masts were made of sapphire the planks and anchor of gold and the ropes of silverThe helmsman who was a spirit of the sea stood on the deck and cried Any passengers for IndiaYes the lay disciple answered thats where we are boundThen come on board the sea spirit saidThe layman climbed aboard the beautiful ship and turned to call his friend the barberYou may come the sea spirit said but he may notWhy not the disciple askedHe is not a follower of the holy life answered the sea spiritI brought this ship for you but not for himIn that case the layman announced all the gifts I have given all the virtues I have practiced all the powers I have developed  I give the fruit of all of them to himThank you Master cried the barberVery well said the sea spirit now I can take you both aboardThe ship carried the two men over the sea and up the Ganges RiverAfter depositing them safely at their home in Baranasi the sea spirit used his magic power to create enormous wealth for both of themThen poising himself in midair he instructed the men and their friends Keep company with the wise and good he saidIf this barber had not been in company with this pious layman he would have perished in the middle of the ocean Finally the sea spirit returned to his own abode taking the naga king with himHaving finished this discourse the Buddha identified the Birth and taught the Dhamma after which the pious layman entered on the fruit of the second pathOn that occasion the Buddha said the disciple attained arahantshipSariputta was the naga king and I myself was the spirit of the seaOne morning while some bhikkhus were on their alms round in Savatthi they passed some ascetics of different sects practicing austeritiesSome of them were naked and lying on thornsOthers sat around a blazing fire under the burning sunLater while the monks were discussing the ascetics they asked the Buddha Lord is there any virtue in those harsh ascetic practicesThe Buddha answered No monks there is neither virtue nor any special merit in themWhen they are examined and tested they are like a path over a dunghill or like the noise the hare heardPuzzled the monks said Lord we do not know about that noisePlease tell us what it wasAt their request the Buddha told them this story of the distant pastOne day the hare lay under the young palm tree idly thinking If this earth were destroyed what would become of me At that very instant a ripe belli fruit happened to fall and hit a palm leaf making a loud THUDStartled by this sound the hare leapt to his feet and cried The earth is collapsing He immediately fled without even glancing backAnother hare seeing him race past as if for his very life asked Whats wrong and started running tooDont ask panted the firstThis frightened the second hare even more and he sprinted to keep upWhats wrong he shouted againPausing for just a moment the first hare cried The earth is breaking up At this the two of them bolted off togetherTheir fear was infectious and other hares joined them until all the hares in that forest were fleeing togetherWhen other animals saw the commotion and asked what was wrong they were breathlessly told The earth is breaking up and they too began running for their livesIn this way the hares were soon joined by herds of deer boars elk buffaloes wild oxen and rhinoceroses a family of tigers and some elephantsWhen the lion saw this headlong stampede of animals and heard the cause of their flight he thought The earth is certainly not coming to an endThere must have been some sound which they misunderstoodIf I dont act quickly they will be killedI must save themThen as fast as only he could run he got in front of them and roared three timesAt the sound of his mighty voice all the animals stopped in their tracksPanting they huddled together in fearThe lion approached and asked why they were running awayThe earth is collapsing they all answeredWho saw it collapsing he askedThe elephants know all about it some animals repliedWhen he asked the elephants they said We dont knowThe tigers knowThe tigers said The rhinoceroses know The rhinoceroses said The wild oxen know The wild oxen said The buffaloes know The buffaloes said The elk know The elk said The boars know The boars said The deer know The deer said We dont knowThe hares knowWhen he asked the hares they pointed to one particular hare and said This one told usThe lion asked him Is it true sir that the earth is breaking upYes sir I saw it said the hareWhere were you when you saw itIn the forest in a palm grove mixed with belli treesI was lying there under a palm at the foot of a belli tree thinking If this earth were destroyed what would become of me At that very moment I heard the sound of the earth breaking up and I fledFrom this explanation the lion realized exactly what had really happened but he wanted to verify his conclusions and demonstrate the truth to the other animalsHe gently calmed the animals and said I will take the hare and go to find out whether or not the earth is coming to an end where he says it isUntil we return stay herePlacing the hare on his tawny back he raced with great speed back to that groveThen he put the hare down and said Come show me the place you meantI dont dare my lord said the hareDont be afraid said the lionThe hare shivering in fear would not risk going near the belli treeHe could only point and say Over there sir is the place of dreadful soundThe lion went to the place the hare indicatedHe could make out where the hare had been lying in the grass and he saw the ripe belli fruit that had fallen on the palm leafHaving carefully ascertained that the earth was not breaking up he placed the hare on his back again and returned to the waiting animalsHe told them what he had found and said Dont be afraid Reassured all the animals returned to their usual places and resumed their routinesThose animals had placed themselves in great danger because they listened to rumours and unfounded fears rather than trying to find out the truth themselvesTruly if it had not been for the lion those beasts would have rushed into the sea and perishedIt was only because of the Bodhisattas wisdom and compassion that they escaped deathAt the conclusion of the story the Buddha identified the Birth At that time I myself was the lionOne day in Jetavana Monastery bhikkhus began talking about the good that the Buddha did for his relativesWhen the Buddha asked them about their subject and they told him he said Bhikkhus this is not the first time the Tathagata has done good works to benefit his relatives Then he told this story of the pastOn the bank of the Ganges there was an enormous mango tree with two massive branches so thick with leaves it looked like a mountainIts sweet fruit was of exquisite fragrance and flavorOne branch spread over the bank of the river but the other extended over the waterOne day while the monkey king was eating the succulent fruit he thought If any of this fruit ever fell into the river great danger could come to us To prevent this he ordered the monkeys to pick all the mango flowers or tiny fruit from that branchOne fruit however was hidden by an ants nest and escaped the monkeys attentionWhen it ripened it fell into the riverAt that time the King of Baranasi was bathing and amusing himself in the riverWhenever the king bathed in the river he had nets stretched both upstream and downstream from where he wasThe mango floated down the river and stuck in the net upstream from the kingThat evening as the king was leaving the fishermen pulled in the net and found the fruitAs they had never seen a fruit like this before they showed it to the kingWhat is this fruit the king askedWe do not know sire they answeredWho will knowThe foresters sireThe king summoned the foresters who told him that the fruit was a mangoThe king cut it with a knife and after having the foresters eat some tasted it himselfHe also gave some of the fruit to the ministers and to his wivesThe king could not forget the magnificent flavor of the ripe mangoObsessed with desire for the new fruit he called the foresters again and asked where the tree stoodWhen he learned that it was on the bank of the river he had many rafts joined together and sailed upstream to find itIn due course the king and his retinue arrived at the site of the huge treeThe king went ashore and set up a campAfter having eaten some of the delectable mangoes he retired for the night on a bed prepared at the foot of the treeFires were lit and guards set on each sideAt midnight after the men had fallen asleep and all was quiet the monkey king came with his troopThe eighty thousand monkeys moved from branch to branch eating mangoesThe noise woke the king who roused his archersSurround those monkeys eating mangoes and shoot them he orderedTomorrow we will dine on mango fruit and monkeys fleshThe archers readied their bows to obey the kingThe monkeys saw the archers and realized that all means of escape had been cut offShivering in fear of death they ran to their leader and cried Sire there are men with bows all around the tree preparing to shoot usWhat can we doDo not fear he comforted themI will save your lives Then he climbed onto the branch stretching over the riverSpringing from the end of it he jumped a hundred bowlengths and landed on the opposite bank of the GangesJudging the distance he had jumped he thought That is how far I came Then he found a long vine and cut it thinking This much will be fastened to a tree and this much will go across the river He secured one end of the vine to a sturdy tree and the other around his own waistThen he again leapt across the river with the speed of a cloud blown by the windIn his calculation however he had forgotten to include the length to be tied around his own waist so he could not reach the trunk of the mango treeHe reached out and grabbed the end of a branch firmly with both handsHe signaled to the troop of monkeys and cried QuickStep on my back and run along this vine to safetyGood luck to you allThe eighty thousand monkeys each in turn respectfully saluted the monkey king asked his pardon and escaped in this wayThe last monkey in the troop however had long resented the leader and wished to overthrow himWhen he saw the monkey king hanging there he exulted This is my chance to see the last of my enemy Climbing onto a high branch he flung himself down on the monkey kings back with a dreadful blow that broke his heartHaving caused his rival excruciating pain the wicked monkey triumphantly escaped and left the monkey king to suffer aloneHaving seen all that had happened as he lay on his bed the king thought This noble monkey king not caring for his own life has ensured the safety of his troopIt would be wrong to destroy such an animalI will have him brought down and taken care of He ordered his men to lower the monkey gently down to a raft on the GangesAfter the monkey had been brought ashore and washed the king anointed him with the purest oilSpreading an oiled skin on his own bed and laying the monkey king on it the king covered him with a yellow robeAfter the noble animal had been given sugared water to drink the king himself took a low seat and addressed him Noble monkey you made yourself a bridge for all the other monkeys to pass over to safetyWhat are you to them and what are they to you he askedThe monkey explained Great king I guard the herdI am their lord and chiefWhen they were filled with fear of your archers I leapt a great distance to save themAfter I had tied a vine around my waist I returned to this mango treeMy strength was almost gone but I managed to hold the branch so that my monkeys could pass over my back and reach safetyBecause I could save them I have no fear of deathLike a righteous king I could guarantee the happiness of those over whom I used to reignSire understand this truthIf you wish to be a righteous ruler the happiness of your kingdom your cities and your people must be dear to youIt must be dearer than life itselfAfter teaching the king in this way the monkey king diedThe king gave orders that the monkey king should be given a royal funeralHe ordered his wives to carry torches to the cemetery with their hair disheveledThe ministers sent a hundred wagon loads of wood for the funeral pyreWhen the regal ceremony was over the ministers took the skull to the kingThe king built a shrine at the monkeys burial place and made offerings of incense and flowersHe had the skull inlaid with gold raised on a spear and carried in front of the procession returning to BaranasiThere he put it at the royal gate and paid homage to it with incense and flowersThe whole city was decorated and the skull was honored for seven daysFor the rest of his life the king revered the skull as a relic offering incense and garlandsEstablished in the wonderful teaching of the monkey king he gave alms and performed other good deedsHe ruled his kingdom righteously and became destined for heavenAfter the lesson the Buddha declared the Truths and identified the Birth At that time the king was Ananda the monkey retinue was this assembly the wicked monkey was Devadatta and I myself was the monkey kingThe

variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topicsIts publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddhas discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practiceThese works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first aroseAll beings tremble at the rod says the Buddha yet today the ominous rod of terrorism has become one of the gravest problems that we faceNo longer is the terrorist threat reserved for the vulnerable public figure or the outspoken adversaryWith their lightning speed and global reach our modern media of communication have given the terrorist cadres a tremendous new power to intimidate whole populationsFar too often the victims of their hits are the helpless and innocent struck down in a symbolic show of hateThis appalling increase in terrorist violence pierces the moral consciousness at its core leaving behind painful and persisting woundsFor those of us who reside in Sri Lanka the problem becomes ever more acute as we witness the tide of terrorism sweep across this traditional homeland of the DhammaIt is no longer possible for us to immerse ourselves in the comfortable routines of our familiar worldInstead we must struggle in anguish and hope to deal with this frightful menace in our midst  to understand it and to confront it in a manner worthy of our Buddhist heritageIt cannot be disputed that the worldwide rise of terrorism springs from complex causes of a political economic and social character which must be tackled by any adequate solution to the problemAt the same time however we have to insist that terrorism also has a deeper underlying human dimension that can only be ignored at our perilIf we probe beneath the burning issues of political ideology and ethnic grievances around which the terrorist forces rally we will discover at its epicenter those same malignant drives that in less virulent form motivate so much ordinary human conductAs the vital dynamism from which terrorism springs we will find greed a rapacious lust for power and dominationWe will find hate smoldering within as cold resentment or whipped up into a frenzy of destructionAnd we will find delusion a collective paranoia instilled by inflammatory ideologies or the blind submergence of the individual in the groupThese are the hidden human roots of terrorism fed by personal frustration and social discontent they yield as their fruits the violence that surrounds usAs we grapple with the problem of terrorism asking ourselves what we can contribute to stem its rising tide we may find an answer closer to home than we imagineLet us first note that the spread of terrorism is not so much a macabre deviation from prevailing norms as an extreme manifestation of a wholesale decline in human fellow feelingThis lack of empathy and sensitivity to others can already be discerned in the everyday functioning of society  in the spreading disease of corruption apathy and selfishness infecting the social organismAdd to this a frantic search for a sense of belonging through the rediscovery of ethnic roots and the result is a potentially very explosive mixtureIf this much is recognized we may then see that one of the most effective countermeasures we can apply in our individual capacity against the growth of terrorism lies very much within our reachSimply put it consists in reaffirming to ourselves  and teaching by precept and example  those fundamental ethical values upon which a harmonious and peaceful society is foundedThis reaffirmation of genuine moral values  of compassion honesty truthfulness tolerance and respect for others  will sound a thunderous statement of conscienceWhether made audibly or privately to oneself it will raise a note of protest against the moral negligence from which terrorism draws its sustenance acclaiming our confidence in the power of the goodWhile we should not cherish unrealistic expectations about our ability to reshape the world we also should not lose sight of our responsibility to counter prevalent trendsNor should we discount our ability to make an impactThe clear and decisive commitment to ethical values has a quiet potency that can effect important changes both outwardly and inwardlyWhile subtly altering the interpersonal aspects of our lives within our hearts it will fortify those two mental factors that the Buddha called the guardians of the world  shame and moral dread  the former the innate repugnance toward evil the latter the fear of its consequencesAbove all we must reaffirm the need to rise above the limiting perspectives of the selfcentered point of view in which so many today have become entrenchedRecognizing that every community and the world as a whole is ultimately harmed by the struggle of each faction to secure its individual ends we must stand up for the development of a sense of humane responsibility that will transcend divisive loyaltiesThe lesson that we must learn and teach is that embedded in the ancient maxim taught by the Buddha Considering others as oneself do not hurt them or cause them harm To recognize others as being essentially the same as oneself and to feel their wish for happiness as ones own this is the only effective means we can propose to build the peaceful society for which we yearnThe Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of

dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first aroseOn first encounter Buddhism confronts us as a paradoxIntellectually it appears a freethinkers delight sober realistic undogmatic almost scientific in its outlook and methodBut if we come into contact with the living Dhamma from within we soon discover that it has another side which seems the antithesis of all our rationalistic presuppositionsWe still dont meet rigid creeds or random speculation but we do come upon religious ideals of renunciation contemplation and devotion a body of doctrines dealing with matters transcending sense perception and thought and  perhaps most disconcerting  a program of training in which faith figures as a cardinal virtue doubt as a hindrance barrier and fetterWhen we try to determine our own relationship with the Dhamma eventually we find ourselves challenged to make sense out of its two seemingly irreconcilable faces the empiricist face turned to the world telling us to investigate and verify things for ourselves and the religious face turned to the Beyond advising us to dispel our doubts and place trust in the Teacher and his TeachingOne way we can resolve this dilemma is by accepting only one face of the Dhamma as authentic and rejecting the other as spurious or superfluousThus with traditional Buddhist pietism we can embrace the religious side of faith and devotion but shy off from the hardheaded worldview and the task of critical inquiry or with modern Buddhist apologetics we can extol the Dhammas empiricism and resemblance to science but stumble embarrassingly over the religious sideYet reflection on what a genuine Buddhist spirituality truly requires makes it clear that both faces of the Dhamma are equally authentic and that both must be taken into accountIf we fail to do so not only do we risk adopting a lopsided view of the teaching but our own involvement with the Dhamma is likely to be hampered by partiality and conflicting attitudesThe problem remains however of bringing together the two faces of the Dhamma without sidling into selfcontradictionThe key we suggest to achieving this reconciliation and thus to securing the internal consistency of our own perspective and practice lies in considering two fundamental points first the guiding purpose of the Dhamma and second the strategy it employs to achieve that purposeThe purpose is the attainment of deliverance from sufferingThe Dhamma does not aim at providing us with factual information about the world and thus despite a compatibility with science its goals and concerns are necessarily different from those of the latterPrimarily and essentially the Dhamma is a path to spiritual emancipation to liberation from the round of repeated birth death and sufferingOffered to us as the irreplaceable means of deliverance the Dhamma does not seek mere intellectual assent but commands a response that is bound to be fully religiousIt addresses us at the bedrock of our being and there it awakens the faith devotion and commitment appropriate when the final goal of our existence is at stakeBut for Buddhism faith and devotion are only spurs which impel us to enter and persevere along the path by themselves they cannot ensure deliveranceThe primary cause of bondage and suffering the Buddha teaches is ignorance regarding the true nature of existence hence in the Buddhist strategy of liberation the primary instrument must be wisdom the knowledge and vision of things as they really areInvestigation and critical inquiry cool and uncommitted constitute the first step toward wisdom enabling us to resolve our doubts and gain a conceptual grasp of the truths upon which our deliverance dependsBut doubt and questioning cannot continue indefinitelyOnce we have decided that the Dhamma is to be our vehicle to spiritual freedom we have to step on board we must leave our hesitancy behind and enter the course of training which will lead us from faith to liberating visionFor those who approach the Dhamma in quest of intellectual or emotional gratification inevitably it will show two faces and one will always remain a puzzleBut if we are prepared to approach the Dhamma on its own terms as the way to release from suffering there will not be two faces at allInstead we will see what was there from the start the single face of Dhamma which like any other face presents two complementary sidesThe Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creedsFounded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topicsIts publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddhas discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practiceThese works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first aroseIn line with the presentday stress on the need for religious teachings to be personally relevant and directly verifiable in certain Dhamma circles the timehonored Buddhist doctrine of rebirth has come up for severe reexaminationAlthough only a few contemporary Buddhist thinkers still go so far as to suggest that this doctrine be scrapped as unscientific another opinion has been gaining ground to the effect that whether or not rebirth itself be a fact the doctrine of rebirth has no essential bearings on the practice of Dhamma and thence no claim to an assured place in the Buddhist teachingsThe Dhamma it is said is concerned solely with the here and now with helping us to resolve our personal hangups through increased selfawareness and inner honestyAll the rest of Buddhism we can now let go as the religious trappings of an ancient culture utterly inappropriate for the Dhamma of our technological ageIf we suspend our own predilections for the moment and instead go directly to our sources we come upon the indisputable fact that the Buddha himself taught rebirth and taught it as a basic tenet of his teachingViewed in their totality the Buddhas discourses show us that far from being a mere concession to the outlook prevalent in his time or an Asiatic cultural contrivance the doctrine of rebirth has tremendous implications for the entire course of Dhamma practice affecting both the aim with which the practice is taken up and the motivation with which it is followed through to completionThe aim of the Buddhist path is liberation from suffering and the Buddha makes it abundantly clear that the suffering from which liberation is needed is the suffering of bondage to samsara the round of repeated birth and deathTo be sure the Dhamma does have an aspect which is directly visible and personally verifiableBy direct inspection of our own experience we can see that sorrow tension fear and grief always arise from our greed aversion and ignorance and thus can be eliminated with the removal of those defilementsThe importance of this directly visible side of Dhamma practice cannot be underestimated as it serves to confirm our confidence in the liberating efficacy of the Buddhist pathHowever to downplay the doctrine of rebirth and explain the entire import of the Dhamma as the amelioration of mental suffering through enhanced selfawareness is to deprive the Dhamma of those wider perspectives from which it derives its full breadth and profundityBy doing so one seriously risks reducing it in the end to little more than a sophisticated ancient system of humanistic psychotherapyThe Buddha himself has clearly indicated that the root problem of human existence is not simply the fact that we are vulnerable to sorrow grief and fear but that we tie ourselves through our egoistic clinging to a constantly selfregenerating pattern of birth aging sickness and death within which we undergo the more specific forms of mental afflictionHe has also shown that the primary danger in the defilements is their causal role in sustaining the round of rebirthsAs long as they remain unabandoned in the deep strata of the mind they drag us through the round of becoming in which we shed a flood of tears greater than the waters of the ocean When these points are carefully considered we then see that the practice of Dhamma does not aim at providing us with a comfortable reconciliation with our present personalities and our situation in the world but at initiating a farreaching inner transformation which will issue in our deliverance from the cycle of worldly existence in its entiretyAdmittedly for most of us the primary motivation for entering upon the path of Dhamma has been a gnawing sense of dissatisfaction with the routine course of our unenlightened lives rather than a keen perception of the dangers in the round of rebirthsHowever if we are going to follow the Dhamma through to its end and tap its full potential for conferring peace and higher wisdom it is necessary for the motivation of our practice to mature beyond that which originally induced us to enter the pathOur underlying motivation must grow toward those essential truths disclosed to us by the Buddha and encompassing those truths must use them to nourish its own capacity to lead us toward the realization of the goalOur motivation acquires the requisite maturity by the cultivation of right view the first factor of the Noble Eightfold Path which as explained by the Buddha includes an understanding of the principles of kamma and rebirth as fundamental to the structure of our existenceThough contemplating the moment is the key to the development of insight meditation it would be an erroneous extreme to hold that the practice of Dhamma consists wholly in maintaining mindfulness of the presentThe Buddhist path stresses the role of wisdom as the instrument of deliverance and wisdom must comprise not only a penetration of the moment in its vertical depths but a comprehension of the past and future horizons within which our present existence unfoldsTo take full cognizance of the principle of rebirth will give us that panoramic perspective from which we can survey our lives in their broader context and total network of relationshipsThis will spur us on in our own pursuit of the path and will reveal the profound significance of the goal toward which our practice points the end of the cycle of rebirths as minds final liberation from sufferingThe Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creedsFounded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topicsIts publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddhas discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practiceThese works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first aroseHe who attends on the sick attends on me declared the Buddha exhorting his disciples on the importance of ministering to the sickThis famous statement was made by the Blessed One when he discovered a monk lying in his soiled robes desperately ill with an acute attack of dysenteryWith the help of Ananda the Buddha washed and cleaned the sick monk in warm waterOn this occasion he reminded the monks that they have neither parents nor relatives to look after them so they must look after one anotherIf the teacher is ill it is the bounden duty of the pupil to look after him and if the pupil is ill it is the teachers duty to look after the sick pupilIf a teacher or a pupil is not available it is the responsibility of the community to look after the sickOn another occasion the Buddha discovered a monk whose body was covered with sores his robe sticking to the body with pus oozing from the soresUnable to look after him his fellow monks had abandoned himOn discovering this monk the Buddha boiled water and washed the monk with his own hands then cleaned and dried his robesWhen the monk felt comforted the Buddha preached to him and he became an arahant soon after which he passed awayThus the Buddha not only advocated the importance of looking after the sick he also set a noble example by himself ministering to those who were so ill that they were even considered repulsive by othersThe Buddha has enumerated the qualities that should be present in a good nurseHe should be competent to administer the medicine he should know what is agreeable to the patient and what is notHe should keep away what is disagreeable and give only what is agreeable to the patientHe should be benevolent and kindhearted he should perform his duties out of a sense of service and not just for the sake of remunerationHe should not feel repulsion towards saliva phlegm urine stools sores etcHe should be capable of exhorting and stimulating the patient with noble ideas with Dhamma talkHere it is noteworthy that the nurse is expected to be efficient not only in taking care of the body by giving proper food and medicine but is also expected to nurture the patients mental conditionIt is well known that the kindness of nurses and doctors is almost as effective as medicine for a patients morale and recoveryWhen one is desperately ill and feels helpless a kind word or a gentle act becomes a source of comfort and hopeThat is why benevolence and compassion which are also sublime emotions are regarded as praiseworthy qualities in a nurseThe sutta adds another dimension to the nursing profession by including the spiritual element in a nurses talkSickness is a time when one is face to face with the realities of life and it is a good opportunity to instill a sense of spiritual urgency even in the most materialistic mindFurther the fear of death is naturally greater when a person is ill than when wellThe best means of calming this fear is by diverting attention to the DhammaA nurse is expected to give this spiritual guidance to the patient in his or her charge as a part and parcel of a nurses dutyIn the Anguttara Nikaya the Buddha describes three types of patientsThere are patients who do not recover whether or not they get proper medical attention and nursing care there are others who recover irrespective of whether or not they get medical attention and nursing care there are others who recover only with appropriate medical treatment and careBecause there is this third type of patient all those who are ill should be given the best medical treatment available agreeable food and proper nursing careSo long as a patient is alive everything possible should be done for his recoveryAccording to another sutta illness is one of the inevitables in lifeWhen faced with it all resources available to one even magical incantations should be utilized with the hope of restoring healthHere the question of whether such performances are effective or not is not discussedThe point seems to be that at the time of a crisis there is no harm in trying out even methods traditionally believed to be efficacious but in which one does not necessarily have faith or beliefOf course such methods should not clash with ones conscienceIf in spite of these efforts death does occur then one has to accept it as a verdict of kamma with equanimity and philosophical maturityHere we are reminded of an episode where a mother who was critically ill needed rabbit meat as a cureThe son finding that rabbit meat was not available in the open market went in search of a rabbitHe caught one but was loathe to kill even for the sake of his motherHe let the rabbit go and wished his mother wellSimultaneously with this wish the power of the sons moral virtue brought about the mothers recoveryThe Buddhist tradition seems to hold that under certain circumstances moral power has healing properties that may work even in cases when orthodox medicine failsThe Medicines Chapter of the Vinaya Mahavagga shows that the Buddha relaxed a number of minor disciplinary rules to accommodate the needs of sick monksThough a strict disciplinarian the Buddha has shown great sympathy and understanding to those who are illThe value of health has been fully realized and it is even recognized as the greatest gainThe Buddha teaches that the patient too should cooperate with the doctor and the nurse in order to get wellSuch a good patient should take and do only what is agreeable to himEven in taking agreeable food he should know the proper quantityHe should take the prescribed medicine without fussHe should honestly disclose his ailments to his dutyconscious nurseHe should patiently bear physical pain even when it is acute and excruciatingThe suttas show that the Buddha exercised great will power and composure on occasions when he fell illHe experienced excruciating pain when a stone splinter pierced his foot after Devadatta hurled a boulder at himHe endured such pain with mindfulness and selfcomposure and was not overpowered by the painDuring his last illness too the Buddha mindfully bore up great physical pain and with admirable courage he walked from Pava to Kusinara with his devoted attendant Ananda resting in a number of places to soothe his tired bodyThe Mahaparinibbana Sutta also reports that the Buddha once willfully suppressed a grave illness in Beluvagama and regained healthIt seems that those who are highly developed mentally are able to suppress illness at least on certain occasionsOnce Nakulapita visited the Buddha in old age and the Master advised him to remain mentally healthy even though the body is feebleThere is physical and mental painIf when one has physical pain one becomes worried and adds mental pain too that is like being shot with two arrowsOne who is spiritually evolved is capable of keeping the mind healthy proportionate to his spiritual developmentAs an arahant is fully developed spiritually he is capable of experiencing physical pain only without mental painA number of suttas advocate the recitation of the enlightenment factors for the purpose of healing physical ailmentsOn two occasions when the Elders Mahakassapa and Mahamoggallana were ill the Buddha recited the enlightenment factors and it is reported that the monks regained normal healthIt is perhaps significant to note that all the monks concerned were arahants and had therefore fully developed the enlightenment factorsThe Bojjhanga Samyutta also reports that once when the Buddha was ill he requested Cunda to recite the enlightenment factorsThe Buddha was pleased at the recitation and it is said that he regained healthOn another occasion when the monk Girimananda was very ill the Buddha informed Ananda that if a discourse on ten perceptions is delivered to him he might get wellThe ten perceptions are the perception of impermanence egolessness impurity of the body evil consequences elimination detachment cessation disenchantment with the entire world impermanence of all component things and mindfulness of breathingAnanda learned the discourse from the Buddha and repeated it for Girimananda and it is reported that he recoveredOnce the Buddha heard that a newly ordained monk who was not very well known among his fellow monks was very illThe Buddha visited himWhen he saw the Buddha approaching him he stirred in his bed and tried to get up but the Buddha cautioned him not to riseHaving taken a seat the Buddha inquired after his health whether the pains are decreasing and not increasingThe monk replied that he is feeling very ill and weak that his pains are increasing and not decreasingThe Buddha then inquired whether he had any misgiving or remorseThe monk replied that he had plenty of misgiving and remorseThe Buddha then asked whether he reproached himself for breach of virtueHe said noThen the Buddha asked why he felt remorseful if he was not guilty of any breach of virtueThe monk replied that the Buddha does not preach the doctrine for purity of virtue but for detachment from lustGreatly pleased the Buddha exclaimed Sadhu Sadhu in approbationThe Buddha then went on to preach the doctrine to the monkHe explained that the sense faculties are impermanent unsatisfactory and egoless therefore they should not be considered as I and mine Understanding their true nature the noble disciple becomes disenchanted with the sense facultiesWhen this explanation of the Dhamma was being given the vision of truth dawned on the monk he realized that whatever has the nature of arising necessarily has the nature of cessationIn other words he became a sotapanna a streamentererAccording to the Sotapattisamyutta Anathapindika was once very ill and at his request the Venerable Sariputta visited himOn being told that the pains are excruciating and increasing Sariputta delivered a discourse reminding Anathapindika of his own virtuesSariputta explained that the uninstructed worldling who has no faith in the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha and who has not cultivated virtuous moral habits goes to a state of woe on the destruction of the bodyBut Anathapindika has unshakable conviction in the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha and has cultivated noble moral habitsSariputta told him that when these noble qualities are mindfully appreciated the pains would subsideFurther Sariputta pointed out that uninstructed worldlings reach a state of woe on the disintegration of the body as they have not cultivated the Noble Eightfold PathBut on the contrary Anathapindika has cultivated the Noble Eightfold PathWhen attention is paid to them and the noble qualities are appreciated the pains would subsideIt is reported that the pains subsided and Anathapindika recovered from that illnessSo much so that Anathapindika got out of bed and served the Venerable Sariputta with the meal that was prepared for himselfThe Sotapattisamyutta records an account of another occasion when Anathapindika was illThe Venerable Ananda was summoned to the bedside and he delivered a discourseAnanda explained that uninstructed ordinary people who have no faith in the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha and who are given to immoral habits are seized with trepidation and fear at the approach of deathBut the noble disciple who has deep conviction in the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha and who has cultivated moral habits does not experience trepidation and fear of deathAnathapindika then confessed unshakable conviction in the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha and declared that he is endowed with the spotless virtue of a householderAnanda exclaimed that it is indeed a great gain that Anathapindika has disclosed the attainment of the fruit of streamentryIt is however not reported whether Anathapindika recovered straight awayThe Buddha recommends that a monk should not relax his energy and determination for spiritual progress even when he is illIt is possible that the illness might deteriorate and before that happens care should be taken to advance spiritually as much as possibleAfter recovering from an illness too one should not be negligent because should there be a relapse the chances of gaining higher spiritual attainments diminishThe Buddhist method of ministering to the sick as is evident from the canonical texts cited above attaches great importance not only to proper medical and nursing care but also to directing the mind of the patient to wholesome thoughtsThere seems to be a belief that attention paid to doctrinal topics especially the recitation of virtues which one has already cultivated is endowed with healing propertiesIn the case of the Buddha and arahants the recitation of the bojjhangas has restored normal healthIn the case of the monk Girimananda who was probably not an arahant at the time of his illness it was a discourse on the ten perceptions that restored his good healthAnathapindika was a sotapanna and a discussion on the special qualities of a sotapanna was instrumental for his speedy recoveryIt may be that when one is reminded of the spiritual qualities one has already acquired great joy arises in the mindSuch joy is perhaps capable even of altering ones bodily chemistry in a positive and healthy mannerHere we are reminded of a relevant episode contained in the PapañcasudaniA monk while listening to the Dhamma was bitten by a snakeHe ignored the snake bite and continued to listenThe venom spread and the pain became acuteHe then reflected on the unblemished purity of his virtuous conduct from the time of his higher ordinationGreat joy and satisfaction arose within him when he realized the spotless nature of his characterThis healthy psychological change acted as antivenom and he was immediately curedThese episodes seem to reveal that when attention is drawn to ones own spiritual qualities at times of serious illness and pious joy wells up in the mind thereby healthpromoting factors become activated in the body perhaps by way of the secretion of healthrestoring hormonesThat may be the mechanism by which spiritually advanced individuals regain health when appropriate suttas are recitedThere is much material in the Pali canon on counseling the terminally illSpeaking about death to a terminally ill patient is not avoided as an unpleasant topicOn the contrary the reality of death and perhaps its imminence are accepted without any pretense and the patient is made to face the prospect of death with confidence and tranquillityThe advice given by Nakulamata to Nakulapita is extremely valuable in this connectionOnce Nakulapita was seriously ill and his wife Nakulamata noticed that he was anxious and worriedShe advised him thus Please sir do not face death with anxietyPainful is death for one who is anxiousThe Buddha has looked down upon death with anxietyIt may be you are anxious that I will not be able to support the family after your deathPlease do not think soI am capable of spinning and weaving and I will be able to bring up the children even if you are no morePerhaps you are worried that I will remarry after your deathPlease do not think soWe both led pure wholesome lives according to the noble conduct of householdersSo do not entertain any anxiety on that accountIt may be you are worried that I will neglect attending on the Buddha and the SanghaPlease do not think soI will be more devoted to the Buddha and the Sangha after your deathPerhaps you are worried that I will neglect keeping to the preceptsPlease do not have any doubts on that accountI am one of those who fully practice the moral habits declared for the laity and if you wish please ask the Buddha about this matterPerhaps you fear that I have not gained inner mental composurePlease do not think soI am one of those who have gained inner mental composure as much as a householder could gainIf you have any doubts about this the Buddha is at Bhesakalavana ask himPerhaps it occurs to you that I have not attained proficiency in the Buddhas dispensation that I have not gone beyond doubt and perplexity without depending on anotherIf you wish to have these matters clarified ask the BuddhaBut please do not face death with anxiety for it is painful and censured by the Buddha It is reported that after Nakulapita was thus admonished by Nakulamata he regained his health and gone was that illness never to recurLater on this whole incident was narrated to the Buddha who commended Nakulamata for her sagacious adviceThe Sotapattisamyutta contains a valuable discourse on the question of counseling the terminally illOnce Mahanama the Sakyan inquired from the Buddha how a wise layman should advise another wise layman who is terminally illHere it should be noted that both the counselor and the patient are wise lay BuddhistsThe Buddha delivered a whole discourse on how this should be doneFirst a wise layman should comfort a wise layman who is terminally ill with the four assurances Be comforted friend you have unshakable confidence in the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha that the Buddha is fully enlightened the Dhamma is well proclaimed and the Sangha is well disciplinedYou also have cultivated unblemished virtuous conduct which is conducive to concentration Having thus comforted the patient with the four assurances he should ask him whether he has any longing for his parentsIf he says yes it should be pointed out that death will certainly come whether he has longing for his parents or notTherefore it is better to give up the longingThen if he says he gives up his longing for his parents he should be asked whether he has longing for his wife and childrenWith the same reasoning he should be persuaded to give up that longing tooThen he should be asked if he has any longing for the pleasures of the sensesIf he says yes he should be convinced that divine pleasures are superior to human pleasures and should be encouraged to aspire for divine pleasuresThen he should be gradually led up the scale of divine pleasures and when he comes to the highest heaven of the sense sphere his attention should be diverted to the BrahmaworldIf he says he has resolved on the attainment of the Brahmaworld he should be admonished that even the Brahmaworld is characterized by impermanence and the rebirth personalityTherefore it is better to aspire for the cessation of the rebirth personalityIf he can establish his mind on the cessation of the rebirth personality then the Buddha says there is no difference between him and the monk who is liberatedThis no doubt is the highest form of counseling that can be given to a highly advanced person who is terminally ill by an equally spiritually advanced personIt is very clear from the discourse that the patient must be one who is as advanced as a streamenterer as the four assurances or the consoling factors mentioned at the very beginning of the discourse are identical with the qualities of a streamentererThe Cittasamyutta contains an interesting episode of the death of a spiritually advanced learned lay discipleCitta the householder was a nonreturnerWhen he fell critically ill a group of sylvan deities invited Citta to set his mind on becoming a universal monarch because the aspirations of the virtuous come to passHe refused saying that that too is impermanentThough lying on his deathbed he admonished his relatives who had assembled round him on the importance of cultivating faith in the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha and on the importance of charity then he passed awayAccording to the Sotapattisamyutta the Buddha once visited the bedside of Dighavu the lay disciple who was terminally illThe Master advised him to fix his attention on unwavering confidence in the noble qualities of the Triple Gem and to will that he be endowed with spotless virtuous conductDighavu replied that these qualities of a streamenterer are already found in himThen the Buddha advised him to be established in those virtues and develop the six qualities conducive to understanding namely the perception of the impermanence of all component things the unsatisfactoriness of all that is impermanent the egolessness of what is unsatisfactory the perception of elimination detachment and cessationDighavu replied that these qualities too are found in him but he is concerned that his father will be sad when he diesThen Jotipala his father advised him not to be worried on that account but to pay heed to what the Buddha saysThe Buddha having admonished him left and Dighavu died soon afterLater the Buddha declared that Dighavu passed away as a nonreturnerThe brahman Dhananjani was an unscrupulous tax collector who exploited both the king and the publicThe Venerable Sariputta met him once and exhorted him on the evil consequences of an unrighteous lifeShortly thereafter Dhananjani was seriously ill and Sariputta was summoned to his bedsideOn being inquired about his health Dhananjani informed Sariputta that he has an unbearable headacheSariputta then engaged him in a conversation gradually drawing his attention from lower to higher realms of existence as far as the BrahmaworldHaving thus diverted the attention of the neardeath patient to the Brahmaworld Sariputta went on to explain the path leading to the attainment of the Brahmaworld namely the full development of the brahmaviharas  loving kindness compassion altruistic joy and equanimity  to suffuse all quartersAt the end of the discourse Dhananjani requested Sariputta to convey his respects to the BuddhaSariputta departed and shortly afterwards Dhananjani diedIt is reported that he was reborn in the BrahmaworldLater when the matter was related to the Buddha he found fault with Sariputta for not having led Dhananjani further on the spiritual pathThis sutta shows that a man who had been unscrupulous in his dealings could also be guided to a happier rebirth by counseling during the crucial period just prior to deathIt is highly doubtful whether any and every evil doer could be thus guided towards rebirth in a happy realmPerhaps Dhananjanis good qualities outweighed his evil deeds and that may be the reason why it was possible to lead him to rebirth in a happy state by counsel offered by a noble arahant at the hour of deathThat this may have been so can be inferred from the facts reported in the suttaSariputta made it a point to inquire about Dhananjanis spiritual zeal soon after inquiring about the Buddhas health from a monk coming from Rajagaha when he himself was touring in the far away DakkhinapathaIt is very likely that Dhananjani was a faithful patron of the Sangha when his first wife a lady full of faith was aliveHis second wife was a faithless womanWhen Sariputta heard that Dhananjani was negligent he was dismayed and made up his mind to talk to Dhananjani should the occasion arise to meet himAnother important noteworthy feature in this discourse is that the Venerable Sariputta starts the discourse from the lowest state of existence and works upwards as far as the BrahmaworldPerhaps he started from the hells because Dhananjani had deteriorated to that levelSariputta may have helped to remind him of his former good deeds and also may have drawn his attention to a relevant Dhamma discourse Sariputta had delivered to him perhaps only a few days prior to his illnessThus by drawing on the spiritual potential that was hidden in him Sariputta may have been able to help Dhananjani attain a happy rebirth by last minute counselingHere we are reminded of the episode of young MattakundaliWhen he was lying on his deathbed the Blessed One appeared and Mattakundali being greatly pleased generated much faith in the BuddhaDying soon after he was reborn in a celestial realmA sutta in the Sotapattisamyutta maintains that when an uninstructed ordinary person at the threshold of death sees that he has no faith in the noble qualities of the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha and that he has led an immoral life great fear of death and trepidation arise in himBut a person who has deep unwavering faith in the noble qualities of the Triple Gem and who is spotlessly pure in his conduct experiences no such fear of death and trepidationIt seems to be the guilty conscience that causes much anguish at the moment of deathWhen there is fear and anxiety at this crucial moment rebirth must take place in a sphere that is proportionate and commensurate to that experience of anguishIt is appropriate to record here a relevant discussion Mahanama the Sakyan had with the Buddha regarding the fate of one who meets with a violent deathMahanama tells the Buddha that when he comes to the serene atmosphere of the monastery and associates with pious monks of noble qualities he feels quite calm and selfpossessedBut when he goes out into the streets of Kapilavatthu busy with constant traffic he feels frightened over the future birth that would await him should he meet with a violent death in a traffic accidentThe Buddha assures him that a person who has cultivated moral virtues and led a righteous life need not entertain such fearsHe explains the situation with the help of a simileIf a pot of ghee is broken after being submerged in water the potsherds will sink to the riverbed but the ghee will rise to the surfaceSimilarly the body will disintegrate but the cultured mind will rise up like the gheeIt is the same idea that is emphasized in suttas such as Sankharuppatti Kukkuravatika and TevijjaRebirth usually depends on the thoughts that are most often entertained during a lifetimeIf one entertains thoughts and dispositions that are suitable for an animal for a dog or a cow as given in the Kukkuravatika Sutta then it is likely one will be reborn among these animals ie among beings who have similar dispositionsIf on the other hand one has entertained thoughts and dispositions comparable to those among the Brahmas by the cultivation of sublime emotions such as universal love and compassion one has a good chance of being reborn among the BrahmasTherefore preparation for death really has to be done while livingEven to be guided in thought to a higher rebirth when death is imminent one needs the prior requisite of faith in the ideal of human virtue and understanding  for this is what is meant by having faith in the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha  and the cultivation of moral habitsIf one lacks virtue guidance of thought patterns at the hour of death to a higher level will be difficult to the extent that one is deficient in virtueBut however difficult and effective the actual guidance may be it is a Buddhist custom to invite a monk to the bedside of a terminally ill patient with the hope that the chanting of certain protective suttas will help the patient to develop faith and elevate his thoughts to a higher plane of spiritualityWe are reminded here that according to the Vinaya some previous Buddhas such as Vessabhu whose dispensations did not last long used to instruct their disciples by looking into their minds with telepathic powers and guiding their thought patterns thus Think thus do not think thus pay attention thus do not pay attention thus give this up develop this etcPerhaps this may be the technique used by Gotama Buddha and his eminent disciples to guide thought patterns of amenable adherents at the hour of deathThey seem to have mainly used more general techniques with lengthy doctrinal discourses at other normal times in preference to guided meditation with insight into the thought patterns of individualsThe question may arise of how effective spiritual guidance will be if the terminally ill patient is unconsciousHere what is actually important is that we are really unaware of the patients mental condition at the hour of deathThe doctors and onlookers might conclude that the patient is unconscious because he does not respond to his surroundings and to the questions put to himHis five faculties may have become partly or completely defunct but nobody can be certain whether or not his mental faculty is activeWe certainly do not know what special potentialities the mind harbors on the occasion of deathIt is quite likely that the mental faculty is most active at this crucial hourPerhaps this is the time that one has the most violent mental struggle yearning for life with the firm habitual resistance and protest against deathIt is our conjecture that yearning for life is greatest when the fear of death is greatestThe fear of death is greatest when ones sense of guilt is greatest the fear that one has squandered the great opportunity of human life an opportunity which could have been well utilized for spiritual growthIf on the other hand one has well utilized the opportunity of human life for spiritual growth one can face the inevitability of death with relative calm contentment and happy satisfactionOnes rebirth seems to be commensurate with ones spiritual potential which in Buddhist terminology is called kammaIt is appropriate to conclude this essay by giving thought to what we should do when we visit a terminally ill patientOur normal attitude is one of sadness and pity but Buddhism holds that it is wrong to entertain negative thoughts at such a momentIt is my opinion that it would be helpful to the terminally ill patient and to any patient for that matter if we radiate thoughts of metta loving kindness to himAs the dying persons mind may be working at this crucial hour unencumbered by the limitations imposed by the physical sense faculties it is possible that the persons mind will be sensitive and receptive to the spiritual thought waves of those around himIf negative thought waves are generated by grief and lamentation the dying person may be adversely affectedBut if gentle thoughts of love and kindness are extended such thoughts may function as a subtle mental balm that allays the distress and anxiety brought on by the approach of death and envelops the dying persons mind in a warm protective cloak of consoling peaceAll references in text are to the editions of the Pali Text Society OxfordLily de Silva is Professor of Pali and

accurate annotated translations of the Buddhas discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practiceThese works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first aroseWEBU SAYADAW You have taken the moral precepts now practice themOnly when your practice of morality is perfect can you fulfill your aspirations for awakeningHaving perfected yourselves in morality you have to perform various other meritorious practices and these can take you to the pinnacle and the fulfillment of your aspirationsThe teachings of the Buddha are enshrined in the TipitakaThese teachings were not given by the Buddha just to be preached and studiedYou are good people you have to practice the teachings with unwavering effort from the time you obtain them in order to escape from this sufferingDo not get confused about the teachingsWe dont have to know many techniques only one but that we should know clearlyIf we establish one technique with strong effort and get rid of all doubts then without asking anyone else we shall find the answersChoose one technique and practice it steadfastlyIf you focus your mind at the small spot where the air touches when you breathe in and out then there will be no wanting no aversion or delusion and as these three are absent you are immediately out of sufferingSo for a short moment Your mind is pureNow if your last mindmoment came up at this time and you died would there be anything to be worried about or to be afraid ofThe benefits accruing to you from this practice dont last for just a short moment or one lifetimeThis short moment of purity will bring benefits for the remainder of the cycle of birth and deathAnd why can you accomplish thisBecause the time is right your form of existence is right and you are putting forth right effortThe disciples of the Buddha took the practice from the Teacher and worked with unwavering perseveranceTherefore they achieved the awakening they had aspired forHow did they workIn the same way as a man who wants to light a fire with a fire stick as in the olden daysThey rubbed two pieces of wood together and heat was producedEventually the wood started to glow and then they could light a fireSo if a man wants to start a fire in this way and rubs two pieces of wood together does he count One rub two rubs three rubsDISCIPLE No sir that wouldnt work very wellSAYADAW How would he have to do it thenD He would have to rub continuously until he got a flameS Yes when they wanted to start a fire in those days this was the only way to do itThey had to rub with strong determination and without taking breaksNow if one were to rub two pieces of wood together in this way how long would it take for the fire to startD When it gets hot enough the fire will start sirS Will that take longD Not very long sirS No if this man works with determination it doesnt take longIt is just the same with this practice hereYou want fireYou know that if you rub these two pieces of wood together you can have itNow if you count One rub two rubs it will become a little bit hotAnd then you take a rest for a whileWill you start a fireD No sirS OK so you start again once twice three times and again heat is producedThen you lay back again and take a bit of restWill you start a fireD No sirS And if you continue in this way for a whole monthD We wont get fireS And if you continue for a whole yearD It will just get warm sir but there will be no fireS Now what if you were to work like this for one hundred yearsD It will just become warm sirS In that case there is no fire in these two pieces of woodD There is fire sir but effort and perseverance are not sufficientS It is just the same with our workYou have to work as the fire maker does without taking restSoon it will become hot and then before long a fire will startOnly then will you be able to use the fire in the way you wantYou should all make effort to fulfill your aspiration for awakeningYou have received the teachings of the BuddhaNow you have to work so that your efforts are equal to those of the wise of old who attained their goalThe teachings of the Buddha are the only path out of suffering and you can practice them only when a Buddha has arisen and as long as his teachings are availableWhen no teachings of a Buddha are available you cannot fulfill your aspiration for NibbanaWhen a Buddha arises in the world right conduct and understanding that lead out of suffering are expoundedIf you use the opportunity and put them into practice you will become perfectRight conduct can also be practiced when there are no teachings of a Buddha but insight or understanding is not availableWhat exactly does right conduct meanNow that the teachings of a Buddha are available all of you untiringly give the four requisites of food robes shelter and medicine to the monksWhen you give you offer the best you can affordBut still you are not satisfied yet you want to do more and moreThis is good conductTo practice the teachings of the Buddha to the point of being able to escape from all suffering we have to be aware of one single object continuously without break or interruptionIf we are thus aware we are practicing understandingPracticing both together and being perfect in effort the wise of old attained to the awakening to which they had aspiredYou may think Well we make offerings to the teachings by giving food clothing shelter and medicine to the monksTo realize the teachings for ourselves we would have to practice insightWe shall do that if we have some free time after preparing our offerings Now if you work like this are you practicing right conduct or insightD It is right conduct sirS When you have fulfilled your duties and keep your mind steadfastly focused on one single object what are you practicing thenD Wisdom sirS So what happened to right conductWhen you keep your attention focused on the spot are you still practicing right conductD Yes sir then we are practicing right conduct and understanding at the same timeS Yes you can practice the two jointlyFirst you prepare food and then you meditateThus we have to perfect ourselves in both practices in right conduct and understandingBut you practice first only right conduct and then only understandingIs it not possible to practice these emancipating teachings of the Buddha simultaneouslyIs it not possible to be aware of inbreath and outbreath even while preparing food or while building a monasteryD Its possible sirS You see this is the way the wise disciples of the Buddha used to practiceThey had the ability to accept good advice and instructionsDo you think they might have thought Our parents who are our highest possessions and to whom we owe an infinite debt of gratitude are getting oldWe have to spend day and night serving them therefore we cant meditateD Sir some must have thought in this wayS Is the fulfillment of ones duties towards parents comprised in right conduct or in understandingD It is right conduct sirS Isnt it possible to be aware of mind and matter while you look after your parentsD Its possible sirS Now that you know that the wise of old practiced right conduct and understanding simultaneously do you still consider it impossible to practice understanding while serving your children and grandchildrenCant you train your mind in the awareness of mind and matter at the same time as you are fulfilling all your dutiesWherever you are whatever you do you can practice right conduct and meditation at the same timeWhen your children are good you can be aware of inandoutbreath and when they are naughty and you have to correct them then too you can practiceTell me what is your correcting the childrenD It is right conduct sirS So if you practice awareness while you scold them what are you practicingD Understanding sirS If we practice awareness while we do what we have to do will we sufferDoes it cost us anythingDoes it disturb our workD No sir if one works with awareness the work is completed more quicklyS If you dont allow yourselves to be distracted you will work faster and you will earn more moneyYour aspiration to Nibbana too will be fulfilled more quicklyAll the beings who practice in this way can fulfill their aspirationsThere is not a single second in which it isnt possible to fulfill your aspirationHow about those human beings Devas and Brahmans who dont practice the teachings of Buddha though the time is goodDo they attain the fulfillment of their aspirationsD Those who dont make effort cant fulfill their aspirations sirS WhyIs it because they arent reborn in the right plane of existence or because it isnt the right timeD No sir but without effort nothing can be accomplishedS Maybe they dont have sufficient paramiD Maybe some cant grasp the teachings because they havent completed their perfections sufficiently in the past sirS But if you dont put forth effort can you still claim that you dont understand because of missing paramiD Those who have accumulated perfections in the past attain the stages of Nibbana when they listen to the teachingsBut we sir because we have no perfections we listen to the Dhamma again and again and we remain just the sameS The wise of old were just like thirsty peopleThey were thirsty so they looked for waterAnd when they found it what did they doDid they look up at the sky and say Well we dont want to drink this water yetNo they were people who were really thirstyWhat about youYou have Buddhas teachings do you drink them right awayD Sir we linger and waitS In that case it isnt true that you dont have any paramiIf you dont drink your thirst will not be quenchedWhat will you do if you find yourselves sitting right next to the water potD Because we dont have a sufficient amount of parami we just sit there sirS What will you do if you walk into a lake full of waterD When we walk down into the water we stretch out our neck and turn our face up towards the sky sirAnd if we should dive sir we shall keep our mouth firmly shutS Now are you still telling me that you are thirsty but that you dont have the necessary understanding to be able to drinkD Sir because we dont have the necessary conditioning we dont open our mouth in the waterS If you really wanted to drink would you still keep your mouth shutD If one really wanted to drink one wouldnt of courseS So you are saying Though I do want to drink I do not want to drinkArent you contradicting yourselvesD It is as if we pretended not to want to drink sirS Tell me then if you are thirsty and just bear it are you happy or unhappyD Unhappy sirS So if you are unhappy will you keep sitting near the water pot without drinkingD Sir we see this kind of suffering as happinessS Did the Buddha teach that this thirst is happinessD No sir he said it was sufferingS Now tell me what do you think is true What the Buddha said or what you thinkD Our view that this is happiness is wrong sirS Do you want to be happy or unhappyD Though we would like to be happy we continue to create unhappiness for ourselvesS What is better to listen to the Buddha or not to listen to the BuddhaD Sir we know that we should follow the word of the Buddha but still we continue to create suffering for ourselvesS In that case it seems as if you knew your own good but that you are simply lazyD Because our parami are weak we have to suffer under our own ignorance sirS Now if there is water and you dont quench your thirst with it is that because you have not perfected your paramiD Because of the lack of perfections the power of ignorance is so overwhelming sirS Tell me what is more powerful understanding or ignoranceD Sir understanding is more powerful for human beingsS Then you know that the understanding the Buddha taught is powerfulD Sir we know that understanding is a good thingS So just associate yourselves with understandingWhether you think that the power of ignorance is strong or whatever You have learned now to distinguish between mind and matterWhile you are aware of mind and matter in the way the Buddha taught is there still ignorance prevailingD While we are aware sir there is no ignoranceS Now let us concentrate at the spot below the nose above the upper lip with the awareness of mind and matter just as the Buddha taughtWhen we anchor our attention thus can ignorance stayIf you look out for it will you be able to find itD It will be completely gone sirS Are you still aware where it has goneD Sir it has disappeared completelyS In that case is the power of understanding greater or that of ignoranceD The power of ignorance is great sirS Oh dear how is it greatThe poor thing just ran as fast as it could you couldnt even see it anymoreD But it comes back again and again sirS This is so because you allow it back inIf you allow only understanding and knowledge in ignorance cant come backBut if you allow it back then slowly your understanding will break up and ignorance takes over once moreIt is as with the electric lights in hereWhat do you need to switch on the lightsD Switches sirS What happens inside the switches that we get lightD Electricity flows through them sirS What happens if the flow is interruptedD It will become dark sirS What do you have to do to turn the darkness into lightD We have to feed electricity to the bulbs sirS And where does the darkness go when the lights are litD It disappears sirS Is any of the darkness left behindD No sirS When understanding shines is there any ignorance leftD No sirS In that case is the power of ignorance greatD No sir it isntS Is it difficult to do what we did just nowD Not very difficult sirS Dont we see the reality when light suddenly comesD We do sirS Will you still be able to go wrongD No sirS It is so easyWhat did the wise disciples of the Buddha connectIf you want to switch on the light you have to switch on the wires so that electricity flowsSo gently keep your attention at the spot it will connectDo you understandD We would like to give this up sirS Just concentrate your attention thereGentlyDo you become tired if you focus your mind in this wayD No sirS Does it cost you anythingD No sirS Do you have to stop your workD No sirS Isnt this wonderfulYou can practice in all the four postures sitting standing walking and lying downCan you keep your attention at the spot with the awareness of the inandoutbreath even while you are eating drinking and workingD Please sir teach us how to be aware of the breath while we are moving about and workingS You know about many different techniques but you dont have to practice them allChoose one and work with itIf you keep your mind steadfastly focused on one object you will immediately be aware of what you have not been aware of before just as you see light as soon as you turn on the switchCan there still be wrong view and delusion in your mind while you are thus awareD No sir but as we dont know where the light switches are we have to remain sitting in the darkS Oh dear youve got so many switchesWhichever you turn the light will comeD Sir because there are so many switches I dont know which one to turnS Any one will do the results will be immediateD When I press that switch sir the light bulb immediately burns upThats why I thought it was the wrong switchS It doesnt burn up it will light the bulbEven if it shots out one day when you try again it will certainly burnD But I dont know where to press the switch sirS You know the switches you have been taught so many techniques by the monks who have compassion for youNow do not try them allSelect one onlyD Sir please teach us this one techniqueS Every technique the Buddha taught will work as a switch to turn on the lightD We would like to learn a technique by which we can perfect our conduct and train ourselves in understanding while we work walk or sit sirS Well then tell me do not all of you big and small breatheD Yes sir we doS So there is no one here who doesnt know how to breatheCan you say sometimes Sorry I am very busy nowI dont have time to breatheD No sirS So then it is very easy for you to breathe isnt itNow just try to find out where the air comes out when you breathe outD It comes out of the nose sirS Is there any other place where it comes outD No sir there is only one placeS Yes there is only one placeSo dont come and tell me that there are so many switches and that you dont know which one to pressYou are all breathing arent youWhere does this air touch when you breathe outD It touches at a point at the base of the nose sirS What happens when the air entersWhere does it touchD It touches there again at the same spot sirS So this is quite obvious to you The air brushes over a small spot at the base of the nose as you breathe in and outYou are aware of this arent youD Yes sirS Dont allow the mind to wander away to other objectsCan you feel the spot where the air touches just as if you were touching it with your fingerPut your attention there and keep it thereDont follow the breath outside the nostrilsKeep your attention quietly and calmly at the spot and you will be able to know how the air goes in and outThe flow of air is continuous isnt itD Yes sir it isS You can be aware of it without the slightest interruptionIf you keep your attention there there is only the awareness of mental properties and physical propertiesNow under which of the two come the nostrils under mind or under matterD Sir as far as I know the nostrils are matterS What is the entity that knows the touch sensationD Sir that which knows is mindS So you are aware of mind and matter at the same timeIf you are aware of mind and matter are there still some other entities of which you arent awareD No sir there is nothing apart from mind and matterS Is being aware of mind and matter ignorance or knowledgeD It is knowledge sirS If one has no awareness of mind and matter what do we call thatD That we call ignorance sirS Can ignorance still influence us while we are training ourselves in understandingD No sir it cantS Is there still cause for worry and fear about the present and the futureD No sir there isntS Even if you are aware for just one short momentyou benefitHow much will you receive if you can keep up this awareness for a longer periodD The benefits must be many sirS Will there still be doubt in your mind about your own ability to attain the awakening to which you have aspiredD No sirS You can reach your goal even quicker than you thoughtOf course you still have to fulfill your duties towards your teachersparents and childrenYou have to support the teachings of the BuddhaYou have to make a livingIf you dont fulfill all these duties is your morality perfectD It isnt sirS If your moral conduct isnt perfect can you attain your goalD No sir it is impossibleS Tell me when or where is it not possible to practice right conduct and meditation simultaneouslyD It is never too difficult sir even if one is illS If your insight develops through your practice do you still need to tell others that you have become happy through the Buddha DhammaD It isnt necessary to tell others sirS And if you dont talk about it does it mean that you dont know about your own happinessD Even if we dont tell everyone we still know for ourselves sirS In just the same way noble people knowYou know for yourselves how much you have got now and when you reach the goal then you will knowIf you write on a piece of paper that salt is salty and someone reads this he knows that salt is salty doesnt heD Of course sirS And if you just tell someone that salt is salty will he knowD Why certainly sirS But tell me will salt become salty just by your writing so or saying soD No sir of course notS If you read that salt is salty do you actually know that this is soD Though one understands that it is salty one doesnt actually know how salt tastesOnly if we put some salt on our tongue and taste it shall we actually know what salty meansS If you have tasted it and know it is salty do you still have to read about itDo you still have to make declarations about its tasteD No sirS If we tell our neighbor about its taste will he know thenD He will just have heard about it sirS What do we have to do to make him knowD We have to give him some salt and make him tasteOtherwise what he knows is just hearsay sirS Do you know for sure that right conduct and insight and wisdom constitute the path to the release from sufferingD Yes sir we knowS If you read that salt is salty and consider this knowledge to be quite sufficient then that is where you stopBut if you want to make sure you have to taste for yourselvesIs it sufficient to read that salt is salty and then have this confirmed by meD Sir you wouldnt lieIf you tell me it is salty that is quite sufficient for meS Now you are going back on what you said earlier onYou know salt is salty from hearing and reading about it but only if you really know for yourselves will you become happyIf you tell somebody that salt is salty and he blindly accepts what you say then he wont even feel the desire to taste for himselfAfter all he thinks he knowsWith this notion in mind he wont see the need to taste itIt is not easy to know for oneself that salt is saltySalt does existTake it taste itThen you will know for yourselves and there will be no need to ask othersD Sir yesterday I did taste a little bit of saltS ReallyWhy only a littleDid the salt run outD No sir there is plenty of itS Then take itDont just taste a little bitUse as much as you needEvery single one of you has got some salt havent youD Yes sirWe havent eaten our full yet sir but we are satisfied with tasting just a littleS But of course you are not thinking of leaving it at that are youD Well sir not actually but as time goes by everything changesWe planned something last year and already a year has passedS Now this time dont only thinkHow many thinkers were there at the time of the BuddhaD They were as numerous as grains of sand on the beach sirS You still have to make efforts and meditateYou still have to strive to understand the teachings of the BuddhaYou are planning to do that arent youWill you only think about putting forth effort in this life alsoD If we only think about it sir we shall again be left behind in the cycle of birth and deathS Now then there is no problemIn the past we missed out because we were only thinking about making effort but now

woodIf I continue talking you will think This monk is talking for a long time I shall stop nowOnly if you work can you make an end of itIf you have the desire to work meditate work hard applying yourselves with the same effort and determination as did the Noble Ones of oldThe Webu Sayadaw was born on the th of February in Ingyinbin a small village near Shewbo in upper BurmaHe was ordained as a novice at the age of nine and was given the name Shin KumaraAt the age of twenty he was ordained as a full member of the Sangha now being addressed as U KumaraU Kumara went to Mandalay to study at the famous Masoyein Monastery the leading monastic university of the timeIn his seventh year after full ordination he abandoned the study of the Pali scriptures and left the monastery to put into practice what he had learned about meditationAfter leaving the monastery U Kumara spent four years in solitudeThen he went to his native village Ingyinbin for a brief visitHe taught his former teacher at the village monastery on request the technique of meditation he had adoptedHe said This is the shortcut to NibbanaAnyone can use itIt stands up to investigation and is in accordance with the teachings of the Buddha as observed in the scripturesIt is the straight path to NibbanaThe Webu Sayadaw emphasized the practice of meditation as the only way to bring the teachings of the Buddha to fulfillmentThe study of the scriptures though helpful is not essential for the realization of NibbanaThe technique of meditation taught by the Webu Sayadaw is anapana sati mindfulness of breathing which requires one to be aware of breathing in while breathing in of breathing out while breathing out and of the spot or area which the stream of air touches while the breath is entering and leaving the nostrilsThough anapana sati is basically a way of developing samadhi onepointed concentration of mind the Webu Sayadaw said that when concentration is developed to a sufficient degree the meditator can gain insight into the three characteristics of nature  impermanence unsatisfactoriness and nonselfThe direct understanding of these three characteristics is called pañña wisdom which is the most essential quality required of a meditator to reach NibbanaThe Webu Sayadaw was not a scholar and his discourses do not cater to the intellectual who prefers the study of Buddhist philosophy to the practiceHis refreshing simplicity his patience his lovely sense of humor and his humility all revealed in his dialogue with his audience illumine a side of Buddhism which cannot be perceived by reading treatises and textsThe statements of the people in the audience offer us a glimpse of how Buddhism is practiced in Burma todayThe Webu Sayadaw undertook pilgrimages to the Buddhist sites of India and Sri LankaHe passed away on the th of June in the meditation center at his native village IngyinbinHe was believed by many to have been an arahant a person who has in practice fully understood the Four Noble Truths and attained the end of sufferingThe Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creedsFounded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topicsIts publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddhas discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practiceThese works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first aroseEhi bhikkhu Come monk With these simple but portentous words the Buddha founded the Sangha the Order of bhikkhus which has preserved and practiced his doctrine from that day to thisWith that Ehi bhikkhu the Buddha conferred ordination upon the first monk the Venerable Kondañña at Isipatana near BenaresAt the conclusion of the Buddhas first discourse Kondañña had asked to be ordained and the Buddha simply by calling him a bhikkhu transformed him into oneThe Buddha went on to say The Dhamma has been well expoundedPractice the holy life rightly to make an end of suffering That was the ultimate the highest aim of becoming a monk then as it is now liberation from all dukkha the suffering of repeated becoming in the cycle of rebirth samsaraDuring the Buddhas life and since the procedure to become a Buddhist monk evolved into a series of steps often involving large numbers of bhikkhus and lay peopleModern ordination ceremonies clearly express the interdependent relationship of monks and lay people supporting each other in their efforts to put an end to sufferingThe bhikkhus by their conduct must inspire faith in the lay peopleThe householders in turn show deep respect for the Order by honoring the individual bhikkhus who in turn determine to make themselves worthy of the respect and support they receive from the laityThe Buddha could only ordain a few bhikkhus with the phrase Ehi bhikkhu Such instantaneous ordination required that the man had cultivated certain paramis in the pastChief amongst the good kammas needed for the Buddha to accept someone as a monk in this way tradition says was having been a bhikkhu in previous lives andor having helped others to ordainThis is one of the reasons why laymen in Myanmar ordain temporarily and why they obtain such lavish help from lay people notably their families when they undertake temporary ordinationBecause they are closely based on the Vinaya Pitaka the ordination ceremonies in the different Theravada countries are almost identicalWhether the bhikkhus expect to remain in robes for the remainder of their lives or are temporary monks makes no difference to the procedureBut national variations especially in the lay aspects of the events do lend color and specific points of interest to the solemn ceremonyIn January a mass ordination of foreign men was held in Yangon Myanmar under the combined auspices of the Myanmar Department of Religious Affairs and the International Meditation Centre YangonThis event unusual in its location scale and international scope will be described below along with a summary of the week these men were in robesAll the detailed arrangements of place transport requisites and the like had been made by the hosts beforehand for seven boys aged  to become samaneras or novices and fortynine foreign men and one Myanmar to take the full upasampada ordinationThey would remain in robes for about a week in accordance with the Myanmar custom of temporary ordinationIn that land it is considered essential for every Buddhist male to become a samanera as a boy and a bhikkhu as a man at least for some short period of his life for the reason explained above and to earn a very high kind of merit puññaAll those in this group who were to be ordained were meditation students of Mother Sayamagyi and Sayagyi U Chit Tin direct disciples of the late Sayagyi U Ba Khin renowned lay teacher of Vipassana meditation in MyanmarThey were associated with the International Meditation Centers in that tradition around the world and the small original IMC atop a low hill in suburban Yangons diplomatic area was the focus for most of the activitiesThe shaving of heads preliminary to every ordination was set up just outside the wall surrounding the Light of the Dhamma Pagoda at the CentreAbout six lifelong bhikkhus from the preceptors monastery came to help shave the heads of the ordinandsShaded from the hot afternoon sun by a permanent awning the men doused their heads with water from plastic buckets then the brownhaired Europeans blond Americans black and greyhaired Asians and Australians sat on low stoolsTwo people including the mans wife if she was available held a piece of white cloth beneath the candidates chin to catch the locks of hair as they fell from the bladeThe bhikkhus swiftly used the straight razors the foreigners had imported while guiding the movements of their assistants through gesture when they did not share a common languageThe men were meditating on the parts of the body or the breath or the significance of ordainingWell aware that this was the start of an important ceremony everyone quietly reflected on its valueIt took perhaps an hour before all were shornAs a mans head was finished he took a shower and changed into fresh clothes in preparation for the pabbajja ceremony which was to take place that evening in the Centers Dhamma HallThe organizers knew that the men would be hungry so they were given an early evening meal since they would not be able to eat again that day after they had taken the novices Ten Precepts the sixth of which requires abstaining from food after middayIt had already been a long day of celebration and religious activityEarly in the morning the children in the group four girls and seven boys had been dressed as princesses and princes in gilt and silk costumes that included fanciful high crowns sequined lungis with long trains for the girls makeup and decorations imitating precious jewelryThe princes were going to become samaneras novices in the evening and the dressing up was part of the build up so they would enjoy themselves and keep happy memories of the dayThe royal attire also symbolized the renunciation of the princely life by the Bodhisatta Siddhattha  the future Buddha  when he went forth from the palace to find the way to liberationBefore am the children were lifted up into the backs of small open pickup trucks and seated on upholstered chairs by the individuals from the Centre who had been assigned to be their foster parents for the dayThe real parents perhaps a bit nervous about how their children would behave carried the bundle of their sons robes along with some small white orchidsIt was a landmark event in the lives of these Western Buddhist familiesThe boys trucks were adorned with tall golden umbrellas proclaiming the ordination procession to passers byThe rest of the group followed in cars and coachesThey moved at a stately pace through Yangon to the Shwe Dagon Pagoda where several hairs of the Buddha are enshrinedAt the head of the motorcade a uniformed Myanmar band standing in a truck played the typical raucous music of the land and sang about the Great RenunciationA dancer performed in the jerky bent knee and elbow style of Southeast AsiaThis too was part of the traditional way to celebrate the boys going forthThe strong group found the route up to Shwe Dagon Myanmars most revered Buddhist site clear of other devoteesSingle file barefoot contented and chatting a little each carrying a purple orchid spray offering they proceeded up the series of long escalators to the level of the walkwayThis is situated perhaps halfway between ground level and the peak of the spire with the golden umbrellaThe wide band is paved in marble and much of it is covered with pagodas cetiyas and sculptures notably of the stylized lions who seem to be guardians of the sacred shrineThere were many bhikkhus and lay families at the pagoda although it was not crowdedThey showed mild curiosity about the large group of outsidersThe international contingent was dressed for the occasion in proper Myanmar attire the men in plaid lungis and short white jackets the women in heavy woven cotton lungis all of one pattern in various dark colorsThe group was led by their teachers and the princes and princesses as it respectfully and mindfully circumambulated the golden domeThe atmosphere was informal and comfortable the meditators appreciating the beauty and peace of the sceneAfter a short meditation session in a side chamber they left Shwe Dagon and drove to an audience with the fifteen leading sayadaws renowned senior bhikkhus who were in office by turns from among the countrys State Sangha Maha Nayakas the Central Executive Body of the SanghaThe group had been allotted a narrow window in the busy schedules of the sayadaws the Central Executive Body of the Sangha to pay respectsThe theras sat on chairs in the front of the room with an ornate shrine behind them and were formally introduced in English to the meditatorsThe foreigners the teachers and Myanmar hosts accompanying them all paid respects to the sayadaws by bowing with their foreheads to the floorThey then repeated Namo Tassa Bhagavato and other devotional verses after the chief sayadawThe focus of events shifted to the meditation centre for the rest of the dayIn the early afternoon there was an earboring ceremony for the four girls aged Since the Order of bhikkhunis has died out and according to Theravada orthodoxy cannot be revived for lack of bhikkhunis to ordain others girls in Myanmar undergo this simple ritual generally when a brother is becoming a samaneraAt IMCs Dhamma Hall there was some chanting as the girls sat proudly before the assembly in their slightly rumpled princess outfitsA Myanmar woman doctor put earrings in each girls ears and they were free to change out of the fancy but inconvenient clothesFor the girls this was the conclusion of their ceremonyThe head shaving of boys and men followed as already describedAfter their supper the men came into the Dhamma Hall their skulls shining where they were seated on the rugs in rows in age order facing a line of senior sayadawsThey received a bundle of brown robes neatly rolled together and tied with the red cloth belt worn by Myanmar bhikkhusEveryone else sat at the back of the hall meditating and observing the proceedingsThe ceremony which had been explained in advance went on in a combination of Pali Myanmar and EnglishSmall groups of the samanerastobe offered their robes to their preceptor who accepted them then they requested the robes back from him so they could go forth and he returned the robesNow they all changed out of their lay clothes into the robesMost of these men had ordained previously and many had done so several timesBut they were all anxious to have another opportunity to practice the strict purity of a member of the Sangha in Myanmar the land they cherished as the home of the pure Buddha Dhamma which they had been practicing some for over twenty yearsThey each formally requested to be ordained as novices and then took the Ten Precepts from U Pandicca their preceptor and underwent a few other short formalitiesThey were given their bhikkhu names from a list considered appropriate for the day of the week of their birthThere was a short discourse of advice for the samaneras and the sayadaws chanted several paritta suttas for the well being of allWith that the novitiation was completeLater in the evening there was the usual group meditation in the Dhamma Hall with the new samaneras seated at the front in order of seniority which in almost all cases was ageThe boys formed the last row and behind them were laymen two or three from abroad the rest from MyanmarNext came the foreign women who had also come for the two weeks at the Centre about fortyfive of themFilling the back to capacity were Myanmar ladiesThis formal meditation hour was repeated three times a day for the two weeks the foreigners were in YangonThe mens full ordination their entry into the life of bhikkhus took place on Sunday the th of JanuaryThe upasampada had to be in a monastery so with the sponsorship and help of the Myanmar Department of Religious Affairs the ordinations took place at Kaba AyeThis complex had originally been constructed to accommodate thousands of members of the Buddhist Sangha who gathered in Myanmar from all over the world in the mids to recite and purify the Pali canon at the Sixth Great Buddhist CouncilBecause of the large number of people to undergo full ordination at the Kaba Aye ordination hall they were divided into morning and afternoon batchesThe motorcade left IMC right after breakfastThe men and boys had been offered their first meal as samaneras in their dining room at the CentreAfter the food had been placed on the low round tables and the samaneras had all sat on mats on the floor upasakas while bowing gently lifted each laden table up several inches symbolically offering the food to the novices in Myanmar fashionWhen they reached the Kaba Aye sima shoes were left in the buses and the samaneras followed by the laypeople formed a procession from the gatewayThe sima is a large circular structure surmounted by a small golden pagodaThe line was led by five Burmese men dressed in fantastic gilt deva costumes holding ten foot tall white cloth sunshades dangling with small metallic Bodhi leavesThe sayadaws samaneras and lay meditators walked slowly up a red carpet runner on the broad flight of stairs into the simaThe interior is feet in diameter with a truly colossal golden Buddha statue on a nearly fifteen foot high throne at the frontIt is flanked slightly below by statues of the two Chief Disciples the Elders Sariputta and Mahamoggallana paying respects among various devotional objects a tasteful grand scale shrineThe ceiling must be thirty feet high supported on six massive columns decorated with bands of mirror inlayA frieze goes around the perimeter level with the Buddhas throne composed of some hundred bhikkhu statues perhaps half lifesize seated in meditationScreened doors open outside at equal intervals thick carpets cover the floor for the comfort of all low movable decorative section dividers separate the Sangha from householders and men from womenThe foreign women sat behind Mother Sayamagyi at the left and watched the proceedings while the samaneras were seated in the central section of the sima several meters away from and facing their preceptor and other sayadaws participating in the ordination ceremonyLaymen occupied another back sectionWhen everyone had settled in the proper place the ceremony beganIn groups of three starting with the eldest samaneras the foreigners approached the elder monks to seek full ordinationFrom the remote viewpoint of the lay people it was difficult to understand everything that was going on but following details was not essential as they were there to witness the event and share in the making of good kammaThe samaneras could understand as they had been trained beforehandThey were being asked the questions put to prospective bhikkhus ever since the Sangha became fully organized in the Buddhas lifetime about their health their sex whether they were free and not in debt if they were really human beings etcThey replied appropriatelyWhen they had all completed the answers the groups again went up to the theras to request full ordinationWhen they had been accepted into the Order each trio moved to join the Myanmar lifetime bhikkhus seated just to the side of the sayadaws conducting the proceedingsAt times permanent bhikkhus had to bodily manipulate the foreigners into their proper places because they could not communicate through the language barrierThe afternoon proceedings were similar except that a large number of outsiders also came to the sima to participate in the meritorious actions of supporting an ordination and of giving alms to the new monks afterwardsThe atmosphere was quite special generated by the commitment the men were making to the pure Buddha Dhamma and by the intention of everyone in the crowd to create kusala good deeds by participating in the proceedingsThe Deputy Minister for Religious Affairs spent several hours observing the ordinations and the Minister himself came to lead off the offering of dana to the newly ordained monks outside the sima in the late afternoonThe general public too was welcome to participate in these activitiesMany who had just read about it in the newspaper came having bought some small item to donate or put some cash into an envelope to giveAll the International Meditation Centers had their own tables loaded with a particular item to be given to the monksThese had been purchased in Myanmar out of funds donated by members of the centersAlso various associations of the city participated in this dana Yangon University lecturers for example came togetherIn all many hundred laypeople lined the path from the ordination hall to the street standing and waiting in the hot sunshine or patches of shadeInside the building the bhikkhus were grouped by nationality behind labeled placards carried by young menEach monk had a Myanmar layman bearing a tall white sunshade behind him and two of them on each sideThese pairs of upasakas carried large white sacksAs dana items piled up on the monks bowls they carefully placed them in the bags making sure they did not touch the groundAll these male workers wore badges for identificationThe senior sayadaws emerged first and slowly filed through the crowd looking neither right nor left but just before them not acknowledging the laypeople making their donations into the big black lacquer almsbowlsThe feeling in the area switched from anticipation to reverence for the Sangha respect for this institution which protects and follows the Buddhas teachings to the fullAs the newly ordained bhikkhus passed through the line of donors they responded to this awe for the robes they were now honored to wear keenly aware of their obligation to conduct themselves as proper monksOnly in this way would they be worthy of the respect they were being shown not let down their teachers and hosts and not disillusion the laity who were so sincere in their honorThe laypeople slipped off their shoes picked up a packet from the table behind them and with both hands carefully placed it in the bowl of the monk as he passed in front of themThe giving was done systematically rotating through each small cluster so that every lay person had equal chance to earn meritThe almsround right after monks have been ordained is considered sure to bring donors extra meritThe new bhikkhus looked radiantly pure with their shaven heads lowered eyes and restrained demeanorThe final event of this day was held from five to six in the evening in Moguk Hall nearby in the same Kaba Aye complexHere about a thousand lay devotees mostly local sat on the floor while the sayadaws and the junior monks sat on chairs at the front of the room facing themThe golden shrine was behind the bhikkhusThey recited Namo Tassa Bhagavato the Refuges and the Precepts after the head sayadaw of the Kaba Aye monastery and then a libation ceremony of pouring out water was held to symbolize sharing the merits made that dayThis was invisible to most of the lay people but was held in the front of the hall using several sets of silver vesselsA tired happy serenity was felt at IMC afterwards born of the knowledge that so much kusala had been generated by so many people that dayFor the remainder of the week of the ordination course the new bhikkhus stayed at the meditation centreThey lived in their own dormitories at one end of the grounds under the watchful eye of their assistant preceptor the Venerable U Chanda Siri who had also helped in all the earlier ordinations organized by the IMCsThey made good use of their time in robes free of worldly affairs by meditating many hours a day  observing the breath to develop sharp samadhi and then applying the concentrated mind to the sensations rising and vanishing in their bodies to penetrate the anicca  and so dukkha and anatta  nature of mind and body as deeply as they couldAll was done as taught in the tradition of Sayagyi U Ba Khin in strict accordance with the teachings of the BuddhaEvery evening there was a confession also in the hallAs there were so many bhikkhus U Chanda Siri heard the confessions of half of the men and one of the older of the foreigners heard the confessions of the remainderThe bhikkhus got up from their seats on the floor straightened their robes and worked their way to the front of the hall in pairs to recite the short Pali catechism admitting to miscellaneous errors and accepting admonition to try to do better in the futureIn this orderly way it took about twenty minutes to finish all of the monks each eveningSometimes the confession was followed by a short discourse by U Chanda Siri or one of the meditation teachersOne talk was about the dullabhas or states difficult to obtain the most rare of which is being a bhikkhuAnother was an explanation of the origins of the questions the samaneras had to answer before being ordained as full bhikkhusThose had been instituted by the Buddha in response to specific situations which arose just as all the rules for the Sangha had beenFollowing the bhikkhus confession the young samaneras came forward to recite the Refuges Ten Precepts etc after U Chanda SiriHe was very particular that they pronounce each syllable in exactly the correct way and they would repeat difficult words over and over until the result was as perfect as the preceptor wantedThe samaneras had their own bedroom and activities which included daily visits to the Shwe Dagon PagodaThe bhikkhus were fed in a separate upstairs dining hall on choice Myanmar and Chinese vegetarian foodOften some special dish  such as ice cream  had been donated by someonePeople were always looking for more ways to earn merit by helping the bhikkhus and other meditators at the CentreThe Myanmar Buddhists exhibit great generosity cultivating the dana paramiThe offerings the bhikkhus had received at the sima were sorted out by lay people one eveningThe cash was totaled up and donated to certain pagodas and monasteries in Yangon and the monks could take whatever they wanted of the remainderMost of the things actually went out to vicars where lifetime bhikkhus would have more use for them than foreigners returning to lay life in their own countries in a few daysThe week as bhikkhus was interspersed with several eventsOne morning a pindapata was held at IMC itselfMonks from U Pandiccas monastery had come to wrap the temporary monks robes in the complex way modestly covering the neck and both shoulders appropriate for going among the houses The line of donors wound around the pagoda and Dhamma HallThis time most of the items were food since it was before noonThe atmosphere was more like a community event since the Centre was home to all the participantsThe lay people again were dressed in fine Myanmar clothes to honor the bhikkhusOne afternoon Myanmar TV conducted interviews with six of the bhikkhus and two of the foreign laywomen in the Dhamma HallThe questionnaire which had been given to the interviewees was quite serious and the bhikkhus especially had a good opportunity to express their views on the situation of Buddha Dhamma in the West and in Myanmar and about what they had personally gained from practicing this meditationIf the interviews were shown in full some profound Buddha Dhamma would have come over that most unlikely of mediaThe boys took off their robes on Saturday the th the bhikkhus did so precisely a week after the ordinationOn that Sunday afternoon the confession was held early at four and immediately afterwards they agreed aloud that they were prepared to return to lay lifeThey then requested to be regarded as samanerasThey removed the robes and changed back into their lay clothes and then asked to be recognized as laymen again  in both Pali and EnglishFinally U Chanda Siri gave them a discourse as laymen urging them to cooperate in spreading the Buddha Dhamma in their own countries and always to follow the advice of Mother Sayamagyi and their other teachersThe temporary bhikkhus returned to lay life with satisfaction at having done what is so hard to do to be a good Buddhist monkThey were glad to have had even that short chance to know life without the entanglements the dust as the Buddha called it of household affairsSome of them were a bit sorry at its endingMost will probably try to take ordination again in this lifetime to earn still more meritTheir families were joyous to see how they had matured from the experienceEveryone had the assurance that comes from the performance of meritorious deeds dedicated towards purification of mind and the attainment of Nibbana the cessation of all sufferingSusan Elbaum Jootla was born in New York City in and obtained BAand MAdegrees in

contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practiceThese works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first aroseAnapana sati the meditation on inandout breathing is the first subject of meditation expounded by the Buddha in the Mahasatipatthana Sutta the Great Discourse on the Foundations of MindfulnessThe Buddha laid special stress on this meditation for it is the gateway to enlightenment and Nibbana adopted by all the Buddhas of the past as the very basis for their attainment of BuddhahoodWhen the Blessed One sat at the foot of the Bodhi Tree and resolved not to rise until he had reached enlightenment he took up anapana sati as his subject of meditationOn the basis of this he attained the four jhanas recollected his previous lives fathomed the nature of samsara aroused the succession of great insight knowledges and at dawn while world systems trembled he attained the limitless wisdom of a Fully Enlightened BuddhaLet us then offer our veneration to the Blessed One who became a peerless worldtranscending Buddha through this meditation of anapana satiMay we comprehend this subject of meditation fully with wisdom resplendent like the sun and moonThrough its power may we attain the blissful peace of NibbanaLet us first examine the meaning of the text expounded by the Buddha on anapana satiThe text beginsHerein monks a monk who has gone to the forest or to the foot of a tree or to an empty place sits down cross legged holding his back erect arousing mindfulness in front of himThis means that any person belonging to the four types of individuals mentioned in this teaching  namely bhikkhu bhikkhuni upasaka or upasika  desirous of practicing this meditation should go either to a forest to the foot of a secluded tree or to a solitary dwellingThere he should sit down crosslegged and keeping his body in an erect position fix his mindfulness at the tip of his nose the locus for his object of meditationIf he breathes in a long breath he should comprehend this with full awarenessIf he breathes out a long breath he should comprehend this with full awarenessIf he breathes in a short breath he should comprehend this with full awarenessif he breathes out a short breath he should comprehend this with full awarenessHe breathes in experiencing the whole body he breathes out experiencing the whole body that is with wellplaced mindfulness he sees the beginning the middle and the end of the two phases the inbreath and the outbreathAs he practices watching the inbreath and the out breath with mindfulness he calms down and tranquilizes the two functions of in breathing and outbreathingThe Buddha illustrates this with a simileWhen a clever turner or his apprentice works an object on his lathe he attends to his task with fixed attention in making a long turn or a short turn he knows that he is making a long turn or a short turnIn the same manner if the practitioner of meditation breathes in a long breath he comprehends it as such and if he breathes out a long breath he comprehends it as such if he breathes in a short breath he comprehends it as such and if he breathes out a short breath he comprehends it as suchHe exercises his awareness so as to see the beginning the middle and the end of these two functions of breathing in and breathing outHe comprehends with wisdom the calming down of these two aspects of inbreathing and outbreathingIn this way he comprehends the two functions of inbreathing and outbreathing in himself and the two functions of in breathing and outbreathing in other personsHe also comprehends the two functions of inbreathing and outbreathing in himself and in others in rapid alternationHe comprehends as well the cause for the arising of inbreathing and outbreathing and the cause for the cessation of in breathing and outbreathing and the momentbymoment arising and cessation of inbreathing and outbreathingHe then realizes that this body which exercises the two functions of inbreathing and outbreathing is only a body not an ego or I This mindfulness and wisdom become helpful in developing greater and more profound mindfulness and wisdom enabling him to discard the erroneous conceptions of things in terms of I and mine He then becomes skilled in living with wisdom in respect of this body and he does not grasp anything in the world with craving conceit or false viewsLiving unattached the meditator treads the path to Nibbana by contemplating the nature of the bodyThis is an amplified paraphrase of the passage from the Mahasatipatthana Sutta on anapana satiThis meditation has been explained in sixteen different ways in various suttasOf these sixteen the first tetrad has been explained hereBut these four are the foundation for all the sixteen ways in which anapana sati can be practicedNow we should investigate the preliminary stages to practicing this meditationIn the first place the Buddha indicated a suitable dwelling for practicing anapana satiIn the sutta he has mentioned three places the forest the foot of a tree or an isolated empty placeThis last can be a quiet restful hut or a dwelling place free from the presence of peopleWe may even consider a meditation hall an empty placeAlthough there may be a large collection of people in such a hall if every one remains calm and silent it can be considered an empty placeThe Buddha recommended such places because in order to practice anapana sati silence is an essential factorA beginning meditator will find it easier to develop mental concentration with anapana sati only if there is silenceEven if one cannot find complete silence one should choose a quiet place where one will enjoy privacyNext the Buddha explained the sitting postureThere are four postures which can be adopted for meditation standing sitting reclining and walkingOf these the most suitable posture to practice anapana sati at the beginning is the seated postureThe person wishing to practice anapana sati should sit down crossleggedFor bhikkhus and laymen the Buddha has recommended the crosslegged PositionThis is not an easy posture for everyone but it can be gradually masteredThe half crosslegged position has been recommended for bhikkhunis and laywomenThis is the posture of sitting with one leg bentIt would be greatly beneficial if the cross legged posture recommended for bhikkhus and laymen could be adopted in the lotus pattern with the feet turned up and resting on the opposite thighsIf that is inconvenient one should sit with the two feet tucked underneath the bodyIn the practice of anapana sati it is imperative to hold the body uprightThe torso should be kept erect though not strained and rigidOne can cultivate this meditation properly only if all the bones of the spine are linked together in an erect positionTherefore this advice of the Buddha to keep the upper part of the body erect should be clearly comprehended and followedThe hands should be placed gently on the lap the back of the right hand over the palm of the leftThe eyes can be closed softly or left halfclosed whichever is more comfortableThe head should be held straight tilted a slight angle downwards the nose perpendicular to the navelThe next factor is the place for fixing the attentionTo cultivate anapana sati one should be clearly mindful of the place where the incoming and outgoing breaths enter and leave the nostrilsThis will be felt as a spot beneath the nostrils or on the upper lip wherever the impact of the air coming in and out the nostrils can be felt most distinctlyOn that spot the attention should be fixed like a sentry watching a gateThen the Buddha has explained the manner in which anapana sati has to be cultivatedOne breathes in mindfully breathes out mindfullyFrom birth to death this function of inbreathing and outbreathing continues without a break without a stop but since we do not consciously reflect on it we do not even realize the presence of this breathIf we do so we can derive much benefit by way of calm and insightThus the Buddha has advised us to be aware of the function of breathingThe practitioner of meditation who consciously watches the breath in this manner should never try to control his breathing or hold back his breath with effortFor if he controls his breath or holds back his breath with conscious effort he will become fatigued and his mental concentration will be disturbed and brokenThe key to the practice is to set up mindfulness naturally at the spot where the inbreaths and the outbreaths are felt entering and leaving the nostrilsThen the meditator has to maintain his awareness of the touch sensation of the breath keeping the awareness as steady and consistent as possibleTo help practitioners in developing this meditation the commentators and meditation masters have indicated eight graduated steps in the practiceThese eight steps will first be enumerated and then they will be explained in relation to the actual meditative processThe eight steps are named counting following contact fixing observing turning away purification and retrospectionThese eight cover the whole course of meditative development up to the attainment of arahantshipCounting is intended for those who have never before practiced anapana satiIt is not necessary for those who have practiced meditation for a considerable period of timeHowever as it is expedient to have a knowledge of this counting should be understood in the following mannerWhen the meditator sits down for meditation he fixes his attention at the tip of his nose and consciously attends to the sequence of inandout breathingHe notes the breath as it enters and notes the breath as it leaves touching against the tip of the nose or the upper lipAt this time he begins to count these movementsThere are a few methods of countingThe easiest is explained thus The first breath felt is counted as one one the second as two two the third as three three the fourth as four four the fifth as five five and so on up to the tenth breath which is counted as ten ten Then he returns to one one and continues again up to ten ten This is repeated over and over from one to tenThe mere counting is not itself meditation but the counting has become an essential aid to meditationA person who has not practiced meditation before finding it difficult to understand the nature of his mind may think he is meditating while his mind runs helter skelterCounting is an easy method to control the wandering mindIf a person fixes his mind well on his meditation he can maintain this counting correctlyIf the mind flees in all directions and he misses the count he becomes confused and thus can realize that his mind has wandered aboutIf the mind has lost track of the count the meditator should begin the counting over againIn this way he should start the counting again from the beginning even if he has gone wrong a thousand timesAs the practice develops there may come a time when the inbreathing and out breathing take a shorter course and it is not possible to count the same number many timesThen the meditator has to count quickly one two three etcWhen he counts in this manner he can comprehend the difference between a long inbreath and outbreath and a short inbreath and outbreathFollowing means following the breath with the mindWhen the mind has been subdued by counting and is fixed on the inbreathing and outbreathing the counting is stopped and replaced by mentally keeping track of the course of the breathThis is explained by the Buddha in this mannerWhen the meditator breathes in a long breath he comprehends that he is breathing in a long breath and when he is breathing out a long breath he comprehends that he is breathing out a long breathHerein one does not deliberately take a long inbreath or a long outbreathOne simply comprehends what actually takes placeThe Buddha has declared in the next passage that a meditator trains himself thinking I shall breathe in experiencing the whole body and I shall breath out experiencing the whole body Here what is meant as the whole body is the entire cycle of breathing in and breathing outThe meditator should fix his attention so as to see the beginning the middle and the end of each cycle of inbreathing and outbreathingIt is this practice that is called experiencing the whole bodyThe beginning middle and end of the breath must be correctly understoodIt is incorrect to consider the tip of the nose to be the beginning of the breath the chest to be the middle and the navel to be the endIf one attempts to trace the breath from the nose through the chest to the belly or to follow it out from the belly through the chest to the nose ones concentration will be disrupted and ones mind will become agitatedThe beginning of the inbreath properly understood is the start of the inhalation the middle is continued inhalation and the end is the completion of the inhalationLikewise in regard to the out breath the beginning is the start of the exhalation the middle is the continued exhalation and the end is the completion of the exhalationTo experience the whole body means to be aware of the entire cycle of each inhalation and exhalation keeping the mind fixed at the spot around the nostrils or on the upper lip where the breath is felt entering and leaving the noseThis work of contemplating the breath at the area around the nostrils without following it inside and outside the body is illustrated by the commentaries with the similes of the gatekeeper and the sawJust as a gatekeeper examines each person entering and leaving the city only as he passes through the gate without following him inside or outside the city so the meditator should be aware of each breath only as it passes through the nostrils without following it inside or outside the bodyJust as a man sawing a log will keep his attention fixed on the spot where the teeth of the saw cut through the wood without following the movement of the teeth back and forth so the meditator should contemplate the breath as it swings back and forth around the nostrils without letting his mindfulness be distracted by the breaths inward and outward passage through the bodyWhen a person meditates earnestly in this manner seeing the entire process a joyous thrill pervades his mindAnd since the mind does not wander about the whole body becomes calm and composed cool and comfortableThese two aspects of the practice indicate the development of stronger concentrationWhen the mindfulness of breathing is maintained the breathing becomes more and more subtle and tranquilAs a result the body becomes calm and ceases to feel fatiguedBodily pain and numbness disappear and the body begins to feel an exhilarating comfort as if it were being fanned with a cool gentle breezeAt that time because of the tranquillity of the mind the breathing becomes finer and finer until it seems that it has ceasedAt times this condition lasts for many minutesThis is when breathing ceases to be feltAt this time some be come alarmed thinking the breathing has ceased but it is not soThe breathing exists but in a very delicate and subtle formNo matter how subtle the breathing becomes one must still keep mindful of the contact of the breath in the area of the nostrils without losing track of itThe mind then becomes free from the five hindrances  sensual desire anger drowsiness restlessness and doubtAs a result one becomes calm and joyfulIt is at this stage that the signs or mental images appear heralding the success of concentrationFirst comes the learning sign then the counterpart signTo some the sign appears like a wad of cotton like an electric light a sliver chain a mist or a wheelIt appeared to the Buddha like the clear and bright midday sunThe learning sign is unsteady it moves here and there up and downBut the counterpart sign appearing at the end of the nostrils is steady fixed and motionlessAt this time there are no hindrances the mind is most active and extremely tranquilThis stage is expounded by the Buddha when he states that one breathes in tranquilizing the activity of the body one breathes out tranquilizing the activity of the bodyThe arising of the counterpart sign and the suppression of the five hindrances marks the attainment of access concentrationAs concentration is further developed the meditator attains full absorption beginning with the first jhanaFour stages of absorption can be attained by the practice of anapana sati namely the first second third and fourth jhanasThese stages of deep concentration are called fixingA person who has reached jhana should not stop there but should go on to develop insight meditationThe stages of insight are called observingWhen insight reaches its climax the meditator attains the supramundane paths starting with the stage of streamentryBecause these paths turn away the fetters that bind one to the cycle of birth and death they are called turning awayThe paths are followed by their respective fruitions this stage is called purification because one has been cleansed of defilementsThereafter one realizes the final stage reviewing knowledge called retrospection because one looks back upon ones entire path of progress and ones attainmentsThis is a brief overview of the main stages along the path to Nibbana based on the meditation of anapana satiNow let us examine the course of practice in terms of the seven stages of purificationThe person who has taken up the practice begins by establishing himself in a fitting moral codeIf he is a layman he first establishes himself in the five precepts or the ten preceptsIf he is a bhikkhu he begins his meditation while scrupulously maintaining the moral code prescribed for himThe unbroken observance of his respective moral code constitutes purification of moralityNext he applies himself to his topic of meditation and as a result the hindrances become subjugated and the mind becomes fixed in concentrationThis is purification of mind  the mind in which the hindrances have been fully suppressed  and this includes both access concentration and the four jhanasWhen the meditator becomes well established in concentration he next turns his attention to insight meditationTo develop insight on the basis of anapana sati the meditator first considers that this process of inandout breathing is only form a series of bodily events  not a self or egoThe mental factors that contemplate the breathing are in turn only mind a series of mental events  not a self or egoThis discrimination of mind and matter is called purification of viewOne who has reached this stage comprehends the process of inandout breathing by way of the conditions for the arising and cessation of the bodily and mental phenomena involved in the process of breathingThis knowledge which becomes extended to all bodily and mental phenomena in terms of their dependent arising is called the comprehension of conditionsAs his understanding matures all doubts conceived by him in respect of past future and present times are dispelledThus this stage is called purification by the transcending of doubtAfter having understood the causal relations of mind and matter the meditator proceeds further with insight meditation and in time there arises the wisdom seeing the rise and fall of things When he breathes in and out he sees the bodily and mental states pass in and out of existence moment after momentAs this wisdom becomes clearer the mind becomes illumined and happiness and tranquillity arise along with faith vigor mindfulness wisdom and equanimityWhen these factors appear he reflects on them observing their three characteristics of impermanence suffering and egolessnessThe wisdom that distinguishes between the exhilarating results of the practice and the task of detached contemplation is called purification by knowledge and vision of the true path and the false path His mind so purified sees very clearly the rise and cessation of mind and matterHe sees next with each inbreath and outbreath the breaking up of the concomitant mental and bodily phenomena which appears just like the bursting of the bubbles seen in a pot of boiling rice or like the breaking up of bubbles when rain falls on a pool of water or like the cracking of sesamum or mustard seeds as they are put into a redhot panThis wisdom which sees the constant and instantaneous breaking up of mental and bodily phenomena is called the knowledge of dissolution Through this wisdom he acquires the ability to see how all factors of mind and body throughout the world arise and disappearThen there arises in him the wisdom that sees all of these phenomena as a fearsome spectacleHe sees that in none of the spheres of existence not even in the heavenly planes is there any genuine pleasure or happiness and he comprehends misfortune and dangerThen he conceives a revulsion towards all conditioned existenceHe arouses an urge to free himself from the world an all consuming desire for deliveranceThen by considering the means of releasing himself there arises in him a state of wisdom which quickly reflects on impermanence suffering and egolessness and leads to subtle and deep levels of insightNow there appears in him the comprehension that the aggregates of mind and body appearing in all the world systems are afflicted by suffering and he realizes that the state of Nibbana which transcends the world is exceedingly peaceful and comfortingWhen he comprehends this situation his mind attains the knowledge of equanimity about formationsThis is the climax of insight meditation called purification by knowledge and vision of progressAs he becomes steadfast his dexterity in meditation increases and when his faculties are fully mature he enters upon the cognitive process of the path of streamentryWith the path of streamentry he realizes Nibbana and comprehends directly the Four Noble TruthsThe path is followed by two or three moments of the fruit of streamentry by which he enjoys the fruits of his attainmentThereafter there arises reviewing knowledge by which he reflects on his progress and attainmentIf one continues with the meditation with earnest aspiration one will develop anew the stages of insight knowledge and realize the three higher paths and fruits those of the oncereturner nonreturner and arahantThese attainments together with streamentry form the seventh stage of purity purification by knowledge and visionWith each of these attainments one realizes in full the Four Noble Truths which had eluded one throughout ones long sojourn in the cycle of rebirthsAs a result all the defilements contained within the mind are uprooted and destroyed and ones mind becomes fully pure and cleansedOne then realizes the state of Nibbana wherein one is liberated from all the suffering of birth aging and death sorrow lamentation pain grief and despairBirths like ours are rare in samsaraWe have been fortunate to encounter the Buddhas message to enjoy the association of good friends to have the opportunity to listen to the DhammaAs we have been endowed with all these blessings if our aspirations are ripe we can in this very life reach the final goal of Nibbana through its graduated stages of streamentry oncereturner nonreturner and arahantshipTherefore let us make our life fruitful by developing regularly the meditation of anapana satiHaving received proper instructions on how to practice this method of meditation one should purify ones moral virtue by observing the precepts and should surrender ones life to the Triple GemOne should choose a convenient time for meditation and practice with utmost regularity reserving the same period each day for ones practiceOne may begin by briefly reflecting on the abundant virtues of the Buddha extending lovingkindness towards all beings pondering the repulsiveness of the body and considering the inevitability of deathThen arousing the confidence that one is walking the very road to Nibbana walked by all the enlightened ones of the past one should proceed forth on the path of meditation and strive with diligent effortThe Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creedsFounded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topicsIts publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddhas discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practiceThese works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first aroseIn November David Craig head of Religious Broadcasting for the World Service of the BBC and RevMartin Forward Interfaith Officer for the Methodist Church in Britain visited Sri Lanka to gather material on Buddhism for a series of programs to be broadcast in during a focus on South AsiaI helped to plan their program and was also asked to prepare a few talks for the World Services daily Words of Faith spot  a four minute prerecorded broadcast sent out three times each dayFour talks resulted broadcast in April and MayTowards the end of I was asked for more and six went out in April and MayOf these ten talks eight have been selected for the present Bodhi Leaf four from the series and the four from the seriesThe themes of the talks are rooted in my journey as a Christian into BuddhismIn the mids I felt the need to let go of my own religious conditioning to enter the world of another faithIt grew from a conviction that people with an interest in religion should not remain imprisoned within one framework but should explore othersThe choice of Buddhism and Sri Lanka was a natural one for meBuddhisms emphasis on meditation and nonviolence touched my own interests as a Christian and a visit to Sri Lanka in had left me with the feeling that my link with the island was not finishedI originally intended to be in Sri Lanka for one yearOne year however became seven and a half from untilMy aim throughout was not only to study Buddhism but to practice itI did not consider myself involved in interfaith dialogue although Im sure some perceived my actions in this wayI wanted to enter Buddhism on its own terms as a human being rather than as a ChristianThe subjects of all the talks printed here arise from the personal journey of discovery that resultedThey draw on conversations with Buddhist friends travel to different parts of the country in times of war the experience of meditation and my reading of the Pali textsMost importantly they reflect the concerns which developed as the interests I brought from Britain encountered Buddhism and Sri Lanka the relationship between nonattachment and outgoing compassionate action the practical meaning of anatta and its implications the benefit of sati for the individual and society the resources Buddhism can offer to those working for social justice and interethnic or interreligious harmony the question of a womans role in societyMy journey into Buddhism was not always an easy one and of course I could not let go of my Christian conditioning completely but it has brought me to a stage when I can say with utter sincerity that I revere the Buddha and take refuge in his teachingsI remain a Christian one who seeks to follow the selfsacrificial path of Jesus of Nazareth but I also feel at home in a Buddhist meditation centerThe talks I hope will show that this is possibleI dedicate them to all the Sri Lankan friends who have brought me to a deeper understanding of the heart of BuddhismOnce I told an academic in Sri Lanka that I practiced a Buddhist form of meditationFlippantly he asked whether I was able to levitateThats not an uncommon reactionIt confuses meditation with selfinduced trance or making the mind a blank something that is unrelated to everyday lifeBut to make such a confusion is a mistakeTrue Buddhist meditation is a vigorous form of mindtraining which can transform both thought and actionIn the Theravada Buddhist tradition found in Burma Sri Lanka and Thailand the practice of mindfulness or bare attention is very importantWhen sitting in meditation perhaps noting the breath as it touches the inside of the nostrils thoughts inevitably enter the mindUsually they relate to oneself in the past or the futureRecent conversations replay themselvesDecisions yet to be made thrust themselves forwardReactions of dislike to bodily pains ariseAnd occasionally images freed from a deeper level of our being move slowly upwardsWhen thoughts and feelings arise in meditation they are to be simply observedThey are not to be repressed or pushed aside but neither are they to be allowed complete freedom to proliferateTheir arising and passing is noted without censure or praiseWhen I first began to meditate I discovered that thoughts and feelings are fluid ever changing often uncontrollable frequently illogical and irrationalIt was a painful realization since I had assumed my mind was under my direct controlBut it was also the beginning of selfknowledge the beginning of knowing how my mind worked and the doorway to modifying conditioned and negative patterns of reaction in my own lifeAt one meditation center in Sri Lanka high in the mountains surrounded by tea estates the first session begins at five in the morningI had to get up by candlelight pull on warm clothes and cross the grass to the meditation hall under a sky often brilliantly full of starsOne morning I was gazing at the dark silvered beauty of the sky when I heard steps below meAt that moment I caught my mind saying Go on into the meditation hall so that they can see you were up first Normally I would have hurried into the hall to show my punctuality but on that occasion I noted the thought recognized the element of competition and consciously refused to act on itI stayed for several more moments rapt in the predawn stillness feeling the cool air against my skin and I was certainly not the first to settle my cushions before the silent candlelit image of the BuddhaAnd I know it was the practice of sati of mindfulness which made that moment of insight into my own competitive egotism possible insight into a childish wish to impress to be top of the classMeditation of this kind is hard workIt has nothing to do with making the mind a blank though it can lead to peace and calm when the racing mind stills and there is only the present momentOne monk who taught me put it this way Meditation is the ultimate practice of nonviolenceSuffering pain and feelings of anger are not suppressed but faced confronted and transformedIn one sermon of the Majjhima Nikaya one of the five sections within the collection of sermons in the Pali canon the Buddha says to his disciplesMonks as lowdown thieves might carve you limb from limb with a doublehanded saw yet even then whoever sets his mind at enmity he for this reason is not a doer of my teachingThis is how you must train yourselves neither will my mind become perverted nor will I utter an evil speech but kindly and compassionate will I dwell with a mind of friendliness and devoid of hatredThe vividness of this picture has always moved me  a thief hacking off my arms and legs with a sawAnd it isnt that farfetchedWar involves such butcheryThe denial of human rights under totalitarian regimes produces similar horror and so does the obsessional urge of a multiple murdererFear terror or violent retaliation in selfprotection would seem the natural reactions to such an attack the reaction programmed into our bodiesYet the challenge of Buddhism here is do not retaliate do not hate show compassion to all people even if they are about to kill youIt is a challenge which reaches out from other religions alsoJesus of Palestine suffering the agony of being nailed through his flesh to rough wooden posts forgave his killers and felt compassion for them in their blindnessBut does this imply that Buddhism advocates that we should never protect ourselves or others from violence that we should submit to whatever exploitation we are subjected to that in the face of evil forces we should remain passiveTo answer yes is to misread Buddhism and all true religionBuddhism does not support passivity in the face of violence and evilRather it encourages a mental attitude which can face and oppose violence without fear or hatredNowhere in the Buddhist texts is it suggested that we should remain inactive when others are sufferingNowhere does it say we should refrain from action if someone is murdering our son daughter neighbor or colleague in front of our eyesIn such situations suffering must be relieved violence must be denounced selfsacrifice might even be demanded though the Buddhist texts also warn that to meet violence with violence brings a spiral of further violenceWhat the Buddhist texts do say is that to hate to feel anger towards the doer of violence is selfdefeatingIt harms the hater more than the hatedIn the ancient Buddhist texts we come across many stories of nonhatred deflecting violence and making it powerlessOne woman because she refuses to feel hatred is unharmed when burning oil is poured over her by a jealous cowifeAnd when a monk dies of snakebite the Buddha says he would not have died if he had radiated loving kindness to the world of snakesThis might seem utopian in a world shot through with violenceThe skeptic could point to the deaths of Gandhi in India Oscar Romero in El Salvador and Michael Rodrigo in Sri Lanka to show that the most compassionate of beings have been unable to escape violent deaths caused by the greed and hatred of othersBut the force of these religious teachings will remainViolence is not overcome by violenceHatred is not defeated by hatredOur lives are not made more secure by wishing to protect themTo face death without hatred or fear even towards our killers is the path of sainthoodThese are eternal truthsA professor of Theravada Buddhism once asked me Why is it assumed at all the interfaith gatherings I attend that God is the uniting factor among the religionsWe should be concentrating on humanity rather than divinityWhen it is taken for granted that all people of faith worship a Supreme Creator and Sustainer God Buddhists and Jains are excludedAlthough Buddhists believe that there are gods living in heavens they do not ascribe creative power to them nor do they believe that these gods have any influence over ultimate human liberationBelief in God cannot therefore provide common ground between Buddhists and religions such as Christianity Islam and JudaismBut can common ground be found in what religions say about humanity or about how we can work for a humane societyI believe the answer is yes Buddhism speaks of four brahmaviharas or divine abidings and these qualities permeate the whole of Buddhist teachingThey are metta  loving kindness karuna  compassion mudita  sympathetic joy and upekkha  equanimityMetta is boundless loving kindness radiated to all beings  to friends and enemies the known and the unknown the lovely and the unlovelyIt is an actionchanging mental orientationKaruna is seen where people are so sensitive to the sufferings of others that they cannot rest until they act to relieve that sufferingTo a greater degree than metta karuna involves actionMudita is a quality which challenges me greatlyTo show mudita is to show joy in the success of others to be free from jealousy or bitterness to celebrate happiness and achievement in others even when we are facing tragedy ourselvesAs for upekkha equanimity this has often been misunderstood as indifference as apathy in the face of human pain the very antithesis of compassionBut upekkha is really freedom from the selfcenteredness which clouds understanding and destroys true discernmentPeople with upekkha are not pulled this way and that by emotional reactions that have more to do with the ego than with true concern for othersThey can see right from wrong and can act with wisdomThe brahmaviharas speak to me of the ideals that should direct our lives  the ideals that can create the kind of society any truly religious person yearns forSuch a society would be one where loving kindness and compassion triumph over greed where the success of one person does not mean the demeaning or exploitation of others where rulers are guided by clear principles of right and wrong rather than hunger for praise or powerThese divine abidings give a picture of the truly goodThey touch the hope of all religions and can bring unity of purpose independent of a concept of GodSo let compassion for the good of humanity be at the forefront of religious encountersMay those who come from the monotheistic traditions discover that they can share their hopes for a righteous society with their Buddhist neighborsMay Buddhists find themselves united with their Jewish Christian and Muslim friends in working for a world where loving kindness takes the place of greedIn May I traveled from wartorn Jaffna in northern Sri Lanka to the SouthIt was at Vesak the time when Buddhists celebrate three major events in the life of their Master his birth his awakening into Buddhahood and his passing away into final NibbanaIt was like moving from one world into anotherIn the North the tension was palpable  towns gutted by fighting vast stretches of empty roads people with hardship in their eyesBut as we crossed over into the South there was celebrationGroups of boys flagged down our car to thrust fruit drinks into our handsLanterns of wire and colored paper hung in porches with their streamers flowing in the breezeAnd nearer Colombo came the first of the pandals  massive temporary structures by the road brilliantly lit telling in pictures Buddhist stories of how selfsacrifice triumphs over violence how compassion vanquishes hatredVesak is the most important religious festival of the Buddhist yearIt is marked by light pilgrimage and the retelling of storiesAt its heart is remembrance of the Buddhas solitary striving in meditation under a tree near Gaya in India years agoThe serene face of the Buddha image can give the impression that this striving led to an experience of the metaphysicalBut Prince Siddhattha became the Buddha not because he was lifted beyond the world but because he saw the real nature of the worldIt had been his sensitivity to human suffering that had made him leave his wife and son years beforeHe had wanted an answer to the question WhyWhy was life shot through with the pain of illness bereavement and unrealized longingsAt Bodhgaya he found itHe saw that humans were bound to anguishfilled lives because their interpretation of the world was wrongHe saw that our fault was to believe that our lives our possessions and our hopes are centered around an unchanging self which has to be protected and promotedHe saw that only suffering was the result fuelled by the greeds and hatreds flowing from selfish cravingAll formations are impermanent is what the Buddha understoodSelfcentered clinging he realized was the fruit of delusionWith this came liberationThe prison of selfhood evaporatedRaga and dosa greed and hatred were destroyedBoundless compassion was released and he could teach the world that suffering has a cause and can be eradicatedAt Vesak Buddhists celebrate this knowledge that suffering can be ended that within the pain of life there is hopeIn and today in that celebration takes place against the backdrop of war in Sri Lanka and elsewhere  war caused by interlocking structures of injustice rooted in human greed and human illusion throwing the innocent before the barrel of a gun or under the rubble of a shelled buildingMy hope is that the Buddhas message will not only be heard but acted uponAll war and conflict can be traced back to some form of craving or delusionIt may be craving for power or domination by an individual or group or the delusion which flows from distorted history or mythVesak should call us to analyze the causes of our bloodletting to see where craving and greed cloud objectivity and prevent peaceThe story goes that the Buddha was at first loathe to share with others what he had learned because so few would understand its hard but liberating messageOur fortune is that he did share itThe health of our world depends on whether we act on that messageSri Pada in Sri Lanka is over feet high and has been a place of pilgrimage for centuriesAt the summit is a huge footprint claimed variously to be that of the Buddha Adam and Lord ShivaFrom December to May is the pilgrimage seasonEach night during this season thousands of devotees climb up an illuminated lengthy ascent of stepsFrom a distance the dark shape seems to have a diamond necklace thrown down its sideSometimes the crowd is so large that pilgrims have to pause at each step they climbThe pressure on the leg muscles is incredibleAn elderly Buddhist friend of mine climbed on such a nightShe told me that the only way she could force her legs through the ordeal was to say of the pain This is not mine this is not meShe says the same in her meditation practice and I have learned to do so tooWhen sitting in absolute stillness irritations come mosquitoes bite pain from the knees shoots up the strong urge to relieve itchy skin arisesBut it is possible to conquer the wish to move or scratch by seeing the pain simply as pain and not as belonging to an I The pain becomes an object for meditationIt becomes a process that can be observedThis snaps the thread of our usual response to irritation which is to claim it as ours and to seek to be rid of itAnd it can also train the mind to detect and halt negative reactions to other forms of attack on our persons in everyday lifeAll this touches on anatta the Buddhist concept of noself or nosoulAnatta was seized on by nineteenth century Christian missionaries to Sri Lanka as something which proved Buddhism was absolutely nihilisticFor instance RevThomas Moscrop a Methodist missionary claimed in that Buddhism is too pessimistic too cold too antagonistic to the constitution of human nature to take the world captiveBut I have not found nihilism in what Buddhists have said to me about anattaSome years ago one friend said If there is no belief in self there is no worry there is no reason to become angry or hurt To her the idea was liberatingIt was freedom from being tied to selfpromotion and selfprotectionI can remember how deeply her words challenged meThey helped me to see that Buddhism and Christianity are not in opposition hereThe frameworks are different but the practical path towards human liberation touches bothBoth religions speak about a wrong concept of the selfBuddhism says Dont think you are fixed unchangingYou are forever flowing shifting interconnected with the whole cosmosFree yourself from clinging to the idea that you are separate and have to fight against the world to keep your identity intactChristianity also has something radical to sayThe Methodists a Christian denomination which arose in eighteenth century England have a Covenant Service on the first Sunday of each new year in which they pledge obedience to GodAt one point they say I am no longer my own but thine Saint Paul in his letters to new churches speaks of having lost his old selfTo the Christians of Colossae in Greece he says For you have died and your life is hid with Christ in GodAll of these sayings point to a death of the egotistical self and a loss of selfsufficiency and selfworshipBoth Buddhism and Christianity say that the self which insists on its separateness from the rest of life is doomedBuddhism says that such a self has no objective existence as an unchanging entityChristianity says the self has to die to give way to a higher power of loveBoth point to the liberation that comes when we transcend care for self when we refuse to exert protective ownership over our lives and personsI have certainly found that if we do not cling to pain hurt and fear as ours but accept them as part of the changing flux of existence if we do not seek to protect our identity and safety at all costs we will be able to climb more than Adams PeakWe are liberated into a new way of seeing and a new openness to the everchanging process of existenceA Christian missionary in Sri Lanka once said to me with great sincerity The Buddha image speaks to me of coldness of noninvolvement of a turning away from lifeI prefer the image of Jesus Christ with his robes dirty with the sweat of the poorOne stereotype of Buddhism is that it supports a withdrawal from the suffering of the world a renunciation of active involvement with societyAn interreligious conference I attended a few years ago stays in my mind because one of the western participants insisted that outwardmoving compassion was not an important part of BuddhismMy encounter with Buddhism forces me to challenge this stereotypeI did so at that conference and I continue to do soIt is outsiders  European observers and those seeking an escape from the world  who have projected onto Buddhism the encouragement of indifference to the agony within human lifeIt does not rise from withinBuddhism certainly speaks of destruction renunciation and detachment but it is detachment from all those things which prevent compassion from flowing  from possessiveness competitiveness and selfishnessViraga one of the Pali words translated as detachment actually means without raga  without lust without possessive craving  not without concern for our worldWhen I told a Buddhist monk here in Sri Lanka of my experience at that interreligious conference he simply said Without compassion there can be no Buddhism And that compassion is an active oneBuddhaghosa the great fifth century commentator who came from India to work in Sri Lanka gives several meanings to the Buddhist concept of compassionHe writes When there is suffering in others it causes good peoples hearts to be moved thus it is compassionOr alternatively it combats others suffering and demolishes it thus it is compassionOr alternatively it is scattered upon those who suffer or extended to them by pervasion thus it is compassionTo extend compassion to others in meditation is certainly part of Buddhist practice but so too is the effort to combat and demolish sufferingTo combat suffering involves more than refraining from doing harmIt implies action to liberate others both from social forces which dehumanize and from imprisoning thought patterns which hinder wholeness and the living of a religious lifeSuch action is seen in the life of the Buddha and in the lives of all truly enlightened onesFor me the picture of Jesus Christ with his clothes marked with the suffering of the poor and the image of the Buddha do not contradict one anotherThey are not in conflict or competitionCompassion unites themJesus stretched his hands out to the poor and those despised in his society taking into himself the worlds evilThe Buddha out of compassion for humans caught in the pain and suffering of existence left his wife and son to seek a path of liberation for allIn Polonnaruwa one of the ancient now ruined capitals of Sri Lanka there is a rock temple the Gal Vihara where three massive images are formed out of the stoneTwo are of the BuddhaPeace seems to radiate from them and has done so for over yearsYet it is not the peace of indifference or apathyIt is the peace of wisdom and compassion which arises when the heartrending nature of human violence and human greed is fully realizedIt is not an anguished twisted scream of torture at the nature of the worlds inhumanity but a silent gentle embodiment in stone of empathy compassion and strengthIn front of these very images Thomas Merton an American Christian monk of this century whose religious journey brought him very close to Buddhism was urged to write The rock all matter is charged with dharmakaya everything is emptiness and everything is compassionThe Buddha image speaks to me therefore both of the wisdom which sees into the causes of human suffering and also of the compassion which lies at the very heart of true enlightenmentAnd it stirs me to try to do something to demolish some of the pain of our worldAmong such humans brethren there will arise a sword period of seven days during which they will look on each other as wild beasts sharp swords will appear ready to their hands and they thinking This is a wild beast will with their swords deprive each other of lifeThese words from the Pali canon come towards the end of the Cakkavatti Sihanada Sutta of the Digha NikayaHere the Buddha describes the process whereby a society slides into a state of absolute anarchy and violence reaching the point where all respect for the preciousness of human life is lost and humans kill each other without guilt or remorseStealing appears first then murder false speech and sexual promiscuity followReligion is undermined respect for elders disintegrates human life loses its worthIt is a horrifying picture of growing bestiality that is as relevant today as it was when first spokenWhen I first met Buddhism an important question for me was what Buddhism had to say about the problems of violence and injustice problems which affect every nationThe classic formula at the heart of Buddhism is that it is tanha craving which lies at the root of the worlds miseryOften this is seen in a very individualistic wayThe Buddhist path is held up as an escape route from suffering through withdrawal from society and through mental cultureI do not downplay this emphasisThe importance of mindtraining was central to the Buddhas teachingIt holds the key to the liberating insight that can transform human lifeYet I have found that individual psychological factors are not the only ones emphasized in the Buddhist textsThe texts do give pictures for anyone concerned with justice and harmony within the body of societyIn the text I started with the chain of causality which results in bestiality goes back to the State the king who forgets one of the duties ascribed to a just ruler in BuddhismIt is this And whosoever in thy kingdom is poor to him let wealth be given By overlooking this the king denied the poor a living and from this  a refusal to create economic justice  flows stealing murder lying immorality and bestialityWhat I find interesting is that the accusing finger is pointed at the structures of power and not at evil qualities in the ordinary peopleAnd the message is violence and social breakdown are inevitable if people are denied the means to live with dignityTo use a Christian term the poor in the myth are sinned against by their rulerThey are victims of structural injustice and their urge to survive corrupts the whole fabric of societyThe story within the Cakkavatti Sihanada Sutta however does not end with the sword periodWhen the depths of brutality have been reached there are some who see the enormity of their fall from humane valuesThey go into retreat  into caves jungle dens and caverned tree trunks  and emerge to embrace one another and to restore harmony through the recovery of moral senseA deterioration from the state downwards is transformed into a regeneration from the bottom upwards through the will and discernment of the people themselvesThe message of this sutta challenges all those who see religion purely in individualistic termsIt demonstrates Buddhisms very real concern for social justice and also the stress it places on analyzing the root causes of disharmony and violenceIt presents society as a net of interacting interdependent beings who are helped or hindered from living wholesome lives by the forces which flow from the state or world structuresIn Sri Lanka I have met groups seeking to find elements in Buddhism relevant to social issuesThis mythological story is one of themIt can be a resource to all of usIt urges us to look at the society in which we live critically and to ask Is there a deterioration of human values If so we must ask further Does our society create the conditions in which each person can live with dignity If it does not then Buddhism encourages not only a path of individual mental culture but also the kind of social involvement which recognizes the ability of ordinary people to change their situation and which seeks to struggle for a more just world where none is denied resources to liveKataragama is a place of pilgrimage in the south of Sri Lanka holy to both Buddhists and HindusIn I went to their annual festivalOn the final night as elephants drummers and dancers were slowly and gracefully moving along the path between the shrine to Lord Kataragama and the Kiri Vehera the Buddhist temple with its milkwhite dagoba two powerful grenades were lobbed into the crowd made up mainly of poor villagers but containing one political dignitaryAbout fifteen people were killed and many more were injured especially in the rush to escape the sacred areaIt was the time when the JVP the Peoples Liberation Front was attempting to seize political power through the gun and the death threatAt Kataragama religious devotion was shattered by blood in a pattern not unfamiliar in Sri LankaBoth Hindus and Muslims have also been attacked when worshippingPolitical concerns and religion have touchedIn this context the interreligious encounter that I began in as a student of Buddhism in Sri Lanka also became a journey into suffering and painful political reality which included the violent death of friends and sharing the fear of those who were threatenedAn important question for me at this time was how to cope with the suffering around me without being destroyed how to empathize with others and deal with my own fear for the safety of dear onesIn any situation of violence or war there is a choice to be made  to become vulnerable to the pain involved or to raise defenses against it in a refusal to recognize its existenceMany raise defenses because such a path seems easierFor to become vulnerable is to let go of control  the control we place on our feelings when we repress them or fight themAnd such a loss can be frighteningI found myself choosing vulnerability in Sri LankaI chose to look violence in the faceI chose to see its horror and to recognize the fear and pain it brings rather than to push these things from my consciousnessThe experience would not have been bearable if not for an encounter with compassionFor it was when I became aware in my whole being rather than only at the level of the intellect that what I was feeling was the pain of a nation a world rather than simply my own pain that I was able to cope with itIt was the realization of interconnectedness  that we are woven one with another  an insight central to BuddhismI saw that there is a common core of suffering in life which links us together so that to become vulnerable is inevitably to become aware not only of ones own pain but also of that of othersWhen I had reached this point of insight compassion came like a gift and I learned that it could destroy bitterness and paralysisBehind pain lies compassion  compassion for all beings caught up in the violence of existenceIt was at this time that I wrote the following words disturbed by the number of people who seemed undisturbed by the fact that Sri Lanka had become a killing fieldI feel we must open ourselves upWe must recognize the suffering which lies at the heart of existence and then let compassion arise and strengthen us to struggle against all that dehumanizesThe Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creedsFounded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topicsIts publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddhas discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practiceThese works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first aroseNow determine in your mind to listen with respect to the DhammaDuring the time that I am speaking be as attentive to my words as if it was the Lord Buddha himself sitting in front of youClose your eyes and make yourself comfortable compose your mind and make it onepointedHumbly allow the Triple Gem of wisdom truth and purity to abide in your heart as a way of showing respect to the Fully Enlightened OneToday I have brought nothing material of any substance to offer you only Dhamma the teachings of the Lord BuddhaListen wellYou should understand that even the Buddha himself with his great store of accumulated virtue could not avoid physical deathWhen he reached old age he relinquished his body and let go of its heavy burdenNow you too must learn to be satisfied with the many years youve already depended on your bodyYou should feel that its enoughYou can compare it to household utensils youve had for a long time  your cups saucers plates and so onWhen you first had them they were clean and shining but now after using them for so long theyre starting to wear outSome are already broken some have disappeared and those that are left are deteriorating they have no stable form and its their nature to be like thatYour body is the same way  its been continually changing right from the day you were born through childhood and youth until now its reached old ageYou must accept thatThe Buddha said that conditions whether they are internal conditions bodily conditions or external conditions are notself their nature is to changeContemplate this truth until you see it clearlyThis very lump of flesh that lies here in decline is saccadhamma the truthThe truth of this body is saccadhamma and it is the unchanging teaching of the BuddhaThe Buddha taught us to look at the body to contemplate it and come to terms with its natureWe must be able to be at peace with the body whatever state it is inThe Buddha taught that we should ensure that its only the body that is locked up in jail and not let the mind be imprisoned along with itNow as your body begins to run down and deteriorate with age dont resist that but dont let your mind deteriorate with itKeep the mind separateGive energy to the mind by realizing the truth of the way things areThe Lord Buddha taught that this is the nature of the body it cant be any other way having been born it gets old and sick and then it diesThis is a great truth you are presently encounteringLook at the body with wisdom and realize itEven if your house is flooded or burnt to the ground whatever the danger that threatens it let it concern only the houseIf theres a flood dont let it flood your mindIf theres a fire dont let it burn your heartLet it be merely the house that which is external to you that is flooded and burntAllow the mind to let go of its attachmentsThe time is ripeYouve been alive a long timeYour eyes have seen any number of forms and colors your ears have heard so many sounds youve had any number of experiencesAnd thats all they were  just experiencesYouve eaten delicious foods and all the good tastes were just good tastes nothing moreThe unpleasant tastes were just unpleasant tastes thats allIf the eye sees a beautiful form thats all it is just a beautiful formAn ugly form is just an ugly formThe ear hears an entrancing melodious sound and its nothing more than thatA grating disharmonious sound is simply soThe Buddha said that rich or poor young or old human or animal no being in this world can maintain itself in any one state for long everything experiences change and estrangementThis is a fact of life that we can do nothing to remedyBut the Buddha said that what we can do is to contemplate the body and mind so as to see their impersonality see that neither of them is me or mine They have a merely provisional realityIts like this house its only nominally yours you couldnt take it with you anywhereIts the same with your wealth your possessions and your family  theyre all yours only in name they dont really belong to you they belong to natureNow this truth doesnt apply to you alone everyone is in the same position even the Lord Buddha and his enlightened disciplesThey differed from us in only one respect and that was in their acceptance of the way things are they saw that it could be no other waySo the Buddha taught us to scan and examine this body from the soles of the feet up to the crown of the head and then back down to the feet againJust take a look at the bodyWhat sort of things do you seeIs there anything intrinsically clean thereCan you find any abiding essenceThis whole body is steadily degenerating and the Buddha taught us to see that it doesnt belong to usIts natural for the body to be this way because all conditioned phenomena are subject to changeHow else would you have it beActually theres nothing wrong with the way the body isIts not the body that causes you suffering its your wrong thinkingWhen you see the right wrongly theres bound to be confusionIts like the water of a riverIt naturally flows down the gradient it never flows against it thats its natureIf a person were to go and stand on a river bank and seeing the water flowing swiftly down its course foolishly want it to flow back up the gradient he would sufferWhatever he was doing his wrong thinking would allow him no peace of mindHe would be unhappy because of his wrong view thinking against the streamIf he had right view he would see that the water must inevitably flow down the gradient and until he realized and accepted that fact the person would be agitated and upsetThe river that must flow down the gradient is like your bodyHaving been young your body has become old and now its meandering towards its deathDont go wishing it was otherwise its not something you have the power to remedyThe Buddha told us to see the way things are and then let go of our clinging to themTake this feeling of letting go as your refugeKeep meditating even if you feel tired and exhaustedLet your mind dwell with the breathTake a few deep breaths and then establish the mind on the breath using the mantra Buddho Make this practice habitualThe more exhausted you feel the more subtle and focused your concentration must be so that you can cope with the painful sensations that ariseWhen you start to feel fatigued then bring all your thinking to a halt let the mind gather itself together and then turn to knowing the breathJust keep up the inner recitation Buddho BuddhoLet go of all externalsDont go grasping at thoughts of your children and relatives dont grasp at anything whatsoeverLet goLet the mind unite in a single point and let that composed mind dwell with the breathLet the breath be its sole object of knowledgeConcentrate until the mind becomes increasingly subtle until feelings are insignificant and there is great inner clarity and wakefulnessThen when painful sensations arise they will gradually cease of their own accordFinally youll look on the breath as if it was a relative come to visit youWhen a relative leaves we follow him out and see him offWe watch until hes walked or driven out of sight and then we go back indoorsWe watch the breath in the same wayIf the breath is coarse we know that its coarse if its subtle we know that its subtleAs it becomes increasingly fine we keep following it while simultaneously awakening the mindEventually the breath disappears altogether and all that remains is the feeling of wakefulnessThis is called meeting the BuddhaWe have that clear wakefulness that is called Buddho the one who knows the one who is awake the radiant oneIt is meeting and dwelling with the Buddha with knowledge and clarityFor it was only the historical fleshandblood Buddha that entered parinibbana the true Buddha the Buddha that is clear radiant knowing we can still experience and attain today and when we do so the heart is oneSo let go put everything down everything except the knowingDont be fooled if visions or sounds arise in your mind during meditationPut them all downDont take hold of anything at allJust stay with this nondual awarenessDont worry about the past or the future just be still and you will reach the place where theres no advancing no retreating and no stopping where theres nothing to grasp at or cling toWhyBecause theres no self no me or mine Its all goneThe Buddha taught us to be emptied of everything in this way not to carry anything with usTo know and having known let goRealizing the Dhamma the path to freedom from the round of birth and death is a job that we all have to do aloneSo keep trying to let go and to understand the teachingsReally put effort into your contemplationDont worry about your familyAt the moment they are as they are in the future they will be like youTheres no one in the world who can escape this fateThe Buddha told us to put down everything that lacks a real abiding substanceIf you put everything down you will see the truth if you dont you wontThats the way it is and its the same for all so dont worry and dont grasp at anythingEven if you find yourself thinking well thats all right too as long as you think wiselyDont think foolishlyIf you think of your children think of them with wisdom not with foolishnessWhatever the mind turns to then think and know that thing with wisdom aware of its natureIf you know something with wisdom then you let it go and theres no sufferingThe mind is bright joyful and at peace and turning away from distractions it is undividedRight now what you can look to for help and support is your breathThis is your own work nobody elsesLeave others to do their own workYou have your own duty and responsibility and you dont have to take on those of your familyDont take anything else on let it all goThat letting go will make your mind calmYour sole responsibility right now is to focus your mind and bring it to peaceLeave everything else to othersForms sounds odors tastes  leave them to others to attend toPut everything behind you and do your own work fulfill your own responsibilityWhatever arises in your mind be it fear of pain fear of death anxiety about others or whatever say to it Dont disturb meYoure not my business any more Just keep saying this to yourself when you see those dhammas ariseWhat does the word dhamma refer toEverything is a dhammaThere is nothing that is not a dhammaAnd what about worldThe world is the very mental state that is agitating you at this momentWhat will this person doWhat will that person doWhen Im dead who will look after themHow will they manage This is all just the world Even the mere arising of a thought of fearing death or pain is the worldThrow the world awayThe world is the way it isIf you allow it to arise in the mind and dominate consciousness then the mind becomes obscured and cant see itselfSo whatever appears in the mind just say This isnt my businessIts impermanent unsatisfactory and notselfThinking youd like to go on living for a long time will make you sufferBut thinking youd like to die right away or die very quickly isnt right either its suffering isnt itConditions dont belong to us they follow their own natural lawsYou cant do anything about the way the body isYou can prettify it a little make it look attractive and clean for a while like the young girls who paint their lips and let their nails grow long but when old age arrives everyones in the same boatThats the way the body is you cant make it any other wayBut what you can improve and beautify is the mindAnyone can build a house of wood and bricks but the Buddha taught that that sort of home is not our real home its only nominally oursIts a home in the world and it follows the ways of the worldOur real home is inner peaceAn external material home may well be pretty but it is not very peacefulTheres this worry and then that this anxiety and then thatSo we say its not our real home its external to us sooner or later well have to give it upIts not a place we can live in permanently because it doesnt truly belong to us its part of the worldOur body is the same we take it to be self to be me and mine but in fact its not really so at all its another worldly homeYour body has followed its natural course from birth until now its old and sick and you cant forbid it from doing that thats the way it isWanting it to be different would be as foolish as wanting a duck to be like a chickenWhen you see that thats impossible that a duck has to be a duck that a chicken has to be a chicken and that bodies have to get old and die you will find strength and energyHowever much you want the body to go on and last for a long time it wont do thatThe Buddha saidThe word sankhara refers to this body and mindSankharas are impermanent and unstable having come into being they disappear having arisen they pass away and yet everyone wants them to be permanentThis is foolishnessLook at the breathHaving come in it goes out thats its nature thats how it has to beThe inhalation and exhalation have to alternate there must be changeSankharas exist through change you cant prevent itJust think could you exhale without inhalingWould it feel goodOr could you just inhaleWe want things to be permanent but they cant be its impossibleOnce the breath has come in it must go out when its gone out it comes in again and thats natural isnt itHaving been born we get old and sick and then we die and thats totally natural and normalIts because sankharas have done their job because the inbreaths and outbreaths have alternated in this way that the human race is still here todayAs soon as were born were deadOur birth and death are just one thingIts like a tree when theres a root there must be twigsWhen there are twigs there must be a rootYou cant have one without the otherIts a little funny to see how at a death people are so griefstricken and distracted tearful and sad and at a birth how happy and delightedIts delusion nobody has ever looked at this clearlyI think if you really want to cry then it would be better to do so when someones bornFor actually birth is death death is birth the root is the twig the twig is the rootIf youve got to cry cry at the root cry at the birthLook closely if there was no birth there would be no deathCan you understand thisDont think a lotJust think This is the way things are Its your work your dutyRight now nobody can help you theres nothing that your family and your possessions can do for youAll that can help you now is the correct awarenessSo dont waverLet goThrow it all awayEven if you dont let go everything is starting to leave anywayCan you see that how all the different parts of your body are trying to slip awayTake your hair when you were young it was thick and black now its falling outIts leavingYour eyes used to be good and strong and now theyre weak and your sight is unclearWhen the organs have had enough they leave this isnt their homeWhen you were a child your teeth were healthy and firm now theyre wobbly perhaps youve got false onesYour eyes ears nose tongue  everything is trying to leave because this isnt their homeYou cant make a permanent home in a sankhara you can stay for a short while and then you have to goIts like a tenant watching over his tiny little house with failing eyesHis teeth arent so good his ears arent so good his bodys not so healthy everything is leavingSo you neednt worry about anything because this isnt your real home its just a temporary shelterHaving come into this world you should contemplate its natureEverything there is is preparing to disappearLook at your bodyIs there anything there thats still in its original formIs your skin as it used to beIs your hairIts not the same is itWhere has everything goneThis is nature the way things areWhen their time is up conditions go their wayThis world is nothing to rely on  its an endless round of disturbance and trouble pleasures and painsTheres no peaceWhen we have no real home were like an aimless traveler out on the road going this way for a while and then that way stopping for a while and then setting off againUntil we return to our real home we feel illatease whatever were doing just like the one whos left his village to go on a journeyOnly when he gets home again can he really relax and be at easeNowhere in the world is any real peace to be foundThe poor have no peace and neither do the richAdults have no peace children have no peace the poorly educated have no peace and neither do the highlyeducatedTheres no peace anywhereThats the nature of the worldThose who have few possessions suffer and so do those who have manyChildren adults the aged everyone suffersThe suffering of being old the suffering of being young the suffering of being wealthy and the suffering of being poor  its all nothing but sufferingWhen youve contemplated things in this way youll see anicca impermanence and dukkha unsatisfactorinessWhy are things impermanent and unsatisfactoryIts because theyre anatta notselfBoth your body that is lying here sick and painful and the mind that is aware of its sickness and pain are called dhammasThat which is formless the thoughts feelings and perceptions is called namadhammaThat which is racked with aches and pains is called rupadhammaThe material is dhamma and the immaterial is dhammaSo we live with dhammas in dhamma we are dhammaIn truth theres no self anywhere to be found there are only dhammas continually arising and passing away as is their natureEvery single moment were undergoing birth and deathThis is the way things areWhen we think of the Lord Buddha how truly he spoke we feel how worthy he is of salutation reverence and respectWhenever we see the truth of something we see his teachings even if weve never actually practiced DhammaBut even if we have a knowledge of the teachings have studied and practice them but still havent seen their truth then were still homelessSo understand this point that all people all creatures are about to leaveWhen beings have lived an appropriate time they go their wayThe rich the poor the young the old all beings must experience this changeWhen you realize that thats the way the world is youll feel that its a wearisome placeWhen you see that theres nothing stable or substantial you can rely on youll feel wearied and disenchantedBeing disenchanted doesnt mean youre averse thoughThe mind is clearIt sees that theres nothing to be done to remedy this state of affairs its just the way the world isKnowing in this way you can let go of attachment let go with a mind that is neither happy nor sad but at peace with sankharas through seeing with wisdom their changing natureAnicca vata sankhara  all sankharas are impermanentTo put it simply impermanence is the BuddhaIf we see an impermanent phenomenon really clearly well see that its permanent permanent in the sense that its subjection to change is unchangingThis is the permanence that living beings possessThere is continual transformation from childhood through youth to old age and that very impermanence that nature to change is permanent and fixedIf you look at it like that your heart will be at easeIts not just you that has to go through this its everyoneWhen you consider things thus youll see them as wearisome and disenchantment will ariseYour delight in the world of sensepleasures will disappearYoull see that if you have a lot of things you have to leave a lot behind if you have few you will leave behind fewWealth is just wealth long life is just long life theyre nothing specialWhats important is that we should do as the Lord Buddha taught and build our own home building it by the method that Ive been explaining to youBuild your homeLet goLet go until the mind reaches the peace that is free from advancing free from retreating and free from stopping stillPleasure is not our home pain is not our homePleasure and pain both decline and pass awayThe Great Teacher saw that all sankharas are impermanent and so he taught us to let go of our attachment to themWhen we reach the end of our life well have no choice anyway we wont be able to take anything with usSo wouldnt it be better to put things down before thatTheyre just a heavy burden to carry around why not throw off that load nowWhy bother to drag them aroundLet go relax and let your family look after youThose who nurse the sick grow in goodness and virtueOne who is sick and giving others that opportunity shouldnt make things difficult for themIf theres a pain or some problem or other let them know and keep the mind in a wholesome stateOne who is nursing parents should fill his or her mind with warmth and kindness not get caught in aversionThis is the one time when you can repay the debt you owe themFrom your birth through your childhood as youve grown up youve been dependent on your parentsThat we are here today is because our mothers and fathers have helped us in so many waysWe owe them an incredible debt of gratitudeSo today all of you children and relatives gathered here together see how your parents become your childrenBefore you were their children now they become yoursThey become older and older until they become children againTheir memories go their eyes dont see so well and their ears dont hear sometimes they garble their wordsDont let it upset youAll of you nursing the sick must know how to let goDont hold on to things just let go and let them have their own wayWhen a young child is disobedient sometimes the parents let it have its own way just to keep the peace to make it happyNow your parents are like that childTheir memories and perceptions are confusedSometimes they muddle up your names or you ask them to give you a cup and they bring a plateIts normal dont be upset by itLet the patient remember the kindness of those who nurse and patiently endure the painful feelingsExert yourself mentally dont let the mind become scattered and agitated and dont make things difficult for those looking after youLet those who nurse the sick fill their minds with virtue and kindnessDont be averse to the unattractive side of the job to cleaning up mucus and phlegm or urine and excrementTry your bestEveryone in the family give a handThese are the only parents youve gotThey gave you life they have been your teachers your nurses and your doctors  theyve been everything to youThat they have brought you up taught you shared their wealth with you and made you their heirs is the great beneficence of parentsConsequently the Buddha taught the virtues of kataññu and katavedi of knowing our debt of gratitude and trying to repay itThese two virtues are complementaryIf our parents are in need if theyre unwell or in difficulty then we do our best to help themThis is kataññukatavedi it is a virtue that sustains the worldIt prevents families from breaking up it makes them stable and harmoniousToday I have brought you the Dhamma as a gift in this time of illnessI have no material things to give you there seem to be plenty of those in the house already and so I give you Dhamma something which has a lasting worth something which youll never be able to exhaustHaving received it from me you can pass it on to as many others as you like and it will never be depletedThat is the nature of TruthI am happy to have been able to give you this gift of Dhamma and I hope it will give you strength to deal with your painAjahn Chah was born into a large and comfortable family in a rural village in Northeast ThailandHe ordained as a novice in early youth and on reaching the age of twenty took higher ordination as a monkAs a young monk he studied some basic Dhamma Discipline and scripturesLater he practice meditation under the guidance of several of the local meditation masters in the ascetic forest traditionHe wandered for a number of years in the style of an ascetic monk sleeping in forests caves and cremation grounds and spent a short but enlightening period with Ajahn Mun one of the most famous and respected Thai meditation masters of this centuryAfter many years of travel and practice he was invited to settle in a thick forest grove near the village of his birthThis grove was uninhabited known as a place of cobras tigers and ghosts thus being as he said the perfect location for a forest monkAround Ajahn Chah a large monastery formed as more and more monks nuns and lay people came to hear his teachings and stay on to practice with himNow there are more than forty mountain and forest branch temples throughout Thailand and in England and Australia as wellOn entering Wat Pah Pong one is likely to encounter monks drawing water from a well and a sign on the path that says You there be quietWere trying to meditate Although there is a group meditation twice a day the heart of the meditation is the way of lifeMonks do manual work dye and sew their own robes make most of their own requisites and keep the monastery buildings and grounds in immaculate shapeMonks here live extremely simply following the ascetic precepts of eating once a day from the alms bowl and limiting their possessions and robesScattered throughout the forest are individual huts where monks live and meditate in solitude and where they practice walking meditation on cleared paths under the treesDiscipline is extremely strict enabling one to lead a simple and pure life in a harmoniously regulated community where virtue meditation and understanding may be skillfully and continuously cultivatedAjahn Chahs simple yet profound style of teaching has a special appeal to Westerners and many have come to study and practice with him quite a few for many yearsIn Wat Pah Nanachat was established near Wat Pah Pong as a special training monastery for the growing number of Westerners interested in undertaking monastic trainingSince then Ajahn Chahs large following of senior Western disciples has begun the work of spreading the Dhamma in the WestAjahn Chah has himself traveled twice to Europe and North America and he has established a thriving branch monastery in Sussex EnglandWisdom is a way of living and being and Ajahn Chah has endeavored to preserve the simple lifestyle of the monks in order that people may study and practice Dhamma in the present dayAjahn Chahs wonderfully simple style of teaching can be deceptiveIt is often only after one has heard something from him many times that suddenly ones mind is ripe and somehow the teaching takes on a much deeper meaningHis skillful means in tailoring his explanations of Dhamma to time and place and to the understanding and sensitivity of his audience is marvellous to seeSometimes on paper though it can make him seem inconsistent or even selfcontradictoryAt such times the reader should remember that these words are a record of living experienceSimilarly if the teaching may seem to vary at times from tradition it should be borne in mind that the venerable Ajahn speaks always from the heart from the depths of his own meditative experienceThe Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creedsFounded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topicsIts publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddhas discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practiceThese works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first aroseWhile the Buddha was staying at Jetavana Monastery near Savatthi the wealthy banker Anathapindika went one day to pay his respectsHis servants carried masses of flowers perfume butter oil honey molasses cloths and robesAnathapindika paid obeisance to the Buddha presented the offerings he had brought and sat down respectfullyAt that time Anathapindika was accompanied by five hundred friends who were followers of heretical teachersHis friends also paid their respects to the Buddha and sat close to the bankerThe Buddhas face appeared like a full moon and his body was surrounded by a radiant auraSeated on the red stone seat he was like a young lion roaring with a clear noble voice as he taught them a discourse full of sweetness and beautiful to the earAfter hearing the Buddhas teaching the five hundred gave up their heretical practices and took refuge in the Triple Gem the Buddha the Dhamma and the SanghaAfter that they went regularly with Anathapindika to offer flowers and incense and to hear the teachingThey gave liberally kept the precepts and faithfully observed the Uposatha DaySoon after the Buddha left Savatthi to return to Rajagaha however these men abandoned their new faith and reverted to their previous beliefsSeven or eight months later the Buddha returned to JetavanaAgain Anathapindika brought these friends to visit the BuddhaThey paid their respects but Anathapindika explained that they had forsaken their refuge and had resumed their original practicesThe Buddha asked Is it true that you have abandoned refuge in the Triple Gem for refuge in other doctrines The Buddhas voice was incredibly clear because throughout myriad aeons He had always spoken truthfullyWhen these men heard it they were unable to conceal the truthYes Blessed One they confessedIt is trueDisciples the Buddha said nowhere between the lowest of hells below and the highest heaven above nowhere in all the infinite worlds that stretch right and left is there the equal much less the superior of a BuddhaIncalculable is the excellence which springs from obeying the Precepts and from other virtuous conductThen he declared the virtues of the Triple GemBy taking refuge in the Triple Gem He told them one escapes from rebirth in states of suffering He further explained that meditation on the Triple Gem leads through the four stages to EnlightenmentIn forsaking such a refuge as this he admonished them you have certainly erredIn the past too men who foolishly mistook what was no refuge for a real refuge met disasterActually they fell prey to yakkhas  evil spirits  in the wilderness and were utterly destroyedIn contrast men who clung to the truth not only survived but actually prospered in that same wildernessAnathapindika raised his clasped hands to his forehead praised the Buddha and asked him to tell that story of the pastIn order to dispel the worlds ignorance and to conquer suffering the Buddha proclaimed I practiced the Ten Perfections for countless aeonsListen carefully and I will speakHaving their full attention the Buddha made clear as though he were releasing the full moon from behind clouds what rebirth had concealed from themOne day it so happened that the two merchants each loaded five hundred carts with costly wares of Baranasi and prepared to leave in the same direction at exactly the same timeThe wise merchant thought If this silly young fool travels with me and if our thousand carts stay together it will be too much for the roadFinding wood and water for the men will be difficult and there wont be enough grass for the oxenEither he or I must go firstLook he said to the other merchant the two of us cant travel togetherWould you rather go first or follow after meThe foolish trader thought There will be many advantages if I take the leadIll get a road which is not yet cut upMy oxen will have the pick of the grassMy men will get the choicest wild herbs for curryThe water will be undisturbedBest of all Ill be able to fix my own price for bartering my goods Considering all these advantages he said I will go ahead of you my friendThe Bodhisatta was pleased to hear this because he saw many advantages in following afterHe reasoned Those carts going first will level the road where it is rough and Ill be able to travel along the road they have already smoothedTheir oxen will graze off the coarse old grass and mine will pasture on the sweet young growth which will spring up in its placeMy men will find fresh sweet herbs for curry where the old ones have been pickedWhere there is no water the first caravan will have to dig to supply themselves and well be able to drink at the wells they have dugHaggling over prices is tiring work hell do the work and I will be able to barter my wares at prices he has already fixedVery well my friend he said please go firstI will said the foolish merchant and he yoked his carts and set outAfter a while he came to the outskirts of a wildernessHe filled all of his huge water jars with water before setting out to cross the sixty yojanas of desert which lay before himThe yakkha who haunted that wilderness had been watching the caravanWhen it had reached the middle he used his magic power to conjure up a lovely carriage drawn by pure white young bullsWith a retinue of a dozen disguised yakkhas carrying swords and shields he rode along in his carriage like a mighty lordHis hair and clothes were wet and he had a wreath of blue lotuses and white water lilies around his headHis attendants also were dripping wet and draped in garlandsEven the bulls hooves and carriage wheels were muddyAs the wind was blowing from the front the merchant was riding at the head of his caravan to escape the dustThe yakkha drew his carriage beside the merchants and greeted him kindlyThe merchant returned the greeting and moved his own carriage to one side to allow the carts to pass while he and the yakkha chattedWe are on our way from Baranasi sir explained the merchantI see that your men are all wet and muddy and that you have lotuses and water liliesDid it rain while you were on the roadDid you come across pools with lotuses and water liliesWhat do you mean the yakkha exclaimedOver there is the darkgreen streak of a jungleBeyond that there is plenty of waterIt is always raining there and there are many lakes with lotuses and water lilies Then pretending to be interested in the merchants business he asked What do you have in these cartsExpensive merchandise answered the merchantWhat is in this cart which seems so heavily laden the yakkha asked as the last cart rolled byThats full of waterYou were wise to carry water with you this far but there is no need for it now since water is so abundant aheadYou could travel much faster and lighter without those heavy jarsYoud be better off breaking them and throwing the water awayWell good day he said suddenly as he turned his carriageWe must be on our wayWe have stopped too long already He rode away quickly with his menAs soon as they were out of sight he turned and made his way back to his own cityThe merchant was so foolish that he followed the yakkhas adviceHe broke all the jars without saving even a single cupful of water and ordered the men to drive on quicklyOf course they did not find any water and they were soon exhausted from thirstAt sunset they drew their carts into a circle and tethered the oxen to the wheels but there was no water for the weary animalsWithout water the men could not cook any rice eitherThey sank to the ground and fell asleepAs soon as night came the yakkhas attacked killing every single man and beastThe fiends devoured the flesh leaving only the bones and departedSkeletons were strewn in every direction but the five hundred carts stood with their loads untouchedThus the heedless young merchant was the sole cause of the destruction of the entire caravanAllowing six weeks to pass after the foolish trader had left the Bodhisatta set out with his five hundred cartsWhen he reached the edge of the wilderness he filled his water jarsThen he assembled his men and announced Let not so much as a handful of water be used without my permissionFurthermore there are poisonous plants in this wildernessDo not eat any leaf flower or fruit which you have never eaten before without showing it to me first Having thus carefully warned his men he led the caravan into the wildernessWhen they had reached the middle of the wilderness the yakkha appeared on the path just as beforeThe merchant noticed his red eyes and fearless manner and suspected something strangeI know there is no water in this desert he said to himselfFurthermore this stranger casts no shadowHe must be a yakkhaHe probably tricked the foolish merchant but he doesnt realize how clever I amGet out of here he shouted at the yakkhaWe are men of businessWe do not throw away our water before we see where more is to come fromWithout saying any more the yakkha rode awayAs soon as the yakkhas had left the merchants men approached their leader and said Sir those men were wearing lotuses and water lilies on their headsTheir clothes and hair were wringing wetThey told us that up ahead there is a thick forest where it is always rainingLet us throw away our water so that we can proceed quicker with lightened cartsThe merchant ordered a halt and summoned all his menHas any man among you ever heard before today he asked that there was a lake or a pool in this wildernessNo sir they answeredIts known as the Waterless Desert We have just been told by some strangers that it is raining in the forest just aheadHow far does a rainwind carryA yojana sirHas any man here seen the top of even a single stormcloudNo sirHow far off can you see a flash of lightningFour or five yojanas sirHas any man here seen a flash of lightningNo sirHow far off can a man hear a peal of thunderTwo or three yojanas sirHas any man here heard a peal of thunderNo sirThose were not men but yakkhas the wise merchant told his menThey are hoping that we will throw away our waterThen when we are weak and faint they will return to devour usSince the young merchant who went before us was not a man of good sense most likely he was fooled by themWe may expect to find his carts standing just as they were first loadedWe will probably see them todayPress on with all possible speed without throwing away a drop of waterJust as the merchant had predicted his caravan soon came upon the five hundred carts with the skeletons of men and oxen strewn in every directionHe ordered his men to arrange his carts in a fortified circle to take care of the oxen and to prepare an early supper for themselvesAfter the animals and men had all safely bedded down the merchant and his foremen swords in hand stood guard all through the nightAt daybreak the merchant replaced his own weak carts for stronger ones and exchanged his own common goods for the most costly of the abandoned merchandiseWhen he arrived at his destination he was able to barter his stock of wares at two or three times their valueHe returned to his own city without losing a single man out of all his companyThis clinging to the truth not only endows happiness even up to rebirth in the Realm of Brahma but also leads ultimately to ArahantshipFollowing untruth entails rebirth either in the four states of punishment or in the lowest conditions of mankind After the Buddha had expounded the Four Truths those five hundred disciples were established in the Fruit of the First PathThe Buddha concluded his lesson by identifying the Birth as follows The foolish young merchant was Devadatta and his men were Devadattas followersThe wise merchants men were the followers of the Buddha and I myself was that wise merchantSo that a disheartened bhikkhu would have no regrets in the future the Buddha told him this story at Savatthi to encourage him to persevereIf you give up your practice in this sublime teaching which leads to Nibbana the Buddha told him you will suffer long like the trader of Seriva who lost a golden bowl worth a hundred thousand piecesWhen asked to explain the Buddha told this story of the distant pastOne day the two of them crossed the Telavaha river to do business in the bustling city of AndhapuraAs usual to avoid competing with each other they divided the city between them and began selling their goods from door to doorIn that city there was a ramshackle mansionYears before the family had been rich merchants but by the time of this story their fortunes had dwindled to nothing and all the men of the family had diedThe sole survivors were a girl and her grandmother and these two earned their living by working for hireThat afternoon while the greedy peddler was on his rounds he came to the door of that very house crying Beads for saleBeads for saleWhen the young girl heard his cry she begged Please buy me a trinket GrandmotherWere very poor dearTheres not a cent in the house and I cant think of anything to offer in exchangeThe girl suddenly remembered an old bowlLook she criedHeres an old bowlIts of no use to usLets try to trade it for something niceWhat the little girl showed her grandmother was an old bowl which had been used by the great merchant the late head of the familyHe had always eaten his curries served from this beautiful expensive bowlAfter his death it had been thrown among the pots and pans and forgottenSince it hadnt been used for a very long time it was completely covered with grimeThe two women had no idea it was goldThe old woman asked the trader to come in and sit downShe showed him the bowl and said Sir my granddaughter would like a trinketWould you be so kind as to take this bowl and give her something or other in exchangeThe peddler took the bowl in his hand and turned it overSuspecting its value he scratched the back of it with a needleAfter just one covert look he knew for certain the bowl was real goldHe sat there frowning and thinking until his greed got the better of himAt last he decided to try to get the bowl without giving the woman anything whatever for itPretending to be angry he growled Why did you bring me this stupid bowlIt isnt worth half a cent He threw the bowl to the floor got up and stalked out of the house in apparent disgustSince it had been agreed between the two traders that the one might try the streets which the other had already covered the honest peddler came later into that same street and appeared at the door of the house crying Beads for saleOnce again the young girl made the same request of her grandmother and the old woman replied My dear the first peddler threw our bowl on the ground and stormed out of the houseWhat have we got left to offerOh but that trader was nasty GrandmotherThis one looks and sounds very kindI think he will take itAll right thenCall him inWhen the peddler came into the house the two women gave him a seat and shyly put the bowl into his handsImmediately recognizing that the bowl was gold he said Mother this bowl is worth a hundred thousand pieces of silverIm sorry but I dont have that much moneyAstonished at his words the old woman said Sir another peddler who came here a little while ago said that it was not worth half a centHe got angry threw it on the floor and went awayIf it wasnt valuable then it must be because of your own goodness that the bowl has turned into goldPlease take it and just give us something or other for itWe will be more than satisfiedAt that time the peddler had only five hundred pieces of silver and goods worth another five hundredHe gave everything to the women asking only to keep his scales his bag and eight coins for his return fareOf course they were happy to agreeAfter profuse thanks on both sides the trader hurried to the river with the golden bowlHe gave his eight coins to the boatman and got into the boatNot long after he had left the greedy peddler returned to the house giving the impression of having reluctantly reconsidered their offerHe asked them to bring out their bowl saying he would give them something or other for it after allThe old woman flew at himYou scoundrel she criedYou told us that our golden bowl was not worth even half a centLucky for us an honest trader came after you left and told us it was really worth a hundred thousand pieces of silverHe gave us a thousand for it and took it away so you are too lateWhen the peddler heard this an intense pain swept over himHe robbed meHe robbed me he criedHe got my golden bowl worth a hundred thousand He became hysterical and lost all controlThrowing down his money and merchandise he tore off his shirt grabbed the beam of his scales for a club and ran to the riverside to catch the other traderBy the time he got to the river the boat was already in midstreamHe shouted for the boat to return to shore but the honest peddler who had already paid calmly told the ferryman to continue onThe frustrated trader could only stand there on the riverbank and watch his rival escape with the bowlThe sight so infuriated him that a fierce hate swelled up inside himHis heart grew hot and blood gushed from his mouthFinally his heart cracked like the mud at the bottom of a pond dried up by the sunSo intense was the unreasoning hatred which he developed against the other trader because of the golden bowl that he perished then and thereThe honest trader returned to Seriva where he lived a full life spent in charity and other good works and passed away to fare according to his desertsOne day while the Buddha was staying in Jetavana some bhikkhus asked him if there was any benefit in sacrificing goats sheep and other animals as offerings for departed relativesNo bhikkhus replied the BuddhaNo good ever comes from taking life not even when it is for the purpose of providing a Feast for the Dead Then he told this story of the pastYes sir they replied and led the goat to the riverWhile they were grooming it the goat started to laugh with a sound like a pot smashingThen just as strangely it started to weep loudlyThe young students were amazed at this behaviorWhy did you suddenly laugh they asked the goat and why do you now cry so loudlyRepeat your question when we get back to your teacher the goat answeredThe students hurriedly took the goat back to their master and told him what had happened at the riverHearing the story the master himself asked the goat why it had laughed and why it had weptIn times past brahman the goat began I was a brahman who taught the Vedas like youI too sacrificed a goat as an offering for a Feast for the DeadBecause of killing that single goat I have had my head cut off timesI laughed aloud when I realized that this is my last birth as an animal to be sacrificedToday I will be freed from my miseryOn the other hand I cried when I realized that because of killing me you too may be doomed to lose your head five hundred timesIt was out of pity for you that I criedWell goat said the brahman in that case I am not going to kill youBrahman exclaimed the goatWhether or not you kill me I cannot escape death todayDont worry the brahman assured the goatI will guard youYou dont understand the goat told himYour protection is weakThe force of my evil deed is very strongThe brahman untied the goat and said to his students Dont allow anyone to harm this goat They obediently followed the animal to protect itAfter the goat was freed it began to grazeIt stretched out its neck to reach the leaves on a bush growing near the top of a large rockAt that very instant a lightning bolt hit the rock breaking off a sharp piece of stone which flew through the air and neatly cut off the goats headA crowd of people gathered around the dead goat and began to talk excitedly about the amazing accidentA tree deva had observed everything from the goats purchase to its dramatic death and drawing a lesson from the incident admonished the crowd If people only knew that the penalty would be rebirth into sorrow they would cease from taking lifeA horrible doom awaits one who slays With this explanation of the law of kamma the deva instilled in his listeners the fear of hellThe people were so frightened that they completely gave up the practice of animal sacrificesThe deva further instructed the people in the Precepts and urged them to do goodEventually that deva passed away to fare according to his desertsFor several generations after that people remained faithful to the Precepts and spent their lives in charity and meritorious works so that many were reborn in the heavensThe Buddha told this story at Jetavana about a conniving bhikkhu who was the source of much trouble to other bhikkhusThe landowner had a great fear of robbers and decided that the safest course to protect his money was to hide it in an unlikely placeBelieving the mattedhaired ascetic to be a model of sainthood he brought a hundred pieces of gold to the hermitage buried them there and asked the ascetic to keep watch over the treasureTheres no need to say more sir to a man like me who has renounced the worldWe hermits never covet what belongs to othersThats wonderful said the landowner who went off with complete confidence in the hermits protestationsAs soon as the landowner was out of sight the ascetic chuckled to himself Why theres enough here to last a man his whole lifeAllowing a few days to elapse the hermit dug up the gold and reburied it conveniently by the roadThe following morning after a meal of rice and succulent curries at the landowners house the ascetic said My good sir Ive been staying here supported by you for a long timeFrankly living so long in one place is like living in the world which is forbidden to ascetics like meI really cannot remain here any longer the time has come for me to leaveThe landowner urged him to stay but nothing could overcome the hermits determinationWell then said the landowner if you must go good luck to you Reluctantly he escorted the ascetic to the outskirts of the village and returned homeAfter walking a short way by himself the ascetic thought it would be a good thing to cajole the landownerSticking a straw in his matted hair he hurried back to the villageWhat brings you back again asked the surprised landownerI just noticed that a straw from your roof got stuck in my hairWe hermits must not take anything which has not been given to us so I have brought it back to youThrow it down sir and go your way said the landownerImagine he said to himselfThis ascetic is so honest he wont even take a straw which does not belong to himWhat a rare person Thus greatly impressed by the ascetics honesty the landowner bid him farewell againAt that time the Bodhisatta reborn as a merchant was traveling to the border on business and happened to stop at that same little village where he witnessed the ascetics return with the piece of strawSuspicion grew in his mind that the hermit must have robbed the landowner of somethingHe asked the rich man whether he had deposited anything in the ascetics careYes the landowner answered rather hesitantly a hundred pieces of goldWell why dont you just go and see if its still safe the merchant suggestedThe landowner went to the deserted hermitage dug where he had left his money and found it goneRushing back to the merchant he cried Its not thereThe thief is certainly that longhaired rascal of an ascetic said the merchantLets catch himThe two men ran after the rogue and quickly caught himThey kicked him and beat him until he showed them where he had hidden the goldAfter they had gotten back the money the merchant looked at the coins and scornfully asked the ascetic Why didnt this hundred pieces of gold trouble your conscience as much as that strawTake care you hypocrite never to play such a trick againWhen his life ended the merchant passed away to fare according to his desertsThe Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creedsFounded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topicsIts publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddhas discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practiceThese works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first aroseIt is near sunset on a hot summer afternoonOutside a temple a Buddhist monk named Bhikkhu Tissa sits quietly on a mat in the shade of a treeMrPrentice a layman comes hiking up the road wiping his perspiring face with a handkerchiefHe sees the monk and approaches himMRPRENTICE Oh Bhikkhu Tissa I was hoping Id find you hereBHIKKHU TISSA Good afternoon MrPrenticePRENTICE You remember my nameI wasnt sure if you wouldIve come around the temple every now and then  just out of curiosity mainlyBHIKKHU TISSA Is it curiosity that brings you here nowPRENTICE I guess you could say thatIsnt this heat awfulBHIKKHU TISSA Sit down MrPrenticeTheres plenty of lawnPRENTICE Ah so there isThank youHe looks around doubtfully then he settles in the shade at a respectful distance from the monkIm a bit worn outIts kind of a long walk from my house to hereI wonder if you might have time to answer a couple of questionsBHIKKHU TISSA Ill tryWhats on your mindPRENTICE In a word BuddhismBHIKKHU TISSA All of itPRENTICE Ha haNo its just that Ive been doing some reading  plus hearing an occasional lecture here  and I must say I find Buddhism very attractive at least in theoryIts very cool rational and scientific in its explanations of realityI can appreciate thatI like to think Im a man of scienceThe Buddhist analysis of mind and matter appears to me almost like a scientific investigationBut the other part the religious part gives me troubleBHIKKHU TISSA Youre a great admirer of science are you MrPrenticePRENTICE Oh yes no questionBHIKKHU TISSA Could it be that you appreciate Buddhism in proportion as it resembles sciencePRENTICE Uh well possiblyBHIKKHU TISSA If thats so why not stay with the real articleWhy bother with BuddhismPRENTICE Well of course science lacks a it lacksBHIKKHU TISSA The religious partPRENTICE ExactlyYou see venerable sir the problem is thisMuch as I like what I know of Buddhism much as I approve of it intellectually I find it difficult to actually commit myself to it as a religious disciplineI have too many doubtsI admire the philosophy but I suppose I just cant take it seriouslyBHIKKHU TISSA Seriousness is precisely the difference between philosophy and religionThe philosopher deals in expendable theories the religious man puts his life on the linePRENTICE And thats exactly what Im not prepared to doBHIKKHU TISSA Many people feel that wayPRENTICE And yet  its what Id like to doTo be seriousTo put my life on the lineThe trouble is I dont have any motivationBHIKKHU TISSA HmmHow far is it from your house to herePRENTICE WhatOh eight or ten blocks I guessBHIKKHU TISSA And you walked eight or ten blocks on a hot afternoon to tell me you dont have any motivationPRENTICE AhGood pointBHIKKHU TISSA Buddhist discipline begins and ends with selfexaminationBuddhist philosophy or theory if you will instructs us how to carry out that examination and the efforts that followWe can read the philosophy all we want but if we dont practice it  if we dont take the medicine so to speak  it wont do anything for usNow you tell me that youve been reading Buddhist literature and you say you have doubtsWhat specifically is troubling youPRENTICE Nothing specific I thinkJust general doubts keep me from taking the medicineTo put it bluntly why should I undertake what promises to be a horrendously hard discipline of meditation and religious observances and so onWhat will I get out of itBHIKKHU TISSA First of all a horrendously hard discipline will by itself accomplish nothingPRENTICE NothingBHIKKHU TISSA You should get rid of the notion of investing an effort in order to get something in returnPRENTICE I dont understandBHIKKHU TISSA Weve already got more than we can handle  namely sufferingWe follow the teachings of the Buddha in order to get rid of sufferingMost people dont understand this important pointThey think that they have to try to acquire something  wisdom or knowledge or freedomPRENTICE But the Buddha does speak of wisdom and knowledge and freedom and so onArent these things worthwhileBHIKKHU TISSA CertainlyBut they are not objects to be grasped at as we habitually grasp at things we desireThe highest truth is not a prize to be seizedIT is here all the timeBuddhist discipline aims at removing the obstructions that prevent our seeing the truthThe practitioner must certainly make an effort but he should not try to get anything by his effortPRENTICE It seems paradoxical to meBHIKKHU TISSA Only because you are accustomed to the ordinary way of doing things  a way which I might guess has not brought you the happiness you seekPRENTICE Perhaps youre right about thatLet me rephrase my questionI mean even though I appreciate Buddhist thought I dont feel motivated to actually commit myself to itWhy should I just leap into the dark so to speakBHIKKHU TISSA You should not leap into the dark under any circumstancesPRENTICE But isnt that what Buddhism demandsA leap of faith anywayBHIKKHU TISSA Absolutely notBlind hope of faith wont help you in the leastPRENTICE Then what reason do I have toBHIKKHU TISSA Ah theres the word  reasonYou see MrPrentice the practicing Buddhist needs reason founded on direct insightThe two go togetherDont believe out of mere hopeDont believe from abstract logicDont believe what you cant see clearly for yourselfPRENTICE Theres very little I can seeI certainly cant see enlightenment ahead I cant see NibbanaBHIKKHU TISSA And what can you see MrPrenticePRENTICE My own confusionMy uncertaintyMy unhappinessBHIKKHU TISSA YesPRENTICE I dont want to sound grandiose but I see well suffering  at least my own sufferingBhikkhu Tissa is silentMr Prentice continues haltinglyI dont mean to say I have any kind of penetrating visionI just have this recognition that things arent the way they ought to be that Im getting older but not any wiser that something is wrong in the world or in meId like to do something about itId like to get free from this confusion this well what word can I use but sufferingI suppose thats why I got interested in Buddhism  because it talks about suffering and the way to the end of sufferingIf some kind of deliverance is really possible Id like to achieve itBHIKKHU TISSA I think youve found your own reason MrPrenticePRENTICE Yes I suppose soThen maybe its just doubt or fear that holds me backYou mentioned selfexamination a moment agoMaybe thats what I have to doBHIKKHU TISSA It sounds like youve already begunPlease understand that the traveler on the Buddhist path proceeds step by stepHe doesnt leap into darknessHe keeps his eye on the present moment  on the present step  observing and analyzing what is right before him not troubling himself with what is past or what yet may comeHe examines himself constantly as the Buddha taught learning what is true and false and what is beneficial and harmfulAs he learns these things he must act accordingly  by resisting unwholesome influences by striving to cultivate wholesome thought speech and action and by gradually deepening and purifying his understandingPRENTICE It sounds terrifically difficultBHIKKHU TISSA It neednt be soThe way of the Buddha is not an ascetic discipline not some extraordinary program of penancesIt is simply right living  the easiest and best way to liveWe are so used to living the wrong way  stumbling blindly through pain and confusion  that we find it hard to believe there is any other way to livePRENTICE You call it the Middle WayBHIKKHU TISSA YesThe Dhamma the Buddhas teaching is the Middle Way between the extremes of selfmortification and selfindulgenceWe shouldnt torment our bodies and minds in the belief that this will purge us of evil and make us wiseNor should we rush to gratify all our desires for pleasureThe Middle Way of the Buddha is a balanced and sensible life that avoids foolish extremesPRENTICE Yes that was clear to me even from my first readingAs I said on an intellectual level I find it eminently satisfyingStill the actual practice of it is somehow  I dont know  dauntingI wonder if Im the only one who feels this wayBHIKKHU TISSA The Buddha teaches that the mind of a puthujjana an ordinary worldly person is dominated by defilements which distorts his view of realitySuch a mind is wild tormented deludedIt ranges here and there with the ebb and flow of passionObsessed with greed and aversion it doesnt want to be restrained and tamedYou might say that the defilements fear the power of Dhamma and do everything they can to turn us away from it to keep us enslavedFor a very long time we have rushed about according to whims and fears and the idea of even attempting to resist the defilements seems preposterous at firstPRENTICE Well why are we loaded with defilementsBHIKKHU TISSA In a word because of our ignoranceBecause of not knowing not understanding things as they really areIn our ignorance we are easy prey to defilements and our minds rush foolishly this way and that not knowing the harm in such actionsIgnorance is the terrible burden we bear that makes it so difficult to act wisely and happilyRemember I said that one practices Dhamma not to get wisdom but to get rid of sufferingInsight wisdom appears as one studies the world and oneself according to DhammaAs this wisdom grows ignorance is gradually destroyedWhen ignorance is gone craving is conquered and suffering vanishesThis is enlightenmentPRENTICE You talk as though these things happen automaticallyBHIKKHU TISSA In a sense they doWe should not attempt to throw suffering out of our lives by brute forceInstead we should go to the source to pull out the roots of suffering and let it wither by itselfIts a matter of cause and effectPRENTICE Im beginning to see that there is a certain impersonality about the whole processBut surely one has to make a definite effort to accomplish anythingBHIKKHU TISSA Of courseLet me explain in this way when you bring a lamp into a dark room darkness is dispelled and the room is filled with lightThe lamp is DhammaWhat before was obscured is illuminatedWhat before was unknown is made manifestWe have to carry that lamp of Dhamma into the darkness of our own mindsThats our task thats what the Buddha shows us how to doPRENTICE And that means meditation rightBHIKKHU TISSA Not just meditationPRENTICE But thats the essence isnt itThats what is most importantBHIKKHU TISSA NoYou shouldnt single out any one aspect of the Buddhas teaching and ignore the restThe Buddha taught the Noble Eightfold Path as the way to the end of sufferingAll the factors of the path are necessary for complete deliveranceJust to understand this in itself is one aspect of Right ViewsThere are of course many othersPRENTICE I presume the factor of Right Views has to be perfected to be developed fullyBHIKKHU TISSA All the factors have to be developed fullyPRENTICE I seeSo after perfecting Right Views one moves on to Right Intentions Right Speech Right Action Right Livelihood Right Effort Right Mindfulness and Right ConcentrationAm I correctBHIKKHU TISSA No youre notThe path is not a staircasePRENTICE You mean you dont climb up from steps one to eightBHIKKHU TISSA Not at allThe eight factors of the path are to be practiced togetherThey do not exist in isolation but reinforce one another and thereby sustain the practitionerThe traditional sequence of the list has nothing to do with the actual cultivation of the factorsPRENTICE Well this is somewhat of a reliefI was wondering how I could even get past the first factor much less all the othersBHIKKHU TISSA Oh you still have to get past them as you put it but there is no fixed order to worry aboutThe path is a program of practice  an eightfold program  which attends to all the important aspects of ones developmentAt the outset we should be correctly informed of the nature of the world and our duties in itThen it is up to us to gradually purify ourselves through practice of these factorsAnother way of looking at the path is in terms of three categories of training sila samadhi and pañña  or morality concentration and wisdomMorality is the foundation of the whole practice it supports concentration which in turn supports wisdomWithout morality we can achieve nothing of valuePlease understand that this does not mean that you should devote yourself exclusively to the perfection of morality before turning your attention to concentration and wisdomThese three aspects of training are intimately related and must be practiced together so that you can develop yourself completely and advance toward liberationPRENTICE Perhaps its just my ignorance but it does seem that wisdom is the most important part and I confess I cant get too excited about morality and concentrationBHIKKHU TISSA You are quite mistakenFirst wisdom is a tool not an end in itselfWisdom is the power by which we come to discern the true nature of reality and cut off harmful tendenciesSecond there is no value in regarding wisdom as a more important factor than the others when all of them are essentialPRENTTICE I must be confusing wisdom with the enlightenment that follows its applicationWell then it still seems to me that Buddhist discipline involves some kind of a leap of intuition to the higher planeBHIKKHU TISSA Theres that leap againTell me MrPrentice on your way here didnt you pass an apple orchardPRENTICE An orchardWell yes I didBHIKKHU TISSA And have you ever seen the apples being harvested in the fallPRENTICE CertainlyBHIKKHU TISSA When people want to pick apples do they stand beneath the trees and leap mightily into the air and snatch the fruit off the boughsPRENTICE No of course notOh I see where this is headingBHIKKHU TISSA How do they pick applesPRENTICE They get a ladder and prop it up against the trunk and climb up  yes I see your point  step by stepAnd of course youre right the bottom rung is no less important than the top rungWell Bhikkhu Tissa Ill have to rethink my views on spiritual accomplishmentBHIKKHU TISSA It would be ridiculous wouldnt it  dozens of earnest applepickers grunting and leaping and crashing back down on the groundAnd yet believe it or not this is how many people pursue religionThey very much want some kind of sublime deliverance but they go about it in the wrong way without preparing themselves for what must necessarily be a gradual processPRENTICE I have an uncomfortable feeling that I might be one of those peopleBHIKKHU TISSA Are youWhat do you thinkPRENTICE Certainly Im not the most patient fellow in the world and I admit that your comments make me feel a bit foolishBut in the hope of improving myself let me question you further about morality and concentrationConcentration seems to be selfevident  steadiness or stability in meditationIs that wrongBHIKKHU TISSA Not so much wrong as incompleteConcentration is onepointed attention to an objectIt is that power by which the mind is fixed unwaveringly on whatever we wish to know and understandWe all possess this power to one degree or another or else we could never write a letter or ride a bicycle or perform any simple taskThe training in concentration that Buddhism speaks of is a systematic strengthening and development of this ordinary faculty until it becomes a powerful tool for uncovering truthIt is in fact indispensable for the development of wisdom which like everything else in the world does not arise out of nothing but from causes and conditionsOrdinarily our minds are scattered and weak without focus or purpose and unable to hold still long enough to examine anything in depthWe lack the necessary stillness and steadiness for the arising of wisdomWithout these conditions wisdom simply will not appear to usWhen we develop concentration we do not create wisdom but we make it possible for wisdom to occur just as a gardener does not create fruit but tends the plant so that fruit will result out of the workings of its own natureNow you seem to subscribe to the common notion that concentration is confined to the practice of meditation which you further presume to belong to a single compartment in Buddhist practiceOn the contrary concentration is appropriate and necessary in all our activitiesPRENTICE I suppose I hadnt thought of concentration being useful outside of specific mental exercises but now I must say that it does appear logically necessary for the attainment of wisdomThe solution to any problem certainly requires some amount of concentration and reflection and when the problem is as profound as that of human suffering I can see that concentration must be very intense indeedAll right so far this fits togetherBut as for morality Im still rather confusedWhy should morality be as indispensable as concentration and wisdomIt seems if youll pardon my saying so that morality is somehow peripheral to the main issueWhy should the Buddha consider morality so important in what is otherwise a rather scientific process of investigation and developmentBHIKKHU TISSA What makes you think that morality is not scientificPRENTICE Well its just not surelyI dont mean to denigrate it  its certainly praiseworthy  but I dont see how it possibly fits into the dispassionate process you have describedBHIKKHU TISSA MrPrentice the Buddha extolled moral behavior not because it provides some agreeable sauce for the main meal of wisdom but because it is indispensable  indeed a prerequisite  for any progress on the pathInterested newcomers like you are often struck by the rational or scientific nature of Buddhist philosophy but fail to grasp that Buddhist morality is equally rationalWe try to follow the moral precepts not out of sentimental attachment or deference to convention but simply because they are conducive to our own spiritual development and to the wellbeing of othersRemember to get anywhere we have to overcome obstructions to our understanding namely greed hatred delusion and all other defilements that spring from themWhat do you think  if we cannot control our overt behavior can we ever claim to control our own mindsPRENTICE No certainly notBHIKKHU TISSA There are a great many actions we can perform by thought word or deedSome we call good some evil some neutralFor instance to give charity is good to harm another person is evil to wash a frying pan is probably neutralPRENTICE This is common senseBHIKKHU TISSA Common sense but not only common senseWhat are good and evil after allJust conventional distinctionsAnd why do we recognize these distinctionsBecause one kind of action leads to pain woe misery and another kind of action leads to happiness wellbeing and peaceGood redounds to the benefit of oneself and othersEvil causes suffering for the evildoer and his victimsAm I wrongPRENTICE NoIts abundantly clear what kinds of actions cause woe or welfare in the worldBHIKKHU TISSA Morality MrPrentice is not just helpful for the practitioner of the path  it is essential being the foundation of concentrationAn immoral unrestrained person can never develop the power of concentration because his mind is constantly swarming with passionsHe is distracted deluded restless unable to settle down and examine himself in any systematic wayOn the other hand a person who does his best to follow the moral precepts enjoys a free conscience selfrespect and a weakening of the defilements which obstruct the inquiring mindMoreover by acting morally he begins to discover the spaciousness of a life not devoted to the gratification of selfish cravingThough he restrains himself he becomes freer though he denies himself he becomes richerThe Buddhas teaching of nonself begins to appear in his own experience  not merely as some remote theory  and thus he is prepared for the work of concentrationPRENTICE I confess I hadnt considered these matters as much as I should have before talking to youBHIKKHU TISSA No dont say thatIts right and proper for you to read to inquire to listen to gather all the useful information you can
