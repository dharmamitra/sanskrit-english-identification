They will eventually transcend the world and attain nirvāṇa The Buddha continued You gods and humans and people of the future who have received the Buddhas teachings should ponder them well Then all can take the right actions with an upright mind A ruler who cultivates virtue sets an example for his ministers who in turn command all subjects to maintain good conduct All should revere the holy and respect the virtuous and be kind and loving to others Do not fail the Buddhas teachings All should seek to transcend the world and uproot the evils of repeated birth and death leaving forever the immeasurable anxiety and agony through the three evil lifejourneys almsgiving observance of precepts endurance of adversity energetic progress meditation and development of wisdom You each should teach others who in turn will teach many others to uphold virtue and to rectify ones mind and intention If one observes the precepts with purity for one day and one night in this land ones merit exceeds that from doing good karmas for  years in Amitāyus Buddhas land Because that Buddha Land is pure and its inhabitants having no evil even as slight as a hair spontaneously accumulate good karmas If one cultivates virtue for ten days and ten nights in this land ones merit exceeds that from doing good karmas for  years in Buddha Lands in other directions Because most inhabitants of other Buddha Lands do good and few do evil With no place to do evil acquiring merit is their natural way of life However in this land are many evils and acquiring merit is not the natural way of life People toil painfully to satisfy their desires and they take advantage of one another Exhausted in body and mind they eat bitterness and drink poison Their evils never end I pity you gods and humans and painstakingly instruct you to cultivate virtue According to your capacities I guide you and teach you the Dharma for you to carry out so that you all will attain bodhi as you wish Wherever the Buddha visits in countries or settlements no one will fail to be transformed The world will be in harmony the sun and the moon will be bright and the winds and rains will be timely Natural disasters and epidemics will not strike The country will prosper and the people will live in peace rendering weaponry useless As people admire virtue and appreciate kindness they will learn to be courteous and to yield to one another The Buddha continued I pity you gods and humans more than parents are concerned about their children I now have become a Buddha in this world and I  destroy the five evils remove the five pains and eliminate the five burns I attack evil with virtue to end the suffering of repeated birth and death enabling all to acquire the five virtues and ascend to the peace  which is free from causes and conditions After I have left this world the Way to bodhi will gradually disappear People will resume their evil ways of sycophancy and falsehood and will experience the five pains and the five burns just as before I have only told you briefly about it The Buddha told Maitreya Bodhisattva You all should ponder and admonish one another in accordance with the Buddha Dharma not to violate it Then Maitreya Bodhisattva joined his palms and said What the Buddha has said is true People of the world are like that The Tathāgata out of lovingkindness and compassion enables us all to be liberated Having received the Buddhas solemn admonition we dare not defy or lose it The Vision of Amitāyus Buddha and His Land The Buddha told nanda Rise arrange your robe join your palms reverently and make obeisance to Amitāyus Buddha BuddhaTathāgatas in worlds in the ten directions all praise and acclaim that Buddha who has neither attachment nor hindrance Then nanda rose arranged his robe and stood properly facing the west He said WorldHonored One I wish to see that Buddha His Land of Peace and Bliss and the multitude of Bodhisattvas and voicehearers there As soon as he spoke these words Amitāyus Buddha emitted great radiance illuminating all Buddha Lands The vajra mountain range Sumeru the king of mountains and other large and small mountains all became the same color The radiance was like the water covering the world at the end of a kalpa when everything is submerged and one sees only an expanse of water That Buddhas radiance had the same effect The radiance of voicehearers and Bodhisattvas was entirely obscured and one saw only that Buddhas radiance brilliant and magnificent At that time nanda saw Amitāyus Buddha awesome and majestic like Sumeru the mountainking taller than all the worlds The radiance of his sublime appearance shone on everything As the four groups of ākyamuni Buddhas disciples in this assembly all saw Amitāyus Buddha and His land likewise all inhabitants of the Land of Peace and Bliss saw ākyamuni Buddha and His people in this Sahā World Then the Buddha asked nanda and Maitreya Bodhisattva Do you not see all the wonderful pure adornments in that land from its ground up to pure abode heavens nanda replied Yes I see them Do you not hear Amitāyus Buddha pronounce  aloud to all worlds to transform their sentient beings nanda replied Yes I hear Him People of that land ride a palace  yojanas in size made of the seven treasures to make offerings to Buddhas  in the ten directions unhindered Do you see this I see this replied nanda Some people of that land are reborn from the womb Do you see this I see this replied nanda Those who are reborn from the womb live in palaces  or  yojanas in size They each enjoy pleasures as naturally as if they were in Trayastriśa Heaven Doubts Causing a Rebirth from the Womb At that time Maitreya Bodhisattva asked the Buddha WorldHonored One why are people of that land reborn from the womb or reborn miraculously  The Buddha told Maitreya Bodhisattva There are sentient beings that wish to be reborn in that land but they accumulate merit with a mind of doubts They do not understand Buddha wisdom including the inconceivable wisdomknowledge the indescribable wisdomknowledge the vast Mahāyāna wisdomknowledge and the unsurpassed supreme wisdomknowledge They disbelieve in and doubt such wisdomknowledge Nevertheless they believe in sin and merit and they develop their roots of goodness wishing to be reborn in that land These sentient beings are reborn  and live a year lifespan in a palace They never see that Buddha nor do they hear the Buddha Dharma nor do they see the multitude of Bodhisattvas and voicehearers Therefore in that land this is called a rebirth from the womb Then there are sentient beings that believe in Buddha wisdom including the unsurpassed supreme wisdomknowledge They acquire merits and faithfully transfer their merits to others These sentient beings are reborn miraculously seated crosslegged in lotus flowers made of the seven treasures In an instant their physical features radiance wisdom and merits are as complete as those of the Bodhisattvas already there Moreover Maitreya in Buddha Lands in other directions are great Bodhisattvas who wish to see Amitāyus Buddha and His multitude of Bodhisattvas and voicehearers and to make offerings reverently to them These Bodhisattvas after death will also be reborn miraculously in Amitāyus Buddhas land in lotus flowers made of the seven treasures Maitreya know that those reborn miraculously have superior wisdom while those reborn from the womb have little wisdom For  years they do not see that Buddha nor do they hear the Dharma nor do they see the multitude of Bodhisattvas and voicehearers Unable to make offerings to Buddhas and ignorant of Bodhisattvas Dharma procedures they cannot acquire merit Know that all this is caused by their lacking wisdom and harboring doubts in their past lives The Buddha told Maitreya Bodhisattva As an analogy a WheelTurning King has a special palace adorned with the seven treasures It is furnished with beds curtains and silky canopies If young princes have offended the king they are detained in that palace chained with gold locks Just like a WheelTurning King they are provided with food and drink clothing and bedding flowers and incense and instrumental music without any shortage What is your opinion Do these princes enjoy staying there No replied Maitreya Bodhisattva using various methods they seek the strength to escape The Buddha told Maitreya Bodhisattva These sentient beings live in the same way Because they have doubts about Buddha wisdom they are reborn in that palace made of the seven treasures There is no punishment not even a single thought of evil However for  years they do not see the Three Jewels and are unable to make offerings or develop roots of goodness This is their suffering Although there are pleasures to spare they do not enjoy that place However if these sentient beings can recognize their initial sins reproach themselves and beseech to leave that place their wish will be fulfilled Then they can go to the place where Amitāyus Buddha is and can make offerings reverently They also can go to the places where innumerable countless Buddhas are to acquire merit Maitreya know that those who harbor doubts will lose great benefits Therefore one should recognize and believe in Buddhas unsurpassed wisdom Rebirth of Bodhisattvas from This and Other Lands Maitreya Bodhisattva asked the Buddha WorldHonored One how many Bodhisattvas in this world who are at the spiritual level of no regress have been reborn in that land The Buddha replied to Maitreya Bodhisattva From this world  koṭi Bodhisattvas who never regress have been reborn in that land Each of these Bodhisattvas has made offerings to innumerable Buddhas though less so than Maitreya Innumerable Bodhisattvas with lesser achievement and lesser merit will all be reborn there The Buddha told Maitreya Bodhisattva Not only from my land but also from Buddha Lands in other directions will Bodhisattvas be reborn in that land The first Buddha is called Shining Far whose  koṭi Bodhisattvas will be reborn there The second Buddha is called Treasure Store whose  koṭi Bodhisattvas will be reborn there The third Buddha is called Infinite Tone whose  koṭi Bodhisattvas will be reborn there The fourth Buddha is called Sweet Nectar Flavor whose  koṭi Bodhisattvas will be reborn there The fifth Buddha is called Dragon Victory whose  koṭi Bodhisattvas will be reborn there The sixth Buddha is called Victory Power whose  Bodhisattvas will be reborn there The seventh Buddha is called Lion whose  koṭi Bodhisattvas will be reborn there The eighth Buddha is called Immaculate Light whose  koṭi Bodhisattvas will be reborn there The ninth Buddha is called Virtue Leader whose  koṭi Bodhisattvas will be reborn there The tenth Buddha is called Wonderful Virtue Mountain whose  koṭi Bodhisattvas will be reborn there The eleventh Buddha is called King of Men whose  koṭi Bodhisattvas will be reborn there The twelfth Buddha is called Supreme Flower whose innumerable Bodhisattvas all at the spiritual level of no regress all with wisdom and valor having made offerings to innumerable Buddhas able to collect in seven days the firm dharmas practiced by great Bodhisattvas for  koṭi kalpas will be reborn there The thirteenth Buddha is called Fearlessness whose  koṭi great Bodhisattvas and innumerable bhikṣus and novice Bodhisattvas will be reborn there The Buddha told Maitreya Bodhisattva Not only will Bodhisattvas from these fourteen Buddha Lands be reborn there but also countless Bodhisattvas from innumerable Buddha Lands in the ten directions will be reborn there If I tell day and night only the names of Buddhas  in the ten directions and their Bodhisattvas and bhikṣus who will be reborn there I cannot finish the list in a kalpa I now have told you only in brief Circulation of the Sūtra The Buddha told Maitreya Bodhisattva If there is a person who having heard that Buddhas name is joyful and exuberant even for a single thought know that he has acquired great benefits and unsurpassed merits Therefore Maitreya even if there is an enormous fire filling this entire ThreeThousand Large Thousandfold World one regardless should cross the fire to hear this sūtra delight and believe in it accept and uphold it read and recite it and train accordingly Because there are many Bodhisattvas who wish to hear this sūtra but do not have access If sentient beings have heard this sūtra they will never regress from their resolve to attain the unsurpassed bodhi Therefore they should deeply believe in this sūtra accept and uphold it recite and pronounce it and carry out its teachings For the sake of sentient beings I have pronounced this sūtra and enabled them to see Amitāyus Buddha and everything in His land so that they can resolve to do what should be done and not allow doubts to arise after my parinirvāṇa In times to come the Dharma will be annihilated Out of lovingkindness and compassion I will specially save this sūtra and make it stay for a hundred years more Sentient beings that encounter this sūtra will all be delivered as they wish The Buddha told Maitreya Bodhisattva The appearance of a Tathāgata in the world is hard to encounter and hard to see The Buddha Dharma is hard to acquire and hard to hear The excellent Bodhisattva Dharma including the pāramitās is hard to hear as well To practice the Dharma after hearing it from a beneficent learned friend is also very hard To believe appreciate accept and uphold this sūtra after hearing it is the hardest of all Nothing is harder than this Such is my Dharma This is how it is pronounced and how it is taught In addition  nayuta people acquired the pure dharmaeye  Koṭi gods and humans achieved the third voicehearer fruit becoming Anāgāmins and  koṭi bhikṣus eradicated their afflictions and liberated their minds  Forty koṭi Bodhisattvas achieved the spiritual level of no regress adorning themselves with their great merits and vows They would in a future life attain true enlightenment Then the ThreeThousand Large Thousandfold World quaked in six different ways Great radiance illuminated everywhere in worlds in the ten directions One hundred thousand kinds of music spontaneously played and innumerable wonderful flowers rained down from the sky After the Buddha pronounced this sūtra the entire assemblyMaitreya Bodhisattva and the multitude of Bodhisattvas who came from worlds in the ten directions together with the Elder nanda and other great voicehearershaving heard the Buddhas words greatly rejoiced WorldHonored One today we are the sons of a dharma king and have gratefully received your teachings so that we may form correct views Pray do not abandon us like the abandoning of that king  s sons All we ask is that you abide here for some time and not enter nirvala WorldHonored One this is analogous to someone well studied in the literature but who is struck with fear when looking at this text The Tathagata is of course accomplished in all manner of dharmas but in regard to these dharmas also have fear So if we could but have the Tathagata remain in the world for some time expounding the timeless ambrosia of the dharma and fulfilling the needs of all then living beings would no longer fear falling into the hell realms WorldHonored One this is analogous to someone who has just begun to learn his trade but then finds himself arrested by officials and locked up in prison People ask him How are you taking all this He answers I am in agony  If only I could obtain my freedom I would be overj oyed WorldHonored One this is what it is like  You practiced all those austerities for our sake but at the moment we are as yet incapable of escaping the sufferings of sarpsara So how could the Tathagata accept the bliss  WorldHonored One this is analogous to a master physician skilled in Ayurvedic medicines and their application He passes on the secret medicinal preparations solely to his son and does not teach these things to his other pupils The Tathagata seems also to be like this you have taught the most profound and hidden treasury of doctrines solely to Maiijusrf and are abandoning us without consideration The Tathagata should not be like that master physician you should have no parsimony regarding the dharma as did regarding the secrets of his knowledge teaching it to his son to whom he is partial but not to his other students That physician is unable to teach what he knows openly due to a sense of success or failure within him that makes him secretive and resentful But there are never any thoughts of success or failure in the Tathagata so why will we not be instructed All we ask is that the Tathagata reside for some time and not pass into final nirvaa WorldHonored One this is analogous to some people that whether they are old young infirm or in distress choose to abandon the straight and true path for a steep and dangerous one This steep path is fraught with difficulty and will bring a great deal of pain and suffering But there is also someone else who sees all this and feeling sympathy and compassion for them immediately points out a road that is flat and easy to travel Lord we are just like those people  The socalled young in this example is a metaphor for those who have not yet nurtured their capacity to the point where they can realize the dharma body The old is a metaphor for those plagued by a buildup of the defilements The infirm represents those not yet free of the cycle of birth and death And the steep path is a metaphor for twentyfive forms of existence found within the cycle of birth and death All we ask Tathagata is that you lead us on the right path to the ambrosia of immortality Stay in the world for some time with us do not enter into nirvaa At that time the WorldHonored One addressed the assembly of monks Bhikus Do not be like the ordinary people or the gods for that matter who cry out in sorrow You must be diligent your minds concentrated and your thoughts upright Then having heard what the Buddha had said the gods humans asuras and the others stopped their weeping much like someone who mourns the loss of a child has reached a point where he can cry no more At that point the WorldHonored One uttered these verses for all to hear You should all open your minds You must avoid this great depression  The natures of buddhas are all like this So quiet down Rej oice in your assiduous practice Guard your thoughts direct your attention properly Distance yourself from all impropriety And take comfort in the joy you get   Furthermore bhius if you have any doubts at all now is the time to ask about them You may wonder if something is empty or nonempty permanent or impermanent painful or not painful a support or not a support gone or not gone a refuge or not a refuge eternal or not eternal if something is terminable or constant a living being or not a living being if something exists or does not exist if something is real or not real true or not true emancipated or not emancipated concealed or unconcealed or if something is dual or nondual If you have any doubts concerning one or more aspects of the dharma such as these I have j ust mentioned you should ask me now and I will accordingly erase those doubts for you After I have expounded the immortal ambrosia of the dharma to you then and only then will I enter nirvala Bhius it is extraordinary for a buddha to appear in the world It is rare to obtain a human body For you to meet a buddha and arouse faith such things are even more rare To be able to endure what is difficult to endure this is also rare To be able to fulfill the requirements of the rules of discipline perfectly without any lapses to attain the fruit of arhatship these things are also rare like searching for gold dust or an udumbara flower Bhius it is highly unusual that you have managed to avoid the difficult conditions of the eight inopportune births enabling you to obtain a human body  That you have encountered me should not be dismissed as insignificant Over a long time I have performed a variety of ascetic practices such that I have now obtained unsurpassed skillfulness in expedient means It is thus for your sake that in the course over innumerable kalpas I have tossed away my body my hands my feet my head my eyes and even my brain For that reason you must not be lazy Bhikus how does one adorn the jeweled castle of the truedharma Furnish it with a variety of rare gems of virtuous merit Make morality  meditation  and wisdom its walls moats and parapets Now that you have encountered this jeweled castle of the buddhadharma do not take it to be inauthentic That would be like a merchant who comes across a castle filled with genuine jewels but comes home instead with debris You may similarly come away with falsehoods from your encounter with this jeweled castle  Monks do not become complacent indulging in low thoughts  Although you have obtained ordination you have no yearning for the Mahayana Monks although you have succeeded in putting on iiya dyed robes your hearts have yet to be dyed in the pure teaching of the Mahayana Monks although you have practiced almsbegging and have moved around from place to place from the outset you have never begged for the dharmafood of the Mahayana Monks although you have removed the hair on your heads and chins you have yet to take up the truedharma to remove that which binds you to the world Monks I will now lay out the true teaching for you Now at this moment I am here this great assembly is harmoniously gathered together and the natural condition of the tathagatas is true and never in error For this reason you must be diligent focused courageous and put an end to the errors that bind you to the world When this wisdomsun with its tenfold powers sinks over the horizon and is gone you will be enveloped in the darkness of ignorance Monks just as the medicinal herbs of the mountains and the continents are there for living beings to make use of my dharma should be thought of in the same way This dharma that I have brought forth whose flavor is the sublime ambrosia of immortality is the ideal medicine for the various defilements that plague living beings From now I will tum all living beings into my own children The four groups should all be securely settled within the hidden treasury I too will be settled there whereupon I will enter nirvliIa Now what is this thing I call the hidden treasury It is something like the three dots that form the Sanskrit letter iif they were written in a horizontal line they would not form the letter i and if laid out vertically they would also fail to produce the letter Only when they are arranged like the three eyes in the face of Mahesvara will they form the letter i No other formulation will work I too am thus The dharma of liberation is not nirvaIa the body of the Tathagata is not nirvaIa and the spiritual wisdom of mahiiprajfiii is also not nirvaIa Each of these three dharmas is different each by itself is not nirvaIa It is because I am now settled in all three of these  dhannas that for the sake of living beings I enter nirvaQa as it is called just like the letter i is commonly understood At that time the bhikus upon hearing that the Buddha WorldHonored One would surely pass into nirvala were all despondent The hair on their body stood on end and tears welled up in their eyes Bowing down to the feet of the Buddha they circumambulated him numerous times and finally spoke up WorldHonored One You have readily explained the notions of impermanence suffering emptiness and nonself WorldHonored One just as among the footprints of all living beings there is nothing that surpasses the footprint of an elephant so too is the concept of impennanence paramount among all concepts Anyone who is diligent in his cultivation of this will be able to eliminate all craving in the realm of desire all attachment in the realms of fonn and nonfonn spiritual ignorance arrogance and even conceptions of impennanence itself WorldHonored One If the Tathagata has abandoned the concept of impennanence then he should not enter nirvala now If he has not abandoned it then why would he tell us that cultivating the concept of impennanence will free us from attachment ignorance arrogance and even the concept of impennanence itself in regard to the triple world WorldHonored One this is analogous to the fanner who plows his land deeply in autumn and is able to remove its weeds The concept of impennanence is also like this for it enables one to remove all craving in the world of desire and in the realms of fonn and nonfonn all attachment spiritual ignorance arrogance and even conceptions of impennanence itself WorldHonored One just like the fact that when plowing fields it is paramount to plow  a in autumn and among the footprints of living beings the footprint of the elephant is paramount among all conceptualizations the concept of impermanence is paramount WorldHonored One Suppose there is a sovereign who knowing his life was about to end grants pardons to the prisoners incarcerated under his rule and only after doing thi s does he relinquish his hold on life Should not the Tathagata now also respond in this way saving living beings from every confinement of their stupidity and spiritual ignorance enabling them all to attain liberation and only after doing that enter parinirviiIJa A l l of u s here have yet t o attain deliverance How could the Tathligata be on the edge of abandoning us to enter nirvlila just like that WorldHonored One it is like someone possessed by a demon Ifhe meets a good exorcist he will have the opportunity to be freed by means of the power of that master s incantations In like manner the Tathligata can remove the demons of ignorance from his srlivakas empowering them to settle themselves in the dharmas of great wisdom liberation and so forth j ust like the worldly letter i WorldHonored One it is like a rutting elephant held in captivity He cannot be restrained even by experienced trainers and could suddenly break any ropes or chains holding him and run away But we are not yet able to do thatwe have yet to throw off the fiftyseven defilements that bind us  So how could the Tathligata be on the edge of abandoning us to enter nirvlila WorldHonored One Just as someone suffering from malaria could have his pain eliminated after meeting a skilled physician we are in the same situation We suffer from a host of vexations improper ways of making a living and feverish illnesses And although we have encountered a tathligata our illnesses are yet to be healed we have yet to attain the unsurpassed peace and eternal bliss  How could the Tathligata be about to abandon and enter nirvlila He could not even distinguish those who were close to him from those who were nothe did not recognize his mother his daughter or his sister for example Abandoning himself to wild licentiousness he became impudent in his speech and would even lie down in the filth of his own excrement After taking the medicine he would disgorge the alcohol and return to his normal state of mind In his heart he would then feel ashamed and reproach himself deeply for his behavior Alcohol is not good the root of harmful things He knows that if he could only expunge it from his life he could distance himself from the wrongdoings he is wont to do Blessed One we are just like this From the ancient past we have transmigrated through the realm of birth and death intoxicated with physical pleasure and craving stimulation through our five senses We harbor notions of motherhood that are not what our mothers are we harbor notions of sisterhood that are not what our sisters are we harbor notions of what a daughter is that are not what daughters are and we create notions of what living beings are that are not what living beings are This is why we repeatedly transmigrate in this painful cycle of sarpsara lying down in the filth of our own excrement like that inebriated man If the Tathagata would only administer the medicine of the dharma to us now it would enable us to disgorge the harmful wine of the defilements And yet here we are having not yet attained this mind of awakening How could the Tathagata be on the verge of abandoning us to enter nirvaIa himself WorldHonored One it is like someone who appreciates the banana tree as something solid when in fact it is no such thing WorldHonored One living beings are like that They may appreciate a self a person an individual living being a life span a personality an observer an actor or an experiencerseeing them all as real  But in fact these are also falsely deduced  This is how we cultivate our consciousness of nons elf WorldHonored One these notions b are analogous to wine sedimentof no use whatsoever This body is like that as well without a self and without a master WorldHonored One j ust like the flower of the sevenleaved saptaparla tree has no scent this body has no self and no master as well In this way our thoughts are always directed toward cultivating the discernment of nonself It i s j ust as the Buddha has explained to us All dharmas are devoid of self or anything pertaining to self Monks you should cultivate this understanding for having done so will remove your egotism And after one has abandoned their egotism that person will thereupon enter nirvaIa WorldHonored One j ust as it makes no sense for someone to say that traces of the birds in the sky are visible it makes no sense that such views would be held by anyone capable of cultivating a consciousness of nonself At that point the WorldHonored One praised the bhikus saying Excellent excellent You have cultivated your discernment of nonself quite beautifully Then the bhikus spoke to the Buddha saying WorldHonored One We have not only cultivated our perception of nonself we have also cultivated other discerning perceptions that is we are concerned with what is suffering and what is impennanence in addition to what is nonself WorldHonored One Like an intoxicated person whose mind in a daze sees mountains rivers stone walls grasses and trees palaces houses the sun moon or stars as if they were all spinning round WorldHonored One anyone who does not cultivate his perception of suffering impennanence and nonself is disoriented and cannot be caned a noble seeker Undisciplined in many ways such a person transmigrates in the cycle of birth and death WorldHonored One these are the reasons why we carefully practice these discernments At that point the WorldHonored One said to the bhikus  Now listen carefully listen carefully  In the analogy of the intoxicated man that you just gave you have understood the written letters but you have not penetrated into what they mean What does this story mean It is that living beings on the whole are just like that intoxicated person who looking up at the sun and moon perceives them to be spinning when in fact they are not Blinded by defilement and ignorance they create misconceptions in the fonn of inversions in their thinking what is self they reckon as nonself what is constant or pennanent they reckon as impennanent what is pure they reckon as impure and what is joyful they reckon as painful Because are deluded by the defilements even if they recognize these they still do not comprehend what this means just like that intoxicated person who perceived something to be spinning when it was not Self is what buddha means Pennanence is what dhanna body means Bliss is what nirvala means  Purity is what dhanna means Bhikus why do you say To have any perception of self reflects arrogance and pride and leads to transmigration in sarpsara With that attitude when any of you declare I cultivate my perception of impermanence suffering and nonself these three types of practice will have no real meaning But now I will explain to you three special dh armas to cultivate instead When what is painful is regarded as joyful and what is joyful is regarded as painful that is an inverted dharma When what is impermanent is regarded as permanent and what is permanent is regarded as impermanent that is an inverted dharma When what is nonself is regarded as self and what is self is regarded as nonself that is an inverted dharma When what is impure is regarded as pure and what is pure is regarded as impure that is an inverted dharma It is because of these four inversions that peopIe do not understand the proper practice of dharma  c Bhikus when you are enveloped by a dharma of pain or suffering you can still entertain the notion of j oy or bliss when you are enveloped by a dharma of impermanence you can still entertain the notion of permanence when you are enveloped by a dharma of nonself you can still entertain the notion of self and when you are enveloped by a dharma of impurity you can still entertain the notion of purity The mundane world contains permanence bliss self and purity and the supramundane world also contains permanence bliss self and purity And while these words in the context of the dharma in the mundane world may have no meaning in the context of the supramundane world these words do have meaning Why is this It is because people are affected by these four inversions that they do not understand the meaning of the dharma in the mundane world And what is the reason for that It is because people in the mundane world are impacted by three inversionsperception reflection and theoryand thus they perceive suffering in what is joyous they perceive impermanence in what is permanent they perceive nonself in what is self and they perceive impurity in what is pure These are known as inversions and it is by means of them that written letters may function in the world yet their meanings remain unknown And what are those meanings Nonself denotes sarpsara Self denotes tathagata Impermanence denotes sravakas and pratyekabuddhas Permanence denotes the dharma body of tathagatas Pain denotes all other paths Bliss denotes nirvala itself Impurity denotes created dharmas Purity denotes the true teaching of the buddhas and bodhisattvas All these are what I call the noninversions It is by means of what is not inverted that one can understand the meaning of letters If you want to separate yourself from the four inversions you must understand permanence bliss purity and self in this way Then the bhius spoke up and addressed the Buddha thus  WorldHonored One The Buddha has expounded on the fact that by separating oneself from the four inversions one attains an understanding of permanence bliss self and purity The Tathagata himself now resides in a state eternally devoid of the four inversions and thus is fully cognizant of permanence bliss self and purity But if you are already fully aware of permanence bliss self and purity then why do you not remain with us for one kapa or even a half a kapa guiding us so that we may also leave behind the four inversions Instead we are going to be abandoned as you are now about to enter nirvala Tathagata if we would be given consideration and would be directed by you we would sincerely accept and practice your teaching  Tathagata if you enter nirvala how are we to establish ourselves in the pure brahmacarya practices while residing in these bodies of poison What we should do is follow the Buddha WorldHonored One to enter nirvala Then the Buddha said this to the bhius You should not use that kind of language I have entrusted the entire unsurpassed righteous dharma to Mahakasyapa This Mahakasyapa will be a great support for you Just as the Tathagata has been the ground of support for living beings Mahakasyapa will also become a ground of support for you This is analogous to a great king with many territories under his command who when he embarks on a j ourney to tour them entrusts everything to his chief minister The Tathagata is acting in this way when he entrusts the truedharma to Mahakasyapa You should also understand that the perceptions of impermanence and suffering that you have been cultivating are not true real ities The  situation is analogous to a group of people going out on a lake in boats to enjoy themselves in springtime and they inadvertently drop a jeweled necklace made of vaicjUrya into the water thereby losing it At that moment everyone j umps into the water to look for it Competing with one another in the water they grab rocks vegetation or gravel each declaring I have found it and jubilantly holding it up for all to see only then realizing that they have something else entirely as the necklace is still in the water By virtue of the power of the gemstones however the water becomes clear Everyone in the crowd can then see the necklace in the water just as if they were looking up into the sky and seeing the shape of the moon While all this is going on there is one wise man in the crowd who skillfully slips into the water and grabs the necklace Bhikyus thus you should not cultivate your ideas of impermanence suffering nonself impurity and so forth as if they were the true meaning  Just like those people who took rocks vegetation or gravel to be the jeweled necklace they were looking for you must carefully learn about expedient means so that wherever you are you can continually cultivate your perception of self as well as your perceptions of permanence bliss and purity You also need to understand that the forms of the four teachings that you have been studying are all inverted Those who want to obtain the truth need to cultivate their discernment of things just like the wise man who skillfully noticed what was really going on and brought up the jeweled necklace By this I am referring to your perception of self and your perceptions of permanence bliss and purity as well At that point the monks responded by saying to the Buddha WorldHonored One in the past you preached this to us All dharmas are devoid of self You should cultivate this understanding for having done so you will then leave behind your idea of self When you have abandoned your idea of self you will then leave behind your arrogance and one who abandons arrogance can gain entrance into nirvaIa What did that mean The Buddha said to the monks Excellent excellent It is well that you have inquired into the meaning of this matter in an effort to dispel your own doubts Consider this parable There was once a king of dull sensitivity and little wisdom was a physician whose nature was also rather stupid yet as the king was unable to distinguish such things he gave a very generous official salary This doctor treated a host of illnesses by simply prescribing milk for he did not understand the causes of the ailments with which he was faced Although he knew that milk was often not particularly efficacious as medicine whatever illness he encountered whether it was an illness of wind of cold of heatin each case he nevertheless administered milk And the king on his part could not discern if the physician himself understood what was beneficial or deleterious good or bad in his medicinal use of milk Now there also happened to be a brilliant physician in the kingdom who was quite proficient in all eight technical disciplines of healing He responded skillfully to whatever ailment he encountered because he was aware of all known medicinal treatments People came from great distances to see him It did not occur to the elder physician to seek him out for consultation instead the elder physician displayed arrogance and contempt toward him If you can agree to offer yourself in service to me for fortyeight years only after that will I teach you the practice of medicine The brilliant physician immediately accepted his proposal saying I will do as you say I will do as you say To the best of my ability I humbly offer to serve you  b The elder physician then brought him into as a visiting physician to see the king On that occasion the brilliant physician as a visitor proceeded to explain a variety of different treatments and techniques to the king saying o great king of course you understand how important it is to distinguish things carefully This dharma as such may be used to rule nations or this dharma as such may be used to cure illnesses  Upon hearing these words the sovereign realized at that moment that the elder physician was an imbecile lacking any knowledge of what he was doing He immediately sent him away ordering him banished from the country Thereafter he found that his respect for the visiting physician had doubled Now on his part this visiting physician thought to himself If I want to educate the king now is the right time to do so He then turned to the king and said Great king if you truly love me then please grant me one wish The king answered From being here at my right hand to any other rank whatever your heart desires I shall grant to you The visiting physician then said o king although you permit me every possible rank I would not dare to ask for so much Instead what I seek is a royal decree to be enforced throughout the nation stating that henceforth there shall be no more taking of milk for medicinal purposesas was prescribed by the elder physician Why do I ask for this It is because this medicine toxic with many harmful effects Therefore declare that if anyone insists on ingesting this form of medicine they are to be beheaded I shall immediately issue a proclamation for all the lands in my domain to the effect that without exception sick people are no longer allowed to use milk as medicine Anyone who takes it as medicine will lose The visiting physician at that point turned his efforts toward blending ingredients with different tastes to synthesize a number of medicines That is he based on tasted pungent bitter salty sweet and sour With them he treated a range of illnesses none of which were beyond his means to cure Not long after this however the king himself grew ill He immediately called for the physician saying I am now seriously ill racked with pain and it appears that I am about to die Can you do something to help me The physician divined the king  s illness and determined that milk should be prescribed He then addressed the king and explained The ailment that is causing the king so much discomfort is one that should be treated by drinking milk In the past I suspended the use of milk as medicine but that position was not entirely truthful If you could take some milk now it would be the best possible way of ridding yourself of this illness The king is now suffering from a debilitating fever and he should definitely drink milk for this The king then said to the physician Have you gone mad Are you stricken with fever yourself For you are saying that drinking milk will take away my illness  Before you called it poison so why would you tell me to drink it now Are you trying to deceive me The previous doctor praised but you called it poison and had me ban it Yet now you claim it is the best thing to cure what ails me If I were to do as you say it would mean that from the beginning the elder physician was clearly a better doctor than you  Then the visiting physician responded to the king with these words  o king you should not speak in that way It is like an insect that eats through wood in such a way that what he leaves behind is in the shape of a letter of the alphabet Theinsect is not aware if what he has left behind forms a letter or not and no intelligent person who sees this would cry out This insect knows letters or be particularly surprised by what he sees Great king you must understand that the old physician was like this He did not distinc guish one illness from another but merely gave milk to everyone as medicine so just as that insect whose path accidentally formed a letter  The previous elder physician did not understand what was beneficial or deleterious good or bad in the use of milk as medicine Then the king asked Why did he not understand this The visiting physician answered When milk is used as medicine it can have the harmful effect of poison or it can have the effect of amrta an ambrosia of immortality When would you say that milk is something that prevents death If a cow does not eat wine dregs slimy grass o r wheat tailings her calves will be strong If her pastures are neither high plains nor wet lowlands if she drinks from clear streams and is not forced to run if she is not placed in a herd together with bulls if her eating and drinking are regulated properly and she has a proper place to move about and sleep then her milk will be able to eliminate certain diseases In this case we can refer to milk as a fine amrta medicine that staves off death But excluding milk obtained in this manner all other forms of milk should be called toxic when used medicinally  After listening to his words the great king then praised him saying  Great physician excellent excellent Today for the first time I have understood what is good and bad beneficial and deleterious about prescribing milk as medicine He thereupon drank the milk given him and was subsequently cured of his illness Right away the king then issued a decree for the entire nation stating that from that point forward people should take medicinal milk as they had in the past When the citizens heard this they felt resentment however and discussing the matter among themselves said things like  Has the great king become possessed by a demon Is he mad Does he mean to deceive us by ordering us to drink milk once again Feeling angry the people all gathered at the king  s location  The king then spoke to them saying You should not give rise to feelings of anger toward me This matter of whether or not milk is to be prescribed medicinally all stems from the teachings of the physician There is no negligence on my part in this The ill all began to drink the milk prescribed for them as medicine and each found their ailments either eliminated or alleviated Monks you should understand that the Tathagata Worthy of Offerings of Right and Universal Knowledge with Clarity and Conduct Perfect Well Gone with Understanding of the World Unsurpassed Worthy Tamer of Men Teacher of Gods and Humans Buddha WorldHonored One is also like this I have appeared in the world as a great physicianking suppressing all heretical physicians  In the presence of a gathering of kings I thus announced myself saying I am the physicianking And out of my desire to subdue the nonBuddhist paths I therefore declared This is why the Tathagata proclaims nonself as part of his buddhadharma It is because I need to straighten out of living beingsbecause I am aware of their situationthat I expound the absence of self There are reasons why I also expound the presence of self just like that skilled physician who was well aware that milk may be either medicinal or nonmedicinal But what I am speaking of is not what ordinary people imagine the self to be Ordinary people or ignorant people suppose the self to be the a size of a thumb or perhaps a mustard seed or a speck of dust What the Tathagata explains the self to be is nothing like that Therefore when I preach dharmas are without self in truth they are not without self So what is this self  If a dharma is true real permanent autonomous a basis and its nature is immutable then that is what I call self Just like that great physician who correctly appreciated the medicinal value of milk for the sake of living beings the Tathagata similarly expounds the presence of a true and real self in dharmas This is how you four groups of followers should practice the dharma Chapter One Longevity Part  The Buddha once again addressed the bhikus Whatever doubts you may have about monastic discipline you should ask me now and I will explain things to bring you joy in satisfying your concerns  Having long since absorbed the fact that the original nature of all dharrnas is empty I thoroughly understand this On the other hand bhikus do not say that the Tathagata cultivates only the practice of emptiness as the original nature of dharrnas Once again he spoke to the bhikus  Whatever doubts you may have about the precepts you should come forward and ask about them now At that point some bhikus came forward and said WorldHonored One we do not have the wisdom to be able to ask a Tathagata One Worthy of Offerings Perfectly Enlightened One Because the realm that the Tathagata is inconceivable to us the samiidhis that the Tathagata has are inconceivable to us and the teachings that the Tathagata explains are inconceivable to us That is why we do not possess the wisdom that would enable us to ask the Tathagata a question WorldHonored One suppose for example there was a old man one hundred and twenty years of age who suffered from longstanding health problems and who was confined to bed unable to get up from a prone position His energy is depleted his life nearly finished At that time a wealthy person with some connection to this old man who had wanted to visit for some time finally appeared at his home Handing over a hundred pounds of gold to the old man he made this request I have to go away and would like you to hold this gold for me Could I ask you to return it to me when I come back though it may be ten years or even twenty years before I return The old man agreed and accepted the gold Yet he had no offspring and it was not long before his illness deepened and his life ended What had been entrusted to him then became utterly lost When the owner of the gold finally returned he looked for the gold but found nothing This is an example of how an ignorant person may not know how to judge what can and cannot be safely entrusted to another for after his return search as he may that owner could not find his gold This is why he lost his wealth b WorldHonored One we sravakas are in such a situation Although we hear the Tathagatas carefully crafted teachings and precepts we are not entirely able to accept and maintain them and thus we are unable to ensure that the dharma will remain over a long period of time much like how that old man accepted what the other person had entrusted to him but could not ensure its safekeeping for very long  At this point we are so ignorant when it comes to monastic discipline what could we possibly ask about The Buddha said to the bhilus But if you were to ask me something now it would be beneficial for all living beings For that reason I instruct you to allow yourself the liberty to freely ask me about whatever it may be that you have doubts about Then the monks did speak up saying to the Buddha WorldHonored One this situation is also analogous to that of someone who is twentyfive years old robust and sharp He has a great deal of wealth in gold silver and vaiciurya precious stones his father mother wife children and his relatives are all alive and with him Then someone comes and entrusts him with some jeweled valuables explaining to this young man Due to certain circumstances I need to go away When those matters have finished I will return and you can return these things to me then On that occasion the healthy young man the valuables and proceeds to protect them as if they were his own possessions But then unexpectedly he becomes ill whereupon he turns to his family members and issues this order This gold and these jewels have been entrusted to me by someone else If he comes looking for them give them all back to him Thus does a wise person know well how to plan for such things When someone goes away and then returns looking for what he left behind he should be able to regain possession of it without any fear of loss For the WorldHonored One it is also like this For if you entrust the jewel of the dharma to Ananda and the other bhikus it cannot abide for long Because without exception all sravakas even Ananda and Mahakasyapa are impermanent It would be just like entrusting valuables to that old man who agreed to accept them F or thi s reason the unsurpassed dharma of the Buddha should be entrusted to the bodhisattvas By means of their dialogic inquiry and reply at which they are so adept the jewel of the dharma under their care will abide through incalculable thousands of kalpas And during that time it will surely grow and flourish bringing benefit and comfort to living beings j ust like that healthy man who accepted the valuables from another and made provisions for them to be kept beyond his own lifetime  It is in this sense that we wonder how even great bodhisattvas could put forth questions to you our wisdom is analogous to that of a mosquito How could we presume to be able to inquire about the profound teaching of the Tathagata Then the sravakas became silent remaining where they were Then the Buddha praised the monks saying Excellent excellent Well have you attained minds without contamination the minds of arhats I have also thought about the circumstances of these two groups and accordingly I take the Mahayana and entrust it to the bodhisattvas enabling this wondrous teaching to remain in the world for a very long time Sons and daughters of good families my life span cannot be measured nor can the eloquence of my pleasant speech be exhausted You should therefore feel free to seek clarification At that time there was a bodhisattvamahasattva in the crowd originally from the village of Tala Known as Mahakasyapa he was a brahman and still young in years Through the Buddha s special powers he rose from his seat threw his robe over his right shoulder and circumambulated the Buddha for a hundred thousand paces before kneeling before him with his right knee on the ground pressing his palms together and speaking thus WorldHonc ored One I now have a few questions I would like to ask If the Buddha permits I would dare speak The Buddha then said to Kasyapa The Tathagata has omniscient knowledge and knows that which you will ask I will expound on these matters for you to remove your doubts and bring you joy Then the bodhisattvamahasattva Kasyapa addressed the Buddha as follows  WorldHonored One the Tathagata takes pity on us and listens to our queries I know that my wisdom is slight no more than that of a mosquito and the virtue of the Tathagata and WorldHonored One towers like a mountain is pure like sandalwood like a lion difficult to subdue and his followers cannot be put asunder The body of the Tathagata is like a true vajra diamond resembling vaiiiirya its appearance and truly difficult to destroy In addition he is surrounded by a great ocean of wisdom and within that assembly are numerous great bodhisattvamahasattvas who all accomplish merit so wondrously immeasurably and without limit that they are like fragrant elephants Who would dare to stand before such a community to ask a question But in order receive the supernatural power of the Buddha by means of the spiritual power emanating from the good karmic roots of this great assembly I will endeavor to ask some minor questions Then directly facing the Buddha Kasyapa asked the following questions in verse How does one gain long life and An adamantine indestructible body By means of what causal principles Does one attain such solid power How can this sutra Bring us to the ultimate to the other shore We beseech the Buddha to reveal these secrets For a wide range of living beings How does one achieve something so grand That he becomes a spiritual support for other living beings When in truth someone is not an arhat How can he have the capacity of an arhat How can we understand the deity Mara Who creates obstacles for living beings A Buddha utterance and a Paplyas utteranceBy what understanding can we distinguish them What are the controls within ourselves For rej oicing and expounding the Truths How might our good karmic acts be so thoroughly accomplished That we explicate the four inversions  How does one create good karma Great Sage please explain this now How can the bodhisattvas Manage to see the nature of what is difficult to see How can one grasp the meanings of Complete syllables and halfsyllables How can we pair sacred observances Like the siirasa and kiicilindi birds The sun and moon and The planets Venus and Jupiter How is it that someone who has yet to commit to the path Is still called a bodhisattva In the midst of a large community  a How can one attain fearlessness Like gold from the Jambii River With which no one can find fault Where in this sullied world Are those as immaculate as a lotus flower Where among those having the defilements Are those whom the defilements cannot stain Who can be like physicians treating illnesses Yet not afflicted by those illnesses How in this great ocean of birth and death Can one become the captain of his ship How can one j ettison salpsara Like a snake shedding its skin How should we contemplate the Three Jewels So they become like wishfulfilling trees for the gods If the three vehicles are without selfnature Then how do we then explain them Concerning the nonorigination of the bliss  Why is it said that one acquires bliss  How can bodhisattvas Create a community that is not fractured How is it that people born blind Can nonetheless create eyes to guide themselves How should we express our many faces When we seek only for the Great Sage to preach How can our preaching of the dharma Expand like a moon growing fuller each day How can we also express The ultimate that is nirvaQa How can we show courage Toward humans gods and Maras How should we understand the dharmanature Even as we accept our longing for the dharma How can bodhisattvas Distance themselves from all illness How can we for other living beings Unpack these mysteries How can we explain the ultimate As well as what is not ultimate If one cuts through one  s web of uncertainty Why is this not spoken of as definitive How should we approach The path to the supreme and unsurpassed  I now beseech the Tathagata On behalf of the bodhisattvas Hoping for an exposition of great depth And subtlety about our practice Within each and every dharma Is a nature tranquil and j oyous I humbly implore the Honorable Great Sage To explain this to us in some detail  o Great Support for living beings Most Honored One on Two Legs Wondrous Remedy I now want to ask about the aggregates Yet I lack the wisdom to do so Diligent are the bodhisattvas But they too cannot understand  Such things are profound indeed b It is the realm of budd has  At that time the Buddha praised the bodhisattva Kasyapa Excellent excellent Good man you have yet to attain omniscient knowledge but as one who has already attained this I know that what you are asking about is a profound and hidden treasure Good man it was when I sat down at that seat of enlightenment under the bodhi tree that I first attained true awakening At that time there were present bodhisattvas in buddha realms as innumerable as the grains of sand in asarrzkhyeya Ganges Rivers and they also asked me about its profound significance The impact of their words were in all cases no different in merit from those you have spoken today for asking questions such as yours in turn benefits innumerable living beings The Nirvana Sutfa Volume I At that time Kasyapa once again addressed the Buddha saying WorldHonored One I lack the power of wisdom to be able to ask the Tathagata anything of such a profound nature WorldHonored One a mosquito is incapable of traversing enough sky to cross an ocean to its far shore and I am like that I am quite incapable of asking the Tathagata about the deepest meanings in the ocean of your wisdom in the sky of your dhannanature WorldHonored One when a king takes out the jewels he wears in his hair and entrusts them to the treasury official responsible for storing them that treasury official reveres enhances and protects what he has been given In like manner will I revere enhance and protect the profound significance of the wellbalanced expounded by the Tathagata Because it will enable me to gain deep wisdom on a grand scale At that time the Buddha said to Kasyapa Good man listen carefully Listen carefully  I will now explain for you the acts that led to the Tathagata s gaining this long life A bodhisattva obtains a long life by means of the causality in his kanna For that reason you should concentrate and listen carefully If you can establish a proper kannic cause for bodhi then by all means you should listen carefully to the meanings  And having heard and absorbed this you can turn to communicating it to others Good man it is because I cultivated proper behavior in this way that I attained anuttarii samyaksallbodhi and now once again I shall disseminate this doctrine to all Good man this is analogous to a prince who commits a crime and is detained in prison and the king whose intense pity and affection toward his beloved son brings him to redirect his carriage to that place of detention Bodhisattvas are like this If they desire to obtain long life they must protect all living beings just as if those beings were their own children Bringing forth great sympathy  great compassion ii great sympathetic joy  and great equanimity  a bodhisattva bestows upon them the precept against killing and teaches them how to practice what are wholesome dhannas You should also finnly establish all living beings in the five moral precepts and ten aspects of good character In addition you should enter all realms  including the realms of hell hungry ghosts animals and asuras so that you may also relieve the suffering living beings there liberating anyone not yet liberated saving anyone not yet saved enabling anyone not in nirvaJa to attain nirvaJa Calming all forms of fear is the type of karmic causality that causes bodhisattvas to then attain extremely long lives to gain freedom in all forms of wisdom and to be reborn in a heavenly realm when this lifetime comeS to an end At that time the bodhisattva Kasyapa addressed the Buddha again and said WorldHonored One the meaning of your explanation that the bodhisattvamahasattvas should view living beings as their own children is profound but somewhat opaque for I cannot quite understand it WorldHonored One the Tathagata should not tell bodhisattvas to cultivate impartiality toward living beings regarding them as his children Why do I say this Because within the Buddha s dharma there are those who violate the precepts commit heinous crimes or malign the truedharma How could perceive such people to be the same as your own children The Buddha then responded to Kasyapa But it is so it is so  I perceive living beings truly as children of mine just like my own son Rahula The bodhisattva Kasyapa then said WorldHonored One once in the past during the upaviisa confessional ceremonies on the fi fteenth day of the month a small boy appeared just when the community was engaging in the purifying ritual of precept recitation He was not there to cultivate wholesome practices in action speech or thought but surreptitiously listened to the discussion on the precepts while standing off in the shadows of the corner of the room Then Guhyapada VajrapaJi using the Buddha s supernatural power picked up his vajra mallet and crushed the boy into dust WorldHonored One this vajrapiiIJis extreme act of violence led to the taking of the life of this small boy How can the Tathagata say that you view all living beings as identical to your son Rahula after something like this  The Buddha answered Kasyapa by saying Now you should not speak that way That child was not a real person but only temporarily incarnated there as a human in order to drive off those who transgress the precepts and are harmful to the dharma by forcing them to leave the community Guhyapada Vajrapali was likewise only an apparition Kasyapa I look upon those who malign the truedharma the icchantikas those who kill living beings those who hold false views and those who committed crimes in the past in the same way which is that I regard them all with same compassion I have for Rahula Good man there are examples of kings who cannot set aside the need to mete out capital punishment when the crime requires it even when those who violate the law are government officials but a worldhonored tathagata is not like that banishment from the monastery for improper conduct censure for quarreling with fellow monks probation for too many precept violations restriction of activities for offensive behavior toward a householder suspension for not recognizing one  s own transgressions revocation of monastic privileges for not confessing precept violations and suspension for not abandoning wrong views Good man the Tathagata chastises those who debase the dharma in order to show such people that there are moral consequences to engaging in bad behavior Good man understand that at the same time the Tathagata does this without instilling fear in these wicked living beings for I also shine one two perhaps even five beams of light  Anyone who personally encounters this light will and will walk away from all such bad behavior A tathagata is equipped with immeasurable strength to perform such deeds Good man if there is some teaching that you have not yet seen but wish to I will now show you its face After my parinirviila depend l a ing on the area there will be some bhius who keep the precepts whose comportment is impeccable and who take responsibility for preserving the dharma When they see someone who is hostile to the dharma and respond by temporarily expelling that person  or by censure or by chastisement you should understand that the will gain a measure of merit beyond calculation Good man thi s is analogous to a king who had been violent and wicked throughout his reign who then falls seriously ill The king of a neighboring state well aware of this king  s reputation decides it is time to raise an army to destroy him completely At that point the sick king is so debilitated as to be powerless but stricken with fear he undergoes a change of heart and begins to do good deeds In such a case as this the neighboring king has gained immeasurable merit The monks who preserve the dharma are j ust like this By expelling or censuring those who violate the Law it enables those same people to practice the dharma properly bringing merit beyond measure Good man suppose for example poisonous plants start growing in the fields of an upright householder s place of residence When the householder becomes aware of the situation straight away he will then cut them down to get rid of them forever Or when a man in the prime of life finds white hairs growing on his head he becomes embarrassed and cuts them or pulls them out preventing them from growing any longer Supporting the dharma monks is j ust like this When you see someone who has violated the precepts or injured the truedharma then you must take punitive steps such as temporarily removing that person from the community or censuring him If a good monk sees someone acting in a way that is inj urious to the dharma and decides to leave him be rather than taking steps to have him reprimanded by temporary removal or censure understand that the monk who observes the bad behavior but does nothing is an enemy within the dharma of the Buddha If you can reprimand by temporarily expulsion or censure then you will be a disciple of mine for you have heard my true voice The bodhisattva Kasyapa then addressed the Buddha once more saying But WorldHonored One we still cannot regard all living beings as identical to our own children in the way you describedthat is as you regard your own son Rahula WorldHonored One one person may pick up a sword to injure the Buddha and another person may take sandalwood paste to worship the Buddha and the Buddha looks upon these two with impartiality Why then do you also say we must admonish or censure  Ifwe censured them we would then be violating your doctrine  The Buddha then imparted this to Kasyapa Good man consider for example sovereigns important officials or grand councilors who are raising children that are physically attractive graceful discerning and intelligent What if they entrust two three or four of their children to a strict teacher with these words Please educate and train all these children for me Teach them deportment ceremonial behavior the arts textual studies and mathematics in a way that will enable all of them to succeed If it should happen that three of the four charges I give to you now take ill from being caned and die then make sure that you do not hold back in disciplining the remaining child so that he is able to accomplish his goals For though I may mourn the loss of three of my children in the end I will not hold this against you Kasyapa would that father and that teacher be guilty of the crime of murdering those children Indeed no they would not WorldHonored One Because the children were brought to this teacher out of love and the desire to have them accomplish their studies there was no evil intent Teaching children like this brings immeasurable blessings I look upon those acting in ways that are destructive of the dharma as if they were all equally my only child Now the Tathagata is about to entrust this unsurpassed truedharma to kings high officials grand councilors monks nuns laymen  b and laywomen Kings high officials and the four groups of Buddhist followers should work to encourage students to attain the highest level of morality meditation and wisdom If there are who do not study these three teachings who are lazy who violate the precepts or who malign the truedharma the king and the four groups of believers should punish them Good man would the sovereigns of nations or the four groups of believers be committing transgressions if they took action in this way or not They would not WorldHonored One Good man a s neither kings nor the four groups o f believers would incur any karmic sin  how could a tathagata Good man a tathagata thoroughly engages in equanimity toward all living beings recognizing them as if they were all no different from his only child Those who engage in this way are called bodhisattvas who cultivate impartiality toward all living beings recognizing each of them as equal to their only child Good man bodhisattvas who train in this way obtain long lives and are also able to know the events of their former lifetimes The bodhisattva Kasyapa then spoke to the Buddha again WorldHonored One as the Buddha has explained it if bodhisattvas cultivate impartiality in which all living beings are seen as their own children then those bodhisattvas will gain long life But the Tathagata should not speak in such a manner Because among individuals who know the dharma some of whom even preach on various ways of following the norms of filial duty there are those who return home and then pick up a tile shard or a rock and throw it at their mother or father So while that follower  s mother and father may be fields of blessings for him and from whom he derives great benefitsin essence people so rare he may never encounter anyone like them againthis individual nevertheless does not pay homage to them as he should but instead causes them agony and inj ury What the Tathagata has expounded amounts to something like this saying that bodhisattvas who cultivate a mind of equanimity toward all living beings will attain a long life and the ability to know their past lives and forever reside in the world without change But for some reason the WorldHonored One now has a lifetime whose length is quite short no different from anyone else  Might the Tathagata have some sense of resentment toward living beings WorldHonored One what action of yours in the past was so bad that its karmic outcome would result in severing your life faculty For this life you have obtained is so short as to have lasted less than one hundred years The Buddha answered Kasyapa Good man why would you speak in such a harsh way before a tathagata The long life of a tathagata is the best among all long lives The permanent dharma that I have obtained is first among everything permanent The bodhisattva Kasyapa then addressed the Buddha again saying WorldHonored One in what way has the Tathagata attained a long life The Buddha answered It is like the eight great rivers The first is called Ganga  the second is called Yamuna  the third is called Sarayu  the fourth is called Aj iravatI the fifth is called MahI the sixth is called the Sindhu  the seventh is called Vaku  and the eighth is called SIta These eight large rivers and a great many small rivers all  c empty into the great ocean Kasyapa the life spans of everyonehumans gods and even those out in spaceall eventually flow like great rivers into the ocean that is the life span of the Tathagata That is precisely why the life span of the Tathagata cannot be measured Moreover Kasyapa j ust like Lake Anavatapta supplies water for the four great rivers  the Tathagata supplies life for everyone Kasyapa j ust as among the eternal dharmas it is space that comes first among everything permanent it is the Tathagata that is first Kasyapa Just as cream on the surface of clarified butter is first among medicines so is the Tathagata for his life span is first among living beings The bodhisattva Kasyapa then addressed the Buddha again WorldHonored One if the Tathagatas life span is as you have described then should not the Tathagata reside either for one more kalpa at least something close to a kalpa so as to continually disseminate the wondrous dharma like the pouring down of a great and opportune rain  Now Kasyapa you should not hold an image in your mind of the Tathagata in terms of his life ending Kasyapa if a monk nun layman laywoman or even someone of another path attains the freedom of the five supernatural powers that person may reside either for one more kaipa or something less than another kaipa may course through the air sitting or lying down as they please emit fire from their left side and pour out water from their right side or produce smoke and flames from their bodies just as in a real conflagration Such people are capable of living as long as they want or are free to make their lives brief If someone endowed with these special abilities has the spiritual power to do whatever he pleases would not the Tathagata have the power to deal with any and all things as he likes Would he be not capable of living for half the length of a kaipa or for an entire kaipa or for a hundred kaipas a hundred thousand kaipas or innumerable kaipas F or this reason you should understand that a tathagata is a permanently abiding dharma an immutable dharma This body of the Tathagata that you see now is only a transformational body it is not a body nourished by any sort of food It is in order to save living beings that I show my body as identical to a poisonous tree thus will I demonstrate the abandonment of this form and the entry into nirvala Kasyapa you should understand the Buddha to be a permanently abiding dharma an immutable dharma And it is within this context of that which is of ultimate significance that all of you should devote yourselves to your practice with singleminded commitment and when you have completed your practice disseminating the teaching to others At that point the bodhisattva Kasyapa said to the Buddha WorldHonored One what is the difference between the dharmas transcending this world and the dharmas occurring in this world Just as the Buddha stated Buddha is a permanently abiding dharma an immutable dharma among the worldly teachings it is also said  The deity Brahma is permanent the deity Isvara is permanent and immutable I am permanent my nature is permanent the very atoms of my existence are permanent If as you say a tathagata is a permanent dharma then why is the Tathagata s presence impermanent If you are not a permanent presence then in what way are you distinct Why do I say this Because Brahma and the worldly nature of the tiniest atoms are also not manifest The Buddha told Kasyapa Suppose for example there was a rich merchant who had a considerable collection of cattle Though their colors were varied and there were  a different types of cows among them they formed a single herd The merchant entrusted control over the cows to herdsmen who led them to water and grass as needed The herdsmen churned the milk  and ate it themselves Now when the merchant  s life came to an end all the cows in his possession were stolen by a group of thieves After securing the herd they ended up churning the milk themselves as they had no wives to do it for them  Then they would sit down to eat and as they did the thieves would speak among themselves saying That rich merchant raised these cows but not because he sought milk or yogurtit was only for the sarpirmarqa But how are we supposed to get that That creamy froth is said to have the best flavor of anything in this world but we have no vessel for preparing it  And even if we were to obtain it from this milk there would be no place to store it Their conversation continued All we have are these leather bags We could fill them but even if they were filled with milk we still do not know how to churn it Then the thieves took what could have become sarpirmwuja and they added water to it But because they added so much water they lost whatever chance they had of making yogurt or sarpirmauja This is what ordinary people are like While they may have the good dharma whatever they have of it is what remains of the Tathagata s truedharma Why do I say this Because after the Worldhonored Tathagata enters nirvala they will steal the remaining good dharma he leaves behindbe they teachings on morality meditation or wisdomjust like the thieves who looted the herd of cows  But although ordinary people have obtained the Buddha s teachings on morality meditation and wisdom they lack the skills that would enable them to attain liberation by means of these teachings With their attitude they simply cannot obtain the permanent morality the permanent meditation or the permanent wisdom that is liberation j ust like that group of thieves who did not know the means by which to acquire sarpirmwuja and so lost  In addition much like the thieves decision to add water to the milk in order to produce sarpirmauja ordinary people also do things out of ignorance For the sake of liberation they speak of nirvala as being a soul a living being a life force a spirit Brahma ISvara an atom a nature a precept a meditation wisdom liberation or the heaven of neither thought nor nonthought But in fact these people have attained neither liberation nor nirvala They are no more than the group of thieves who did not obtain sarpirmwuja These ordinary people do engage in some sacred practices honoring their mother and father  on the basis of which they attain rebirth in a heaven and receive a modicum of peace and joy there But like the group of thieves that added water to milk just so do ordinary people not actually understand why it is due to cultivating even a few sacred practices honoring their parents that they can attain birth in a heavenly realm Nor can they understand morality meditation and wisdom or taking refuge in the Three Jewels And because they do not understand when I speak of permanence bliss self and purity they may repeat what I have said but in fact they do not understand what they are talking about Therefore I want you to know that after the Tathagata passes from this world at that time there will be such people who lecture on the topic of permanence bliss self and purity But if a king who turns the wheel of the dharma were to appear in the world through the strength of his virtue this group of thieves would be forced to withdraw and abandon the cows which in tum would thereupon suffer no further harm At that time the wheelturning king would take all the cows and assign them to a highly skilled herdsman This person will know the means by which to extract sarpirmaruja and because of this sarpirmafJrja the lives of all living beings  b will be without pain or stress When a dharma wheeltuming king appears in the world ordinary people will no longer be able to preach about morality meditation or wisdom they will retreat from such activities just as the cattle thieves retreated Were a tathagata to appear in the world and thoroughly explain to living beings the ordinary worldly teaching as well as the extraordinary transcendent teaching it would enable bodhisattvas to follow him and preach these things on their own Once those bodhisattvamahiisattvas obtain that most excellent sarpirmafJrja they would go on to bring an incalculable number of other living beings to where they too obtained the unsurpassed timeless ambrosia of the dharma that is the permanence bliss self and purity of a tathagata Good man this is what I mean when I say that the Tathagata is permanent and immutable which is not the permanent dharma meant when a common ordinary or ignorant person refers to Brahmii or other deities When someone invokes permanent dharma in the way I am speaking of here it calls forth the Tathagata and not any other dharma KaSyapa you should understand a tathagata body in this way KaSyapa good men and good women should always focus their thoughts on cultivating understanding of these two words the Buddha permanently abides KaSyapa when a good man or good woman cultivates these two words know that such a person is following that which I have practiced and will reach the same place that I have reached Good man if ones practice of these two words comes to an end understand that for that person the Tathagata enters parinirvafJa Good man the meaning of nirviiQa is none other than the dharmanature or natural condition of all buddhas The bodhisattva Kasyapa then addressed the Buddha saying WorldHonored One what is the sense of this natural condition of buddhas WorldHonored One I would now like to understand what this means The only request I have is for the Tathagata to take pity on us and explain this in detail The abandonment of his body is the natural condition  This natural condition includes the buddha relinquishing his body but relinquishing his body means there will be nothing there and if nothing is there then in what sense does his body exist And if this is the natural condition of his body then how does it obtain existence  How should I now understand the meaning of these things The Buddha then replied to the bodhisattva Kasyapa Good man you should not speak of cessation as the natural condition  There is no cessation in their natural condition Good man it is like postulating about deities in the heaven of nonideation who attain material bodies yet have no notion of materiality You should not ask such things as Where do all these deities reside Do they enj oy themselves How do they act and think How do they see and hear Good man the realm of the tathagatas is beyond anything even the sravakas and pratyekabuddhas can understand Good man you should not speak about the body of a tathagata as a dharma that disappears For good man dharmas that disappear in this way belong to the realm of buddhas and not the realms of sravakas or pratyekabuddhas Good man you should not speculate where tathagatas might reside where they go what they see or what they enj oy Good man the meaning of these things is beyond the extent of your knowledge The dharma bodies of buddhas have a variety of skillful means that simply cannot be conceptualized  c In addition good man you should cultivate a notion of the buddha dharma and sangha as all being permanent These three dharmas are not different notions they are not impermanent notions and they are not notions that change There will be no foundation to the three pure refuges of someone who regards these as different All the restrictions and precepts will not remain with them and in the end they will be unable to realize the fruits of bodhi on the paths of the sravaka or the pratyekabuddha If on the other hand one can incorporate this inconceivability into their cultivation of this notion of permanence that person s refuge will be genuine Good man it is like saying because there is a tree there is a shadow of a tree Tathagatas are also like this Because they are permanent dharmas they thus serve as a refuge for living beings They are not impermanent when it is claimed that tathagatas are impermanent they then cease to be the foundation for the refuge of both people and deities The bodhisattva Kasyapa then asked the Buddha WorldHonored One there is also the metaphor of the tree in the dark that has no shadow Kasyapa you should never say there is a tree with no shadow It is only that the shadow is not visible to your physical eye Good man the Tathagata is like this His nature is something that abides permanently without change But without the eye of wisdom this cannot be seen just like the shadow of a tree is not visible in the darkness Ordinary people will claim after the Buddha has disappeared that this shows the Tathagata is an impermanent dharma Time and time again I will be spoken of in this way But if you say that the Tathagata is somehow different from the teachings and the community that itself precludes the establishment of taking the triplerefuge It is like saying that because your mother and father are different therefore that makes them impermanent Once again the bodhisattva Kasyapa addressed the Buddha WorldHonored One from now on I will regard the buddha dharma and sangha as three entities that abide eternally I will enlighten my father and mother about this and make sure that they and the next seven generations maintain this understanding with reverence How special this is WorldHonored One that I should now be able to learn the inconceivable nature of the tathagatas the teachings and the community If there are people who cannot accept this let it be known that I will be like frost or hail to any colleague who devotes their time to cultivating an understanding of as impennanent At that time the Buddha praised the bodhisattva Kasyapa Excellent excellent You are now well equipped to protect and sustain the truedharma Those who support the dharma in this way do not deceive others And those who do not deceive others wholesome kannic conditions for which they obtain long lifetimes and clear knowledge of their past livesChapter Two The Adamantine Body At that time the WorldHonored One once again addressed Kasyapa saying Good man the body of a tathagata is a permanently abiding body an indestructible body an adamantine body it is not a body sustained by food of any sort In other words it is a dharma body The bodhisattva Kasyapa said to the Buddha WorldHonored One I do not see anything like the bodies that you have just enumerated All that I can see is a body that is impermanent destructible made up of atoms which consumes different foods and so forth Because the Tathagata is about to enter nirvala The Buddha said Kasyapa Now you must not say that the Tathagata s body is not solid that it is subj ect to destruction like the body of an ordinary person Good man you should be aware of the fact that the body of a tathagata has become hardened and difficult to destroy over an immense period of timehundreds of millions of kapas It is not like the body of a human or a god nor is it a body bound by fear nor is it a body that consumes any sort of food It is not visible it has no external form A tathagata saves all living beings and yet does not save anyone which is why he is able to liberate living beings He does not liberate anyone which is why he awakens living beings He does not awaken anyone which is why the dharma he preaches accords with reality He is nondual and therefore immeasurable unequaled evenly consistent like space completely without shape of the same nature as nonarising He does not cut off what is not permanent he always courses in the single vehicle though living beings see three  He does not retrogress and does not turn away from cutting through all fetters nor does he confront or contact anyone He is without any nature and abides in that nature He is neither combined nor dispersed neither long nor short neither round nor square He is not made of aggregates  sense bases  or sense realms and yet there are aggregates sense bases and sense realms in him He neither increases nor decreases neither wins nor loses The body of a tathagata accomplishes merit that is thus beyond measure There is no one who understands this yet there is no one who does not understand this There is no one who sees it yet there is no one who does not see it It is neither a composite of the four major elements nor not a composite of the four major elements It does not arise from causes but neither does it arise noncausally It is not a living being but neither is it a nonliving being It is neither a sramalJa nor that of a brahman Aside from one dharma characteristic cannot be enumerated When it enters the final parinirviilJa it does not enter parinirviilJa The dharma bodies of tathagatas have all accomplished innumerable subtle and virtuous qualities such as theseY KliSyapa there is no one other than a tathagata who understands this it is not something understood by either sravakas or pratyekabuddhas Kasyapa a tathagata body that has achieved virtuous qualities such as this is not a body sustained by eating of any sort Kasyapa as the virtuous qualities in the true body of a tathagata are such how could it also be subj ect to illness or stress as vulnerable and fragi le as an unfired pot Kasyapa the reason the Tathagata manifests illness is in order to tame living beings Good man by now you should understand that the body of a tathagata is an adamantine vajra body From this day forth you should always focus your thoughts on this meaning Do not think of it as a body sustained by eating Moreover you should explain to others as well that the Tathagata s body is in fact a dharma body The bodhisattva Kasyapa addressed the Buddha and said WorldHonored One the Tathagata has accomplished such significant virtue how indeed could his body be subject to illness pain impermanence or  destruction From today I will always think of the Tathagata s body as a permanent dharma body a body of bliss and I will disseminate this to others As such WorldHonored One the Tathagata s dharma body is indeed adamantine and indestructible And yet I am still unable to understand the causality that brought it into being The Buddha said Kasyapa it is by means of the causality resulting from upholding the truedharma that one achieves an adamantine body Kasyapa having upheld the causal principles of the dharma since the distant past I have now attained this adamantine body permanent and indestructible Good man those who are committed to upholding the truedharma regardless of whether or not they themselves have accepted the five lay precepts or carry out the proper observances will do whatever it takes to defend those pure monks who do keep the precepts even wielding knives and swords bows and arrows or halberds and lances  The bodhisattva Kasyapa then addressed the Buddha again asking WorldHonored One if we come across a monk who lives apart from any protected community residing alone in an isolated quiet spot in the hills or under a tree should we call that person a true bhiu What about a person who follows someone who provides protection should we recognize such people as householder shavelings The Buddha informed Kasyapa They may read and recite sutras and engage in contemplation in seated meditation And when people come to them with questions on the dharma they may then give a sermon speaking about charity discipline meritmaking minimizing desire  c and knowing satisfaction therein But though they may be able to preach in various ways they will never have the lion s roar  They will not be surrounded by other lions and they will not be able vanquish the wicked who violate the nonns o f behavior Bhius such a s these ultimately are unable to benefit themselves and they are unable to benefit others  You should understand these people to be lazy idlers Although they may hold to the precepts and promote the pure practices  those people cannot really do anything In the Nirvana Sutra the Buddha established restrictions on the bhius such that they should not keep slaves  cows sheep or anything improper If there is a monk who keeps anything impure like this he must be reined in The Tathflgata had also explained in previous sutras that when there are monks who keep improper things such as these you should chase them down and return them to lay status just like any given king controls his country according to his dharma Whenever there is a bhiu who can roar like a lion in this way the precept breakers who hear him speak will all be consumed with rage and attack that dhanna master This dhanna preacher however even if his life were to end  would be known as one who kept the precepts benefiting himself and others For this reason I give sovereigns government officials royal councilors and Buddhist laymen pennission to protect dharma preachers Anyone who wants to protect the truedhanna effectively should study what has been outlined here Kasyapa those who break the precepts and do not protect the dharma I call householder shavelings  Someone who does not maintain the precepts earns a name like this Good man in the distant past innumerable seemingly endless asaJlkhyeya kapas ago in this town of Kusinagara a buddha appeared in the world known as Nandivardhana Tathagata Worthy of Offerings of Right and Universal Knowledge with Clarity and Conduct Perfect WellGone with Understanding of the World Unsurpassed Worthy Tamer of Men Teacher of Gods and Humans Awakened WorldHonored One At that time the world was vast exquisitely pure plentiful and peaceful The people prospered greatly and there was no hunger or thirst Like the Sukhavati Land of Bliss it was filled with bodhisattvas and the like This buddha worldhonored one resided in that world for an immeasurable saving living beings and after which between twin sal trees he entered mahiiparinirviia After that buddhas nirvliIa the true teaching abided in the world for countless millions of years but during the last forty years when that buddhas teaching was about to disappear one monk appeared who kept the precepts His name was Buddhadatta He was surrounded by a large group of followers and produced the lions a roar when he preached across the entire ninefold division of scriptures He imposed restrictions on the monks them they could not keep slaves cows sheep or anything improper At that time there were many monks who violated the precepts and when they heard him speak of these things all of them harbored evil thoughts taking up swords and staves to intimidate this dharma master At that time the king was called Bhavadatta Hearing the commotion he took steps to protect the dh arma by immediately going to where the dharma preacher was and then doing everything he could to help him fi ght back against the evil preceptbreaking monks enabling the dharma preacher to escape harm But the king himself was severely inj ured in the melee struck by swords arrows and lances There was no place on his body that was spared from a wound not even an area as small as a mustard seed Buddhadatta immediately praised him saying King you are now a genuine protector of the true teaching In a future world you yourself will become a dharma vessel of immeasurable proportions When he heard these words from the preacher the king was filled with joy Soon thereafter his life came to an end and he was reborn in the land of the Buddha obhya becoming that buddhas principal disciple there The citizen followers of the king whether they were soldiers who fought with him or individuals who rejoiced at his efforts were all filled with a nonretrogressive resolution to attain awakening  And when their lives ended they were all reborn in the lahd of the Buddha Akobhya as well After that kalpa ended the life of the monk Buddhadatta also came to an end and he too achieved rebirth in the land of the Buddha Akobhya Among the sravakas listening to that buddha Buddhadatta became his number two disciple Thus when the true teaching is about to come to an end you should maintain and protect it in this manner Kasyapa the king at that time was none other than I myself The bhiu who preached the dharma was the Buddha Kasyapa Those who defend the true teaching Kasyapa obtain this kind of incomparable reward As a consequence of those events I have attained the various marks by which I adorn myself today having achieved a dharma body an indestructible body The bodhisattva Kasyapa then addressed the Buddha saying W orldHonored One a tathagata  s permanent body is something like a painted rock The Buddha said to Kasyapa Good man this is why monks nuns laymen and laywomen must all redouble their efforts to defend and uphold the truedharma The rewards for taking responsibility for preserving the dharma are extensive boundless Good man for this reason laymen who defend the dharma may need to take up swords and staves in this way to protect those monks who are upholding the dharma If one has taken the vow of maintaining the five precepts in and of itself that does not mean that person has earned the appellation a person of the Mahayana On the other hand someone who has not taken the five precepts yet defends the truedharma would be given the title of  the Mahayana protectors of the truedharma should take up swords and other weapons to serve the dharma preachers Kasyapa said to the Buddha WorldHonored One if monks stand sidebyside with laymen wielding swords or staves  would they still be considered teachers or not Would they still be maintaining the precepts or violating them The Buddha said to Kasyapa  b Do not suggest that this would mean a violation of the precepts Good man after my nirvfula a degenerate age will come upon the world nations will be in chaos people will steal from one another and society will be plagued by famine At that time many will aspire for the monastic life because they are hungry Such individuals I call shavelings When they see there are pure monks who are maintaining the precepts protecting the truedharma and comporting themselves with dignity these shavelings will run after those monks to chase them away perhaps injuring or even killing them The bodhisattva Kasyapa then spoke to the Buddha WorldHonored One those people who do keep the precepts and who do protect the truedharma how will they manage to travel between towns and cities in order to teach Good man that is why I now allow those who keep the precepts to rely on the companionship of those in white robes who wield weapons Though kings high officials and merchants may take up weapons as lay followers in order to protect the dharma I declare this to be entirely in keeping with the precepts However though one may take up weapons in defense of the dh arma  he should not take another s life To act in the way I have described would constitute the most principled precept keeping Such a person never keeps decorated royal parasols oil pots rice or other grains or any kind of fruits or melons He does not cultivate relationships with kings government officials or the wealthy for personal gain He is not obsequious toward patrons he is meticulous in his comportment and he is stem with those who break the precepts and others who behave badly Such a person I call a teacher who keeps the precepts and protects the dharma who can be a true spiritual guide to living beings and whose mind is broad and expansive like a great ocean Kasyapa if there is a monk who preaches the dharma to others for personal gain his followers and associates will learn from their teacher and also covet personal gain Kasyapa there are three types of sangha communities  sanghas that include people who violate precepts  sanghas made up of the foolish and ignorant and  sanghas of people who live in a pure way The communities that include people who violate precepts are easily spoiled but the communities of those who are pure in keeping the precepts cannot be spoiled even by situations that offer them personal gain Which sanghas include people who violate precepts There are some monks who although they normally observe the rules of behavior when there is personal gain involved spend considerable time with people who violate precepts and inevitably become intimate with them through j oint activities Which sanghas are foolish and ignorant If there are monks in the forest whose faculties are dim and dull and who do not see things clearly who have few desires and beg for their meals who on the days for reciting the precepts or the occasions for confessing precept violations teach their disciples how to make a pure confession but when seeing others who are not their disciples blithely violate the precepts yet do not manage to enjoin them to make a pure confession and unaffected by this sit together with them throughout the precept recitation and confession ceremoniesthis I call a sangha of the foolish and ignorant Which sanghas are pure These are the monks who are not damaged by even ten trillion maras The basic nature of this group of bodhisattvas is pure and they are able to straighten out the other two groups I have just mentioned enabling everyone to live in peace in pure communities I call them dharmaprotecting most excellent vinaya  masters Because of their desire to discipline and benefit living beings they understand which aspects of the moral precepts are unimportant and which are important They do not affirm behavior that is not in keeping with the discipline behavior in keeping with the discipline they do affirm How does someone discipline another If bodhisattvas are going to spiritually transform other living beings they must be a constant presence in towns and villages regardless of time or occasion They might end up in the homes of widows or female entertainers even living together with them for many years If they were srlivakas this type of thing could not be done but this I call disciplining and benefiting living beings How does one know which should be considered weighty As you see the Tathligata establish a precept on the basis of some incident from that day forward you should follow that and take care not to commit a similar offense Thus we have the four grave piiriijika offenses that one who has gone forth as a monastic must never commit Which should be considered light If one commits a violation in a trivial situation and upon being remonstrated three times is able to give up such behavior this I would call light or insignificant To not affirm noncompliance with the precepts refers to the refusal to reside together with anyone who lauds impure things and urges you to accept them To affirm compliance with the precepts refers to the careful study of the monastic precepts and the avoidance of anyone who violates them Whenever noticing conduct in another that accords with the rules in the vinaya one  s heart is filled with joy This is how one grasps what is wrought in the Buddhas dharma and is fully capable of explaining it This is a person I would call a vinaya master One who thoroughly grasps just one word  or one who thoroughly retains what is in the sutras are also like this In this way good man the buddhadharma is immeasurable inconceivable The bodhisattva Kasyapa then addressed the Buddha saying WorldHonored One just so just so Truly a sacred teaching like the Buddha s dhanna is immeasurable and inconceivable The Tathagata himself is just the same beyond conception Therefore we know that the Tathagata is pennanently abiding indestructible and unchanging From now on I will study hard in order to disseminate this meaning to others At that time the Buddha praised Kasyapa Bodhsattva Excellent excellent The body of a Tathagata is just that a body that is adamantine and indestructible Bodhisattvas should thoroughly study right perception and right understanding If you are able to see all these things clearly in this way then you will see the Buddha s adamantine body his indestructible body just as if you were looking at images of yourself reflected in a mirror Chapter Three The Virtues of the N arne At that time the Tathagata again infonned Kasyapa saying Good man now you should carefully retain in your memory the virtues contained in the words and phrases of this sutra And any good men or women who hear the sutra s name will not be reborn in any of the four realms Why is this It is because a scripture like this has been put into practice by countless unfathomable numbers of buddhas resulting in an accumulation of merit the likes of which I will now explain The bodhisattva Kasyapa then said to the Buddha WorldHonored One what should we call this sutra How can the bodhisattvamahasattvas retain it with the proper reverence The Buddha said to Kasyapa Its meaning is profound and its verbal expression is excellent as it a holy life that is complete accomplished and pure It is a diamond treasury complete and lacking nothing Now you need to listen carefully to what I am going to explain Good man by calling it mahii  I am saying that it is pennanent Just as the flows of the eight great rivers all return to the ocean in the same way this sutra to vanquish all their emotional constraints and defilements and all Mara natures afterward inevitably bringing mahiiparinirviilJa when they accept the end of their lives That is why I call it the MahiiparinirviilJa Good man as a physician may have one secret healing technique that incorporates all other fonns of healing good man the Tathagata does the same The various sublime   dhannas and gateways to the treasury of profound mysteries that I have expounded are all included in this MahiiparinirviilJa  That is precisely why I call it the MahiiparinirviilJa Good man consider the fanner who always has hope when he plants in the spring months yet when harvesting his crops those hopes may all come to naught Good man all living beings are like this They cultivate their study of other sutras always in the hope of a flavor to be savored  But if they get a chance to hear the MahiiparinirviilJa  all such hope for flavors in other sutras will drop away forever This MahiiparinirviilJa can bring about the deliverance ofliving beings from any stream of existence Good man among all footprints the footprint of an elephant is the most grand and this sutra is like that Among the samiidhis taught in the sutras what is presented here is the finest Good man when it comes to plowing rice fields autumn plowing is the best and this sutra in the same way is the best among the sutras Good man just as clarified butter is first among medicines for controlling fever and anxiety in the minds of living beings so too is this MahiiparinirviilJa first  Good man and just as sweet butter is replete with eight flavors the MahiiparinirviilJa is also replete with eight flavors What are the eight These are all the eight flavors included in the discourse and it is because the sutra is replete with eight that it is called the MahiiparinirviilJa If bodhisattvamahasattvas base themselves in this discourse then anywhere they are will manifest nirvala That is why I call it the MahiiparinirviilJa  Kasyapa if good men and good women aspire to  b nirvala by means of this MahiiparinirviilJa they must thus apply themselves to studying the pennanent abiding of the Tathagata and of the dhanna and sangha as well The bodhisattva Kasyapa then said to the Buddha Extraordinary WorldHonored One The virtue of the Tathagata i s beyond conception T h e dhanna and the sangha are j ust the sameinconceivable This MahiiparinirviilJa is also beyond conception Those who study this scripture will gain an opening into the truedharma becoming excellent physicians themselves You should understand however that those who never study it will be blind lacking eyes of wisdom their sight clouded by ignorance Chapter Four The Nature of the Tathagata  Part  The Buddha said to Kasyapa Good man bodhisattvamahasattvas elucidate separately the meanings of four issues contained within the Mahiiparinirviia  What are the four I  Correcting oneself  correcting others  competently providing answers that accord with questions and  skillfully grasping the meaning of causality What is correcting oneself If a buddha tathagatha looks at the origins  he will have something to say about them For example a monk seeing a great cluster of fires might declare I would just as well embrace the flames of these burning fires as dare to malign the twelvefold scriptures and the hidden treasury expounded by the Tathagata by claiming that these are the words of Mara Anyone who says the Tathagata dharma and sangha are impermanent would be deceiving himself and lying to others He might as well take a sword and cut off his own tongue for no one could ever say the Tathagata the dharma and the sangha are impermanent If you hear people say such things do not believe them and yet you should nonetheless feel sympathy for those who speak this way for the Tathagata dharma and sangha are beyond their conception You should thus contemplate your own self as if it were a cluster of fires This I call correcting oneself What is correcting others Once when I was expounding the dharma a woman nursing a baby came to see me As she bent her head to my feet to show respect something occurred to her Thinking about this she then sat down facing me At that moment the WorldHonored One understood and asked her about it Out of love and affection you have put no small amount of butter into your baby s mouth But you do not know the degree to which he has digested it if at all no c The woman then said to the Buddha Astonishing WorldHonored One that you are able to know so well the thoughts in my mind  All I ask of the Tathagata is if he would tell me how well  WorldHonored One this morning I did give the child a great amount of butter I fear that he has not been able to digest ithe will not have a premature death will he All I ask of the Tathagata is to explain this for me The Buddha said to her What your child has eaten he in fact did digest immediately increasing his life span When she heard this the woman s heart danced with j oy WorldHonored One it is from your desire to tame living beings that you thoroughly analyze and explain about digesting and not digesting In addition you have also taught us the dharma in doctrines such as nonself and impermanence If the Buddha the WorldHonored One had first expounded permanence then those of us being taught would have said this teaching is the same as that of the nonBuddhists and we would have abandoned it right away The Buddha then informed the woman When your child grows big enough to where he can come and go on his own what he eats at that point he may or may not be able to digest And the butter that you gave him in the past will no longer suffice The sravaka disciples that I have are also like this Just like your infant they have been unable to digest this teaching about permanent abiding This is why I first expounded the doctrines of suffering and impermanence  But when the qualities in my sravaka disciples become adequate for them to endure the cultivation of practice based on the Mahayana scriptures I can then explain this sutra to them in terms of six flavors What are these six flavors I explain that suffering is sour impermanence is salty nons elf is bitter bliss is sweet self is spicy and permanence is astringent In this world there are three kinds of flavors what I call the absence of permanence the absence of self and the absence of bliss But using the defilements as kindling and wisdom as fire this can be turned into what becomes a nirvalic meal to enjoy I am speaking of what is permanent blissful and self and what enables all disciples to enjoy the fruit of the path  also said to the woman If a situation developed in which you wanted to go away for a period of time you would have to make your bad sons go outside the house while you entrusted your treasury of valuables entirely to your good sons would you not The woman said As true as a sacred teaching Our store of what is rare and valuable would be shown to the good sons but not to the bad sons Sister it is the same with me At the time of my parinirviila the Tathagata s treasury of the subtle hidden and unsurpassed dharma will not be given to the disciples who are sravakas just as you would not entrust your treasury of valuables to your bad sons I have to entrust to the bodhisattvas just as you would entrust your treasury of valuables to your good sons Why is this Because the sravaka disciples formulate the idea of transformation  presuming that a buddha tathagata truly passes into extinction But as a matter of fact I do not pass into extinction This would be akin to your traveling to a distant place and before you can return your bad sons tell everyone you have died when in fact you have not died The bodhisattvas will say that the Tathagata is permanent and immutable In the same way your good sons will not say that you have died This is why my unsurpassed hidden treasury will be entrusted to the bodhisattvas Good man if any living being proclaims that the Buddha abides pera manently and is immutable know that the Buddha dwells in his home This is what I call the correction of others What is capable of providing an answer that accords with a question If someone came to the Buddha the WorldHonored One and asked How could I attain fame as a great donor to charity without giving up my wealth The Buddha would say  If there is a sramafa or a brahman or someone of this nature who knows the contentment of living with few desires and who would never accept or retain anything impure to that person you should give female and male slave attendants To one practicing the restraints of reiigious life  give a girl To one who has given up wine and meat give wine and meat To one who does not transgress the rule against eating after noon give food in the afternoon To one who does not wear flowers or fragrances give flowers and fragrances The fame of this kind of giving will spread throughout the world at almost no cost to you and your fortune  is what I call capable of providing an answer that accords with a question At that point the bodhisattva Kasyapa addressed the Buddha saying WorldHonored One a person should not give meat to someone who eats meat Why do I say this In my view there is great virtue in not eating meat The Buddha then praised Kasyapa Excellent excellent You have now reached a clear understanding of my point The bodhisattva who protects the dharma should be like this Good man from today I no longer allow sravaka disciples to eat meat Whenever you receive donations of food from lay donors you should regard the food as if it were the flesh of your own son The bodhisattva Kasyapa addressed the Buddha saying WorldHonored One why does the Tathagata not allow the eating of meat Good man to eat meat is to cut out the seeds of your own great compassion Kasyapa then said Why is it Tathagata that previously you allowed bhikus to eat three kinds of pure meat Kasyapa regarding the three kinds of pure meat in response to specific situations I have been gradually imposing restrictions The bodhisattva Kasyapa once again addressed the Buddha saying WorldHonored One what were the causes for the ten kinds of impure and nine kinds of pure both being disallowed The Buddha said to Kasyapa The formulations of those restrictions also came gradually due to particular events but it should be understood that my present intention is to end the eating of meat The bodhisattva Kasyapa then said to the Buddha Why is it Tathagata that you proclaim meat and fish are to be regarded as fine foods Good man I am not saying that meat and fish are fine foods I am saying that sugar cane nonglutinous rice crystallized honey all grains brown sugar milk with honey and clarified butter are fine foods But even when I say you should keep gannents made of various kinds of cloth by should I mean keeping what you need cloth stripped of its color Why would I condone anyones craving for the taste of meat or fish Kasyapa then said If the Tathagata has imposed a rule that we should not eat meat then does that mean we should also not accept food containing the five flavorsyogurt buttermilk fresh butter clarified butter and sesame oilas well as clothing robes made of kauseya silk conch shells leather gold or silver and bowls or utensils Good man This does not mean you should adopt the same perspective as the ascetic Nirgrantha Jains Each restrictive precept formulated by  b the Tathagata reflects a particular intent There was thus a particular intention behind my allowing you to eat the three kinds of pure meat And yet that is different from the idea of ending the consumption of the ten kinds of meat and it is from this other idea cutting it out entirely including meat that comes from animals that die a natural death Kasyapa from today I establish a precept restricting my disciples from eating all forms of meat Kasyapa those who do partake of meat whether they are walking standing sitting or lying down will produce an odor of meat that all living beings will smell and this inevitably creates a sense of fear in them It is like a man who gets close to lions a crowd that sees him do this will smell the odor of the lion on him afterward and become afraid Good man it is like the fact that when someone eats garlic he smells foul and repugnant When others see that person and smell that odor they will move away If people have no desire to see him when he is spotted from a distance how much less when he is near Those who eat meat are l ike this Any living being who smells the scent of meat will become afraid and will be filled with the fear of death All forms of life whether they live out their lives in water on land or in the air flee from  They will all say This person is our enemy For this reason bodhisattvas do not customarily eat meat They may manifest eating meat for purposes of saving living beings but although it appears that they are eating meat in fact they are not Good man the pure eating of bodhisattvas is thus not eating so how could they eat meat Good man countless centuries following my nirviiQa there will be holy people of the four Buddhist paths who will all attain nirvala After the truedhanna has disappeared during a period of counterfeit dhanna there will be bhius who will imitate upholding the precepts and will read and recite the sutras to some degree Yet these monks will cravenly delight in food and drink nourishing their bodies for a long life The clothes they wear will be coarse and ugly They will continually declare I have attained arhatship but they will have many ills and some will lie down to sleep in their own excrement Their false views will be pursued actively maligning Jhe truedhanna People such as these will destroy the rules of discipline the proper practices and the dignity and decorum that have been fonnulated by the Tathagata  They will preach the goal of liberation and avoiding impurities even as they destroy the teaching that is profound and hidden Having reached the point where each of them follows his or her own ideas they will make assertions in opposition to what is in the sutras and vinayas such as Tathagatas all allow us to eat meat Producing such lines of reasoning by themselves they will nevertheless claim them to be the words of the Buddha and yet they will argue among themselves each insisting to be a sramaa disciple of Sakyamuni Good man at that time there will also be sramaas who will store grain accept fish and meat prepare their own meals and who will keep  The Nirvana SutTa Volume I jars of oil jeweled canopies and leather shoes Some of them will be c close to kings important officials civic leaders oracles and astrologers Some will study medicine and the healing arts raise and keep slaves gold silver lapis lazuli agate carnelian crystal pearls coral amber j ade conch shells or different types of fruit and melons There will be those who study the arts who become painters ceramicists scribes teachers cultivators of plants practitioners of spells and magic There will be those who manufacture medicines and produce theatrical performances and those who adorn their bodies with perfumes and flowers engage in gambling and games and learn crafts and skills If there are monks who can separate themselves from these unfortunate activities you should refer to them as true disciples of mine At that moment Kasyapa spoke once more to the Buddha WorldHonored One the monks nuns laymen and laywomen depend upon others for their livelihood If when begging for their meals some end up with meat mixed in with their food how can they eat in a way that conforms to the dharma of purity The Buddha said Kasyapa wash the food with water separating out the meat After that may you eat If utensils become polluted by contact with meat j ust remove any residue of meat flavor and you may then use them without transgression If you see that there is a lot of meat in your food then you should not accept it Any meat that is clearly present should not be eaten to eat it constitutes a transgression I am now proclaiming this rule eliminating meat eating If I were to explain this in detail it would never end but as I have reached the time of my nirvala I offer only this brief statement This then is what I call providing an answer that accords with a question Kasyapa what is skillfully grasping the meaning of causality It is like the that would occur if followers from the four groups came to ask me these questions WorldHonored One tell us why a teaching l ike this was not expounded to King Prasenaj it when the Tathagata first appeared as a buddha  The doctrine that you preach for us has profound and wonderful meaning but at times your preaching is deep at times it is shallow Some things you call violations and some things you call nonviolations What do you mean by downfall What is it that you call vinaya What is the meaning of what you call priitimoka I would then answer as follows The priitimoka or code of precepts is known as contentment Through it one achieves the proper comportment  devoid of accumulation so it is also called pure livelihood Downfall refers to the four unfortunate realms In addition downfall may also specifically indicate falling into the hells all the way down to Avid Hell If you measured the speed of that fall it would be faster than that of a violent storm If hearing this strikes you with fear then be strict about maintaining the precepts and do not violate the rules of comportment To cultivate the contentment that I mention is to not accept anything impure In addition downfall also means to offer nourishment to the realms of hell animals or hungry ghosts All these meanings I identify by the term downfall The priitimoka is there to help you put distance between anything unwholesome or wicked and your actions speech and thought Vinaya refers to entering into commitments to follow rules and observances and to appreciate the meanings of the sutras in all their profundity It forbids the acceptance of all things impure as well as all situations brought about by impure causes or conditions It also means prohibitions against the four grave violations  the thirteen offenses entailing adjudication but permitting one to remain in the order  the two offenses that are undetermined  the thirty property offenses entailing expiation with forfeiture  the ninetyone offenses requiring expiation  the teachings on the four faults requiring confession  the manifold rules of training  and the seven quieting disputes asamathii   There are also some people who break all the rules In what sense do I say all I am referring to everything from the four grave violations to the seven rules for resolving conflicts a There are some people who repudiate the profound scriptures of the truedharma There are also icchantikas who have fully rid themselves of all forms  With no karmic relationship they blithely say How brilliant and clever I am They keep fully hidden their transgressions whether trivial or serious concealing their wickedness like a turtle conceals his six protruding body parts Such people pass through a long night without regretting their many errors And because they do not regret their transgressions over time only increase The violations committed by these monks will never become public and this in tum leads to such violations becoming rampant This is why the Tathagata aware of this situation has dispensed the rules for the community in a gradual fashion rather than putting out the entire system of prohibitions all at once At that time there were good men and good women who spoke to the Buddha thus WorldHonored One Ifthe Tathagata has been aware of this problem of members of the sangha hiding their improper behavior for some time why did you not formulate these rules of restraint earlier You would not WorldHonored One want to cause living beings to end up in Avici Hell would you It seems like a situation in which a great many people who have set out to reach somewhere have lost sight of the correct road and have ended up following the wrong path Because these people do not realize they are lost they all think This is the path Moreover they do not see anyone question whether or not they are doing the right thing so they continue in the same direction  Living beings like this are lost to the Buddha s teachings they do not see the truth The Tathagata should first explain the right path and then issue directives to the bhiksus that suchandsuch in effect violates the precepts and suchandsuch in effect upholds the precepts The rules should be laid out like that Because the truth that is the Tathagata s genuine awakening is the basis upon which we understand the right path It is only the Tathligata the god among gods who can explain the exalted virtues of the ten aspects of good character as well as their meaning and appeal  That is why we implore you to formulate the precepts for us first The Buddha said Good man by stating that the Tathagata fully expounds the exalted virtues of the ten aspects of good character to living beings you imply that the Tathligata looks upon living beings as if each were Rahula So how can you complain saying You would not WorldHonored One want to cause living beings to end up in A vlci Hell would you Were I to see even one person with a karmic condition that would mean falling into A vlci Hell just for the sake of that person I would remain in the world for nearly a kalpa even an entire kalpa With this great compassion toward living beings what situation could make me want to deceive those whom I regard like a son so that they would end up in hell Good man it is like a royal tailor who sees a hole in a garment and thereupon sets out to repair it The Tathligata also operates in this way When he sees a living being with karmic conditions that will bring him to A vici Hell he immediately uses the goodness in the precepts to make up for what is lacking in that person  s situation Good man suppose there were a wheelturning sage king who first explained to living being s the value of the ten aspects of good character yet afterward faced a series of incidents of bad behavior That king would respond immediately each time something happened by putting a stop to those actions Only then after stopping these unacceptable types of behavior would he himself promulgate the ruling principles of a sage king Good man in a like manner although I may have spoken about  at first I did not lay down specific prohibitions It was only after the need arose due to a series of actions by monks in violation of the spirit of the dharma that I set down rules of discipline based on those incidents Those with a willingness for the dharma however will cultivate their practice according to the teachings And living beings like this will be able to see the Tathagata s dharma body Just as the jeweled   circle possessed by a cakravartin king is inconceivable the Tathligata is also inconceivable and the two jewels known as dhanna and sangha are inconceivable as well Those who can preach the dhanna and those who can hear the dhannathey are all inconceivable These reflect what I call skillfully grasping the meaning of causality Thus do the bodhisattvas elucidate separately the meanings of four issues what I call the doctrine of causality in the Mahayiina Mahiiparinirviila  Next correcting oneself refers to obtaining the Mahiiparinirviila  Correcting others refers to my having preached to the monks a tathagata is a constant presence without change What I have called competently providing answers that accord with questions occurred when due to something you asked about Kasyapa I expounded this profound and sublime doctrine in a way that applied broadly to bodhisattvamahasattvas monks nuns laymen and laywomen Skillfully grasping the meaning of causality reflects the fact that sravakas and pratyekabuddhas do not grasp these profound doctrines They simply do not hear the hidden treasury that is composed of liberation nirvala and mahiiprajiiii wisdom which together form three dots as in the Sanskrit letter i I will now clarify the differences among these for the sravakas so they can open their eye of wisdom If someone were to say something to the effect of How can these four things be said to be identicalis that not a falsehood you should ask them What is the difference between these four things empty space nothing at all inert and unobstructed How can you call them false No WorldHonored One These expressions all mean one thing emptiness Correcting oneself correcting others providing an answer that accords with a question and grasping the meaning of causality are also like that for in the Mahiiparinirviila they are equal with no differences The Buddha said to Kasyapa If there is a good man or good woman who makes such statements as The Tathagata is impennanent How do we know that he is impermanent Because the Buddha himself has said To put an end to the defilements is called nirvaQa Like a fire that is extinguished there is nothing there whatsoever To end the defilements is also thus I call it nirvaQa So how could the Tathagata be pennanently abiding without change As the Buddha has said That which is free from all fonns of existence is called nirvaQa Within nirvaQa there are no fonns of existence So how can one say that the Tathagata is pennanently abiding and immutable Extinguishing the defilements means that the individual is no longer known as what he or she was so how can one say that the Tathagata is pennanentiy abiding and immutable As the Buddha has said Free from desire calm and stilled this I call nirviiQa If a man cuts off his head then he has no head Free from desire calm and stilled is also like this In emptiness there is nothing whatsoever Therefore it is called nirvaQa So how can one say that the Tathagata is pennanentiy abiding and immutable As the Buddha has said  c Like heated iron When pounded sparks fly That scatter and disappear No one knows where they are Attaining proper liberation Is also like this After crossing over all the mud Of lust and desire One attains a place without movement It is not known where So how can one say that the Tathagata is pennanentiy abiding and immutable Kasyapa a complaint like this I would call an erroneous critique Kasyapa you should not entertain this idea inferring that the nature of the Tathagata is something that perishes Kasyapa the destruction of the defilements means that that individual is no longer known the same as what he or she was Why is this Because this is forever and that is why I call it permanent Termed quiescent there is nothing beyond it What perishes are any perceivable characteristics of that nothing remains Termed clean permanently abiding and nonretrogressing this is why nirvala is called permanently abiding The Tathagata is also permanently abiding and immutable The mention of sparks flying in the verse is a reference to the defilements To say That scatter and disappear no one knows where they are addresses the fact that the tathagatas following the destruction of their defilements are no longer present in the five realms of sarpsaric existence This is why I state that tathagatas are a permanently abiding dharma in which there is no change In addition Kasyapa what the buddhas teach is called dharma This is why the Tathagata is revered and honored with offerings And because the dharma is permanent the buddhas are also permanent The bodhisattva Kasyapa then asked the Buddha if the flame of the defilements disappears and the tathagatas also disappear then the tathagatas have no place to abide permanently Like the fact that when sparks fly and disappear in the process of forging iron and no one knows where their red color goes when the defilements of a tathagata disappear there is similarly no place they have perished to Or one could say that like the heat and red color of the hot iron when these have disappeared they simply no longer exist Tathagatas must be like this after disappearing they are impermanent for when they destroy the fire of the defilements they immediately enter nirvala We should understand then that tathagatas are impermanent Good man this iron you speak of refers to ordinary people An ordinary person even after destroying the defilements is reborn after the cessation of his existence Therefore I call impermanent But a tathagata is not like that for he is not born again after the cessation of his existence Therefore I call pennanent Kasyapa spoke once more  But even after the iron s red color disappears it can return for the red color would arise again if the iron were put into the fire And if the fetters of defilement arose in him again this would mean that he is impennanent The Buddha said Now Kasyapa you should not make such a statement saying that the Tathagata is impennanent Good man it is like this  when you bum wood after it is extinguished there will be ash after the defilements are extinguished there will be nirvala Tearing a gannent cutting off someone  s head or smashing a j ar all work metaphorically in the same say Each one of these things has its own appellation we call them forth by saying tearing a garment cutting off a head or smashing a jar Kasyapa after the iron cools it can be heated again But the Tathagata is not like that Having cut cut off the defilements in himself he is absolutely cool For when the defilements have been burned away in a buddha they do not arise again Kasyapa you should understand that there are countless numbers of living beings whose situation is like the metaphor of iron here I use the blaze of my untainted wisdom to bum off the constraints of their defilements Kasyapa once again spoke  Excellent excellent  Now I see the truth in the Tathagata s explanation that buddhas are pennanent The Buddha said Kasyapa suppose there were a sacred king who had been in the women s apartments o f the palace and then suddenly decides to g o out for diversion into the garden behind the palace Although at that point the king is not among his female attendants no one would presume to say  the king  s life has ended Good man the Tathagata is like this  Although he does not appear in Jambudvlpa when he has entered nirvlila this is not known as impermanence The Tathagata has left behind uncountable defilements to enter the place of peace and joy called nirvala where he strolls among the flowers of awakening with amusement and pleasure  Kasyapa once again spoke asking The Buddha has said I have long since crossed over the ocean of the defilements But if the Buddha has already crossed over the ocean of the defilements why would he join with Yasodhara and produce the child Rahula What are the circumstances by which we can understand that the Tathagata has not yet crossed to the shore beyond the binding ocean of his defilements The Buddha then said to Kasyapa You should not say If the Buddha has long since crossed over the ocean of the defilements why would he join with Yasodhara and produce the child Rahula What are the circumstances by which we can understand that the Tathagata has not yet crossed to the shore beyond the binding ocean of his defilements Good man this MahiiparinirviifJa establishes the Great Meaning You must all pay attention and listen very carefully to what I will now expound in a rather expansive way Do not be frightened by what you hear Bodhisattvamahasattvas who abide in mahiiparinirviifJa are like rulers of Mount Sumeru they can take something as vast as that mountain and make it fit inside a pouch of mustard seeds The living beings living on the Sumeru continent would not feel constricted by such activity for they would have no notion that anything had either come or goneas far as they would know their continent would be no different from what it had been before Only one who is crossing to the other shore would see the bodhisattva put Mount Sumeru into the mustardseed pouch and then gently return it to where it was originally Good man there are also bodhisattvamahasattvas abiding in mahiiparinirviifJa who can put the great trichiliocosm of the universe into a mustardseed pouch The beings would similarly not feel constricted by such activity for they would have no notion that anything had either come or goneas far as they would know their world would be no different from what it had been before Only those who will cross over to the other shore will see a bodhisattva thus put the great trichiliocosm into a mustardseed pouch and then gently return them to where they were originally Good man there are also bodhisattvamahasattvas abiding in mahiiparinirviifJa who in much the same way can take the great trichiliocosm and put it inside the space of one hair and then return it to its original location Good man there are also bodhisattvamahasattvas abiding in mahiiparinirviifJa who cut out the three thousandgreat thousand buddha worlds from all the ten directions place them on the end of a pin and then cast them into other buddha worlds located elsewhere as easily as piercing the leaf of a jujube tree All the living beings would not be aware of where they had gone and returned from Only those who will cross over to the other shore will be able to perceive this as well as their original locations Good man there are also bodhisattvamahasattvas abiding in mahiiparinirviifJa who cut out the three thousandgreat thousand buddha realms of the ten directions and place them in the palm of their right hand and like a potter s ball of clay then throw them into realms molecular in size  Yet there would not be one living being on those worlds that would have any sense of anything coming or going during this either Only those who will cross over to the other shore will be able to perceive this as well as their original locations Good man there are also bodhisattvamahasattvas abiding in mahiiparinirviifJa who cut out the three thousandgreat thousand buddha worlds of the ten directions and internalize them all within their own bodies The living beings there feel no constriction and have no sense of coming or going or even being anywhere during this process   Only those who will cross over to the other shore will be able to perceive this as well as their original locations Good man there are also bodhisattvamahasattvas abiding in mahiiparinirviilJa who can take the worlds in the ten directions and place them inside one molecule  Yet the living beings residing there feel no constriction or any sense of coming or going during this process Only those who will cross over to the other shore will be able to perceive this as well as their original locations Good man there are bodhisattvamahasattvas abiding in mahiiparinirviilJa who are thus able to display an array of supernatural transformations This is why it is called mahiiparinirviilJa  These innumerable supernatural transformations that may be thus revealed by bodhisattvamahasattvas are generally incomprehensible for living beings So now tell me how do you propose to understand that the Tathagata indulged in sexual intercourse to produce Rahula Good man having abided in this mahiiparinirviilJa for so long I have displayed supernatural transfonnations in many different ways In the ten billion suns and moons and ten billion Jambudvipas among the great trichiliocosm there have been various displays of this sort such as those expounded in some detail in the SuraJgamasutra  One of the things  have done is to reveal nirvaIa in the triple thousandgreat thousand worlds and in Jambudvipa And yet  did not ultimately choose nirvaIa  Or I have also showed myself entering the womb of a mother in Jambudvipa causing a father and mother to think they begot me as their son despite the fact that this body ultimately is not something born from the union of sexual desires Having separated myself from sexual desire for so longver innumerable kalpa s this body I have now is in fact a dhanna body that manifested in a womb only to confonn to the ways of the world  Good man  manife sted m y birth from m y mother Maya in the Lumbini Grove in Jambudvipa Following my birth  was able to immediately take seven steps to the east and roar out the words I am the most c revered the highest among humans gods and asuras My mother and father and indeed the people and gods who witnessed this were overcome with joy and thought how exceedingly rare this was The people presumed I was an infant yet for innumerable kalpas this body of mine had long since been separated from the phenomenon  The body of a tathagata is none other than a dharma body it is not constructed of flesh blood tendons veins bones and marrow It was because I was conforming to the ways of living beings in the world that I manifested myself as a newborn baby I walked seven paces to the south and displayed my desire to become a superior field of merit for innumerable living beings I walked seven paces to the west and revealed that when my lifetime is exhausted I will have cut off aging and death forever this being my last body I walked seven paces to the north and showed that I had already crossed over to the other shore beyond all forms of smpsara I walked seven paces to the east and showed that I will be a guide for living beings And walking seven steps in the four intermediate directions revealed how I had destroyed the array of defi lements and the nature of the four mara  thus becoming a Thus Come One Worthy of Offerings Completely Awakened I walked upward seven paces and showed that I was not polluted by anything impure just like space I walked downward seven paces and revealed the dharma rain that extinguishes the fires of hell bringing serenity and joy to living beings there And for those who violated the precepts I manifested frost and hai l Seven days after I was born in Jambudvlpa I put on a display of shaving my head Everyone presumed at that point that I was an infant who had just shaved his head for the first time But no one among all the people devas king Mara Paplyas sramwzas and brahmans who were present could see the special mark on my head So how could anyone have picked up a knife to come and shave my head Even if someone had done so it would have been meaningless because over the course of immeasurable kalpas I have long since removed the hair on my head and face It is only out of a desire to follow the ways of the world that I made a show of shaving the hair on my head After I was born my parents took me to a temple where they presented me to the deity Mahesvara When Mahesvara looked upon me he immediately put his palms together bowed in respect and stood to one side For over immeasurable kalpas in fact I had long since abandoned going to such temples and only displayed myself in this way out of a desire to confonn to the ways of the world In Jambudvfpa I also displayed having pierced ears In truth among all living beings there is no one who can pierce my ears I manifested this behavior in order to confonn to the world I also took various jewels and constructed a lion  s earring with which I adorned my ears though in fact over innumerable leap a s I had long since abandoned wearing any such adornments It was in order to comply with the ways of the world that I produced this display I showed myself entering a school where I studied writing But over innumerable leap a s I had already endowed myself with the accomplishment of this task so no matter where one may look throughout the triple world there would be no one who would be suitable to be my teacher It is only out of a desire to confonn to the world that I showed myself entering the school That is why I am called Thus Come One Worthy of Offerings Completely Awakened When I learned how to ride an elephant how to ride a horse how to fight and  a how to do various artistic techniques and it was the same situation In Jambudvfpa I also displayed myself as a crown prince Living beings all saw me as a prince enjoying myself delighting in the pleasures of the five senses In fact over the course of innumerable leap a s I had long since abandoned the pursuit of pleasure so the display of this aspect of my life was shown merely to confonn to the ways of the world And there were prognosticators who predicted that if I did not leave behind the householders life I would become a cakravartin king who would rule over Jambudvfpa Living beings all believed in these words but in fact over innumerable leap a s I had already abandoned the status of a cakravartin who turns the wheel of political power in favor of being a cakravartin who turns the wheel of dhanna In Jambudvfpa I then manifested abandoning lust for women and the pleasures of the five senses as well as departing from the householders life after seeing examples of aging illness death and a mendicant sramaa in order to cultivate a path to liberation When this happened living beings all thought Siddhartha has started to live the life of a monk but it had been innumerable leap a s in the past when I left behind the householders life to pursue the Way After I showed myself leaving the household life in Jambudvfpa I took the complete precepts diligently cultivated the path and attained the fruit of the path of a srotiipanna  the fruit of the path of a sakrdiigiimin  the fruit of the path of an aniigiimin  and the fruit of the path of an arhat  Many people said that completing the path of an arhat was relatively easy for me to attain but in fact I had already accomplished the path to arhatship innumerable kalpas ago It was in order to emancipate living beings that I sat down at the site of awakening under the bodhi tree making a seat out of grass and subdued the bands of Mara demons that came at me Everyone thought I first overcame the minions of Mara at that socalled site of awakening under the bodhi tree but on the contrary I had long since prevailed in that struggle in fact innumerable kalpas ago Those around me expected me to have liquid and solid defecation and inhaling and exhaling however what has been attained in this body is a state entirely without such things as defecation or breathing I was only displaying this behavior because it was in accordance with the ways of the world I also showed myself accepting faithful donations from people even though this body of mine has no hunger or thirst at all Because I wanted to appear to be the same as living beings I have also shown myself to be sleeping even though over the course of innumerable kalpas I have equipped myself with such unsurpassed profound wisdom that I have left behind all fonns of existence in the triple world I have thus been quite free from concerns over such things as proper conduct and comportment headaches indigestion back pain wielding a spear washing my feet washing my hands washing my face rinsing my mouth or cleaning my teeth after chewing Many thought my life was filled with such things but in this body of mine there are none of these things My feet are as clean as a white lotus blossom My breath is as pure and fresh as the fragrance of a blue lotus All living beings think of me as a person but in fact I am not a person I showed myself accepting rags from the rubbish for clothing and washing and darning  b my robes as well but I have long since ended any need for these clothes A great many people think Rahula is my son King S uddhodana is my father Lady Maya is my mother and when I was in the world I enjoyed myself with worldly pleasures and then walked away from such things when I left home to pursue the Way Many people have also said The surname of this crown prince is Gautama He freed himself from the pleasures of the world seeking the supramundane dharma But I have long since separated myself from the sexual desires of this world such things have all been mere displays on my part All living beings think of me as a person but in fact I am not Good man although I have repeatedly displayed myself to be entering nirvala while here in Jambudvlpa in truth I have never entered into an absolute nirvala So while all living beings may think the Tathagata has truly perished the tathagatanature in fact will never cease to exist That is why it should be understood that this is a permanently abiding dharma that is immutable as well Good man mahiiparinirviila itself i s none other than the dharma realm of the buddha tathagatas When I appear within in the world of Jambudvlpa living beings all presume that I am attaining buddhahood for the first time But I had already managed to do this over the course of innumerable kapas in the past so this initial attainment of buddhahood was just one more thing I displayed in Jambudvlpa to conform to the world I have also appeared in Jambudvlpa did not uphold the precepts even to the point of committing one of the four grave offenses entailing defeat The multitude around me all saw this and said I had truly transgressed But over the course of innumerable kapas I have been quite diligent about keeping the precepts with no gaps or omissions I have also appeared in Jambudvlpa as an icchantika The many people who saw this all recognized me as an icchantika but in fact I was not an icchantika How could an icchantika have attained unsurpassed perfect enlightenment I also appeared in Jambudvfpa trying to break up the sangha  Living beings all remarked that I was breaking up the sangha but I consider the sangha community to be incapable of being broken up by either humans or gods I have also appeared in lambudvfpa for the purpose of supporting efforts to preserve the dharma The many people who saw all spoke of how astonished they were at the lengths I would go to to preserve the dharma But the reality of buddhas is like thatno one should be astonished by what I did I also manifested myself in Jambudvfpa as the evil Mara Papfyas and the many people who saw me all thought I was Papfyas But over innumerable kalp a s I have long been free of the affairs of Mara having remained pure without stain like a lotus blossom I have also manifested myself in Jambudvfpa as someone who attained buddhahood in a woman  s body The many people who saw this all spoke of how rare it was for a woman to be able to attain anuttarii samyaksaflbodhi Tathagatas cannot accept a woman  s body in perpetuity but out of a desire to tame a great many living beings they do manifest themselves in female form Out of empathy for all living beings I have also appeared in various colored forms I have also appeared in Jambudvfpa born into the four modes of existence But as I have long since removed all causes for my rebirth in any of them would there be karmic cause for me to fall into the four modes of existence I have also manifested in Jambudvfpa assuming the form of the deity Brahrna thereby enabling those who serve Brahma to situate themselves in the truedharma Although in truth I was not him those living beings all assumed that I was the true Brahma deity I appeared in the form of deities worshiped widely in local shrines in just this same way I have also appeared in Jambudvfpa to go into the houses of women of pleasure even though in fact I had no thoughts of sexual desire toward them remaining pure and unstained like a lotus blossom throughout For the sake of living beings lost to sexual cravings I have stood on   street comers preaching this excellent dharma Although in truth my mind was without taint of desire the crowd around me thought I was guarding those women for my own purposes  I have also manifested myself in Jambudvlpa to go into the dwellings of the greenrobed female servants who are siidras in order to teach women in positions of servitude how they could abide in the truedharma I also manifested myself in Jambudvlpa who became scholars in order to teach the young so that they may abide in the truedharma as well I have also manifested myself in Jambudvlpa going into places for drinking alcohol and gambling I displayed an acceptance of various forms of games and competition but it was only for the purpose of rescuing living beings from that world Although in fact I was without the kind of unwholesome karma possessed by those who frequent such places  yet the living beings gathered there all presumed that I was indeed engaged in such behavior I have also manifested myself for some time among the cremation mounds of a charnel ground taking the body of a great eagle to bring those birds of flight to the other shore Although the living beings there all thought of me as an actual bird in truth I had long since abandoned any karmic activity that would produce such a rebirth I manifested in a body like that because I wanted to save those eagles I have also appeared in Jambudvlpa in the form of persons of civic importance out of a desire to establish a great many living beings in positions of abiding in the truedharma I have also manifested as kings high government officials princes and chancellors Preeminent in each group I assumed these royal positions in order to cultivate the truedharma I have also manifested myself during an age when Jambudvlpa was ravaged by pestilence and there were many living beings suffering from disease First I provided medicine and treatment and after that I explained the fine truedharma enabling to abide peacefully in the highest bodhi Those around me in those times all spoke of living in an age of disease I have also manifested myself during an age when famine plagued Jambudvfpa I provided food and drink to people according to their needs and after that preached the fine truedharma enabling them to abide peacefully in the highest bodhi I have also manifested myself during an age of armed in Jambudvfpa immediately expounding the dharma to enable to put aside their enmity and harmful intentions and making them capable of peacefully abiding in the highest bodhi I have also appeared in order to preach the idea of impermanence for those who supposed the existence of something permanent in themselves to preach the idea of suffering for those who supposed something joyful in themselves to preach the idea of nonself for those who supposed a self in themselves and to preach the idea of impurity for those who supposed something inherently pure in themselves If I encountered living beings that were attached to the triple world I would then expound a dharma that enabled them to free themselves from such thinking Thus to ferry living beings to the other shore I have preached the most sublime dharma medicine In order to root out any trees producing the defilements I have planted the seeds of trees that will produce the unsurpassed dharma medicine In order to rescue people from heretical paths I have expounded the truedh arma  Although I have also manifested myself as a teacher of living beings in the beginning I had no notion of being anyones teacher But because I wanted to rescue those at the bottom of society I manifested myself among them and expounded the dharma Again I was not born into that environment as a result of bad karma The complete awakening of a tathagata is well situated in mahaparinirvalJa in ways such as this That is why I say is permanently abiding without change And as it is in this continent of Jambudvfpa so it is in the east in Piirvavideha in the west in Aparagodanfya and in the north in Uttarakuru as well The great trichiliocosm below the four heavens are also like this as are the twentyfive states of existence as described in the Siiraflgamasiitra This  is precisely why it is called mahiiparinirviila And any bodhisattvamahasattva who is well situated in mahiiparinirviila in this way will be able to manifest supernatural transformations in this manner without anything to fear KliSyapa for this reason you should not say that Rahula is the Buddha s son Why not Because over innumerable kapas in the past I have long since left behind sensual existence That is also why a tathagata is known to be permanently abiding without change Kasyapa then spoke up again What is this permanently abiding of which the Tathagata speaks Is it something like the Buddha s statement After a lamp is extinguished its is not located anywhere Is the Tathagata is also like this that is after his extinction he will not be located anywhere The Buddha said Kasyapa good man you should not speak in that way saying that after a lamp is extinguished its is not located anywhere and likewise after the Tathagata s extinction he will also not be located anywhere Good man what is analogous is when a man or woman wants to light a lamp they fill it with oil regardless of its size As long as there is oil its light will be present When the oil has been exhausted the light will also be exhausted The disappearance of the light is a metaphor for the disappearance of the defilements And although the light may have disappeared the lamp itself is still present The Tathagata is like this The defilements in him may have disappeared but his dharma body is always present Good man what do you make of this Do light and lamp both disappear or not Kasyapa answered No WorldHonored One Although they do not both disappear yet they are still impermanent If the dharma body is analogous to the lamp then as the lamp is impermanent the dharma body likewise should be designated as impermanent Good man you should not create such difficulties Just as people speak of a vessel in an ordinary sense a tathagata a WorldHonored One is an unsurpassed dharma vessel But while a vessel is impermanent a tathagata is not Among all dharmas it is nirvala that is permanent and this is the essence of a tathagata Therefore are called permanent Moreover good man when I say the lamp is extinguished this refers to the nirvala realized by arhats Because arhats extinguish craving and the other defilements I use the metaphor of an extinguished lamp Those called aniigiimins I call those who have craving and because craving still exists in them we cannot say they are the same as an extinguished lamp In the past I covered over this distinction by saying that was like the extinguishing of a lamp But mahiinirviila is not the same as what happens in the case of an extinguished lamp Someone at the stage of aniigiimin does not come back again and again  He does not re turn to any of the twentyfive existences nor does he take on a body that smells bad a body of an insect a body that is eaten or a body that is poisonous That is precisely why he is called aniigiimin If someone did take on another body after death  that person would be called iigiimin  in contrast to those called aniigiimin who do not Those who still have some going and coming I call iigiimin and those who no longer have any going or coming I call aniigiimin    V Chapter Four The Nature of the Tathagata Part  At that time bodhisattva Kasyapa addressed the Buddha saying WorldHonored One As the Buddha has said The buddhas the worldhonored ones have a hidden treasury but this does not seem right to me Why do I say this Because it is only that the buddhas the worldhonored ones have speech that is recondite  they do not have a hidden treasuretrove that is secret If we think of the example of a magician who uses a mechanical device a wooden puppet we would see that although people see bend stretch look down and look up they have no idea what is going on inside of it how it is being controlled But the buddhadharma is not like that for all buddhas empower living beings such that all of them can know what they see So in what way is it appropriate to say The buddhas the worldhonored ones have a hidden treasury The Buddha then praised Kasyapa Excellent excellent Good man just as you say a tathagata in fact does not have a treasuretrove that is secret Why do I say this Just like a full moon in autumn that is clear pure and unshaded in the sky when the words of a tathagata unfold they reveal themselves as clear pure and unshaded The ignorant do not understand and speak of his treasury as secret But the wise fully understand so they do not label his words secret Good man consider the example of a man who has amassed immeasurable millions in gold and silver yet he is so stingy at heart that he will not admit to his blessings or provide anything to help those truly in need That kind of accumulation could be termed a secret treasure But tathagatas are not like that Amassing immeasurable rare jewels of the fine dharma over limitless ka pa s their minds are devoid of any stinginess in constantly providing for all living beings Indeed how could it be appropriate to say that tathagatas conceal things Good man if a man was physically disabled perhaps lacking an eye c a hand or a leg he might might feel so ashamed of his condition that he would not let others see him And because others did not see him they would speak of him as being hidden But tathagatas are not like that The truedharma they possess is complete with nothing lacking and they enable people to see it Indeed how could it be appropriate to say that tathagatas conceal things Good man consider another counterexample in the case of a poor man who has taken on a considerable amount of debt Fearing he may encounter the holders of his debt he hides himself not wishing to be seen Thus he is labeled a man in hiding But tathagatas are not like that They do not bear the burden of the mundane dharma of living beings they bear the burden of the supramundane dharma of living beings And yet they hide nothing Because a tathagata is constant in regarding each living being as if it were his only child and for whom he preaches the unsurpassed dharma Good man consider the analogy of a wealthy merchant who only has one child His heart is filled with loving attachment to that child feelings he would never put aside and he would be willing to use every bit of his fortune to demonstrate that fact A tathagata is like this viewing living being as identical to his only child Good man people in this world find their male or female sexual organs ugly or embarrassing and so they cover themselves with clothing Thus it is said they hide themselves in this way But a tathagata is not like this as this faculty is permanently removed in him And without that faculty there is nothing to cover up Good man the discourse held by the briihmafJa priests is like this in that they never want to allow those of the katriya vaisya and sudra castes to hear it Why Because there are corruptions within that discourse But the truedhanna of the Tathagata is not like that it remains auspicious in its beginning middle and end Therefore it cannot be lab led a secret treasury Good man take the example of the layman with only one child His mind is preoccupied with the youngster his affection boundless He brings the child to a teacher out of a desire to get him an education but grows apprehensive when he does not see immediate results and straight away brings the child back home Day and night his affection drives him to work assiduously to teach the child himself but what he teaches is the alphabet he does not conduct lessons on grammar  Because the abilities of the youth are not yet capable of that kind of study Good man when that layman completes his teaching of the letters in the alphabet would the child then be able to comprehend grammar or not I n that situation would the layman b e keeping secrets hidden from his son or not The reason h e does not explain to the child is that the child is too young It is not because he is imposing some kind of secrecy on this material that he refrains from teaching it What is the principle here It is that what we call secrecy stems from situations where someone  s thinking is dominated by jealousy or a defensive stinginess That is not what tathagatas are like Indeed how could it be appropriate to say that tathagatas conceal anything The Buddha then said Excellent excellent Good man as you have said if there are thoughts of hatred jealousy or defensiveness in someone in that case we may say a person is concealing something But the Tathagata is completely devoid of anger or jealousyhow could he be labeled as one who conceals Good man the wealthy merchant in the story is an alusion to the Tathagata What I have called his one son is an allusion to all living beings The way the Tathagata looks upon all living beings is thus akin to how this man looks upon his only son and teaching his son is an allu  a sion to teaching his sravaka disciples The letters of the alphabet and the phonemes they represent are an allusion to the ninefold sutras  and the grammar treatises are an allusion to what I call the wellbalanced Vaitulya Mahayana scriptures It is because sravakas lack a certain power of wisdom that the Tathagata taught them letters namely the ninefold scriptures and did not endeavor to expound to them the wellbalanced Mahayana represented in the story by the grammar treatises Good man if after that merchant s son had grown big the grammar treatises were still not explained to him despite his having studied diligently then indeed one could call that a case of concealing something If for example sravakas similarly garnered such diligence that they would be able to accept the grammar treatises that represent the Mahayana here but out of some secretive selfishness the Tathagata would not expound it to them one could certainly say that the Tathagata had hidden secrets But tathagatas are not like that and that is why I say they hold no hidden secrets Like the wealthy merchant who having taught his young son the letters of the alphabet subsequently explained the grammar treatises I am now in that situation Having expounded on the alphabet that is the ninefold scriptures for my disciples I am now subsequently explaining the grammar treatises What I am referring to is the constant presence without change of the Tathagata Next good man consider an analogy of the moon in summer that brings forth clouds and thunder which pour down great monsoon rains which in turn enable the farmers to sow seeds and reap bountiful harvests Farmers who do not plant seeds will have no harvest but their not harvesting anything is not the fault of the dragon king  as for his part the dragon king has not hidden anything As a Tathagata I am also like this in that I rain down a dharma rain in the form of this Great Nirvana Sutra  Those living beings that plant seeds of goodness will reap a flowering of wisdom those who do not will reap nothing But reaping nothing will not be the fault of the Tathagata Quite the contrary the truth is that the Buddha Tathagata has not hidden anything Then Kasyapa spoke again Now I clearly understand that the Tathagata has not secretly hidden anything from us But this grammar treatise expounded by the Buddha states that the Buddha Tathagata is a constant unchanging presence and this notion I cannot follow Because in the past the Buddha expounded this verse As buddhas pratyekabuddhas and the assembly of sravakas Cast off their impermanent bodies How much more so will ordinary people Yet now you speak of a permanent existence without change How are we to make sense of this The Buddha answered Good man I expounded that verse when I was teaching at the stage of mere letters to all my sravaka disciples Good man when the mother of King Prasenajit died he came to see me because he could not overcome his feelings of sadness and love Great king why has the pain of your sadness and grief become so intense The king said WorldHonored One on this day the life of the first lady of our nation has come to an end If it were possible for you to restore my mother s life to what it once was I would abandon my kingdom elephants horses and my seven precious possessions I would give even my life  All of that I would sacrifice as a reward to you I answered him by saying The lifetimes of all living beings come to an end this is what we call death Buddhas pratyekabuddhas and the sravaka disciples let  l b go of their bodies so why not ordinary people It was because I was teaching the letters of the alphabet to King Prasenajit good man that I uttered that verse Now however I am expounding a grammar treatise for the sravaka disciples for I am saying the Tathiigata is a permanent presence without change If someone claimed the Tathagata was impermanent how could that person  s tongue not fall off Kasyapa then spoke up thus  The Buddha has also uttered this verse  He who has no accumulated holdings And has full knowledge of food Is like a bird in flight Whose traces are sought in vain What is the meaning of this WorldHonored One Who among living beings can be said to have no accumulated holdings And who is able to have what you call full knowledge of food Who moves about in the sky such that his traces are sought in vain And after departing where does one arrive at The Buddha then said to Kasyapa The term accumulated holdings refers to wealth Good man there are two kinds of accumulation created and uncreated  Created accumulationthat is what sravakas do  Uncreated accumulationthat is what tathiigatas do Good man there are also two kinds of sanghas created and uncreated The created sanghas are what I am calling the sravaka  In sravaka sanghas there is not to be any accumulated holdings of what I call slaves and things improper This includes storing grains rice salted or fermented bean paste sesame or beans of any size If someone claims the Tathiigata allows the holding of slaves servants or anything of the like his tongue will become twisted and shrink The sravaka disciples of mine I refer to as who have no accumulated holdings I also refer to them as having full knowledge of food Thus someone who craves food I call one who does not fully know and someone who does not crave food I call one who fully knows One whose traces are hard to find is thus one who is approaching the unsurpassed path to bod hi What I am saying is that these individuals have departed but they have not arrived anywhere Then Kasyapa said If created sanghas have no accumulated holdings then how much more so the uncreated sanghas  It is the tathiigatas that are the un created sanghas indeed how could there be any holdings accumulated by a tathagata This holding is regarded as concealrnn t  That is why there is nothing held back in whatever it is that is expounded by the Tathagata So how could anyone regard his preaching as hiding something The traces sought in vain is a reference to nirvfua itself For within nirvala there is neither sun nor moon neither stars nor astrological signs neither cold nor hot neither winds nor rain no birth aging illness or death and none of the twentyfive forms of existence present in saqJsara One is free from melancholy suffering and indeed all the defilements In this way nirvala is where the Tathiigata abides it is permanent and immutable   The Buddha then spoke to Kasyapa By saying great the implication is of immensity much like how a man whose life force is tremendous is called a great man If a man has been abl e to establish himself in the true dharma I would call him the best among men And as I explained when I taught the eight observances a great person there are people who can do one and there are people who can do many but if any one person can muster all eight that would be considered superior There are no wounds or sores in this nirvala of which I speak Good man it is just like the example of a man shot with a poison arrow He feels great pain but he then sees a physician learned in these matters who removes the poison arrow and administers effective medicine thereby enabling that man to become free of pain and feel calm and joyful The physician then moves on traveling to towns and villages wherever people are suffering from wounds or sores remaining with them as needed to treat their many pains  Good man so it is with the Tathagata Having attained perfect awakening he is a great physician king He sees how the suffering living beings of Jambudvipa have been through enormous turmoil brought on by the poison arrows of the defilements of lust anger and ignorance over innumerable kalpas For them he preaches the ambrosial dharma medicine of the Mahayana scriptures After having healed living beings here he then continues on to other locales where others suffer from the poisoned arrows of the defilements manifesting his attainment of buddhahood so that he may heal them This therefore I call mahiiparinirviirza The name mahiiparinirviirza refers to a place of liberation for it is in those places where living beings struggle with selfdiscipline that the Tathagata appears Because of how truly profound this meaning is it is called mahiiparinirviirza The bodhisattva Kasyapa then addressed the Buddha once again WorldHonored One are worldly physicians able to heal the wounds and sores of all living beings or not Good man worldly wounds and sores are generally of two kinds those that can be healed and those that cannot For those that can be healed a physician should be able to perform this role But for those that cannot be cured the physician cannot help Kasyapa then asked The Buddha has said Then the Tathagata after having healed living beings in Jambudvipa   But if you say after having healed why is it that among living beings there are still some who are unable to attain nirvaQa If none of them can attain it then why does the Tathagata say that after healing them he will go somewhere else Good man there are two types of living beings in Jambudvipa those who have faith and those who do not Those who have faith are the people of whom I spoke when I said they can be healed Why did I say this That is why I spoke of having healed living beings in Jambudvipa People without faith I refer to as icchantikas The icchantikas I also call those who cannot be healed Aside from the icchantikas all others will have been healed This is why nirvfua is referred to as having no wounds WorldHonored One what is it that is called nirvflIa Good man nirvflIa is what I call liberation a Kasyapa spoke again This liberation of which you speak does it have material form or not The Buddha said Good man it may have form or it may be formless To describe it as formless is to refer to the liberation of sravakas and pratyekabuddhas To describe it as having form is to refer to the liberation of buddha tathagatas Therefore good man liberation itself has form and does not have form But it was for the sake of the sravaka disciples that the Tathagata has preached it as being formless W orldHonored One if the liberation of sravakas and pratyekabuddhas is formless how then do they abide in it Good man it is something like the meditation heaven of neither thought nor non thought which exists in both the form realm and in the formless realm As to that state someone may complain by saying If the meditation heaven of neither thought nor nonthought is formless then how could someone reside there how could they come and go start and stop But meanings such as these reflect the realm of buddhas they are not something understood by sravakas or pratyekabuddhas Liberation is just like thisit may have form it may be formless Indeed I have preached that it has no form and I have also preached that there is no thought in thought and nonthought Meanings such as these are of the realm of buddhas they are not something understood by sravakas or pratyekabuddhas Then Kasyapa addressed the Buddha once again WorldHonored One I beseech you Please take pity on our situation and provide us with more detail on the practices leading to mahiiparinirviilJa and the meaning of liberation The Buddha then praised Kasyapa saying Excellent excellent Good man true liberation is what I call complete freedom from all restrictions As true liberation is free from restrictions it means there is no birth and no conjoining of things Take the example of a father and mother who conjoin to give birth to a childthat is not what true liberation is like This is why I also call liberation unborn Kasyapa take the example of the cream on the surface of clarified butter whose nature is purethis also true of the tathagatas As he is not born from the union of a mother and father his nature is pure My manifesting having had a father and mother stems from my hope to spiritually transform living beings to bring them to the other shore True liberation is the Tathagata himself Tathagata and liberation are not two there is no distinction between them One may think it is like sowing seeds in the spring months and then seeing them sprout after the weather turns warmbut true liberation is in fact not like that In addition I speak of liberation as nothingness Nothingness is precisely what liberation is liberation is precisely what the Tathagata is and the Tathagata is precisely what nothingness is It is neither doing nor deed By doing I mean something like building a lookout tower on a city wall to watch for enemies That is not what true liberation is like This is why liberation is none other than the Tathagata In addition liberation is an uncreated dhanna Imagine a ceramist who after creating something goes back and breaks it That is not what liberation is like True liberation neither comes into existence nor goes out of existence Therefore liberation is precisely what the Tathagata is For the Tathagata is just like this  he does not come into existence he does not go out of existence he does not age he does not die he does not break he does not disintegratehe is not a created dhanna It is in this sense that I say the Tathagata enters mahiiparinirviilJa  What do I mean by he does not age he does not die Aging itself we can say means to undergo change such as one  s hair turning white or one  s face becoming wrinkled Dying is when the body disintegrates and life ends There are no dhannas like that in liberation in fact it is because these things are absent that it is called liberation  A Tathagata also has no created dhannas that would cause his hair to become white or his face to become wrinkled For this reason there is no aging in the Tathagata and because there is no aging there is no death In addition I refer to liberation as being without disease The word disease refers to the four hundred and four illnesses of the body as well as injury to the body from something external none of which have any basis for occurring This is why it is called liberation The absence of any disease now that is true liberation And true liberation is precisely what the Tathagata is The Tathagata is without disease for the dhanna body can have no disease In this way freedom from disease is precisely what a tathagata is Death is the name given to the dissolution of the body and the end of life A state without deaththat is what the timeless ambrosia of amrta i s  This amrta is what true liberation is and true liberation is what the Tathagata is As the Tathagata is fully accomplished in these virtues how could it be said that the Tathagata is impermanent I f someone were t o assert impennanence i n  that would be unfounded This adamantine bodyhow could it be impennanent Therefore I do not speak of life ending for a Tathagata The Tathagata is pure without any defilement the body of this Tathagata was not polluted in the womb for example Like the pUlJcjarika white lotus flower its original nature is pure The Tathagata s liberation is also like this  for liberation such as this is the Tathagata That is why I say the Tathagata is pure immaculate In addition in liberation all leaking wounds or sores are permanently gone and nothing remains of this The Tathagata is also like this for he has no leaking wounds In addition in liberation there is no conflict For example take a hungry person who upon seeing anothers food and drink covets them and thinks about snatching them That is precisely what liberation is not In addition liberation is what I call quiescence Ordinary people say this quiescence refers to of Mahesvara but talk like that is simply untrue True quiescence is ultimate liberation and ultimate liberation is precisely what the Tathagata is In addition I speak of liberation as safe Just as a place with many thieves cannot be called safe a place that is pacified is said to be safe or secure Within this liberation there is no fear of any kind hence I call it safe That is why I say that what is safe is true liberation True liberation is precisely what the Tathagata is and the Tathagata is precisely the dharma itself In addition liberation is without peer Having a peer is akin to a king having someone of his rank in a neighboring country But this liberation has nothing of the sort To be without peer can be said of a wheelturning king for no one can become his equal In a similar way liberation has no peer and having no peer describes true liberation True liberation is precisely what this very Tathagata the wheelturning king of the world is This is why the Tathagata is without peer Any asserc tion that there is a peer is unfounded In addition I speak of liberation as devoid of distress To have distress is something like the sense of fear that arises within a king when confronted with the strength of a neighboring state  In this liberation there is nothing of that nature Consider instead the analogy of destroying enmity within one  s own elf which then yie lds a mind free of worrythis is what liberation is like devoid of worry or fear And the absence of worry or fear is precisely what the Tathagata is In addition liberation is devoid of sadness and joy Suppose a woman has only one son who goes far away for his compulsory service and during his absence news suddenly comes to her that something unfortunate has befallen him Upon hearing this she would sink into despair but if she later hears that he is alive she would then be elated In liberation there is nothing like this The absence of sadness and j oy is what true liberation is about and true liberation is precisely what the Tathagata is In addition in liberation there is no dirt Consider for example the way that dust is blown into the air by the wind after the sun goes down during the spring months  There is no such thing in liberation The absence of dust clouds is a metaphor for true liberation and what is truly liberated is the Tathagata Now consider the jewels placed in the topknot of a sacred king that are untarnished The nature of liberation is also like that untarnished This absence of dirt or stain is a metaphor for true liberation and true liberation is the Tathagata The nature of pure gold is that it is not mixed with sand or other stones thus it is called a true jewel People who obtain such things have the idea that they have wealth The nature of this liberation is also something like this true jewel that is a true jewel is a metaphor for true liberation and true liberation is the Tathagata Consider as well the sound you hear when a ceramic j ar is broken This sound does not occur with a j ar made of an adamantine jewel and in liberation there is no sound of anything breaking either The j ar made of an adamantine jewel is a metaphor for liberation and true liberation is the Tathagata This is why I say the body of the Tathagata is indestructible A sound is also made when castor bean pods explode after being roasted and then left out in the sun Liberation has nothing like this rather it is like the adamantine jar of jewel that makes no sound at all when struck Even if innumerable hundreds of thousands of people were to shoot arrows at it all at the same time they would be unable to damage it The absence of any sound of breakage is a metaphor for true liberation and true liberation is the Tathagata Or think of the punishment of an extremely poor man who has to endure the terrible pain of being whipped while shackled simply because he is deep in debt There is nothing like this in this liberation as there is no debt of any kind Then think of the analogy of someone of importance whose holdings of property and jewels are in the uncountable hundreds of millions and whose power allows him to do what he pleases with no debts to anyone Liberation is like this It contains immeasurable rare treasures of dharma assets the freedom of great power and no debt of any kind Having no debt is a metaphor for true liberation and true liberation is what the Tathagata is In addition there is nothing oppressive in liberation such as traveling on foot on a hot day in spring eating sweets in summer or touching something cold in winter In true liberation there is nothing that a approximates these things Nothing oppressive is a metaphor for true liberation and true liberation is precisely what the Tathagata is To understand the meaning of nothing oppressive consider the counterexample of a man who eats his fill of fish and meat and then drinks milk Before long he would be approaching his deathbut in liberation there is nothing like this Now if the person who ate like that could obtain an effective ambmsial medicine it would alleviate his distress True liberation is also something like that The notion of an effective ambrosial medicine is a figurative expression for true liberation and true liberation is what the Tathagata is What is it to be oppressive or not Suppose there was an ordinary person who is proud and haughty so much so that he thinks Who among all these people could harm me And he proceeds to show his prowess by holding snakes tigers and poisonous insects a man like that will meet with an untimely death before his natural life span has been exhausted There is nothing like this in true liberation To not be oppressive is to be like a cakravartin king The sacred jewel that he possesses is capable of subduing dung beetles and the ninetysix other kinds of poisonous insects One only has to perceive the scent of this sacred jewel and all poisons will be neutralized True liberation is also like this as everyone is freed from the twentyfive forms of existence The neutralization of poisons is a metaphor for true liberation and true liberation is precisely what the Tathagata is As to not being oppressive consider the example of space for liberation is also like this Space thus serves as a metaphor for true liberation and true liberation is precisely what the Tathagata is On the other hand oppressive can apply to dry grass for it ignites when a lamp is brought near There is nothing like this in true liberation To not be oppressive moreover can be compared to the sun and the moon that do not oppress living beings In like manner liberation contains nothing that could oppress living beings there is nothing oppressive is thus a figurative way to express true liberation and true liberation is precisely what the Tathagata is In addition liberation is what I call an imperturbable dharma  Things like enemies and friendsthere is simply nothing like this in true liberation Imperturbability is somewhat like a cakravartin king for it is utterly impossible for a sacred king to be someones friend even if were averred that he were a friend it would not make any sense Liberation is like this it is utterly without friends in the usual sense and even if one were to assert that it has friends this would be untenable That king without peers is a metaphor for true liberation true liberation is what the Tathagata is and the Tathagata is what the dharma is In addition imperturbability might be thought of as being like raw cloth that easily accepts dyestuff for coloration but liberation is not like this Imperturbability is instead like the viirika flower in that no matter how much one may want to tum it into something foul smelling or green in color it simply makes no sense to try to do so In the same way even if one wanted to make liberation smell bad or be colored in some way such things do not happen For that very reason liberation is the Tathagata himself In addition I refer to liberation as extraordinary The metaphor of a lotus flower blooming in water is not extraordinary A lotus blooming in fire however that would be extraordinary and whoever saw it would be elated True liberation also like this there is elation in the hearts of those who witness it This extraordinariness is a metaphor for true liberation true liberation is what the Tathagata is and the Tathagata is none other than the dharma body In addition there is also the disanology of liberation as extraordinary and an infant baby who has not grown teeth yet for its teeth arise only after the baby gradually grows large Liberation is not like that there is neither arising nor nonarising    In addition I refer to liberation as non substantial but this does not mean it is indeterminate icchantikas will never be shaken out of their state of mind that anyone who commits a heinous crime is precluded from completing the path to buddhahood but this view is unfounded Because if in their hearts such people can obtain pure faith in the Buddha s truedharma they will immediately destroy as icchantika Likewise if one can become a layman follower  this too will mean the end of being an icchantika Someone who has transgressed in committing a heinous crime can after having eliminated his offense go on to attain buddhahood This is why there is no basis for the claim that people are fixed in who they are that cannot change that they cannot attain buddhahood In true liberation nothing is completely exhausted This nonsubstantiality moreover pervades the dharmadhiitu The nature of the dharmadhiitu is true liberation itself and true liberation is what the Tathagata is When an icchantika moreover exhausts what makes him so he can no longer be labeled icchantika What in fact is meant by the name icchantika Icchantikas are those who have destroyed all wholesome karmic roots within themselves  Their original mindset is one that does not aspire to any wholesome dharmas and they may even reach the point where not one wholesome thought occurs to them In true liberation there is no one like this In fact it is precisely because of the absence of anything like this that it is true liberation and true liberation is what the Tathagata is In addition I also call liberation unfathomable One may think it is like a pile of grains whose number but can be known  however that would be a disanology for true liberation is not like that If instead you take the analogy of an ocean whose capacity cannot be measured that would be true For liberation is indeed just that as its capacity cannot be measured Unfathomable is indeed what true liberation is that cannot be measured and true liberation is what the Tathagata is In addition liberation is what I call dharma without measure Just like one living being has a multitude of karmic recompense in like manner liberation also has recompense that is immeasurable Immeasurable recompensethat is precisely true liberation and true liberation is what the Tathagata is In addition I refer to liberation as immense As an ocean has no equal  liberation similarly cannot be equated with anything The absence of any equivalent is precisely what true liberation is and true liberation is what the Tathagata is In addition I refer to liberation as paramount Just as nothing can be compared to the loftiness of space nothing can be compared to the loftiness of liberation as well Incomparably lofty is what true liberation is and true liberation is what the Tathagata is In addition I refer to liberation as unsurpassable Consider the analogy of the position occupied by a lion something that none of the hundreds of other animal species can surpass Liberation is like this for there is nothing that can surpass it Unsurpassable is what true liberac tion is and true liberation is what the Tathagata is In addition I refer to liberation as what is uppermost Just like the northern direction is located above the other directions there is nothing above liberation Uppermost is precisely what true liberation is and true liberation is what the Tathagata is In addition I refer to liberation as above the uppermost Just like the northern direction lies above the highest locations in the eastern direction in liberation there is nothing above it as uppermost Above the uppermost is precisely what true liberation is and true liberation is what the Tathagata is In addition I call liberation a constant dharma An analogy would be the destruction of the bodies of humans and deities at the end of their lives This we know of as a constant indeed it cannot possibly not be a constant In like manner liberation is not anything inconstant Thus not anything inconstant is what true liberation is and true liberation is what the Tathagata is In addition I refer to liberation as firm Like the solid fum khadira candana and aguru trees liberation is the same in that its nature is firm A nature that is firm is what true liberation is and true liberation is what the Tathagata is In addition I refer to liberation as not vacuous It would be a disanology to describe it as being like bamboo or marsh reeds whose bodies are hollow as liberation is not like that Thus it should be known that liberation is what the Tathagata is In addition liberation is something that cannot be contaminated Consider the analogy of an unpainted wall where mosquitoes and flies alight and remain to frolic If one were to paint colorful pictures or to carve images on it the insects would smell the odor from the pigment and no longer abide there Such nonabiding is a metaphor for true liberation and true liberation is what the Tathagata is In addition I refer to liberation as boundless Villages and towns all have marked boundaries and so are only disanologies for liberation which is not like that Space on the other hand which has no limits would be analogous for liberation also has no limits Liberation in this sense is precisely what the Tathagata is In addition I declare that liberation cannot be seen As it is difficult to see the traces of a bird in flight across the sky the difficulty in seeing something like that is thus analogous to true liberation and true liberation is what the Tathagata is In addition I refer to liberation as profound Why Because it cannot be entered by sravakas and pratyekabuddhas What they cannot enter is indeed true liberation and true liberation is what the Tathagata is It is profound moreover in that it is revered by buddhas and bodhisattvas An analogy would be the profundity of the virtuous merit created by the filial child who makes offerings of sustenance to his mother and father for the profundity of such merit is a metaphor for true liberation And true liberation is what the Tathagata is In addition I refer to liberation as unseen analogous to a person who does not see his own head True liberation is like this as it cannot be seen by sravakas and pratyekabuddhas That which cannot see is thus true liberation and true liberation is what the Tathagata is In addition I refer to liberation as having no abode analogous to the a fact that there are no houses in the sky So it is with liberation as the word abode here is a metaphor for the twentyfive fonns of existence Having no abode is a metaphor for true liberation and true liberation is what the Tathagata is In addition I refer to liberation as something that cannot be held Unlike the iimalaka berry that can be held in one s hand liberation is something else entirely for it cannot be held as such What cannot be held describes what true liberation is and true l iberation is what the Tathagata is In addition I refer to liberation as something that cannot be grasped Like an illusory obj ect that one cannot grasp true liberation similarly is something that one cannot grasp What cannot be grasped describes what true liberation is and true liberation is what the Tathagata i s  In addition liberation is incorporeal A disanology would b e those people whose bodies have produced wounds and sores ulcers and abscesses convulsions and madness eczema and lichenification For within true liberation there are no such ailments The absence of such ailments is a metaphor for true liberation and true liberation is what the Tathagata is In addition I refer to liberation as a single flavor Just as there is a single consistent flavor in milk liberation also has only one flavor A single flavor like this is precisely what true liberation is and true liberation is precisely what the Tathagata is In addition I refer to liberation as pure Like water without any dirt is pure and utterly c lean so too liberation is also pure and clean Pure and clean is precisely what true liberation is and true liberation is precisely what the Tathagata is In addition I refer to liberation as being uniform in its flavor like the purity of the uniform taste of rain as it falls from the sky This purity of being uniform in flavor is but a metaphor for true liberation and true liberation is what the Tathagata is In addition I refer to liberation as removed analogous to a full moon with no c loud cover Liberation is also like this a cloud cover having been entirely removed To be without any cloud cover is precisely true liberation and true liberation is what the Tathagata is In addition liberation I refer to as tranquility This is analogous to a man burning with fever whose body gains a peaceful tranquility when his illness is cured Liberation is j ust like the body when it becomes tranquil To attain tranquility is precisely what true liberation is and true liberation is what the Tathagata is In addition liberation is characterized by equanimity Suppose there were a field replete with poisonous snakes rodents and wolves all of whom intend to kill something That would not be what liberation is like for there are no thoughts of killing in liberation To be without any thoughts of killing is what true liberation is and true liberation is what the Tathagata is Equanimity is analogous to the way a father and mother think about their children equally Liberation also has this equanimity of mind Equanimity of mind is just what true liberation is and true liberation is what the Tathagata is In addition I refer to liberation as no other place analogous to a man who resides only in a beautiful clean house and has no other place for himself So too does liberation have no other locale To have no other place is what true liberation is and true liberation is what the Tathagata is In addition I refer to liberation as contentment Describing libb eration as a hungry person who comes across a cache of sweets and eats to his heart  s content would be a disanology Liberation is not like that Instead it is like eating rice porridge cooked in milk which leads one to require nothing further Not requiring anything further is a metaphor for true liberation and true liberation is what the Tathagata is In addition I refer to liberation as severed just like someone who has severed the tight binds that restricted him and has obtained release Liberation is like this severing all fetters that arise from doubt In this way to discontinue doubt is tantamount to true liberation and true liberation is what the Tathagata is In addition I refer to liberation as reaching the other shore You may think of the analogy of a great river with a shore on this side and a shore on the other side but liberation in fact is not like that This is because while there is a shore on that side there is no shore on this side The existence of an other shore is what true liberation is and true liberation is what the Tathagata is In addition I refer to liberation as silence A great ocean in which many and various sounds break out over the broad expanse of its swells would be a disanology for liberation is not like this Liberation in this sense is what the Tathagata is In addition I call liberation most attractive Those medicines in which are mixed the harftakf fruiC will have a bitter taste as a result This is not an appropriate analogy for liberation for its taste is like the sweet nectar of amrta The taste of sweet amrta is a metaphor for true liberation and true liberation is what the Tathagata is In addition liberation is eliminating the defilements Analogous to a skilled physician who combines medicines for the effective treatment of illnesses liberation is similarly capable of eliminating the defi lements Eliminating the defilements is precisely what true liberation is and true liberation is what the Tathagata is In addition I refer to liberation as being without constriction A small hut that does not accommodate many people would be a disanology for many beings are accepted within liberation The inclusion of so many is precisely what true liberation is and true liberation is what the Tathagata is In addition I refer to liberation as extinguishing passionate desires and not indulging in sexual activity It would be a disanology to think of a woman of many sensual passions for liberation is not like that In this sense liberation is precisely what the Tathagata is for a Tathagata is completely without such fetters as desire resentment stupidity or arrogance In addition I refer to liberation as being without passion Passion is of two types  hungryghost passion and dharma passion True liberation is free of the passions plaguing hungry ghosts Empathy toward living beings also gives rise to passion but this is dharma Dharma passion such as this is precisely what true liberation is and true liberation is what the Tathagata is In addition liberation is also free of me and mine   It i s the Tathagata that is liberation such as this and it is the dharma that is the Tathagata In addition liberation is the destruction and abandonment of all forms of greed Liberation such as this is what the Tathagata is and the Tathagata is none other than the dharma itself In addition liberation is deliverance In that it can rescue one from all sources of fear liberation such as this is what the Tathagata is and the Tathagata is himself the dharma In addition liberation is itself a refuge If one avails himself of the  c refuge that is liberation such as this there is no need to seek any other Consider the analogy of a man who relies upon his king seeking no other support Though he is sure of his king any upheaval in the country  But for one who takes refuge in liberation there are no upheavals The lack of upheavals is what true liberation is true liberation is what the Tathagata is and the Tathagata is what the dharma is In addition I refer to liberation as a house A disanology would be a person who encounters hardship crossing a broad plain Liberation is not like this for there are no hardships The absence of hardship is precisely true liberation and true liberation is what the Tathagata is In addition liberation is the absence of fear Just like the lion king harbors no fear toward the myriad other animals liberation is the same in that one has no fear toward the hosts of Mara To have no fear is what true liberation is and true liberation is what the Tathagata is In addition there is no restrictiveness in liberation If you think of a passage so narrow that it cannot accommodate two people walking abreast what you would have is precisely what liberation is not Liberation in this sense is precisely what the Tathagata is that is unrestricted Or if you think of how restricted you would feel if you jumped into a well in fear of a tiger this would also not be what liberation is like Liberation in this sense is precisely what the Tathagata is that is unrestricted On the other hand if you were out on the ocean in a small rickety boat that you then j ettisoned for a sturdy imposing ship and that ship that took you all the way across that ocean to place that is calm and safe  the elation you would feel is what liberation is like Obtaining that kind of elation that is what true liberation is And true liberation is what the Tathagata is In addition liberation abolishes causality The usual pattern of milk yielding sour milk sour milk yielding butter and butter yielding clarified butter would be a disanology for within liberation such forms of causality do not exist Not having any causality is precisely what true liberation is and true liberation is what the Tathagata is In addition liberation vanquishes arrogance so a great king acting haughty toward a lesser king is not what liberation is like Liberation such as this is what the Tathagata is and the Tathagata is what the dharma is In addition liberation vanquishes selfindulgence By selfindulgence I mean having many cravings Within liberation there is nothing that could be called this The absence of anything that could be called indulgence is precisely what is meant by true liberation and true liberation is what the Tathagata is In addition liberation eliminates the darkness of ignorance It is like when you take the best quality butter and remove its impurities yielding what is then called clarified butter Liberation is like this removing the dregs of ignorance produces true light This true light is what true liberation is and true liberation is what the Tathagata is In addition I call liberation quiescence singular and unique Like a solitary elephant alone in an empty fieldthis is what liberation is like There is only one not two It is true liberation that is unique in this way and true liberation is what the Tathagata is In addition I speak of the hardness of liberation much like the bamboo reeds or hemp plants that have hollow cores yet produce seeds that are hard Apart from buddha tathagatas all other humans and deities are not hard or solid But true liberation is free from the ebb and flow of all forms of existence And liberation such as this is what the Tathagata is In addition I refer to liberation as completely awakened and augmenting to the self True liberation is also like this and true liberation such as this is what the Tathagata is In addition I refer to liberation as abandoning the existences An analogy would be a man who vomits up his food after having eaten Liberation is like this in that in it one has freed oneself from all existence  To have abandoned all existence is   precisely what true liberation is and true liberation is precisely what the Tathagata is In addition I refer to liberation as definitive like the fragrance of the viirika flower rather than saptaparra tree that have no scent Liberation is like this and liberation such as this is precisely what the Tathagata is In addition I call liberation the water element The analogy of the water element comes from the fact that among the great elements water is the most prominent thoroughly pervading all grasses trees and seeds Liberation is like this for it pervades all fonns of life And it is the Tathagata that is liberation such as this In addition I call liberation an entrance It is like a door that opens onto a path that leads to a golden place where gold can then be obtained Liberation is similar just like that door and those who cultivate nonself will thus be able to enter through it Liberation such as this is precisely what the Tathagata is In addition I refer to liberation as excellent This is analogous to a disciple who follows his teacher honors him holds in esteem what he has been taught and attains fame as one who is excellent Liberation is also like this and it is liberation such as this that is what the Tathagata is In addition I refer to liberation as a dhanna beyond this world for it surpasses all other dhannas It is like the fact that among all flavors that of butter or milk is the best Liberation is also this and it is the Tathagata that is liberation like this In addition I refer to liberation as steadfast analogous to the threshold of a door for wind cannot move it True liberation is also like this and it is liberation such as this that is what the Tathagata is In addition I refer to liberation as without waves Water in the ocean moves in the fonn of waves but liberation is not like this Liberation such as this is what the Tathagata is In addition liberation is analogous to a palatial hall Liberation is also like this and you should be aware that it is the Tathagata that is liberation In addition I refer to liberation as eminently useful Like the gold found in the lambii River no matter how much is taken out it will never be said that the gold found in that river has impurities in it Liberation is j ust like thi s there will never be impurities in it True liberation is precisely that which has no impurities and true liberation is what the Tathiigata is In addition liberation means abandoning chi ldish behavior analogous to an adult who abandons behaving as a small boy Liberation is also like this in that it j ettisons the five aggregates  To j ettison the five aggregates is what true liberation is and true liberation is what the Tathiigata is In addition I refer to liberation as the culmination This is akin to a person bound with restraints who gains his release undergoes purification through bathing and then returns home Liberation is like this completely pure That which is completely pure is true liberation and b true liberation is what the Tathiigata is I n addition I refer to lib eration as the p leasure of something undone The pleasure of something undone comes when craving anger and delusion are purged Thi s is like someone who mistakenly drinks poisonous snake venom and in order to remove the poison takes a medicine to induce vomiting Once he has succeeded in vomiting the poison is thereby removed and his body attains calm and j oy Liberation is like this When you purge all the poisons of bondage that are inherent in the defilements you feel calmed and j oyful This is called the pleasure of something undone It is true liberation when you experience this pleasure of something undone and true liberation is what the Tathiigata is In addition I refer to liberation as ending the defilements stemming from the four kinds of poisonous snakes To eliminate the defilements is true liberation and true liberation is the Tathagata In addition I refer to liberation as being freed from existence annihi lating all forms of suffering obtaining all forms of j oy permanently eliminating greed anger and stupidity and pulling out the roots of all defilements To pull out one  s roots is true liberation and true liberation is what the Tathiigata is In addition I refer to liberation as renouncing all created dharmas bringing forth only uncontaminated wholesome dharmas and shutting down the paths Whether one speaks of self nonself the denial of self or the denial of nonself one only renounces attachments to those views  he does not renounce this view of self This view of self I call buddhanature For buddhanature is what true liberation is and true liberation is what the Tathagata is In addition I refer to liberation as not thoroughly empty Thoroughly empty means nothing whatsoever Nothing whatsoever is how liberation is thought of by the heretical Nirgranthas yet these Nirgranthas do not actually have liberation That i s why they call it thoroughly empty But true liberation is not like that hence I refer to it as not thoroughly empty Not thoroughly empty is what is true liberation is and true liberation is precisely what the Tathagata is In addition I refer to liberation as empty and nonempty It is like jars for water wine yogurt butter honey and the like even when they have no water wine yogurt butter or honey inside them they are still called water jars wine jars and so on So these jars cannot be said to be empty nor can they be said to be nonempty Ifwe say they are empty then we cannot admit to any presence of visual form aroma taste or tactile sensation associated with the jars themselves If we say they are non empty then we have to account for the fact that even when there is no water wine and so forth in the jars they are still recognized as water jars wine jars and so forth  Liberation is just like this One can neither say that i t has form o r does not have form One can neither say that it is empty or nonempty If we say it is empty then we cannot admit to the presence of permanence bliss self and purity Ifwe say it is nonempty then who feels its permanence bliss self and purity This means therefore that one cannot declare it to be either empty or nonempty Emptiness refers to the absence of any of the twentyfive forms of existence as well as the absence of any of the defilements Its emptiness represents the fact that all suffering all marks all existences are karmic  this is akin to how we refer to a yogurt jar as empty when there is no yogurt in it Its nonemptiness represents that fact that its lovely formnamely permanence bliss self purity immovableness and immutablenessis true and real and is akin to how we refer to the jar as nonempty because of its fonn smell taste and touch On the other hand the jar may encounter circumstances in which it is broken but liberation is not like that for it is unbreakable Unbreakable is what true liberation is and true liberation is what the Tathagata is In addition I refer to liberation as free from longing Consider a person who is filled with thoughts of ionging for and entreaties to gods such as S akra Devanam Indra Brahma or Mahesvara Know that liberation is not like that If someone completes the attainment of anuttarii samyaksalfbodhi that person will have no longings and no doubts Having neither longings nor doubts is what true liberation is and true liberation is what the Tathagata is So if someone states that there is longing or doubt in liberation that would have no basis In addition liberation eliminates any desire for existence and likewise eliminates all characteristics all restraints all of the defilements all births and deaths all kannic conditioning and all kannic effects Liberation such as this is what the Tathagata is and the Tathagata is what nirvala is It is because all living beings fear the defilements that come with the cycle of birth and death that they accept the triplerefuge This is analogous to a herd of deer that fears a hunter yet manages to escape by separating itself from him If a deer leaping once is like taking refuge once then a deer leaping three times is like taking refuge thrice By leaping three times the deer feels a sense of calm and j oy Living beings are j ust like this for it is also the fear of dangerous huntersthe four marasthat drives them to accept the triplerefugeH It is because of the triplerefuge that they are able to obtain a sense of calm and j oy and feeling a sense of calm and joy is what true liberation is True liberation is what the Tathagata is The Tathagata is what nirvala is Nirvala is what inexhaustible is Inexhaustible is what the buddhanature is The buddhanature is what certainty is And certainty is what anuttarii salfyaksalfbodhi is Kasyapa then spoke the Buddha WorldHonored One if nirviila buddhanature certainty and the Tathagata are all of one meaning why do you explain that there are three fonns of refuge  The Buddha told Kasyapa Good man all living beings fear the cycle of birth and death and therefore seek the triplerefuge And it is by means of these three forms of refuge that one comes to know the buddhanature certainty and nirvIua Good man there are dharmas whose names are identical but whose meanings are different and there are dharmas whose names and meanings are both different The principle of identical names but different meanings is apparent when it is said the buddha is permanent the dharma is permanent the bhiu sangha is permanent and both nirvala and space are also permanent These are called  whose names are identical but whose meanings are different The principle of names and meanings are both different is apparent when it is said that buddha is a name for  awakened    dharma is a name for  unawakened  sangha is a name for  a combination   nirvala is a name for  liberation   and   space is a name for  unwholesome  and also unobstructed   These are of whose names and meanings are both different Good man the triplerefuge is also like this When name and meaning are both different how could one say they are identical This is why I told MahaprajapatI GautamI do not make offerings to me make your offerings to the sangha If you make offerings to the sangha then in effect your offerings will include the complete triplerefuge MahaprajapatI then answered me by saying a There is neither buddha nor dharma in a community of monks Why do you say that making offerings to the sangha results in offerings to the complete triplerefuge I then related this to her Whenever you follow my words that itself is an offering to a buddha Because you do this for the purpose of liberation it also constitutes an offering to the dharma And when a monastic community accepts  that is an offering to the sangha Good man for this reason the triplerefuge can never be uniform Good man the Tathagata on some occasions expounds this single notion as three and on other occasions speaks of this threefold notion as one Meanings such as this are of the realm of buddhas they are not fully understood by sravakas or pratyekabuddhas Kasyapa then asked As the Buddha has explained it what is called nirvala is the ultimate in bliss but what does this mean Nirvala leaving behind the body and leaving behind understanding But if both one s body and understanding are abandoned then who experiences the bliss  The Buddha said Good man consider the analogy of a person who feels troubled after eating and goes outside in order to vomit and then after vomiting returns to where he was His colleagues ask him Have you finally been healed of whatever it was that you suffered from now that you have come back And he tells them I have healed myself and gained a serene bliss The Tathagata is like this Having finally detached himself from all twentyfive forms of existence he gains forever that place of serene bliss that is nirvala which can never be disturbed or exhausted Eliminating all forms of sensation I call bliss without sensation Having no sensation in this way is what I call to be in constant bliss If someone were to claim that a tathagata experiences bliss arising from sensation this would be totally unfounded This is why ultimate bliss is what nirvala is nirvala is what true liberation is and true liberation is what the Tathagata is Kasyapa then asked Nonarising and nonce asing is that what liberation is So it is so it is good man nonarising and nonceasing are precisely what liberation is In this way liberation is none other than the Tathagata himself Kasyapa then spoke again If nonari sing and none easing is liberation then the nature of space which is also without arising or ceasing must also accord with the Tathagata For that which is like the tathagatanature is liberation The Buddha then said to Kasyapa No good man it is not like that Good man it is like the kalavinka andjlvafljlvaka birds whose songs are pure and mellifluous Is the sound of these birds identical to that of the crow or magpie The voice of a crow or magpie cannot compare by a hundredfold a thousandfold even ten thousandfold to the sounds of birds such as the jlvafljlvaka  Kasyapa went on  The kalavinka and other such birds have voices that are sublime and bodies that are also not the same as other birds Why does the Tathagata compare them to crows and magpies as if they were no different It is like comparing a mustard plant to Mount Sumeru Buddha and space are also like thi s The voice of the kalavinka bird is analogous to the voice of the Buddha which could never be analogous to the voices of crows or magpies At that moment the Buddha praised Kasyapa saying b Excellent excellent Good man the understanding you have now shown is quite good a deep appreciation of something difficult to grasp At times the Tathagata may use a particular situation to draw an analogy between space and liberation and thi s liberation of which I speak is what a tathagata is True liberation is not something of which any human or deity could ever be the equivalent and as such space is not its true analog either I use space in order to transform living beings spiritually a disanology that I use as an analogy What you should understand is that liberation is the Tathagata himself and the tathagatanature is liberation itself Liberation and tathagata are not a duality they are not separate Good man the designation disanology refers to the fact that it is incomparable that one cannot use a metaphor to adequately describe it In certain circumstances we may be able to draw a picture by means of simile as when I have said such things as a countenance like a full moon or a white elephant as clean as the snowy Himalayas in the sutras But a full moon cannot be the same as one  s face and no snowy mountain could actually be a white elephant Good man true liberation is something that cannot be likened by means of metaphor or analogy and it is only for purposes spiritually transforming living beings that I use figurative language I use analogies in every case to foster understanding of the nature of dharmas Kasyapa then spoke again asking Why does the Tathagata expound the teaching in two different ways The Buddha said Good man suppose a man filled with malice appeared brandishing a sword and wanted to cut down the Tathagata The Tathagata would remain pleasantly relaxed however and would face the man without anger Would that person be able to inj ure the Tathagata s body and become guilty of committing a heinous crime or not No WorldHonored One Because the realm of a tathagata body cannot be injured For what reason Because it is not a corporeal aggregate like that of living beings  it is only dharmanature  And the reality of dharmanature is that it cannot be injured How could this man possibly injure the Buddhas body To be obsessed with injurious thoughts will itself result in immediate retribution  One could indeed use this story as an analogy to enable someone to understand the genuine dharma  At that moment the Buddha praised Kasyapa Excellent excellent good manwhat I had intended to explain you have already explained In addition good man suppose there is an evil person who wishes to violently attack his mother In the field where he works he lies in wait at the bottom of a large pile of grain When his mother approaches with food for him she sees that he is in an agitated state and that he is sharpening his sword Upon understanding the situation she escapes by hiding inside the pile of grain whereupon the man grabs his sword and thrusts it into the grain pile while walking around it After completing his stabs and cuts he is ovetjoyed filled with the idea that he has killed her Soon thereafter the mother comes out of the grain pile and returns home What do you think has that man accomplished a sin that would send him to A vfci Hell or not No WorldHonored One one cannot determine that in this case The reason is that if we say he is guilty then the mother s body should have been destroyed But if her body is not destroyed then how can we say he is guilty On the other hand if we say he is innocent we then have to deal with his joyful attitude based on his certainty that he had indeed killed his mother so how can we say he is not guilty Although this man did not complete a crime so heinous it would bring immediate retribution nevertheless there is still something vile here One could indeed use this story as an analogy to enable someone to understand the genuine dharma The Buddha praised Kasyapa saying c Excellent excellent good man Using stories like these I preach with a variety of expedient means and analogies describing liberation metaphorically But though an incalculable asakhyeya number of metaphors may be used there is no metaphor that can truly compare with liberation itself In some cases there are stories or particular situations that can provide figurative explanations but in other cases no story or situation will work in that way Therefore understand that the accomplishment of liberation itself brings immeasurable merit as such As one approaches nirvaQa nirvaQa and the Tathagata also have immeasurable merit as such B ecause the accomplishment of immeasurable merit such as this is complete I therefore call it the great nirvaQa The bodhisattva Kasyapa then addressed the Buddha saying WorldHonored One now for the first time I understand that wherever the Tathagata is is unending And if it is unending we should understand that the lifetime of the Buddha must also be without end The Buddha said Excellent excellent Good man you are now thoroughly capable of upholding and maintaining the truedharma If there are good men or women who wish to sever the defilements and fetters that bind them then in this same way they must endeavor to uphold and maintain the truedharma VI Chapter Four The Nature of the Tathagata  Part  Good man within this Subtle Sutra othe Great Nirvana there are four kinds of people who capably protect the truedhanna promote the truedhanna and keep the truedhanna in their thoughts They bring much in the way of blessings and mercy to the world for they are supports for the world tranquil bliss for humans and gods alike Who are the four People who are above worldly affairs yet whose natures are still plagued by the defilements they make up the first group The srotiipannas and sakrdiigiimins are the second The aniigiimins are the third group And the arhats make up the fourth When these four groups of people are present they bring much in the way of blessings and mercy to the world for they are supports for the world conveying comfort and joy to gods and humans alike Who are those in the first group whose natures are still plagued by the defilements This refers to individuals who successfully uphold the precepts comport themselves properly promote the truedhanna comprehend the meaning of the words they hear from the Buddha and then turn around to share them with others declaring It is said that he who is of small desire is on the path he who is of great desire is not on the path In similar manner they explain in detail the eight observances a great person They are called ordinary persons for they are not at the of the eighth person Those who are at this a eighth I do not regard as ordinary persons but instead refer to them as bodhisattvas However I do not call them buddhas People of the second type known as a srotiipannas or salqdiigiimins are those who if they obtain the true teaching will accept and retain that truedharma in their memory Upon hearing the dharma from the Buddha they will take what they hear and write it down make copies of it accept it memorize it recite it and then tum around and share it with others But if after hearing the dharma someone did not write down accept memorize or explain those teachings to others and i f he claimed that accumulating slaves and other impure things are allowed by the Buddha his actions would be inappropriate Such people may be regarded as belonging to the second group of believers but they would not have reached the second or the third stage I do call them bodhisattvas however and they will have received a prophecy of their future buddhahood Arguing for a self is unreasonable  affirming nonself is reasonable for them Preaching attachment to worldly dharmas is unreasonable but if they affirm that the Mahayana will continue without end that is reasonable for them whenever someone receives a new body there are eighty thousand worms is unreasonable But  having freed themselves from sensual desire once and for all they do not spill any semen even while dreaming that is reasonable for them To say that when confronting their last days aniigiimins become afraid would be inappropriate Why are they called aniigiimins It is because they do not return as I have explained earlier and because whatever transgressions they may have committed no longer pollute them Upon receiving a prophecy of their future buddhahood it will not be long before they attain anuttarii samyaksafJbodhi These then are called the third type of person People of the fourth type are known as arhats An arhat cuts away the defilements within himself puts down his heavy burden attains his personal goal does what is to be done resides at the tenth stage attains autonomous wisdom and manifests himself in different forms depending on what someone asks for Thus adorned  whenever they want to complete the Buddha s Way that is what they will do Capable of accomplishing such immeasurable merit they are thus called arhats When these four individuals of whom I speak appear they succeed in bringing much in the way of blessings and mercy to the world for they are supports for the world serene bliss for humans and gods alike They are the most respected the most excellent among gods and humans and are thus something like tathagatas themselves I call them the best among people for they are the foundations of refuge Kasyapa then addressed the Buddha saying b WorldHonored One Presently I do not rely on these four types of peopie Because in the  Ghoilasutra  the Buddha said to Ghoila If a deity like Mara or Brahma wants to destroy something he transforms himself into an image of a buddha replete with the thirtytwo major physical marks and eighty minor marks emitting light from each pore His face will be perfectly round and luminous like the moon with a circle of hair between his eyebrows as white as snow He will face you in this guise but when you examine him you will see most assuredly that what you are seeing is a false reality WorldHonored One If Mara is capable of transforming himself by taking on the body of a buddha why would he not be capable of becoming an arhat or indeed taking on the identities of all four types of individuals the Buddhist path sitting or lying down in the sky from his left side pouring water from his right side emitting fire from his body emitting smoke and flames like a fiery mass This is why I do not trust such people when I am with them Regardless of what they say I cannot accept them respect them or regard them as a place of refuge The Buddha said Good man from what you have explained to me I agree that if you have doubts about someone then you should not accept that person How much more so for these supporters of my dharma who may be imposters  This is why you must learn to carefully discriminate in your understanding of things between who or what is good and not good what should be done and what should not be done Once you have done this j oy will come after your long night Good man it is like a thieving dog that stealthily enters a house at night A family servant when he realizes what is going on will then run after the dog yelling Hey you get out of here  If you don t leave I  ll take your life   When he hears this the dog will immediately run off and not come back You should follow this example and overcome Paplyas in the same way You should not take that shape that you now have For if you become someone else then I will take those five hanging from you and tie you down with them When he hears this Mara will depart and just like that furtive dog he will not come back Kasyapa then addressed the Buddha saying WorldHonored One The Buddha has expounded to the distinguished householder Ghoila that if he can overcome Mara in this way he will have drawn near to mahiiparnirviirza So why must you say that these four types of people are to be regarded as reliable places of refuge when what they say cannot necessarily be trusted The Buddha said to Kasyapa Good man what I have said is j ust that To think otherwise would be wrong Good man I have explained subduing Mara to sravakas who have physical vision with which to see things But this is not an explanation for people who study the Mahayana People who are sravakas even when they have divine vision because of their predilections I generally refer to them as those with physical vision The students of the Mahayana although they have physical vision I generally refer to them as those with buddha vision Why is this Because the Mahayana sutras are what I call the buddha vehicle and this buddha vehicle is the best of the best Good man just as there are those who are powerful and courageous there are also those who are weak and who betake themselves to the strong on whom they depend The strong ones commonly teach the weak saying You should hold the bow and take the arrow like this You must learn how to use the halberd the long hook or a rope like that They also will say c Although facing battle is like walking on swords you must not let fear take hold of you When you come upon men or gods  regard them as insignificant and weak You must generate thoughts of strength to make yourself powerful There are also people who are not naturally bold but pretend to be so by grabbing a bow a sword or some kind of weapon  Having thus equipped themselves they march up to the troops and shout in a loud voice Do not fear those people  If they look at you and see you have no fear of them you can be assured that before long they will break ranks and run like thieving dogs Good man the Tathagata speaks to the sravakas in the same way Do not fear Mara Papyas  If Mara Papyas transforms himself into the body of a buddha and comes to where you are you must resolve with firmness of mind to defeat that demon At that point Mara will then lose heart no longer enjoying  and go away Good man just as a person of strength does not follow the ways of others so it is with the student of the Mahayana who upon hearing the discourses in various abstruse texts enjoys them and does not recoil in fear Why is this so Because people who study the Mahayana in this way have in the past made offerings to showed respect for and paid obeisance to innumerable trillions of buddhas So even if there were innumerable hundreds of billions of Mliraled hordes desperate to seize them by intimidation or flattery would ultimately face those situations without fear Good man it is like someone who has obtained the antidote agada and has no sense of fear toward poisonous snakes and the like This is because the power of that medicine is capable of removing all forms of poison This Mahayana sutra also in that way for just like the power of that medicine with it one does not fear the poisons of any and all maras vanquishing them and preventing them from coming forth again Good man consider the example of a serpent whose nature is particularly cruel When it wants to harm someone the snake merely glares at them with its eyes or blows on them with its breath which is enough to bring fear to any lion tiger wolf or dog If any of these dangerous animals were to hear voice see its shape or touch its body none of them would not lose their life But there are also spells used for good causes and by means of the power of these spells one can compell such dangerous to all become compliant and yielding as if tamed including poisonous snakes garuqa birds violent elephants lions tigers and wolves When they perceive these spells used for good causes animals such as these are immediately subdued S ravakas and pratyekabuddhas are also like this When they see Mara Paplyas they are all stricken with fear yet Mara Paplyas feels no fear at all and thus continues with his demonic activities Those who study the Mahayana in like manner see how the sravakas fear the activities of Mara and have not produced aspirational faith in the Mahayana These students of the Mahayana first use the expedient means at their disposal to overcome the maras compelling them to become compliant and appropriately tamed as a result of which they can then expound to them in detail various aspects of this wondrous dharma Upon seeing a the taming of the maras the sravakas and pratyekabuddhas lose their fear and at that point they will look upon the unsurpassed truedharma that is the Mahayana with aspirational faith and say in effect From now on we should no longer create obstructions to this truedharma In addition good man while sravakas and pratyekabuddhas may be frightened of the defilements those who study the Mahayana have no fear at all Cultivating the Mahayana has that kind of power Because of this causal principle everything I said earlier about enabling sravakas and pratyekabuddhas to overcome maras does not pertain to the Mahayana This Subtle Sutra othe Great Nirvana cannot disappear it is so extraordinary so special If someone hears it and after hearing it accepts its message that person will come to believe that the Tathagata is an eternally abiding dharma Someone like this is an extraordinary marvel like the udumbara flower And after my nirvaQa if there are people who will have the opportunity to hear subtle scriptures of the Mahayana like this one and respond with faith and reverence know that for one hundred thousand kalpas into the future they will not fall into any unfortunate rebirths At that time the Buddha then said to the bodhisattva Kasyapa Good man after my nirvliQa there will be hundreds of thousands indeed innumerable living beings that will discredit this Subtle Sutra o the Great Nirvana refusing to believe it The bodhisattva Kasyapa responded to the Buddha by saying WorldHonored One after the Buddha s extinction how much time will pass before those living beings begin to discredit this sermon And WorldHonored One will there also be living beings that are invariably good at that time who will succeed in helping extricate those who have discredited the dharma  The Buddha then said to Kasyapa Good man within forty years after my parinirviia will circulate widely in Jambudvipa Only after that will it gradually disappear from the land depending on where you are the people of some regions will all say these taste best But there are also people who only eat barley or millet and say What we eat is the best of all foods   This is because those without much religious merit receive commensurate karmic compensation But if a person who is possessed of religious merit never hears of barley or millet they will continue to eat nonglutinous rice sugar cane crystallized honey ghee and so forth The Subtle Sutra of the Great Nirvana is j ust like this Those of dull karmic roots with little religious merit will be unwilling to hear this sutra Just like those of weak religious merit resent honey and other such foods followers of the two vehicles in like fashion may bear resentment toward this unsurpassed Mahiiparinirviifasutra But there will also be living beings who will be favorably disposed toward hearing this sutra After hearing it these individuals will feel elated and will not disparage it They are like those fortunate ones possessed of merit who eat glutinous rice Good man consider the story of a king who resided in the remote mountains in distressed circumstances Even though he had sugar cane b glutinous rice and crystallized honey on hand because such are hard to obtain precious and well sought after he hoarded them He dared not allow them to be eaten dreading what would happen if he ran out And so ate only barley and millet Now at the same time in a different country there was another king who upon hearing about this evinced a sympathetic smile and straightaway decided to load up carts with glutinous rice and sugar cane and send them to the first king as a gift When the shipment reached the first king he distributed it among the people and the entire nation then enjoyed the food together After the people had eaten everyone was elated and remarked It is all due to that other king that we have been able to enjoy this extraordinary mea In all likelihood there will be one person among these four types of believers who will notice that there are a great many other bodhisattvas who although they study Mahayana scriptures like this one perhaps copying them themselves or getting others to copy them in order to seek personal gain or fame or knowledge of the dharma or a spiritual grounding or a means to explore other sutras are nevertheless incapable of expounding the teachings in detail to others This one person will respond by taking this subtle sutra and sending it to other lands with other bodhisattvas enabling them to bring forth an unsurpassed aspiration to bodhi establishing themselves in bodhi And these bodhisattvas having obtained this sutra will then be able to expound it widely to others enabling countless others to accept the flavor of a Mahayana dharma like this Through the power of this one bodhisattva so many who had never heard this sutra will thus be able to hear it just like the people of that kingdom who were able to enj oy the rare foods through the power of that king Good man you should understand that wherever this Subtle Sutra of the Great Nirvana is disseminated that land will thereby be adamantine and its people adamantinelike as well Whenever people can actually hear a sutra like this one they will be nonretrogressing in their tum toward anuttarii samyaksaTflbodhi and whatever they wish for will be accomplished including that which I will fully expound this very day Bhius you should accept and retain well this  for if there are living beings who have been unable thus far to hear scriptures such as this understand that you must be especially compassionate toward them Because these people will be not be able to accept the profound significance of a Mahayana sutra like this The bodhisattva Kasyapa then addressed the Buddha as follows W orldHonored One for forty years after the extinction of the Tathagata this Mahayana scripturethe MahiiparnirviiQasutrawill spread throughout Jambudvlpa after which it will disappear from the land But after that has ended how long will it be before it appears again The Buddha said Good man even as my truedharma will remain for another eighty years it will be during the first forty years that this sutra will rain down as a great dharma rain over Jambudvlpa  c The bodhisattva Kasyapa then said to the Buddha When truedhanna has disappeared when true morality has been discredited when false dhannas have increased and when living beings are not in compliance with dharma who will be able to hear accept hold in reverence and read and recite a sutra such as this one Who will enable others to become well versed in it make offerings to it revere it copy it and explain it I beseech you Tathagata Take pity on us living beings and explain these things analytically and in some detail thereby empowering bodhisattvas so they might retain the teaching upon hearing it and upon retaining it straightaway attain nonretrogressive anuttarii samyaksalJlbodhi Then the Buddha praised KliSyapa saying Excellent excellent Good man you have asked well about this Good man those livings beings who make bodhicitta resolutions before an array of buddhas as numerous as the grains of sand in the HiralJyavatr River will thereupon be empowered in that corrupt world to uphold sutras like this one rather than discredit them Good man those who can make bodhicitta resolutions before worldhonored buddhas as numerous as the grains of sand in one Ganges River will thereupon be empowered in that later time when the world is corrupt to not repudiate this dhanna but instead cherish this scripture though they may not be able to analyze it and fully explain it to others Good man those livings beings who make bodhicitta resolutions before worldhonored buddhas as numerous as the grains of sand in two Ganges Rivers will thereupon be empowered in that later time when the world is corrupt to not repudiate this dhanna but instead appreciate it properly believe in it dedicate themselves to upholding and reciting it though they may be unable to fully explain it to others Those livings beings who make bodhicitta resolutions before worldhonored buddhas as numerous as the grains of sand in three Ganges Rivers will thereupon be empowered in that later time when the world is corrupt to not repudiate this dhanna but instead to uphold read recite and copy fascicles of this sutra despite the fact that in expounding it for others they will not have grasped its deepest meaning Those livings beings who make bodhicitta resolutions before worldhonored buddhas as numerous as the grains of sand in four Ganges Rivers will thereupon be empowered in that later time when the world is corrupt to not repudiate this dharma but instead to uphold read recite and copy fascicles of this sutra Despite the fact that in proclaiming it will not be complete they will give a detailed explanation of onesixteenth of the sutra s meaning to others Those livings beings who make bodhicitta resolutions before worldhonored buddhas as numerous as the grains of sand in five Ganges Rivers will thereupon be empowered in that later time when the world is corrupt to not repudiate this dharma but instead to uphold read recite and copy fascicles of this sutra They will give a detailed explanation of eightsixteenths of the sutra s meaning to others Those livings beings who make bodhicitta resolutions before worldhonored buddhas as numerous as the grains of sand in six Ganges Rivers will thereupon be empowered in that later time when the world is corrupt to not repudiate this dharma but instead to uphold read recite and copy fascicles of this sutra They will give a detailed explanation of twelvesixteenths of the sutra s meaning to others Those livings beings who make bodhicitta resolutions before worldhonored buddhas as numerous as the grains of sand in seven Ganges Rivers will thereupon be empowered in that later time when the world is corrupt to not repudiate this dharma but instead to uphold read recite and copy fascicles of this sutra They will give a detailed explanation of fourteensixteenths of the sutra s meaning to others Those livings beings who make bodhicitta resolutions before worldhonored buddhas as numerous as the grains of sand in eight Ganges Rivers will thereupon be empowered in that later time when the world is corrupt to not repudiate this dharma but instead to uphold read recite and copy fascicles of this sutra They will also work to enable others to copy the sutra for being able to hear it and accept it oneself one to endeavor to give others the opportunity to hear it recite it and disseminate its benefits They will preserve and protect this sutra vigorously and out of sympathy for all living beings in the world honor it with offerings  In addition they will urge others to honor it with offerings respect reverence recitations and obeisance When someone has brought forth the aspiration to anuttarii samyaksaflbodhi understand that in the future this person shall surely uplift and promote a truedharma like this and maintain and preserve it For that reason do not be ignorant of the fact that there will be protectors of the truedharma in the future Because anyone who has committed himor herself by means of bodhicitta shall surely maintain and protect the unsurpassed truedharma in the future Good man on the other hand there also will be depraved bhikus who will not only not be saddened upon hearing of my nirvfuJa  On thi s day the Tathagata enters parin irviilJawhat a j oyous occasion  While the Tathagata has been in the world he has hindered our profitmaking activities But now that he has entered parinirviilJa who else could there be who would rob us like that again Without anyone to rob us of what we deserve we will then take back the personal gains of the Tathagata When the Tathagata was here the prohibitions became truly severe but now with him entering parinirviilJa these restrictions will all be abandoned The kiiiiya robe that we received as monks originally may have had some ritual significance but now let us discard them like banners left on logs People like this will repudiate and defame this Mahayana sutra Good man now you must remember this as long as there are accomplished living beings endowed with significant quantities of merit there will also be those who believe in the Mahayana scriptures And having faith in those scriptures they will endeavor to preserve them Regarding other living beings that have a willingness for the dharma if you can fully explain this sutra to them then upon hearing it the bad kanna they have created over asaflkhyeya kalpas will all be eliminated But for those who refuse to believe in this sutra there will be a torrent of countless pains in this life and derision of a great many people Moreover after they die people will look upon them with disgust and their countenances will appear ugly and rough They will be reborn into poverty always in want Even though their lives may improve things will remain rough and sordid for them as they will be reborn time and time again into families that are poor and of low social standing and into environments where the truedhanna is repudiated and false views abound When they are about to die they may find themselves oppressed by chaotic situations such as warfare violent and murderous kings or conflicts between families that stubbornly hold enmity toward each other Despite the presence of spiritual guides to help them in their hour of need they will not encounter them They will seek the means to provide for their own needs yet not succeed whatever small material gains they make will never be enough to keep them from painful privations of hunger and thirst Even if they were to hear a wellcrafted explanation of this sutra they would not accept it despite the principled nature of its argument This kind of person will not make it to a good rebirth just as a bird with a broken wing simply cannot fly Moreover in their future rebirths these people will not succeed in obtaining the good realms of humans or deities either On the other hand when people are able to believe in Mahayana sutras like this one even if they were born into abject conditions by the virtue inherent in the sutra they will suddenly display grace dignity and power that will only increase daily They will become people whom humans and deities yearn to see they will be respected and loved those in whom others indulge their emotions Kings high officials and their own relatives will listen to them and esteem what they have to say If among my sravaka disciples there is anyone who wants to practice that which is most rare that person should widely promulgate Mahayana sutras like this one to the world  Good man  It is like fog or frostno matter how intense they may seem each lasts only until the sun rises After the sun has risen they will disappear without a trace Good man the bad karma possessed by living beings is also like this Of the great powers that reside in thi s world there is nothing can surpass what one gains from seeing the sun of the Mahaparinirvala  Once that sun has risen it can eliminate every shred of bad karma In addition good man consider the analogy of a man who leaves his family to join the sangha and shaves his head Although he dons the kiiaya robe he has not yet pledged to maintain the ten precepts of a sramalera novice Then a wealthy person appears who invites the monastic community  This person who has not taken the precepts nevertheless joins the group that accepts the invitation Although he is not ordained he will still be included among those counted as monks Good man if there are living beings who in their resolutions for awakening begin to study this Mahayana Mahaparinirvalasiitra such that they copy it read it recite it and so forth then although they may not be accomplished to the point of reaching the ten stages  they will still be included among those counted as residing there Or among the living beings who hear this sutraeven one verse of itthere may those who are disciples of the Buddha and those who are not or those who are motivated by greed or fear or those who are merely ambitious But if upon hearing the sutra they do not malign it you should understand that such people thereby will have already moved closer to anuttara samyaksaTflbodhi Good man these are the reasons why I say that the four kinds of people are supports for the world Good man if it were c laimed that these four kinds of people had declared the Buddha  s elocution not to be the Buddha  s elocution that would be absurd Therefore I say that these four kinds of people are indeed supports for the world Good man you should make offerings to these four groups of people WorldHonored One how can I know who these people are so that I may honor them with offerings The Buddha then instructed Kasyapa When you find someone who takes responsibility for preserving the truedharma that is the type of person from whom you should solicit instruction and to whom you should give alms even to the point of sacrificing your life Thus in regard to this Mahayana sutra I would say One who understands the dharma Whether old or young Should be honored with offerings Respected and revered One who understands the dharma Whether old or young Should be honored with offerings Respected and revered Just like the gods Bow in reverence to serve Indra The bodh isattva Kasyapa then addressed the Buddha saying WorldHonored One just as you have said it is indeed proper to honor teachers and elders in this way However I have some doubt in this area that I would beg of you to address Let us say that there is an elderly person someone who has properly maintained the precepts who approaches someone in the younger quarter to inquire about something he had not known If he were to pay respect to a younger person on this occasion would that mean he would no longer be called someone of proper comportment What if a young person someone who properly maintains the precepts approaches an elder from among the nonprecept keepers to inquire about something he had not known In this case should that younger person make obeisance to that elder or not   as one who has gone forth a monastic should not bow to a layperson and as things stand now in the Buddha s dharma it is also the case that those who are younger in years must always show respect to those who are older and more experienced the principle being that since elder monks received the precepts before the monks junior to them and have thus achieved some dignity a younger person should honor and respect them But as the Buddha has said anyone who violates the precepts is not to be accepted within the Buddha s dharma for they are like a fertile field that has become overgrown with harsh barnyard grass In the verses stated above the Buddha said One who understands the dharma whether old or young should be honored with offerings  like the gods serve Indra But what do these verses mean The Buddha would never speak deceptively would he And yet the Buddha has said Even a bhiu who keeps the precepts has also violated them Why would the Tathagata make such a statement And in another sutra the WorldHonored One has spoken of adjudicating precept violations  The meanings o f all these statements are not clear t o me The Buddha the spoke to Kasyapa Good man I expounded those verses for bodhisattvas and other students of the Mahayana who will come in the future They were not preached for my sravaka disciples  Good man as I explained earlier after the truedharma disappears it will be a time when people discredit the true precepts a time of increases in precept violations when immorality surges a time when holy people all hide themselves and refuse to come out in public a time when it is acceptable to hold slaves and other impure things From among these four types of people there will emerge one individual who will shave off his hair and beard to go forth into homelessness and pursue the religious path Surveying the bhius he will see that each of them is keeping a female or male slave or something impure that they are completely ignorant of what is pure and what is impure and have no idea whatsoever about what is and is not in compliance with the monastic precepts This person will want to discipline the bhilqus who behave like this but though he may soften his light he will not assimilate to their dust Carefully but skillfully he understands the distinction between his sphere of activity and a buddha s sphere of activity Although he sees that people are committing parajika offenses he remains silent and does not raise the issue Because I have come into the world in order to rescue and preserve the truedharma not to quibble over any particular offense  That is why he holds his tongue and does not reproach anyone Good man In the case of someone like this who seeks to protect the dharma even if he commits a violation of the precepts I would not call him a transgressor of the precepts Good man it is like the story of a king who suddenly became ill and died There was a crown prince but he was still young and not ready to succeed to the throne In that nation there was an outcast a cwujala   who was blessed with property and wealth in abundance immeasurably so and had many kin On his own initiative he used his power to uncover the nation s weaknesses and usurp the throne Soon after solidifying his rule townsfolk householders brahmans and others began leaving fleeing to other lands no matter how distant And even those who remained in the kingdom did not want to see this king with their own eyes But there were also merchants brahmans and others who did not leave their homeland like trees that stand where they are born living and dying in the same place This calJjala king upon learning that many of his nations people were leaving searched for them to bring them back and dispatched calJqala guards to block the roads  After seven days he pounded the drums and announced to the brahmans To anyone of you who will serve as the ritual master for my inauguration ceremony  I will give rank and compensation worth half the kingdom But when the brahmans heard his words none accepted to his proposal Each of them said Where will he find a brahman who would do such a thing The calJqala king then spoke up again saying If there is not one brahman among you who will serve as ritual master for me then I demand that brahmans and calJqalas be forced to live eat and sleep together and engage in the same work On the other hand if one of you comes forth to consecrate me as king my offer   of half the kingdom  s territory is genuine  At that time there was one brahman boy at the capping age of twenty   His practice was pure he wore his hair long and he was quite adept at ritual chants I can do everything that your lordship has commanded At that moment the great king felt great j oy in his heart and accepted this boy to be the ritual master of his coronation ceremony But when the other brahmans heard of thi s they all became angry and reproached the youth saying You are a brahman how can you serve as the ritual master for a cQfujiiia The king however wasted no time in dividing the nation and giving half to the young man Thereafter the two of them ruled the country together for quite some time Then one day the youth said to the king I have abandoned the dharma of my family in becoming the kings ritualist But having taught the great king the secret spells  still to this day great king I am not regarded fondly by you Then the king responded Now what have I done that not regard you fondly b The boy answered In the past the king spoke of sharing the elixir of immortality in your possession yet we have never drunk it together The king said Excellent excellent Master I truly did not understand  Master if you have been waiting for this then please feel free to take it with you Having heard what the king said the youth then took and went home He implored the officials to join him in drinking it and after they had done so they went to the king together to say How glad we are that the great master has this sweet elixir of immortality When the king heard this he said to his ritual master Why great master do you only take the sweet elixir with the officials and not divide it further Then the youth took what was left of the elixir mixed it with a poisonous medicine brought this to the king and got him to drink it It was some time after swallowing it before the medicine began to take effect When it did the king writhed in agony fell to the floor and lost consciousness as if dead What the young brahman did then was to bring out the crown prince and restore him as king Having accomplished this he made the following statement The lions throne is something that our dharma should not allow a carjiila to ascend Since ancient times we have never seen nor heard of someone of the carjiila caste becoming a king A cariila ruling the nation and governing the people is simply out of the question You sire must now return to succeed the previous king to rule the nation our truedharma When the young brahman had finished arranging things he gave the cariila an antidote to the poison effectively bringing him out of his coma After the cariila had fully recovered his senses he was thrown out of the palace and forced to leave the country Now although at that time the young brahman did certain things to cooperate with the cariila king  nevertheless he did not forfeit his brahmanic code When the other householders brahmans and so forth heard the full extent of what he had done they were awed at his as something they had never seen before and praised him saying Excellent excellent Benevolent one well have you succeeded in driving out the cariila king  Good man after m y parinirviia the bodhisattvas who protect the truedharma will act like that Using the power of expedient means they will work together with monastics who have violated the precepts assumed false names and accepted and kept unclean things If at that time bodhisattvas were to come across an individual who despite violating many precepts was able to discipline the rulebreaking harmful bhius  they would immediately go to that person in order to pay respect and make obeisance to him to donate a monk s four necessities to him and to bring books of scripture and living utensils as further donations In order to do what he does this person may have to hold on to something from among the eight kinds of impure things Why is this In order to punish those harmful monks that individual will have to behave like the young brahman who in order to get rid of the cGfujiila But even though the bodhisattvas at that time will yet again respect and make obeisance to that person despite the fact that he accepts and keeps one of the eight impure things there will be no karmic transgression in their actions  And why is this Because these bodhisattvas want to purge the harmful bhikus from their community to allow the pure monastics to live in peace and spread the wellbalanced Mahayana scriptures for the benefit of all gods and humans Good man in this sutra I put this reasoning into two verses to compel all bodhisattvas to praise protectors of the dharma just as the c householders brahmans and others acclaimed the youthful brahman when they called out Excellent excellent  This is how a bodhisattva concerned with protecting the dharma should act If you notice that an individual who protects the dharma is engaged in the same activities together with someone known to have broken the precepts and you declare the dharma protector to therefore also be guilty you must know that that person will get into trouble  As a matter of fact the protector of the dharma will not have committed any offense  Good man when there are bhikus who violate the monastic prohibitions but because they are steeped in arrogance conceal the fact and do not regret their actions understand that such people are indeed to be called true violators of the precepts If on the other hand a bodhisattvamahasattva in the course of protecting the dharma in this case although a precept has been violated such a person is not to be called a violator of the precepts Because does not stem from arrogance he will make plain what he has done and will regret it Good man therefore I want to reiterate the verse I gave earlier in the sutra One who understands the dhanna Whether old or young Should be honored with offerings Respected and revered Just like the brahmans Serve fire Bowing in reverence to Indra In the second heaven Again this reasoning is not intended for those who study the sravaka  it is only for the bodhisattvas that I expound this verse The bodhisattva Kasyapa then addressed the Buddha saying WorldHonored One there are bodhisattvamahasattvas who have become extremely lax in their regard for the precepts In their case are the precepts still complete as they were when these bodhisattvas originaly received them or not The Buddha said Good man you should not speak in that way Because the precepts as they were originaly received remain as they originaly were there is nothing lost When an offense is committed the person should immediately confess for having confessed that person wil be in a state of purity Good man it is like an old dyke that is punctured and in the opening a hole fonns from which water then drips out Why does this occur Because there is no one to repair  When there is someone to repair it the water will no longer leak out Bodhisattvas are also be like this in that though they may violate the precepts at the same time they also collectively observe the pOadha karmanand praviirafa ceremonies in which they renew their commitment to the precepts and engage in confession together with their fellow monks What is the point here If there are no people who are pure in keeping the precepts then disintegration slovenliness and indolence in that sangha will increase on a daily basis But if there are people who do keep the precepts in a pure manner then the precepts of those in trouble can soon become complete again ultimately with no loss from their original state Good man If someone is apathetic about religious vehicle I would call that person apathetic But if someone is lax toward the precepts I would not call such a person apathetic As long as the attitudes of bodhisattvamahasattv as toward the Mahayana are neither lazy nor arrogant I regard them as grounded in their originally received precepts for in order to protect the truedharma they bathe themselves in the waters of the Mahayana The bodhisattva Kasyapa then addressed the Buddha saying There are four types of people in the sangha communities but just like it is difficult to know when mango fruit is ripe how can we know when  I a a precept is kept and when it is broken The Buddha spoke  Good man viewed according to what I have expounded here in the tle Sutra of the Great Nirvana do I say you can understand this according to what is in this nirviilasutra Why MahiipariIt is analogous to a farmer who pulls weeds out of his field as he plants rice and other grains If you look at his field with the naked eye you would say it is purely  But the reality is that the field is mixed as rice and grass are both there and they distinguished from each other Thus if the eight things that potentially corrupt a sangha are removed from it then when viewed with the naked eye the community will be known as pure And yet when there are no disruptions it is difficult to distinguish with the naked eye the precept holder from the precept violator It is only when an impropriety is abundantly obvious that this becomes easily understood Then as easily as weeds are distinguished  the problem within a sangha becomes clear Those who can distance themselves from the poisonous snakes that are these eight impure things are those whom I call fields of merit of the pure sacred community they should be honored with offerings from humans and gods But the karmic rewards of such purity cannot be distinguished with the naked eye Good man this is like story of the forest of kiilaka trees within which there was also one tinduka tree The fruit of the kiilaka and tinduka fruit are so similar as to be indistinguishable and when they ripened both were picked by the same woman Without knowing herself how to discriminate one from the other that woman brought all the fruit she had gathered to market and peddled it together But if they bought a kiilaka fruit swallowing it could mean losing their lives  A wise person heard about the problem and came forward to speak with the woman asking Sister from where did you bring this fruit The woman then pointed in the direction of the forest The people who had gathered around immediately cried out Over there That is full of who knows how many kiilaka trees but only one tinduka tree   Upon realizing what she had done they laughed at her and the fruit was thrown out Good man Those in the sangha communities who engage in the eight impure things are also like this Within the community there may be many who take advantage of these eight things we have talked about but there may also be just one person who is pure in keeping the precepts who does not accept any of the impure things included in this list of eight Yet he knows there are people who do condone improper behavior In the activities they share in common he is inseparable from these people standing like the one tinduka tree in the forest When a layman sees them together the layman sees monks who frequently behave improperly and so he neither respects nor offers donations to them But if that layman did want to make a donation he should first speak to them asking Venerable sirs on the question of the eight things do you accept and keep them or not Does the Buddha allow this or not If someone claimed that the Buddha condones such things would you be able to participate in the posadha karman and praviiraa ceremonies with that person After the layman queries them in this way if everyone in a community answers  Regarding these eight things you speak of the Tathagata in his compassionate mercy has allowed us to keep all of them The layman should then say  I b At Jetavana there were many monks Some said that the Buddha allowed gold and silver to be kept but others said he did not allow this Those who said he allowed this and those who said he did not were unable to live together recite the priitimoksa together or do the praviiraa confession ritual together This extended to them not even being able to drink water from the same river and they did not share what they received in offerings So how can you say that the Buddha permitted these things The Buddha the god among gods may accept such things himself but none of you monks should keep them If one of you accepts these things he should not participate with the other monks in reciting the precepts making confessions and other monastic rituals If he does participate with the other monks in these things then when his life ends he will fall into hell Those individuals are like people who lose their lives right after eating the kiiaka fruit In addition the Buddha said Good man consider the analogy of a man who sold medicines in a city one of which was a wonderful sweet medicine that came from the Himalayas But he also had many other assorted medicines that were similar in taste and appearance Many ended up coming to where this mans business was and asking him Do you have the Himalayan medicine Without hesitation the medicine seller would answer Yes I do but he was deceiving them for he would take his other medicines and tell those who were seeking it This is the sweet excellent medicine from the Himalayas The people coming to buy the medicine would look at what he showed them with their untrained eyes and not being able to tell the difference make their purchases and leave each one thinking to himself I have just purchased that sweet medicine from the Himalayas With untrained eyes lay believers will not be able to distinguish among them just as those customers could not discriminate the sweet Himalayan variety among all the medicines  Who is observing the precepts who is violating the precepts who is a true monk who is a false monkonly one with divine vision can discriminate these things Kasyapa on the other hand if an upiisaka knows a bhihJu to be someone who violates the precepts then he should not supply that monk with the means of subsistence or make offerings or obeisance to him If an upiisaka knows a bhihJu is keeping one of the eight things forbidden to him he should not also supply that monk with the means of subsistence or make offerings or obeisance to this person either When someone within a sangha violates the precepts just because that person may be wearing the kiiiiya monastic robe is no reason for anyone to feel they must show respect or make obeisance to that person The bodhisattva Kasyapa then spoke up again WorldHonored One this is excellent excellent  What the Tathagata has expounded is true and meaningful and I graciously accept it like pure gold a rarity even among jewels As the Buddha has explained bhihJus should rely on the dharma of the four forms of spiritual support What are those four reliances a Rely on the teaching rather than the person  Rely on the meaning rather than the language used to express it  Rely on wisdom rather than discursive knowledge  Rely on the sutra that is definitive rather than the sutra whose meaning is indeterminate   l c Taking the dharma of these four as one  s refuge is what should be acknowledged not the four types of people The Buddha said As the dharma of all buddhas it is the dharmatii the nature of reality And as the dharmatii it is what the Tathagata is This is why the Tathagata is a permanently abiding presence without change If someone were to say that the Tathagata is impermanent that person would not understand he has not seen the nature of reality If someone does not know or see the nature of reality they should not be regarded as someone upon whom to rely As I said earlier the four types of people active in the world who support this dharma must realize this to become a refuge for others Why is this so Because those people will have fully grasped the oracular and profound treasury that is the tathiigatagarbha and therefore would understand that the Tathagata is a constant presence and not subject to change If someone were to say the Tathagata is impermanent and subject to change there would be no foundation for such a statement The four types of people can thus be called tathagatas Because these people will be able to grasp the Tathagatas recondite language and even expound upon it If someone did understand this deeply hidden tathagata treasury and did understand that the Tathagata abides permanently and is unchangeable but nevertheless preached that the Tathagata is impermanent in order to gain favor from others there would be no foundation for what he would be doing How could such a person become a spiritual support for others How much more so can people not rely on anyone among these four groups of people following the dharma  The dharma to take refuge in is the reality of dharmatii the person not to take refuge in is a sravaka disciple The reality of dharmatii is a tathagata a sravaka disciple is a created phenomenon A tathagata is permanently abiding a created phenomenon is impermanent Good man If someone violates the precepts or for personal gain preaches that the Tathagata is impermanent and changeable such a person should not be relied upon as a source of refuge Good man instead you should rely on what I call the definitive meanings In the phrase Rely on the meaning rather than the language used to express it by the word meaning I was referring what should be clearly understood The meaning of what is clearly understood refers to something that is not reduced By not reduced I am referring to what is complete A meaning that is complete could be the label for the Tathagata is a constantly abiding presence and unchanging The meaning of the Tathagata is a constantly abiding presence and unchanging is none other than the dharma is permanent I am speaking about the literary embellishments used in essays and treatises And if that is not bad enough some will even declare The Buddha allows bhius to keep slaves and other impure things Gold silver rare jewels stores of rice and other grains cows sheep elephants and horses these they can sell for profit As there is famine in the world takes pity on his children and therefore allows the bhius to keep reserves in storage and to produce their own food so they can eat without receiving food from others  If a sravaka were unable to understand the Tathagata s virtues the kind of know edge you should not regard as a spiritual support When someone does understand that the Tathagata is none other than the dharma body itself that kind of true wisdom in someone is what indeed should serve as spiritual support If one looks upon the body of expediency held by the Tathagata and remarks The aggregates  elements  and sense bases that are incorporated are nourished by eating then this too signals someone you should not rely upon as a spiritual support This is why discursive knowledge cannot serve as a spiritual support for others Anyone who preaches in this way and any text should not serve as spiritual supports In the phrase Rely on the sutra that is definitive rather than on the sutra whose meaning is indeterminate the rubric of indeterminate refers to those sutras used in the sravaka vehicle or sriivakayiina  When they hear about the Tathagatas profound and hidden treasure trove they feel doubt and fear They do not understand that this treasure produces the great ocean of wisdom They are like infants unable to distinguish among the different things they perceive This I call indeterminate Definitive is what I call the true wisdom of bodhisattvas A great unimpeded wisdom flows from a bodhisattva s thoughts like a great sage to whom nothing is unknown This is what is meant by definitive In addition the sriivakayiina itself l call indeterminate and the unsurpassed Mahayana I call definitive If it is said the Tathagata is impermanent and mutable I would call that indeterminate If it is said that the Tathagata abides permanently and is immutable I would call this definitive What is preached by sravakas should be acknowledged as indeterminate but that what is preached by bodhisattvas should be acknowledged as definitive If it is said that the Tathagata is sustained by what he eats that is a nondefinitive  If it is said that he abides permanently and is immutable that I would call definitive If it is said that the Tathagata entering into nirvaQa is like firewood perishing in a flame that notion of extinction is indeterminate If it is said that the Tathagata has entered into dharmatii that I would call definitive The dharma of the sriivakayiina thus should not be relied on as a spiritual support Because in wanting to save living beings the Tathagata used the power of expedient means to expound the sriivakayiina but did so in the way that the wealthy merchant taught letters rather than whole words to his son Good man the sriivakayiina itself is like a newly plowed field that has yet to yield the fruit of a harvest Thus I regard it as indeterminate and this is why one should not rely on the teachings in the sriivakayiina as a spiritual support It is the dharma of the Mahayana that should be relied on as a spiritual support Because in wishing to save living beings the Tathagata used the power of expedient means to expound the Mahayana But because this was done so that it would be taken as a spiritual support I call it definitive It is this notion of the four reliances that you should recognize Next in the phrase Rely on the meaning the term meaning here I would characterize as straightforward Straightforward I would characterize as illuminated Illuminated I would characterize as unreduced Unreduced is how I would characterize the Tathagata Moreover illuminated is how I would characterize wisdom   Straightforward is how I would characterize permanently abiding and the permanence of the Tathagata is what I was referring to in the phrase Rely on the teaching This teaching I thus refer to as permanent and also as boundless It cannot be conceived of it cannot be held on to it cannot be restrained and yet it can be seen If someone were to assert that it cannot be seen that person should not be relied upon This is why you should Rely on the teaching rather than the person If someone were to use subtle and persuasive language to proclaim that impermanent a statement like that should not be relied upon either Therefore Rely on the meaning in a teaching rather than the language used to express it In the phrase Rely on wisdom I am referring to the fact that the collective sangha itself is permanent uncreated and unchanging It is not a place for keeping the eight impure things   Knowledge is created or knowledge is received but there is no assemblage of monks that is the sangha Because the notion of assemblage or collectivity is known to have no real existence How can anyone say that something nonexistent is permanent This is why discursive knowledge of this sort cannot serve as a spiritual support In the phrase Rely on what is definitive the term definitive I would characterize as true understanding in the end you wi have neither false expressions of purity in your comportment nor arrogance or any conceited craving for selfaggrandizement This also refers to the Tathligata s skiful use of expedient means by which the nonarising of attachment is expounded within his dharma This I call definitive for if someone can dweU within this and other expressions of what is definitive know that that person wi have already obtained dwelling in the highest truth For this reason I say Rely on a sutra that is definitive In the phrase about not relying on whose meaning is indeterminate by the term indeterminate I am referring to the sutras that expound such things as Everything is burning everything is impermanent everything is suffering everything is empty everything is nonself These I call indeterminate Because doctrines such as these that cannot be fully clarified will only cause living beings to faU into the A vlci Hell What is the reason for this Because of their attachments living beings wi simply not attain definitive clarity regarding what these doctrines mean Saying everything is burning for example is in effect stating that the Tathligata preached that nirvala is also burning If everything is impermanent then nirvala would also be impermanent Suffering emptiness and nonselfthese would aU end up the same way This is why I call these sutras that are indeterminate and why I say they are not to be relied on as one  s refuge Good man someone may say From his mercy toward all living beings the Tathagata is weU aware of what is appropriate to an occasion The Tathagata has insight into his disciples and the necessities supplied to them by their donors making sure there is nothing they lack The Buddha thus would not allow such people to accept and keep male or female slaves gold silver or precious jewels or sell anything impure in the marketplace If there are disciples without lay donors or a supply of daily necessities in times of f amine when food and drink are difficult to obtain in the interest of promoting and supporting the truedharma I will permit those disciples to accept and keep slaves gold and silver vehicles houses and grains as well as to trade for what they need But although I allow them to accept such things they must be gifts handed over by donors of devout faith c In this case take the dharma of the four reliances as to what you should rely on Any vinaya abhidharma or sutra that does not disagree with those four  you should rely upon them as well But if on the other hand someone were to say Whether or not this is a special occasion whether or not it is a teaching that can be supported in all cases the Tathagata allows every bhiku to accept and keep these kinds of impure things this kind of statement should never be relied upon as a spiritual support And any vinaya abhidharma or sutra that contains the same notion as this explanation should also not be relied upon inclusive of all three categories of scripture I preach these four reliances for the living beings that see with their physical eyes it is not the final teaching for those who have eyes of wisdom This is why I have now expounded of the four reliances wherein dharma is none other than the reality of dharmatii meaning is none other than the fact that the Tathagata is permanent and unchanging wisdom is being fully cognizant of the fact that all living beings possess buddhanature and definitive is comprehending all the Mahayana sutras VII Chapter Four The Nature of the Tathagata  Part  At that time Kasyapa addressed the Buddha saying WorldHonored One The four types of people that the Buddha has been discussing is it right to regard them as supports for us  The Buddha said Just so j ust so Good man as I explained you should indeed rely on them as supports Because there are four maras Why are there four reflects those who effectively accept and embrace another set of sutras and vinayas that are taught by maras The bodhisattva Kasyapa then asked the Buddha WorldHonored One  This fourfold mara issue that the Buddha has explainedif there are teachings expounded by a mara and teachings expounded by a buddha how am I to distinguish between them there are living beings who comply with the actions of maras as well as those who behave in accordance to what the Buddha has taught how can we understand who is who The Buddha then informed Kasyapa Over seven hundred years after my parinirvalJa this Mara Papfyas will gradually bring about a collapse of my truedharma Like a hunter who dons the dharma robe of a monk Mara Papfyas will take the form of a monk a nun an layman or a laywomen He may also transform himself into the body of someone at the stage of srotapanna he may transform himself into the body of an arhat or even take on the material body of a buddha King Mara is thus able to take his contaminated form and a turn it into an uncontaminated body in order to destroy the truedharma If this Mara Papfyas destroys the truedharma he will thereupon make this statement In the distant past the Bodhisattva descended to Kapilavastu from the Tuita Heaven to appear in the palace of King S uddhodhana Through the harmonious combination of the lustful passions of his mother and father he was born and raised by them to become what he is But if you say a person could be born into the world of humans who then becomes revered by great multitudes of humans and gods throughout the world such a thing cannot be true And he will also say In the distant past underwent many austerities making various donations to people such as giving away his head his eyes his body his brain his nation his wife or his children And it was by means of doing these things that he completed the path to buddhahood It was because of these that he was revered by humans and gods gandharvas asuras garnrjas kirrznaras and mahoragas If you come across sutra or vinaya texts that expound these things you should understand them all to be the work of Mara Good man you may also hear of sutras and vinayas that make statements like this The Tathagata Perfectly Awakened One has long since attained buddhahood He appeared in this realm as one who accomplished the buddha path in order to save living beings His birth through the sexual union of his mother and father accords with the ways of the world such was how he manifested himself You should understand that sutras and vinayas that speak in this way express what has been actually taught by the Tathagata A person who acts in accordance with what expounded by Mara is a follower of Mara A person who acts in accordance with the sutras and vinayas expounded by the Buddha is a bodhisattva Someone may assert Though it is said that the Tathagata at the time of his birth took seven steps in each of the ten directions you should not believe this This view reflects the teaching of Mara A person who acts in accordance with what Mara teaches is a follower of Mara A person who can act in accordance with what the Buddha teaches is a bodhisattva Someone may say After the bodhisattva was born his father the king had him carried to temples After gazing upon him the gods in these temples all descended to express their reverence Thi s is why he is called buddha But there may also be criticism of this statement Understand that such criticism is none other than that of Mara papryas Someone else may say When the Buddha went to these temples Mahesvara Mahabrahma S akra Devanam Indra and the other gods all placed their palms together and bowed down to his feet in respect Thus is it described in the sutras and vinayas expounded by the Buddha If someone acts in accordance with what Mara says that person will be a follower of Mara But it is a bodhisattva who effectively acts in accordance with what is taught by the Buddha b Now if there is a sutra or vinaya that states When the Bodhisattva was a prince he searched here and there for a wife motivated by lust When he remained deep inside the palace he was seeking pleasure and enjoyment by indulging himself in his five senses Did he not shave his head and leave home in order to pursue the path Sutras and vinayas with words like this contain the expositions of the Buddha If one acts in accordance with Maras sutras or vinayas he will be a follower of Mara Someone may say  When the Buddha was at the monastery donated by Prince Jeta in S ravasU he assented to the monks accepting and keeping female or male slaves oxen sheep elephants horses asses mules chickens boars cats dogs gold silver lapis lazuli pearls crystal agate carnelian coral amber white agate jade cauldrons made of bronze and copper bowls or basins as part of their daily necessities Cultivating fields to grow crops selling things in markets stocking grains and rice and various activities of this naturebecause of his great compassion they were all permitted by the Buddha in his sympathy for living beings But any sutra or vinaya with that kind of message is a discourse of Mara On that occasion the Tathagata spoke with King Prasenajit and this brahman also known as the Ram of Dignity    saying Bhikus should not accept or keep gold or silver lapis lazuli crystal pearls agate carnelian coral amber white agate jade slaves servants young girls young boys oxen or sheep elephants or horses asses or mules chickens or boars cats or dogs or any other animals cauldrons made of bronze copper bowls and basins any variety of colored carpet or floor covering or bedding materials or any other material necessities for the home They should not be involved in cultivating fields to grow crops selling things in markets preparing food with their own hands or polishing it or pounding it by themselves healing the body with spells various means of training hawks gazing up to contemplate the stars and their constellations engaging in the astronomy of moon cycles divining the gender  determining whether someone  s dream is auspicious or inauspicious judging the sixtyfour artistic skills people have in order to determine which are or are not masculine or feminine or engaging in the eighteen spells and various other devices that deceive people They should not be talking about the innumerable facts of mundane life powdered incense stick incense incense used for smearing on the skin incense used for perfuming the varieties of flower garlands the techniques of arranging hair deceit flattery or insatiable greed They should not approach kings princes ministers or women they should neither laugh in a loud voice nor insist on remaining silent or give way to frequent doubt about the teachings nor should they go on and on talking frivolously about how long how attractive or how good something is nor should they favor wearing beautiful clothes Those involved in any of these various impure things will praise themselves before a donor They will go out to places that are impure where there is drinking prostitution and gambling Anyone like  this I no longer pennit to reside among the bhius Just like weeds  they must all be eliminated  without exception You should understand that sutras and vinayas where you find rules that bar things such as these all reflect what has been uttered by the Tathagata When one acts in accordance with sutras and vinayas that have been uttered by a mara one will be a follower of Mara But one who acts in accordance with what has been said by a buddha is a bodhisattva If it is said that The bodhisattva entered shrines in order to make offerings to deities namely Brahma Mahesvara Skanda and Katyayana I  But his purpose for doing so was to subj ugate those deities and their followers To say otherwise is untenable Or if it is said that The Bodhisattva is unable to enter into discussions about the erroneous theories of heretics since he is unfamiliar with their observances literature or art When slaves are in conflict he is unable to restore hannony among them He is not held in high esteem by sovereigns or ministers whether male or female And he does not know how to blend medicines At the same time it is also said that in situations of others bearing resentment or affection toward him the mind of a tathagata is equanimous he is indifferent to being cut with a sword or to having his body smeared with fragrance as he has no sense of profitable gain or hannful loss toward either It is precisely because he dwells in the world that he is known as a tathagata You should understand any sutra or vinaya discourse that professes sentiments like these reflects what has been expounded by Mara By contrast you may hear someone say The Bodhisattva has shown himself entering the shrines of certain deities and going forth to cultivate the path of other dharmas He shows himself doing these things but although he is indeed there doing what he is seen to do he has no affectionate attachment to any of it Like a lotus flower he is unaffected by mud It is for the purpose of delivering living beings that he skillfully acts in these expedient ways complying with how the world works If you come across any sutra or vinaya with statements like this know that it reflects what the Tathagata said If someone accords with the words of a mara that person will be a follower of Mara If someone accords with the words of the Buddha that person will be a great bodhisattva You may also hear this said a When the Tathagata expounded the sutras and vinayas for us within the dharma regarding bad behavior there were offenses of various degrees of gravity as well as the sthuiityaya transgressionsl all of which are of a serious nature Yet within our vinaya we ultimately decided not to take things in that way The vinaya you have was preached by Mara Our sutras and vinayas are admonitions laid down by the Buddha The Buddha first expounded the ninefold of the dharma seal and these nine seals authorize our sutras and vinayas   In the beginning one did not hear one sentence even one word of any wellbalanced sutras preached by the Tathagata In all the innumerable sutras and vinayas where are these wellbalanced sutras expounded Thus within our canon one never hears of a tenfold group of scriptures The existence of thi s kind of thing should be understood as undoubtedly the work of Devadatta Devadatta is an evil man who created the wellbalanced sutras in his effort to destroy the good dharma We do not believe in sutras of that type Because this way of thinking shatters the sense of propriety inherent in the buddhadharma itself It is a way of speaking in which people will say That may be so in your sutras but it is not in our sutras The contents of our sutras and vinayas are the words of the Tathagata but yours must originate elsewhere  When after my nirvala a corrupted world will contain improper sutras and vinayas he was referring to the wellbalanced Mahayana sutras In the future the world will have corrupt bhius like this So I declare moreover that the wellbalanced sutras surpass the ninefold canon of scriptures You should recognize anyone who is able to grasp their meaning as a person who correctly grasps sutras and vinayas as a person who distances himself from all impurities and as a person as glorious and pure as the full moon Now you may also encounter someone who claims this Although within each sutra and vinaya the Tathagata expounded a plethora of meanings as numerous as grains of sand in the Ganges River it goes without saying that whatever is not in our vinaya is not  For if it were  then why would the Tathagata have not have explained it in the context of our vinaya For this reason I am not in a position to accept  You should recognize this person as one who has thus committed an offense That person may also say I will embrace sutras and vinayas like this Because in doing so I create a wholesome dharma that becomes the cause by which I will know the contentment of reducing desires I will cut off my defilements and I will realize wisdom and nirvaIa One who talks like this is not a disciple of mine But if someone were to say The Tathagata expounded the wellbalanced sutras in order to bring deliverance to living beings this person you should recognize as my true disciple  If someone does not accept the wellbalanced sutras understand that a person in that position could not be my disciple for they have not gone forth in the Buddhas dharma but instead would be a disciple of heretics holding erroneous views Sutras and vinayas that are like this are those that were expounded by the Buddha Discourses that are not like this are those that were expounded by a mara and anyone who follows what has been expounded by a mara is of the assembly of Mara But it is a bodhisattva who follows what has been expounded by the Buddha b In addition good man you may also hear someone say  The Tathagata is not one who has accomplished immeasurable virtue He is impermanent he changes But if there is someone who claims this The Tathagata s awakening is beyond conception Moreover this has been accomplished by means of the virtue accrued over countless asarnkhyeya kalpas and this is why he abides permanently without change sutras and vinayas such as this reflect what was uttered by the Buddha If one acts in accordance with that which is preached by maras this then places that individual among the followers of maras but to act in accordance what has been preached by buddhas is to be a bodhisattva You will also hear this said There may be a bhiku who has not actually committed a piiriijika offense but a group of people nevertheless claims that he has done so and is as if he had cut down a tiila tree  Thus may a bhiku be  despite the fact that he committed no violation What is this about I have always said To commit even one of the four piiriijika offenses would be like splitting a stone it cannot be made whole again If someone comes forth to admit having overstated his own religious achievements that offense I would call piiriijika Because when someone pretends to have attained something that he has not he has lost his sense of social responsibility and this is to be known as piiriijika But there is also the story of a particular bhiku who was satisfied with few desires pure in maintaining precepts and resided in a place of empty quietude When the king and his ministers happened upon him they looked at him and thought he must have attained arhatship So they went before him to offer praise respect and make obeisance and said Great teachers such as yourself attain anuttarii samyaksarrzbodhi after relinguishing their bodies When the bhiku heard this he responded to the king by saying The truth is that I have not attained even the fruit of the path of a novice  king do not praise me for having accomplished the path I beseech you great king do not speak of a dharma that is only discontent to me By discontent I am referring to your mention of my attainment of anuttarii samyaksarrzbodhi which everyone accepts in silence but were I to accept this statement of attainment in silence now it would incur the reproach of the buddhas To course in contentment based in understanding is to be praised by the buddhas so I intend to joyfully cultivate this throughout my entire life Yet to know such contentment is to be aware that I myself have definitely not attained the fruit of the path The king has praised my accomplishments but at the moment I cannot accept this which is why it is called contentment based in understanding The king then answered him Master you have truly attained the fruit of arhatship you are no different from a buddha Thereafter the king spoke widely of this monk to people both inside and outside his kingdom even telling his wives and consorts so that everyone would know that he had attained the sriimaIJera path As a result this led everyone who heard about him to regard him with a sense of trust reverence and deep respect And in his own way this bhiku truly was someone pure in his religious practice This causal chain of events broadly enabled others to obtain great blessings as well so despite the false declaration of his attainment this bhiu was certainly not guilty of having committed the piirii ika offense  The reason is that the person facing him joyously praised and venerated the monk of his own accord unprompted What violation could thus have been committed by a monk like this Now consider another bhiu who in preaching from the Profound Scripture of the Buddha s Hidden Treasury  said  All living beings possess buddhanature and it is because of this nature that they cut off the countless billions of the fetters caused by the defilements thereby attaining anuttarii samyaksarrzbodhi The only exceptions are the icchantikas When the king and his ministers then asked Do you have buddhanature or not The bhiu answered Within my current body buddhanature is definitely present Whether or not I attain buddhahood is something yet to be determined The king said Venerable sir if one thus does not become an icchantika does that mean one will surely attain buddhahood   The monk replied Yes it i s truly as the king says So although this person declared that he definitely possessed buddhanature in his case he too did not commit the piiriijika offense  There was also a bhiu who at the time of his onlination thought to himself Without fail I will definitely attain anuttarii samyaksalbodhi  Someone like this may not have attained the highest path but the merit he has already attained is immeasurable and without limit in a way that cannot be put into words If someone were to claim that by thinking in this way this man commits the piiriijika offense  then it would mean that no bhiu would ever be innocent of this charge Why do I say this Because over the last eight billion kapas I have always separated myself from all things impure been content with few desires accomplished the proper comportment and diligently cultivated the unsurpassed tathiigatagarbha And I knew for certain by myself that in my body I possessed buddhanature For that reason attaining anuttarii samyaksalbodhi is attaining what I now call the great compassion of a buddha Sutras and vinayas that contain ideas like this are the discourses of the Buddha Those who are unable to follow them are followers of Mara Those who are able to follow them are great bodhisattvas There are also those who say There is no such thing as the four piiriijika transgressions the thirteen salghiivasea violations that bring suspension and require adjudication the two indeterminate violations the thirty offenses regarding personal property the ninetyone offenses removed by ritual confession the teaching of the fourfold repentance the manifold areas of behavior requiring personal study the seven rules for resolving conflicts within the sangha and so forth The sthuliityaya transgressions showing gross criminal intent and the five heinous crimes do not exist nor are there any icchantikas If there are monks who fall into the hells by committing these types of offenses then people of other faiths are all reborn in the heavens Because people following other paths do not have precepts that can be violated like this Therefore the Tathagata expounds these precepts just to create fear in people Or if one says that the Buddha preached that When my bhikuS want to engage in sexual activity they should remove their dharma vestments and put on secular clothing then and only then should they indulge in sex That should make you rethink  The consequence of sexual activity is not a transgression for me While the Tathagata was in the world there were bhius who repeatedly engaged in sexual activity and yet obtained true liberation When their lives came to an end they were reborn in the heavens There have been people like this in the past and in there are people like this in the present I am not the only person to do this So even if one commits a violation of one of the four grave piiriijika offenses or five heinous crimes or engages in any kind of impure ritual that person can still attain genuine liberation And although the Tathagata did say Committing a minor dUkrta violation falling into a hell for eight million years measuring time as it passes in the Trayastriquia Heaven I  this was just the Tathagata manifesting himself for the purpose of instilling fear in people After all some people say There is no distinction between the severity of piiriijika and dUkrta offenses These vinaya masters falsely claim that their statements reflect rules enunciated by the Buddha Surely you will understand that these ideas do not reflect anything expounded by the Buddha Statements like these come from the sutras and vinayas of Mara Thus we understand the importance of protecting ourselves like a tortoise that hides his six appendages  Similarly you may encounter a vinaya master who makes the claim that all precept violations are without karmic repercussions  You should avoid getting close to someone like thi s  For the Buddha has said  Transgressing even a single dharma  I regard as deceitful speech Your next life may not be visible to you But it will not be formed without bad  Therefore you should not get close to such people Thus is the purity within my Buddhas dharma and how much more apparent this is for those who commit the serious offenses of sthUlalyaya Therefore you should take seriously the need to guard against dharmas like those coming from irresponsible sources If you do not protect  will there be anything to whatever dharma I have labeled a prohibition As I have explained in the sutras anyone who commits a violation of anything from the parajikas down to the fine points of dUkrta will indeed face hardship   If living beings do not uphold the ordinances and observances how will they be able to see the buddhanature Although all living beings possess buddhanature they have to maintain morality only then will they see it And it is by means of seeing buddhanature that one attains anuttara samyaksafJbodhi The ninefold canon does not contain the wellbalanced sutras and that is why there is no exposition on the existence of buddhanature to be found within it But though this is not expounded in those sutras you should recognize that it truly exists If someone speaks to this point you should recognize that person as a true disciple of mine The bodhisattva Kasyapa then addressed the Buddha saying WorldHonored One you have just explained that all living beings possess buddhanature But as we never hear of this in the ninefold canon would we not be committing a serious parajika offense by preaching this The Buddha said Good man in fact there will be no parajika violation i f you explain it just as you have done Good man this is analogous to someone claiming the ocean contains only seven kinds of jewels and not eight for that person commits no precept violation If someone were to say that throughout our ninefold canon there is no reference to buddhanature this person would also commit no precept violation Why do I say this Because it is in the ocean of wisdom that is the Mahayana that I expound the existence of buddhanature But this is something that is not perceived by those of the two vehicles so therefore if they preach that it does not exist they are not at fault A realm such as this is known by buddhas it is not included in the furthest reaches of the knowledge held by sravakas or pratyekabuddhas Good man if people have never heard of the profound hidden tathagata treasury how could they be aware of the existence of buddhanature What is it that I am calling a hidden treasury I am talking about the wellbalanced Mahayana scriptures themselves Good man there are other path s  some expound a self that is permanent some expound a self that is cut off permanently  In affirming both self and nons elf I call it the middle path One way of explaining this is that the Buddha expounds a middle path in which all living beings possess buddhanature but because it is obscured by the defilements they do not understand it and do not see it Therefore you must diligently cultivate whatever expedient means you can in order to destroy those defilements Know that the person who effectively states things in this way will not be guilty of any of the four grave offenses To not effectively state things in this way I declare to be guilty of a parajika offense You may encounter someone who says  I have already attained anuttara samyaksafbodhi Because I possess buddhanature Those who possess buddhanature will definitely attain unsurpassed perfect enlightenment without fail So by this reasoning I have already attained awakening  You should recognize this person as having committed what I consider a parajika offense Although one may have buddhanature without cultivating one  s understanding of skillful means one will therefore not see it And never having seen it one simply cannot attain anuttara  samyaksaflbodhi Good man understand the implications here  the Buddha s dharma is exceedingly profound it is inconceivable The bodhisattva Klisyapa then addressed the Buddha again and asked WorldHonored One there is a king who has asked When can we say a bhiku has fallen into the transgression of overstating his religious achievements The Buddha said to Klisyapa How could I use that situation to enable me to obtain fortune and fame Bhikus such as this suffer from serious delusion Throughout the long night they will be continually thinking The truth is that I will never attain the fruit of any of the four paths of a sramaa so what can I do to get people in society to say that I have That is man replete with merit a true saint This kind of thinking reflects one who seeks profit solely for himself he is not devoted to the dharma When people pass by him or go in and out of his vicinity they halt and look at him closely seeing how he holds his robe and almsbegging bowl without breaking the rules of deportc ment how he sits in a solitary place just like an arhat This sight may cause worldly people all to remark Bhikus like that are the best of the lot They diligently pursue austere practices cultivating a dharma of tranquility With a situation like this I could end up with a big gain in the number of disciples who follow me They will bring me offerings clothing food and drink furniture and medicine It will also mean I can get many women to love and respect me If you a bhiu or bhiurIIWho engages in something like this this is someone who has fallen into the transgression of overstating his religious achievements And by obtaining the teachings preceptviolating monks and laymen could be brought to successfully keep the precepts which then becomes an opportunity to promote the truedharma honoring what is most important to the Tathagata elucidating the transfonnative nature of the wellbalanced Mahayana dharma liberating innumeFable living beings and gaining a good grasp of the relative significance of what is expounded by the Tathagata in the sutras and vinayas They will also say Now I also have buddhanature There is a sutra called Tathiigatagarbha which states that I will accomplish the buddha path without fail completely eliminating the untold millions of defilements  And in speaking more generally to laymen All of you without exception have buddhanature  You and I together are well situated in the foundation of the Tathagata on which we will attain anuttarii samyaksarrzbodhi eliminating the untold millions of defilements Those who speak like this I would not call people who have fallen into overstating their re ligious achievements  I call them bodhisattvas  As I mentioned committing a minor dUkrta violation means suffering the kannic retribution of falling into a hell for eight million years measuring time as it passes in the Trayastrirnsa Heaven so what would the more serious sthuiityaya violation entail In the Mahayana if there are bhius who commit sthuiityaya transgressions you should not get close to them but what would I call a sthuiityaya transgression within the purview of the Mahayana If for example a layperson of distinction builds a Buddhist monastery and adorns it with flower garlands as an offering to the Buddha and then a bhiu who sees the string running through the flower garland without asking abruptly pulls it out  that would be a sthuiityaya violation Whether understands the nature of what he has done or not it is still a transgression Or if someone driven by vehement desire was to smash a Buddhist stupa that would constitute a sthuiityaya violation You should not get close to people who act like this Consider this Wanting to repair it as an offering to its relics they enter into the stupa and there discover a rare gem which they then entrust to a resident bhiu But the bhiu upon obtaining the jewel feels free to use it for himself A bhiu who reacts like this I call someone impure who often foments conflict A good layman should neither get close to such a person nor make any offerings to him nor pay him any respect A bhiu like this may be someone known to be without any sexual faculty or of two sexual faculties or of indeterminate sexual faculty a For someone of indeterminate sexual faculty when they feel lust for a woman their body thereupon becomes feminine and when they feel lust for a man their body thereupon becomes masculine A bhiu like this is known for having a problematic sexual faculty I do not call this person male I do not call this person female I do not call this person a renunciant and I do not call this person a lay follower either You should not become close to bhius like this give them offerings or respect them I I I Within the Buddha s dharma the dharma for sramaIJas teaches that one should foster compassion nurturing living beings even as small as a black ant One should also promote fearlessness In this sramaIJa dharma there is abstinence from the consumption of alcohol and the enjoyment of fragrant smells This sramaIJa dharma does not abide lying or even the imagined telling of lies in dreams This sramaIJa dharma does not produce a mind filled with desires and even in a dream state it is no different Such is the dharma for sramaas The bodhisattva Kasyapa then addressed the Buddha saying W orldHonored One if a bhiksu engages in sexual activity while dreaming is this a violation of the precepts or not The Buddha answered It is not Nevertheless he should take in the unpleasant smell produced from sexual desire and engage in a meditation on purity wherein not even one thought of arises and a meditation on abstaining from the defilement of affectionate attachment to women If one dreams of engaging in sex upon awakening one should feel regret When a bhiksu receives an offering while begging for food he should eat thinking of the food as the flesh of a child in a world that is starving If he continues to have lustful desires he should immediately free himself from such thoughts as soon as they arise  Teachings of this kind you should know to be precisely what the Buddha has expounded in the sutras and vinayas One who accords with what a mara has taught will be a follower of Mara One who accords with what the Buddha has taught I call bodhisattva You may also hear someone say The Buddha allows his bhiksus to hold one leg in the air and remain silent to jump into an abyss to lay down upon fire to let oneself fall from a cliff to remain in painful circumstances to take poison to fast to lie face down in ashes to bind their own hands and feet to kill living beings to practice geomancy and to cast spells The chi ldren of caqiilas people without any sexual faculty people with two sexual faculties people with indeterminate sexual faculty or people whose faculties are incomplete are all permitted to take the tonsure and follow the Buddhist path This I call an exposition of Mara I do not allow the continuous holding of one leg in the air For the sake of the dhanna I do pennit people to practice walking standing still sitting or lying down But I do not allow the taking of poison fasting the burning of any of the body s five appendages the binding of hands and feet the killing of living beings the practice of geomancy the casting of spells the adornment of leather shoes with motherofpearl or ivory the storing of seeds the idea that grasses and trees have individual life spans or the wearing of mahiiriinkava wool If someone claims that the WorldHonored One preaches in favor of these things you should understand that such a person is a follower of a heretical pathhe is not a disciple of mine But I do allow the eating of the five b flavors derived from cows as well as oil and honey And I do pennit the wearing of leather shoes and the kauseya silk robes I have stated that the four basic elements of earth water fire and wind do not have a life span  Any sutras or vinayas that expound things in this way I would call sennons of the Buddha and anyone who is in accordance with these sennons should be recognized as a true disciple of mine Anyone who is not in accordance with what the Buddha has uttered is a follower of Mara Anyone who follows the Buddha sutras or vinayas should be regarded as a great bodhisattva Good man I have now related in some detail the difference between that which characterizes what is said by the Buddha and what is said by Mara Kasyapa then said to the Buddha WorldHonored One now for the first time I understand the distinction between what maras preach and what buddhas preach As a result I feel that I am able to enter into the deep significance of the Buddhas dhanna The Buddha praised Kasyapa saying Excellent Excellent Good man I see that this distinction has been clarified for you This I call wise Good man what is commonly known as suffering or dulkha does not refer to the socalled Noble Truth Why is this Because if the usual use of suffering referred to the noble truth of suffering it would mean that all cows sheep mules horses and even beings in hell would have noble truths Good man if someone did not understand that the profound realm of a tathagata is that of a subtle and mysterious dharma body in which he abides permanently and immutably that person might say he has a body that eats not a dharma body Such a person does not understand either the virtue or the maj esty of the Tathagata Because it is out of ignorance that a person regards what is proper as what is improper  and regards what is improper as proper It should be understood that whoever like this will surely fall into one of the unfortunate realms as they transmigrate through sarpsara This will only increase their bonds to the cycle of rebirth and they will have to endure many hardships When on the other hand one is able to realize the fact that the Tathagata abides permanently and immutably then by merely hearing the sound of the two words abides permanently even once that person will be directly reborn in the heavens Later at the time of their liberation they will be able to witness the fact that the Tathagata abides permanently and is immutable And having attested to this they will say In the past I had only heard about this but now I have gained liberation and thereupon witnessed it myself Because I was ignorant of the ultimate reality I continued to revolve in the cycle of birth and death with no end When one has understood in this way they truly appreciate the implications of dulkha the benefits of which are substantial But in the absence of such understanding no matter how diligent ones practice may be there will be no benefit This I call understanding dulkha or the noble truth of suffering But for individuals unable to cultivate in this way what they call suffering will not be the noble truth of suffering The Noble Truth of the causes of suffering denotes what happens when genuine understanding of the genuine dhanna does not take place It is when one accepts impure things such as slaves effectively taking what is improper and saying this is the truedhanna  Vitiating the truedhanna prevents it from abiding for any length of time and under these conditions there will be no understanding of the natural conditions that are dharmatii It is owing to that fundamental ignorance that c one transmigrates through satpsara incurri n g much suffering and anxiety unable to gain either rebirth in the heavens or liberation proper One who fully recognizes the truedh arma does not damage it and under those conditions gains rebirth in the heavens or liberation proper For one who does not recognize the reasoning in the truth of how suffering is caused the truedhanna will not pennanently abide in every way it will be a disappearing dhanna Under these conditions individuals will experience much pain and anguish in the process of a transmigration that continues for innumerable kalp a s If someone can succeed in recognizing the dhanna that abides pennanently in a way no different from any other time or place  that I would call understanding the causes or the noble truth of the causes of suffering But for the individual unable to cultivate in this way what are called the causes will not be the noble truth of the causes of suffering If one diligently practices and studies the dhanna of emptiness this will not do Because eliminating all dhannas destroys the true dhannatreasury of the Tathagata To practice and study l ike this I call cultivating emptiness But does cultivating the destruction of suffering in this way contrast with all of the other paths that are heretical One may speak of the cultivation of emptiness as the truth of the destruction of suffering  but the heretical paths all cultivate a dhanna of emptiness as wel l and it must be the truth of the destruction  If one were to assert There is a tathiigatagarbha and even though it cannot be seen it is capable of eliminating all the defilements which is the point at which one comprehends it then upon bringing forth this state of mind by the conditions wrought by this single thought one can attain freedom in all dhannas  For one whose meditation focuses on nonself and empty quiescence as the hidden teasury of the Tathiigata however there will be innumerable transmigrations and the incurring of suffering throughout Those who do not approach practice in that way despite the presence of the defilements will find quickly eliminated How could this be It happens through the understanding of the tathiigata hidden treasuryand this is what I call the noble truth of the destruction of suffering Anyone who is able to practice the destruction of suffering in this way is a true disciple of mine Anyone who is not able to practice in this way I regard as someone cultivating emptiness which does not the noble truth of the destruction of suffering The Noble Truth of the path refers to the Jewels of the buddha dharma and sangha and also includes liberation proper There are those living beings however with misconceptions in the form of inversions of their thinking who say There is no buddha dharma or sangha nor is there any liberation The notion of transmigrating in satpsiira is just an illusion If someone were to cultivate this way of seeing things it would lead to incurring significant suffering throughout that person s transmigration in the triple world But those who can arrive at a perspective in which the Tathiigata is permanently abiding and immutable and see the dharma sangha and liberation likewise will ride that single thought to a resultant freedom for countless lifetimes obtained at their whim Why is this In the past I also held four inverted views taking what was not dharma and reckoning it as dharma for which I received bad karmic fruition beyond measure It is because I have already eliminated all such thinking that I have attained the complete awakening of a buddha This is called the Noble Truth of the path Now if there are people who assert that the Three Jewels are impermanent and cultivate that viewpoint such practice based on falsehood will not bring the noble truth of the path But if someone cultivates the notion that the dharma permanently abides that person would be my disciple To practice the Four Noble Truths in a way that is based on true seeing that is what I call the Four Noble Truths a The bodhisattva Kasyapa then addressed the Buddha saying  WorldHonored One I now understand for the first time how to practice the dharma of the profound Four Noble Truths    The Buddha told Kasyapa Good man the term four inversions the perception of suffering as occurring in a situation that is not one of suffering This is what I call an inversion Nonsuffering is that which we call tathagata To perceive suffering in association with tathagatas is to regard them as impermanent and changeable and if someone were to say The Tathagata is impermanent that would constitute the suffering of a serious transgression Or if someone were to say The Tathagata relinguishes this body of suffering when he enters nirvala akin to the extinguishing of a flame when burning firewood is exhausted this I would call the perception of suffering where there is no suffering Because this amounts to the perception of bliss in suffering it is to be called an inversion And the perception of suffering in bliss I also call an inversion Bliss is precisely what a tathagata is Suffering is what a tathagata would be as something impermanent To say tathagatas are impermanent is what I call perceiving suffering in what is bliss because tathagatas do abide permanently and that is called bliss Someone may say The Tathagata is pennanent so why does he enter nirvaQa Or The Tathagata is devoid of suffering so why is he going to j ettison his body to go out of existence These too are perceptions of suffering in what is bliss and hence I caB them inversions The perception of pennanence in what is impennanent and the perception of impennanence in what is pennanent these I also caB inversions Impennanence is caBed the noncultivation of emptiness by not focusing one  s practice on emptiness one  s lifetime is shortened So if someone says By not cultivating the practice of emptiness and quiescence you wiB obtain a longer l i fetime I would consider this statement to be inverting  This represents the second type of inversion The perception of self in what is nonself and the perception of nonself in what is self these I also caB inversions Worldly people speak of the existence of a self and we also speak of the exi stence of a self in the Buddha  s dhanna but although worldly people affinn the existence of self they do not affinn the exi stence of buddhanature This particular view I caB the perception of self in what is nonself and this too is an inversion There is a self in the Buddha  s dhanna but that self is the buddhanature When worldly people say there is no self in the Buddha  s dhanna I caB this the perception of nons elf in what is self So if someone says There is definitely no self in the dhanna of the Buddha that is why the Tathagata commands his disciples to cultivate practices focused on nonself I would caB that an inversion Such notions represent what I caB the third type of inversion The perception of impurity in what i s pure and the perception of purity in what is impure these I also caB inversions What is pure is precisely the pennanent abiding of the Tathagata whose body is neither a body sustained by any sort of food nor a body affected by the defilements nor a body of flesh nor a body held together by muscle and bone Nonetheless someone may assert that The Tathagata is impennanent His is a body sustained by food it i s a body held together by musc les and bone s  The dharma the  sangha and the liberation will all be extinguished when he dies  This I call an inversion  Regarding the inversion of perceiving purity in what is impure you may hear someone say this Within this body of mine there is not one dharma that is not pure  It i s by means of th i s lack of i mpurity that I w i l l surely gain entrance into that place of purity  This is the practice of the contemplation on impurity that has been taught by the Tathagata  This kind of speech is incoherent and false I call it inverted These errors represent the fourth type of inversion The bodhi sattva Kasyapa then said to the Buddha WorldHonored One today for the first time I have gained the right view of these things WorldHonored One the way we were previously you would have called us people who held wrong views W orldHonored One is there a self or not in any of the twentyfive forms of exi stence The Buddha said beings have buddhanature and this is what is meant by this All living notion of self However the significance of self understood in this way has been continuously covered over by an uncountable number o f the defilements since the beginning  and that is why living beings have been unable to perceive it The Five Parables on Buddhanature    Good man consider the parable of an impoverished woman who had a treasure of pure gold within the area of her home But i f you were to point out to my son where this treasuretrove of gold is  after that I would quickly come to do that for you The man answered I know an expedient way to show this to your son The woman responded None of the people in my house child or adult know anything about thi s  How could you possibly know The man said I will now make everything clear This prompted the woman to respond Indeed I also want to see it Can you show it to me as well The man then immediately dug up the treasure of pure gold that had been their home When the woman saw it she was ecstatic Enamored of how miraculous the entire event was she regarded the man with deep admiration  Good man the buddhanature of living beings is j ust like thi s  not all living beings are able to perceive it j ust like that treasuretrove of which that poor woman was not aware Good man what I have now shown is the universality of buddhanature possessed by all living beings yet obscured by their defilements analogous to a poor person who possesses a treasure of pure gold that she cannot see Today the Tathagata has shown the universally treasure repositories of enlightenment in living beings in other words buddhanature itself When living beings do perceive thi s their hearts are filled with j oy and a deep reverence for the Tathagata the person of skillful means is the Tathagata the woman living in poverty represents all living beings and the treasure of pure gold is the buddhanature Parable Two In addition good man consider the story of a caring woman and her infant son who had become ill In distress the woman sent for a physician and when he arrived he mixed together a medicine made of three  things  clarified butter milk and granulated honey As he gave the mixture to her to feed to her child the physician explained After the child takes the medicine do not give him your milk You may feed him only after he has fully digested the medic ine   So the mother then smeared a bittertasting substance on her breasts and said to her young child My breasts are smeared with poi son so you must not touch them   When the child became hungry h e wanted his mother s milk but hearing that her breasts were poisonous he pulled away from her Eventually the medicine was absorbed by the child whereupon the mother washed her breasts with water and called out to her son Come and I shall give you milk But at that point though the l ittle boy felt hunger and thirst what he had heard earlier about the poi son prevented him from approaching her The mother then told him It was only because I was giving you medicine that I used the poison  Now that you have fully digested the medicine I have cleaned myself completely so you may come and drink from my breasts without pain or bitterness Upon hearing this the infant eventual ly returned and resumed his feeding Good man the Tathagata is j ust like thi s  It was for the sake of saving everyone that I taught l iving beings to cultivate their understanding of non s e l f in all dharmas  after they had practiced in this manner they w i l l have forsaken their egotism I taught the nonexi stence of self forever and attain nirvala  in order to di spel erroneous views circulating in the mundane world and reveal a supramundane dharma  In addition I showed that worldly presumptions of self are fallacious and not real  cultivating the dharma of nonse l f is therefore meant to cleanse one  s identity Just as in thi s parable of the woman who smeared her breast with bitter flavor in order to help her child in like manner the Tathagata explained that dharmas are all without self in order to lead his followers to cultivate emptiness And just as the woman called her child only after washing her breasts because she wanted him to resume feeding I also choose this particular moment now to expound the gatagarbha For this reason bhikyus tathiido not be afraid Like that small child who eventually returned to drink his mother  s milk after hearing her calling him that the bhius on their own should also di stinguish the fact tathiigatagarbha cannot possibly not exist The bodhi sattva Klisyapa then spoke to the Buddha But WorldHonored One truly there is no self Why is this so When a child is born he has no understanding of anything If there were a self then on the day he is born we would expect him to have knowledge This is why we know for certain there is no self Or if the existence of a self were certain then after being born there should be no end to life If all had buddhanature it would mean permanent abiding and no dimension of dissolution in the human condition and in other living beings  If there were no dimension of dissolution then why would there be di stinctions between katriyas brahmans vaisyas sudras carujii las and animals    But now we can see that karmic conditions are dissimilar in various ways which accordingly results in each realm of rebirth being different If the exi stence of a self were certain then there would be no superiority and inferiority relative to all the different living beings For these reasons we know with certainty that the buddhanature is not a permanent dharma If you say the buddhanature is indeed permanent then what is the principle that explains the exi stence of murder thievery licentiousness deception backbiting lying flattery greed anger or erroneous opinions If our selfnatures were permanent then why do some people become rough or violent after drinking alcohol If our selfnatures were permanent then the blind should be able to see colors the deaf should be able to hear sounds the mute should be able to speak and the paraplegic should be able to walk If our selfnatures were permanent then we would have no need to avoid fires floods poisons swords dangerous people or wild animals If our selves were permanent then we should have no memory loss about anything we have experienced from the very beginning  If we did not forget anything then on what basi s do people say Where was I when I saw that person If our selves were perman ent then we would not get involved in recall ing th ings from our past such as the flouri shing and decline of our strength over the course of youth maturity and old age If the self is permanent then where does it reside Is it in the colors of  mucusgreen yellow red or white If the self is permanent does it pervade the entire body like a coating of sesame oil complete without gaps And if one were to forsake the body would the self then also be forsaken Parable Three The Buddha said to Kasyapa Good man imagine there was a powerful athlete who resided in a king s palace and wore a diamond jewel between his eyebrows I n a wrestling match with another athlete he bumped his forehead into his opponent so fiercely that the jewel penetrated into his skin sinking down so deeply that he could not find it As this left a wound he was ordered to see a physician for treatment The physician was a bright man and knew how to treat him for he understood that the wound had been created by the jewel that had entered the man  s body by going under his skin where it was now firmly lodged the physician asked the athlete My good man do you know what happened to the jewel that was on your forehead Taken aback the athlete replied Master physician king what did happen to the jewel on my forehead It could not be gone could it Where is that jewel now It could not have just vanished   He then fell into a state of anguish and broke down in tears But the good doctor consoled him  Do not be upset When you were wrestling the jewel entered into your body and now it is shining forth even though it is under your skin You were so engrossed in the match and the poison of your anger was so intense that you failed to notice when the jewel was forced under your skin  Yet the athlete simply could not believe the doctor and said If it were under my skin there should be blood or pus or something unclean like that How come nothing is coming out of the wound And if it were within some inner tissue then it would not be visible  Why are you trying to deceive me So the doctor then held up a mirror to show the man his own face and the jewel was clearly visible in the reflection When the athlete saw this he was stunned finding the whole thing miraculous Good man all living beings are like this By not being able to get close to a good spiritual advisor despite the fact has the buddhanature they cannot see it Because their minds are clouded over by greed lust resentment and doubt they fall into rebirths as hell beings animals hungry ghosts asuras caliilas atriyas brahmans vaisyas or sudras They are born into a variety of different families as a consequence of the variety of different karmic conditions they bring into being by their thoughts Even when they are fortunate enough to receive a human life they may still be handicapped in their hearing seeing speaking physical movements their ability to pass urine or their ability to walk Like the athlete in the story who bemoaned the loss of his jewel when it was in fact inside his body living beings are in a similar situation Because they do not know how to approach a good spiritual advisor they remain unaware of the hidden treasury that is the tathiigatagarbha and they study and practice the doctrine of nonself This is analogous to the mundane person who asserts the existence of self but does not understand the true nature of self My disciples may also be like this Because they do not know how to approach a good spiritual advisor they study and put into practice the doctrine of nonself but they too do not understand the point of nonself And if they do not understand the true nature of nonself then how could they understand the true nature of self Good man the Tathagata has thus stated that all living beings have buddhanature Just like the skilled physician who had to show the champion his diamond jewel living beings are unaware of their buddhanature because it is concealed from them by their innumerable defilements hundreds of millions of them If they could but do away with these defilements at that point they could attest to its existence as it would become utterly clear to them j ust like the athlete seeing his jewel in the mirror Good man there are innumerable inconceivables like this associated with the tathagata hidden treasury   In addition good man it i s like the medicinal plant of singular flavor growing in the Himalayan Mountains known as the flavor of bliss as it i s extremely sweet This plant only grows deep beneath clusters of plants and cannot be seen when looking down at them but some people can smell it and thereby know where it lies In the past there was a cakravartin king who would go into the Himalayas for thi s medicine Wherever he found it he had wooden cylinders constructed adj acent to the plants As the plant matures it produces a secretion that would then flow into the tubes When collected this way the flavor was as pristine as it was in the plant Then the king died and in the aftermath the medicine that had been of a uniform singular flavor turned into a variety of different flavors depending on where the stores of it ended up Some of it became sour some became salty some became sweet some became bitter some became spicy and some became astringent in flavor The true taste of the medicine remained in the mountains however like the full moon Ordinary people with little in the way of merit tried digging with mattocks but despite great effort and hard work they came away emptyhanded It will appear again only when another cakravartin king appears in the world for obtaining the genuine flavor of the medicine was a consequence of his merit Good man the flavor of the tathagata hidden treasury is like this Covered over by a thicket of defilements living beings with spiritual ignorance will simply be unable to see it The singular flavor is a metaphor for buddhanature in that it is because of the defilements such as they are in each individual that manifests in various different flavors namely the realms of hell animals hungry ghosts gods males females those who are neither male nor female atriyas brahmans vaisyas and sudras But the buddhanature is powerful and exceedingly difficult to damage in any way and that is why there cannot be any murdering  If killing it were possible that would mean permanently eliminating the buddhanature But buddhanature is such that in the end it cannot be eliminated  the very notion that it could be eliminated i s absurd The nature of self in this sense garbha is none other than this hidden treasury that is the tathiigataThere is simply no means by which this mystic repository such as it is could be violently destroyed or burnt up Yet while it cannot be destroyed by and large it cannot be seen either If you attain unsurpassed perfect enl i ghtenment however at that point you witness it These are the reasons why killing cannot happen in this case The bodhisattva Kasyapa then addressed the Buddha WorldHonored One if there were no killing then there would not be any unwholesome karma The Buddha explained to Kasyapa In truth killing living beings does take place You may ask why Good man the buddhanature of living beings abides within their five aggregates and when someone destroys the five aggregates I indeed call this killing a living being   And one who has killed a living being will fall into an unfortunate existence  The different forms that beings take among the twentyfive forms of existence as they course through sarpsara such as atriya brahman vaisya sudra caruiila male female or neither male nor female and so forth are due to karmic causation  In thi s regard a vulgar person might mistakenly conj ecture that the relative size characteristics of the self make it j ust like a grain of millet a grain of rice a bean or a human thumb This variety of sizes and shapes are deluded products of the imagination and conceptions formed of illusions like thi s have no basis in reality By contrast what characterizes the supramundane self i s what I call buddhanature and reckoning the self in this manner is what I call the highest good In addition good man consider the story of a man who had come to know quite clearly about a buried treasure so he picked up a sharp mattock and dug straight down into the ground for it There were rocks large and smal l but he got through them not being blocked by anything until  he reached a stone of diamond that he could not penetrate This diamond was so hard that even his heavy ax could not damage it Good man buddhanature in living beings is just like this It cannot be destroyed by any theory by the deity Mara Paplyas or any other person or deity As a feature of the five aggregates when they come into being it does as well But a characteristic of the functioning five aggregates is that like rocks and sand they can be fractured and even destroyed Yet buddhanature is like a diamond in that it is impossible to destroy or even damage it This is why I say that destroying the five aggregates I do call killing a living being but good man you must also understand that the Buddha s dharma is thus inconceivable  VIII Chapter Four The Nature of the Tathagata Part  The Buddha said Good man the wellbalanced sutras are like the ambrosia a of immortality but they are also like poisonous medicine The bodhisattva Kasyapa then addressed the Buddha What would cause the Tathagata say that the wellbalanced sutras are like the ambrosia of immortality but also like a poisonous medicine The Buddha said Good man do you now want to know the true meaning of the tathagata hidden treasury Kasyapa said I truly want to know the meaning of the tathiigata hidden treasury Then the WorldHonored One explained in verse It may be that taking the ambrosia of immortality Injures a person s life and he dies early It may be that taking the ambrosia of immortality Enhances a person s life and he lives longer It may be that taking poison gives life Or conditions are such that taking poison brings death The ambrosia of immortality that is unimpeded wisdom Refers to the Mahayana scriptures Yet these Mahayana scriptures Are also called a mixing of poison and medicine Like butter the cream on the surface of clarified butter And granulated honey When digested they are medicine When not digested they are poison  The wellbalanced are just like this For the wise they are the ambrosia of immortality For the foolish who do not understand buddhanature When taken they become poison Just like among all flavors Milk comes first Thus those who make strenuous effort By means of the Mahayana Can indeed reach nirvaIa Becoming elephant kings among men Livings beings that understand buddhanature Just like you Kasyapa the taste of the unsurpassed ambrosia of immortality That is never born and never dies Kasyapa for now you are skillful In discriminating the three objects of refuge But the nature of this triplerefuge Is just the nature of self When someone critically observes That selfnature contains buddhanature You will know that a person such as that Is able to enter this hidden treasury One who understands self and what pertains to self Has already passed beyond this world The nature of the Three Jewels that are the Buddha s dharma Is to be honored above all else Like these verses I have expounded The meaning of their nature is thus At that point Kasyapa spoke up and uttered these verses Now I completely do not understand The principle of taking refuge in the Three Jewels How should one seek that place of unsurpassed fearlessness I do not fully understand the principle of taking refuge in the Three Jewels How does one do nonself How does taking refuge in the Buddha Bring one consolation Why in taking refuge in the Dhanna Does one only request explanations for oneself Why do some attain freedom While others do not Why does taking refuge in the Sangha Lead to gaining the greatest benefit How do you truly explain The path to the attainment of buddhahood in the future If one will not attain this in the future Then why take refuge in the Three Jewels  At this point I have no foreknowledge Of the sequence for practicing the refuges What idea can one entertain about childbirth Without ever being pregnant c There must be a presence in the womb Before we say that is with child The child if it is in the womb Will definitely be born before long This sense of how we speak of a child  Is how kanna seems to living beings    As the Buddha has explained Fools cannot understand And because of their nonunderstanding They transmigrate through sarpsara into hell An upasaka in name only Does not understand the true meaning  But only seeks ever more extensive discriminations To eliminate the web of uncertainty surrounding the self But the great wisdom of the Tathagata Only pities such discriminations I thus implore you to explain the hidden treasury Of the tathagatagarbha KiiSyapa you will understand As I bring out for you now The recondite teachings By which your doubts can be removed Now listen carefully You among all the bodhisattvas And the seventh buddha Share the same name A person who takes refuge in the Buddha Is truly called an upiisaka or lay follower To the end he does not also take refuge In other gods or spirits A person who takes refuge in the Dharma Then abandons the taking of life A person who takes refuge in the sacred Sangha Does not seek the paths of heretics Taking refuge in the Three Jewels in this way Brings the attainment of fearlessness KiiSyapa said to the Buddha I will take refuge in the Three Jewels again This is called the right path The realm of the buddhas The mark of equality in the Three Jewels Always contains the nature of great wisdom Selfnature and buddhanature Are not two are not to be distinguished This way is praised by the Buddha It is the basis of right training and stability It is also called the right commitment And therefore extolled by the Buddha Directing myself toward the unsurpassed path Praised by he who is well gone Is nothing less than the ambrosia of immortality There is nothing else like it Then the Buddha said to the bodhisattva Kasyapa Good man now you should not distinguish among the Three Jewels as sravakas and ordinary people do In the Mahayana In the Mahayana there is nothing that marks the three refuges as separate Why do I say this Because the dharma and the sangha exist within the buddhanature itself It was in order to ferry sravakas and ordinary people to the other shore that I separately expounded different marks for each of the three refuges Good man if you want to follow a dharma that accords with worldly custom then it makes sense to distinguish the existence of three separate refuges But good man a bodhisattva would do better to consider things in this way Now with this body I take refuge in this buddha But if it were in this very body that I attained buddhahood then after becoming a buddha I would no longer pay reverence to make obeisance to or make offerings to the worldhonored ones Why is this Because all buddhas are equal equally the object of refuge for living beings If someone wants to pay their respects to relics of the dharma body they should worship the reliquaries of buddhas This comes from the desire to save living beings But by enabling living beings to put forth the idea of a reliquary within their own body and to then worship and make offerings to it in this way living beings can take their personal dharma body as a place of refuge Living beings all rely on untrue or fraudulent dharmas I will in stages endeavor to expound the truedharma In addition some take refuge in fraudulent sanghas For them I will endeavor to be a place of the true sangha And when there are those who distinguish three different forms of refuge I will endeavor to be a single place of refuge for them devoid of that  tripartite distinction I will become the eyes for those who are blind and I w i l l also become a true p l ace of refuge for sravakas and pratyekabuddhas Good man th i s is how a bodhisattva does the work of a buddha both for living beings whose karmic transgressions may be unfathomable and for those who are advanced in wisdom Good man this is akin to a person facing imminent battle whose state of mind is dominated by the thought I am the person in front here  All the soldiers are depending entirely upon me   This i s also like a prince who ruminates I will tame the other princes continuing the work of great kings and hegemons attaining freedom and showing the other princes where their refuge lies Thus should never give rise to thoughts of inferiority just as kings princes or ministers cannot afford to do s o  Good man in much the same way a bodh i s attvamahasattva also ruminates How is it that these three things and myself are one in essence    Good man what I am revealing now is that those three things are j ust nirvaQa itself The Tathagata is called the Unsurpassed Worthy Like the head that sits atop a person  s body rather than at the trunk or limbs the buddha sits at the top  rather than the dharma o r the sangha For the purpose of spiritually transforming worlds he manifests in different forms at different times becoming like their scaffolding Therefore you need not accept the obj ects of refuge as something discriminated into three forms as is currently understood by ordinary dullwitted people In the Mahayana be ardent be resolute like a powerful sword  The bodhisattva Kasyapa then addressed the Buddha WorldHonored One I ask out of appreciation not because I do not understand As someone with a bodhisattva  s seriousness of purpose I wish to ask about the ground of what is pure and undefiled For the sake of  l Ob the bodhisattvas I would like to move the Tathagata to delineate and expand on these astonishing things in your exalted presentation of Mahayana wellbalanced sutras The Tathagata  s great compassion has already been expounded so beautifully that I dwell within it The ground of purity for the bodhisattva of which I speak is none other than this very Mahiiparinirviiasutra that you so eloquently expound WorldHonored One henceforth I will teach other living beings about the hidden tathiigatagarbha in some detail I will also attest to the true basis of the triplerefuge Anyone who can believe in this Mahiiparinirviiasutra will be able to recognize quite naturally the ground of the triplerefuge Why is this so Because of the presence of buddhanature in the hidden treasury that is the tathiigatagarbha Those who expound this scripture will all talk about the presence of the buddhanature within oneself without exception and people like this will not have far to go to find the ground of the triplerefuge Because they  In the future it is I myself who should accomplish the Three Jewels As a result those who are sravakas and pratyekabuddhas and other living beings as well can honor and venerate them by relying on me Good man this is the reason why you should make a proper study of the Mahayana scriptures Kasyapa then said Thus is buddhanature inconceivable And the thirtytwo major marks and the eighty minor marks are also inconceivable At that the Buddha praised Kasyapa Excellent excellent  Good man you have already achieved wisdom of profound value For you I will now explain further about entering this treasury that is the tathiigatagarbha If it were asserted that self is an abiding entity then it would be a permanent dharma and there would be no separation from suffering If one were to cultivate pure practice on the basis of nons elf it would not yield any benefits If it were asserted that all dharmas are without self that would constitute the annihilationist doctrine   and if it were asserted that self is an abiding entity  that would constitute the eternalist doctrine   If it were asserted that that all conditioned phenomena are impermanent that would be the annihilationist view and if all composite things were permanent then that would again be an eternalist view If one asserts suffering that would be annihilationist if one asserts bliss that would be eternalist To cultivate the notion that all dharmas are permanent is to fall into the error of the annihilationist view To cultivate the notion that all dharmas are destroyed is to fall into the error of the eternalist view It is like an inchworm whose hind legs move whenever his forelegs do The cultivation of eternalism and annihilationism are always like this for each one calls forth the other What I am implying here is that focusing your practice on what is painful in other dharmas is never going to be efficacious but focusing your practice on what is j oyful in other dharmas will be efficacious Focusing your practice on nonself in other dharmas is to limit yourself to concern with the defilements while focusing your practice on permanence in other dharmas brings you to what I call the hidden tathiigatagarbha The nirvala I speak of has no abode It would indeed be of some value to pursue your of other dharmas that are impermanent but by cultivating your of dharmas that are permanent you will be looking at the buddha dharma and sangha as well as liberation proper You should understand that this sense of a middle way in the Buddha s dharma expresses the truedharma a perspective that distances itself from either extreme    Ordinary people even those who are foolish have no doubts about the significance of the middle It is like someone weakened from illness who after eating butter feels relieved     c The inherent nature of dharmas of both existence and nonexistence is indeterminate just like the fact that the natures of the four major elements are not the same The fact that they differ from each other is well known by skilled physicians who make them contract or expand by following their idiosyncratic tendencies Good man the Tathagata is also like this He acts toward all living beings like a skilled physician understanding the differences in the inherent makeup of their individual defilements thereby removing and revealing the hidden tathagata treasury that is pure buddhanature permanently abiding and immutable Those who assert that it does exist have a wisdom that is untainted Those who assert that it does not exist are just speaking falsely Those who assert that it does exist need not remain quiet but they should not engage in frivolous speculation nor tum it into a matter of dispute Just search for an understanding of the true nature of dharmas  Ordinary people who speculate or argue do so because they do not comprehend the subtle hidden treasury that is the tathiigatagarbha If expoundl on the problem of suffering the fool immediately thinks Ah yes the body is impermanent  and will preach Everything is suffering But what the fool cannot fathom is the presence of a blissful nature in the body If I expound on impermanence the ordinary person reckons this to mean that all bodies are impermanent like water j ars of unbaked clay But a wise person would discern that one should never say Everything is impermanent Why Because the seed of buddhanature is within ones own body If I expound on nonself the ordinary person will think Throughout the Buddha s dharma there i s never any presence o f a self But the wise person would discern that nonself is a verbal convention and not real Having understood things in this way doubts should not arise in him If I speak of the emptiness of the tathagata hidden treasury the ordinary person who hears this will take it nihilistically But the wise person would discern that a tathagata is constant and immutable When I say that liberation is like an illusion the ordinary person will think Attaining liberation means to be obliterated But the wise person will discern that these lions among humans though they may come and go abide permanently without change If I say that spiritual ignorance conditions all phenomena an ordinary person who hears this will conceive of it as a distinction between two dharmas enlightened knowledge and unenlightened ignorance But a wise person will understand that their natures are not two that nonduality is their true nature If I say that conditioned phenomena condition consciousness an ordinary person will think that I am talking about two things phenomena and consciousness But a wise person will understand that their natures are not distinct that their nondual nature is their true nature When I allude to keeping or violating the ten aspects of good character what ought to be done and what ought not to be done good states of existence and bad states of existence or white dharmas and black dharmas the ordinary person will infer these statements to be about dualities The wise person however will comprehend that their natures are not two distinct things that their nondual nature is their true nature If I say You should cultivate the fact that all dharmas are characterized by suffering the ordinary person will infer this to be about a duality The wise person however will comprehend that their natures are not two distinct things that their nondual nature is their true nature When I state that all conditioned phenomena are impermanent means the tathagata hidden treasury is also imperma  a nent the ordinary person will think these are two different things The wise person however will comprehend that their natures are not two distinct things that their nondual nature is their true nature When I state that all dharmas are without self means that the tathagata hidden treasury is also without self the ordinary person will infer that they are two different things The wise person however will understand that their natures are not two distinct things that their nondual nature is their true nature The nature of self and nonself are not two distinct things The significance of something like this for the tathagata hidden treasury cannot be measured it is praised by innumerable limitless numbers of buddhas This is what I have been explaining here in this Sutra that Accomplishes All Merit   Good man both the nature and characteristics of self and nonself are not a duality You should accept and admire this As I explained in the Large Sutra on Peifect WISdom  self and nonself do not have two distinct characteristics It is like the fact that curds are produced from milk fresh butter is produced from curds clarified butter produced from fresh butter and the cream on clarified butter is produced from clarified butter Does the nature of curds come from milk does it come from itself or does it arise from something else This is the same issue all the way down to the cream on the surface of clarified butter If you say these are produced by means of something else this would constitute external causation and it would mean they do not come from milk If they did not come from milk then milk would be not involved in them If they arose out of themselves they could not have arisen presupposing a continuity over time   If they did arise from within a continuity  then there would be no coarising If there was no coarising then the five kinds of dairy flavors would also not at the same time But though they do not come into being at the same time they definitely do not come from somewhere else That is why you should understand that the characteristics of curds exist within milk prior to  for when there is a rich sweetness of flavor in something it does not change of its own doing   This is true for all the flavors up to and including the cream on the surface of clarified butter The causality at work in a cow drinking water and eating grass is that these things are transfonned by her blood vessels and milk is produced If she eats sweettasting grass her milk will thereupon taste sweet If she eats bittertasting grass her milk will thereupon have a bitter taste There is a type of grass that grows in the Himalayas called snigdha    If cows eat it their milk will yield a clarified butter cream that completely lacks any colors such as green yellow red white or black Thus depending on the grain or grass that a cow eats the color and flavor of her milk will differ By means of the causes and conditions resulting from behavior that is dominated by knowledge or ignorance living beings will produce in two characteristic ways And yet ignorance can be transfonned and thereby turned into knowledge In the same way all dhannas whether wholesome or unwholesome are devoid of this kind of duality The bodhisattva Kasyapa then addressed the Buddha WorldHonored One in your analogy of milk what do curds represent WorldHonored One if as you say the characteristic of curds is definitely present within milk then it being in such a minute fonn that it cannot be seen makes me wonder what does it mean to say that curds arise or come into existence from the causes and conditions of milk When we say dharmas come into existence it is because they originally did not exist but the phenomenon already exists so how can we speak of it as coming into existence If the characteristic of curds is definitely within milk then within a hundred blades of grass there should be milk and likewise within milk there should be grass But   b if one says that curds are definitely not within milk then what causes the milk to produce the curds On the other hand if a dharma that originally did not exist can at a later time come into existence then why is it that grass does not come into existence from milk  Good man it cannot be said with certainty that fresh milk does or does not have curds within it Nor can one state that it comes into existence from something else If one takes the position that fresh milk definitely has curds within it how does one then account for the difference between the substance of something and its flavor For that reason one cannot say that milk definitely has the nature of curds within it On the other hand if one takes the position that fresh milk definitely does not have milk curds within it then why is it that rabbit horns do not arise from milk When poison is put into milk the curds that are then formed will kill a person Therefore it should not be said that milk definitely does not have the nature of curds within it If one takes the position that curds arise from something else then why do curds not arise from water Therefore it should not be said that curds arise from something else   Good man the causal process in operation when a cow eats grass is that her blood turns white then both grass and blood are broken down and by means of her life force this changes into milk Although milk comes from grass and blood it cannot be said that are two distinct and separate things it is just that we speak of it as being produced from this causal process The other milk products from curds down to the cream on clarified butter are also like this It is in this sense that we have named the flavors derived from cows  The breakdown of the milk is what then becomes the causality that leads to curds What causes all this to happen This is why it cannot be said definitively that the characteristics of curds are not present in fresh milk or that it is produced by some outside cause that is separate from milk for such statements are inappropriate Good man knowledge and ignorance are also like this If one is influenced by defilements and constraints in what they do the person is labeled ignorant If one is influenced by thoroughly wholesome dharmas in what they do the person is labeled knowledgeable This is precisely why I say that these two are not distincthow we speak of someone depends on the karmic conditions operative  That Himalayan grass called snigdha will if any cow eats it turn her milk into cream Good man living beings whose merit amounts to little will not find this grass Buddhanature is also like this in that living beings do not see it because it is clouded over by their defilements On the other hand although the ocean is uniformly salty within it there is also water so excellent that it tastes as good as milk Think of the Himalayan Mountains themselves for despite achieving a variety of merit by producing many medicinal plants there are also poisonous plants there The bodies of living beings are also like this although they have poisonous snakes that make up the four elements of the body they also have a wondrous medicine king within them namely buddhanature This is no artificially constructed dharma but it is obscured by the dust of adventitious defilements Whether brahman katriya vaisya or sudra anyone who can remove these defilements will thereupon see the buddhanature and complete the highest path Just as when thunder cracks and clouds appear in the sky flowers bloom on the tusks of all the elephants but if were there no thunderclaps then there would be no blooming of flowers and no words for it either The buddhanature of living beings is just like this In its usual state it is covered by all the defilements and impossible to see This is why I expounded on nonself in living beings  But if one could only hear this subtle Mahiiparinirviiasutra he would then see his buddhanature and it would be like seeing flowers  on an elephant tusk And although you may hear about all the different samiidhis discussed in other sutras if you have not heard this sutra then you will not understand this subtle aspect of the Tathagata just like in the absence of thunder the flowers on the elephant tusks cannot be seen It is only after hearing this sutra that one thereby understands the hidden treasury buddhanature that is expounded by all tathagatas as in the metaphor of seeing flowers on elephant tusks when there is thunder After hearing this sutra one thereupon understands that all living beings possess buddhanature and this is the reason why I expound the MahiiparinirviifJasutra I call it the hidden treasury that is a tathagata extending the dharmakiiyalike flowers on elephant tusks when it thunders By nurturing something of such significance one thus attains what is known as mahiiparinirviifJa If a good man or good woman carefully studies and practices what is in this Subtle Sutra of the GreatNirvana know that this will be a person who repays their debt to the Buddha and is truly a disciple of the Buddha The bodhisattva Kasyapa then addressed the Buddha This is extraordinary WorldHonored One The buddhanature that you speak of is very profound very profound difficult to perceive difficult to enter S ravakas and pratyekabuddhas will be unable to swallow it The Buddha answered Good man j ust so j ust so What you have expressed admiration for does not differ from what I have explained  The bodhisattva Kasyapa then addressed the Buddha WorldHonored One Why is buddhanature so very profound so difficult to perceive so difficult to enter The Buddha answered Good man this is something like a hundred blind men going to a physician in order to have their eyes healed The physician takes a golden scalpel and makes an incision in their retinas He then holds up one finger and asks if they can see it or not but the blind men answer that they are still unable to see anything He then holds up two fingers and then three fingers and until they finally say yes they are able to see slightly Good man this is how it was in the time before this Subtle Sutra of the Great Nirvana had been expounded by the Tathagata Although innumerable bodhisattvas had equipped themselves with the perfections even to the point of reaching the ten stages they were still unable to see that they themselves had the buddhanature Upon the Tathagata expounding it however they will see it immediately if only slightly  But having seen it at all  these bodhisattvamahasattvas will all exclaim This is extraordinary WorldHonored One We have traversed the cycle of birth and death countless times continually confused by nonself Good man thus even bodhisattvas who earn a place among the ten stages may not clearly discern the buddhanature As such how could one expect sravakas and pratyekabuddhas to be able to perceive it Good man this is analogous to a man who looks up at the sky and sees wild geese flying by He may think That was a flock of geese I just saw in the sky but in fact he is unsure of what he was looking at as there were only traces of birds in his gaze In much the same way bodhisattvas who have progressed to the ten stages may perceive and understand only a small portion of this tathagatanature How much harder for a sravaka or pratyekabuddha to be able to discern this Good man it is like an intoxicated man trying to walk down a road that he can barely see in his blurred vision Bodhisattvas at the ten stages who have discerned only a small part of the tathagatanature are in a state like this Good man this is also analogous to a thirsty man crossing a wide field The man  s thirst presses upon him so that he searches everywhere for water He sees a clump of trees and on one of the trees sits a white crane But the man has become so disoriented that he is unable to distinguish between what is a tree and what is water As he is unsure of what he is looking at he will just gaze upon the white crane against the group of trees Good man bodhisattvas at the ten stages who have discerned only a small part of the tathagatanature are in such a state Good man imagine a man adrift in the middle of the ocean hundreds of thousands yea innumerable yojanas  In the distance he sees a large boat a watchtower and a large building At that moment he thinks Ah that watchtower is just an illusion And yet the more I look at it the more certain I am of my feeling that what I see is what I  know to be a watchtower  Bodhisattvas at the ten stages who perceive the tathagatanature within them are in such a state Good man it is like a prince born with a delicate constitution who stays up all night frolicking at a party When the sun comes up he finds that everything he sees has become unclear In much the same way for bodhisattvas at the ten stages although they may see the tathagatanature within themselves they are not very clear about it Good man this is also analogous to someone in a government ministry who is detained because of work for the king and returns home late with the night pressing in upon him Suddenly lightning flashes and he sees a herd of cows At that moment he thinks Were those cows A group of clouds A house perhaps He stares what he saw for some time and realizes that though he has the impression that what he saw were cows it all seems uncertain to him now In much the same way for bodhisattvas at the ten stages  though they may see the tathiigatanature within themselves they remain unable to ascertain precisely what it is Good man it is also like a preceptkeeping bhikyu who looks into water that is free of any insects and yet sees something like the forms of insects in it At that moment he thinks Those things moving in the water are they insects Is it dust After observing the water for a long time although he knows that what he sees is dust he is not completely sure In much the same way bodhisattvas at the ten stages may see the tathiigatanature within themselves but they are not very clear about it In addition good man consider the analogy of someone who looks into the darkness and sees a small child in the distance At that moment he thinks Was that an ox an eagle or a person He observes the darkness for a very long time concluding that although he saw a child he is not completely sure In much the same way bodhisattvas at the ten stages may perceive the tathagatanature within themselves but they are not very clear about it   b In addition good man it is like a man who sees a painted image of a bodhisattva at night in the dark At that moment he thinks This bodhisattva image is it Mahesvara or Mahabrahma or merely a robe made of dyed cloth He gazes at it for some time and while in his mind he is saying that is the image of a bodhisattva in fact he is not completely sure In much the same way bodhisattvas at the ten stages may perceive the tathagatanature within themselves but they are not very clear about it Good man this buddhanature that you possess is thus profound and difficult to discern Only buddhas can understand it of Sravakas and pratyekabuddhas does not encompass it Good man the wise must be discriminating in this way in their understanding of the tathagatanature The bodhisattva Kasyapa then addressed the Buddha saying WorldHonored One as you have explained the buddhanature is subtle and difficult to understand Is it something that can be seen with our physical eyes The Buddha said Kasyapa good man It is like the heaven of neither thought nor nonthought which is also something that those who tread the two paths are unable to understand Understanding comes as a result of having faith in accordance with this sutra In the same way good man sravakas and pratyekabuddhas who believe in what is taught in this MahiiparinirviiIJasutra will thus know of their own tathagatanature by themselves Good man for this reason you should carefully perform and cultivate the practices of this MahiiparinirviiIJasutra Good man buddhanature is thus something only buddhas fully understand of sravakas and pratyekabuddhas does not encompass it The bodhisattva Kasyapa then addressed the Buddha again saying  WorldHonored One Mundane ordinary people regard their nature as a living being to confirm the existence of a self The Buddha said Think about this parable which centers on two people who were close friends One was a prince the other was poor and humble yet the two of them moved around together On one occasion the poor man noticed an impressive sword owned by the prince which was pure and powerfully constructed like no other In his mind the poor man coveted the sword Sometime later the prince had to travel to another country and took the sword with him Meanwhile the poor man while spending the night away from home on one occasion talked in his sleep and kept repeating The sword the sword Someone nearby overheard him grabbed the man and took him to the king Upon seeing him the king asked This sword of which you speak where is it to be found The man answered the king directly explaining what he could and added King even if you were to cut up this body of your humble servant severing my hands and feet in hopes of getting at the sword you would still not find it When this servant was close to your son the prince that was when I did happen to see it but j ust once and I dared not reach out to touch it How could I have taken it The king then asked him When you saw the sword what did it look like He answered Great king what this servant saw was something like a rams horn When the king heard this he broke out in a smile and said As I follow your thinking I see there is nothing to fear for that sword is not in my storehouse How could you have possibly seen such a thing near the prince  l c Then the king turned to his ministers and asked them Have any of you ever seen thi s sword But upon uttering these words the king dropped dead Thereupon another prince succeeded him to the throne and he also asked his staff Tell me if any of you have seen this sword among the treasures in the palace The staff answered We have seen it So he asked What is it shaped like And they answered Great king it looks like a rams horn Then the king said Where in the palace would a sword like that be stored And thus did four kings in succession all search for the sword but to no avail Now some time after the last king had departed the former prince who had left for another country returned to his homeland once again assuming his position as prince and in due time succeeded to the throne as king When he too asked the staff if any of them had seen the sword they answered Great king we have all seen it So he continued What did it look like answered Great king its color is pure like the utpala flower Someone else answered It is shaped like a rams hom and then someone else said Its color is red like a cluster of flames Another chimed in No it looks like a black snake Overcome with laughter the king blurted out None of you have seen what my sword actually looks like Good man bodhisattvamahiisattvas are j ust like this When out in society they expound upon the true characteristics of self but having preached that dhanna they then proceed to abandon it And just like that prince who took his wonderful sword with him when he left for another country the ordinary ignorant person who has been exposed to this teaching will say All things have a self there is a self just like that poor friend of the prince who cried out in his sleep The sword the sword   When sravakas and pratyekabuddhas ask living beings What marks or fonns does the self have that characterize it for what it is they will get such answers as I have seen the fonn of the selfit is the size of a human thumb or It looks like a grain of rice or It is just like a grain of millet And others will say The marks that characterize self reside within the mind where it blazes like the sun Thus living beings do not really know what it is that distinguishes the self much like the palace staff did not know what it was that distinguished the sword When bodhisattvas preach the dhanna concerning the matter of self in such a manner ordinary people will not understand and instead divide things up in various ways to fallaciously create notions about marks characterize the self All this resembles the way in which the queries about what the sword looked like led to the answer that it looked like a rams hom These ordinary people one after another will continue to think in this way in the process producing false views It was in order to cut off false views such as these that the Tathii gata expressed the things he did about nonself In the parable this is why the   told the palace staff That sword is not in my storehouse    Good man the true self that the Tathiigata has been talking about today is what is called the buddhanature In my teachings this buddhanature has been likened to the pure sword  Good man if an ordinary person is able to communicate it well he will be in accord with the highest buddhadhanna But if someone can proclaim it in a detailed way that distinguishes things appropriately know that what you have is someone with the countenance of a bodhisattva Good man whatever different treatises spells verbal utterances and written words there are they are all buddha utterances they do not reflect what is spoken by the proponents of other paths  l a The bodhisattva KiiSyapa said to the Buddha WorldHonored One how is it that the matrix of syllables was uttered by the Tathagata Good man uttering the first half of the syllables or alqaras is what fonns the matrix  providing the support for recorded essays spells and literature  And as for the genuine dharma and all its divisions  ordinary people study this phonetic matrix of syllables so that later they will be able to discern what is dharma and what is not dhanna The bodhisattva Kasyapa then spoke again to the Buddha saying WorldHonored One what is the meaning of the alqaras of which you speak Good man there are fourteen vowel sounds that designate what is meaningful in alqaras The word alqara  itself is called nirvalic because is pennanent and indissoluble  If it is indissoluble then it is indestructible  and indestructible is none other than what the adamantine body of the Tathagata is The fourteen vowel sounds are what I call the basis of syllables or akaras And that which is without corrupting influences is none other than the Tathagata Nothing flows from the Tathagata  s nine orifices thus he is without any corrupting influences Nor does his body even have the nine orifices so for this reason he is free of any corrupting influences To be free from the corrupting influences is to be permanent and permanence is precisely what the Tathagata is The Tathagata is unmade and that is why he is without corrupting influences In addition the sound A is also called virtue  Virtue is precisely the Three Jewels and thus we call it A  A means iiciirya Now what i s meant b y iiciirya I t i s someone who has succeeded in being called a holy one in the world without attachments with few desires someone who has satisfaction That person is also called pure  as they can ferry living beings across the great ocean of sarpsara in and out of which flow the three existences This is what is called holy The sound A is also the practice of discipline  maintaining the pure precepts and comporting oneself in accordance with the world  The letter A also means to depend on holy persons to study comportment stopping starting and rising movements  It is also to worship  respect  and bow down in reverence to the Three Jewels to provide filial care for one  s father and mother and to study the Mahayana good men and good women who maintain the precepts and bodhisattvamahasattvas these are the holy ones  Anyone who is able to obstruct teachings that advocate impropriety is known as a holy person This therefore is what is called the letter A I denotes this  the holy life in the Buddha s dharma that i s extensive  pure  and unstained like the full moon It is in this way that you should do what must be done and refrain from what must not be done As they are able to sustain it these are  called protectors of the dhanna  The autonomous are also called the four worldprotectors  Their autonomy enables them to guard this Mahiiparinirviiasutra J means to be able to proclaim something freely so it can also mean to expound the dhanna for the sake of living beings in a free and autonomous way Moreover since J means autonomy what is it that I have taught It is to cultivate your practice of the wellbalanced scriptures The sound J also means cutting out jealousy just like removing weeds all of which can transform into something auspicious  This therefore is I U is the most exalted  the most supreme  and the most advanced of all sutras  namely the Mahiiparinirviia In addition U indicates the nature of a tathagata  something that sravakas and pratyekabuddhas have yet to hear about If bodhisattvas can manage to hear and accept this sutra then they would become the most eminent among all living beings This is why we say that this sutra is the highest and the best This therefore is the letter U a is like cows milk  the most excellent among all flavors The nature of a tathagata is also like this and this is the most respected and exalted among all sutras If anyone should slander it you should know that that person would be no different from an ox In addition a is called someone without wisdom or without mindfulness  When someone slanders the subtle and secret tathiigatagarbha it should be understood that such a person is in a most regrettable state They are far from the secret tathiigatagarbha when they preach the doctrine of nonself thus they are called a E denotes this  the nirvala of the buddhas that is their natural condition  Thus it is called E The Mahayana sutras are also like this in that they are the last word among all scriptures This is therefore called Au A designates the ability to stop all things impure Within the Buddha s dharma it has the ability to abandon all gold silver and precious stones Ga refers to a womblike repository  and this repository is none other than the hidden treasury that is the tathiigatagarbha All living beings possess buddhanature and that is why this is called Ga Gha is the voice of the Tathagata that is constantly present  To what does the constantly present voice of the Tathagata refer In addition Ka also expresses conformity with the world in displaying the Tathagata having a father mother wife and child Therefore this too is called Ka i L and Lthese four syllables I explain as having four meanings That is buddha dharma and sangha and their opposition  What I call their opposition refers to conformity or acting in accordance with the ways of the world  such as when has Devadatta display his rupture of the sangha or the Buddhas conjuring up various other forms shapes and images in order to set forth the rules of training  But the buddhanature in living beings is not like thisa verbal designation that only later becomes pure  Because its nature is originally pure Although it may be located within the aggregates  sense bases  or sense fields    do not identify it with the aggregates sense bases or sense fields For this reason living beings should all take refuge in the bodhisattvas who by means of their buddhanature look upon living beings without discrimination And for this reason the halfsyllables are the basic units in scriptures treatises and other written works However all the meanings in these half  b syllables are also the basis of speech that is afflicted by the defilements That is why they are called halfsyllables By contrast complete syllables are the basis of all that is good in speech For example someone who does bad deeds in this world might be called a halfperson and someone who cultivates good deeds might be called a complete person In this way the basis of all scriptures and treatises comes from halfsyllables so if someone were to say that the Tathagata and proper liberation were contained in halfsyllables that would be incorrect Because these are things apart from words For this reason in regard to any and all phenomena the Tathagata is unhindered unattached and truly liberated What could be called comprehending the meaning of syllables If one understood that the appearance of the Tathagata in the world could effect the destruction of halfsyllables that I would call comprehending the meaning of syllables But if one only has the meanings that come from following what is expressed with halfsyllables that person would not understand the nature of the Tathagata What would constitute the meaning of no syllables When people familiarize themselves with and practice a dharma that is unwholesome that is what I call  of no syllables A person of no syllables also refers to those who though they familiarize themselves with and practice a dharma that is good nevertheless do not understand what is permanent and impermanent constant and inconstant in the Tathagata They do not understand the two jewels of the dharma and the sangha what is vinaya and what is not vinaya what are sutras and what are not sutras what has been spoken by Mara and what has been spoken by the Buddha If one is incapable of distinguishing such things he would constitute someone who follows and adheres to meanings of no syllables Having now explained of following those meanings that are devoid of syllables entirely I therefore urge you to free yourself from what are halfsyllables and grasp well what lies in complete syllables The bodhisattva Kasyapa then addressed the Buddha saying WorldHonored One We should indeed study carefully the number of syllables For having now encountered the most exalted teacher we have received both encouragement and admonishments from the Tathagata The Buddha praised Kasyapa Excellent excellent To seek the truedharma you must study these things Then the Buddha also imparted this to the bodhisattva Kasyapa Good man the kiicilindi and the cakraviika are two kinds of birds who do things in tandem they are never apart from each other whether moving or stationary In much the same way the dharmas of suffering impermanence and nonself are never apart from each other The bodhisattva Kasyapa said to the Buddha WorldHonored One How can suffering impermanence and nonself be like the cakraviika and the kiicilindi birds The Buddha said Good man There is a dharma that is painful and there is a different dharma that is blissful there is dharma that is permanent and there is a different dharma that is impermanent there is dharma that is self and there is a different dharma that is nonself Just like rice differs from hemp or wheat and wheat is likewise different from beans millet or sugar cane in the same way from a variety of seeds emerge sprouts that will then become leaves and flowers These are all impermanent and yet whenever the fruit ripens people enj oy it and that moment we can call a constant Why Because its nature is true and real Kasyapa then asked the Buddha WorldHonored One If there is a con  c stancy in things like that that would that be the same as of the Tathagata The Buddha answered No good man you should not construe things like that If you were to say the Tathagata is like Mount Sumeru then when the kalpa of destruction comes and Sumeru is destroyed would you have it that the Tathagata is also destroyed in the same way Good man you should not hold that kind of understanding With the exception of nirvala good man among all the dharmas there is not one that is permanent I was only using a worldly figure of speech when I said that the enj oyment of fruit is a constant Kasyapa then asked the Buddha WorldHonored One Excellent excellent Now I see what the Buddha was saying The Buddha told Kasyapa Just so j ust so Good man even those who practice all the samiidhis described in the sutras until they hear this Mahiiparinirviia  everything they say will only pertain to impermanence But when they have heard this sutra even when the defilements are present in them it will seem as if they are gone and they will then be of benefit to all humans and deities Because they will have clearly ascertained the presence of buddhanature within themselves Good man this is also like a mango tree  When its flowers begin to open and scatter that we say is impermanent But when its fruit has ripened it is of great value and that we can say is invariable Good man even those who practice all the samiidhis described in the sutras until they hear this Mahiiparinirviia  everything they say will only pertain to impermanence But when they have heard this sutra even when the defilements are present in them it will seem as if they are gone and they will then be of benefit to all humans and deities Because they will have clearly ascertained the presence of buddhanature within themselves In addition good man this is analogous to what happens when gold ore is melted What had been something with the characteristics of impermanence when melted turns into gold which is of great value and that we can say is invariable Good man even those who practice all the samiidhis described in the sutras until they hear this Mahiiparinirviia  everything they say will only pertain to impermanence But when they have heard this sutra even when the defilements are present in them it will seem as if they are gone and they will then be of benefit to all humans and deities Because they will have clearly ascertained the presence of buddhanature within themselves Good man it is like sesame Before it is pressed it is known as an impermanent  but after pressing it yields oil which is of great value and that we can say is invariable Good man even those who practice all the samiidhis described in the sutras without hearing the Mahiiparinirviia everything they say will only pertain to impennanence But when they have heard this sutra even when the defilements are present in them it will seem as if they are gone and they will then be of benefit to all humans and deities Because they will have clearly ascertained the presence of buddhanature within themselves In addition good man this is analogous to the flow of a multitude of rivers that all return to the sea The samiidhis described  l a in the sutra canon all return to the MahiiparinirviilJasutra of the Mahayana Why is this Because ultimately what I am talking about is the presence of buddhanature Good man this precisely why I say there is a dhanna that is pennanent and there is a different dhanna that is impennanent and so on up to the teaching of nons elf which is also like this The bodhisattva Kasyapa then asked the Buddha WorldHonored One The Tathagata is already free from the poisonous arrow of sorrow Great sorrow is the mark of deities but the Tathagata is not a deity Sorrow is the mark of a human being but the Tathagata is not a human being Sorrow is the mark of the twentyfive fonns of existence in salPsara but the Tathagata is not in any of those twentyfive fonns of existence and therefore the Tathagata has no sorrow Why then do people speak of the Tathagata s sorrow Good man beings in the heaven of nonideation are so called because ideas are not fonned    But if there is no mental process to produce ideas that should mean there is no life force If there is no life force then how could someone have aggregates sense fields and sense bases In that sense one cannot say the life force of a being in the heaven of nonideation resides in any particular place and yet this heaven is real  Good man it is like the tree spirits who reside in trees It cannot be claimed with certainty that they reside in the branches the nodes the stems or the leaves of trees But j ust because their location is not fixed does not mean that we can say they do not exist The life force of a being in the heaven of non ideation is like this Good man the Buddha s dhanna is also like this It is exceedingly profound and difficult to grasp The Tathagata truly has no sorrow or anxiety and he brings forth great compassion for those who are enmeshed in sorrow For he looks upon all living beings as he looks upon his son Rahula In addition good man a life force of a being in the heaven of nonideation can only be truly understood by a buddha the knowledge of all others simply does not extend this far This is also true for the state of neither ideation nor nonideation Kasyapa the nature of the Tathagata is pure and unstained As this is a constructed transformation body where could there be sorrow or anxiety But to say that the Tathagata has no sorrow is to question how he could be capable of benefiting living beings in disseminating the buddhadharma To say the Tathagata has no sorrow is to question how he looks upon living beings as he looks upon Rahula And if someone denied that he looks upon others as Rahula such talk would be false In this sense good man the Buddha is inconceivable the dharma is inconceivable the buddhanature in living beings is inconceivable and the life force of a being in a heaven devoid of ideation is inconceivable The Tathagata has sorrow and he does not have sorrow This is the realm of buddhas and simply cannot be understood by sravakas or pratyekabuddhas Good man this is analogous to the impossibility of a house in all its detail standing in the sky Yet if someone claimed that there could never be any means by which a house could be suspended in midair that would be unfounded It is in this sense that one should not say that a house is standing in the sky or is not standing in the sky Though an ordinary person might claim that a house does stand in the sky in fact the sky is such that in fact nothing resides in it Because its nature offers no support    Good man the mind is j ust like this One cannot say it resides in the aggregates the sense fields or the sense bases nor can one say it does not reside in those places The life of beings in the heaven of nonideation is also like this and the sorrow of the Tathagata is like this as well If the Tathagata had no sorrow then how can it be claimed that he regards living beings as if they were Rahulas If it were claimed that he does have sorrow then why it is said that his nature is the same as the sky Although he conjures up a variety of thingsa palace killing someone and then nurturing him back to health being tied up and escaping obj ects such as gold silver vaidurya jewels a grove of trees or an individual treenone of them are real The Tathagata is like this In conformity with the world he may manifest distress but actually there is no reality in the emotion being displayed Good man the Tathagata has already entered parinirviifJa so how could he have sorrow or anxiety If someone were to say that the Tathagatas entering into nirvala was something impermanent know that it would be that person who would have sorrow If someone were to say that the Tathagata does not enter into nirvala but permanently abides in a way that is immutable know that that person would be without sorrow The Tathagata does worry and does not worry but this is not something that can easily be understood Moreover good man this is analogous to the fact that a lower person is quite familiar with a lower dharma but does not have knowledge of notions of the middle or higher Someone of the middle knows about the middle but does not know about the higher But a higher person understands the higher and the middle and the lower S ravakas and pratyekabuddhas are just like thistheir knowledge is restricted to their own stage of understandingbut the Tathagata is not for he completely understands his own stage as well as the stages of understanding in others He manifests phantom transformations that accord with worldly custom and when ordinary people see this with their physical eyes they presume they are real Yet despite the desire in some to thoroughly understand the unhindered unsurpassed wisdom of the Tathagata this simply will not occur He has anxiety and he does not have anxietyonly a buddha can understand this In the height of s umm er when the waters swell these birds select high plains on which to settle as safe areas to raise their young When that period ends they follow their instincts and move to other areas that give them security The Tathagata s appearance in the world is j ust like this In order to transform innumerable living beings he enables them to reside in the truedharma j ust as the cakraviika and kiicilindi birds choose the high plains as the place to set down their children The Tathagata in like manner enables living beings to accomplish what they need to do and then immediately enters mahiiparinirviilJa Good man with the adage There is a dharma that is suffering and there is a different dharma that is bliss I am alluding to the fact that conditioned phenomena are suffering and that nirvala is bliss This is the most recondite  for it destroys conditioned phenomena The bodhisattva Kasyapa then addressed the Buddha WorldHonored One Why is it that when living beings attain nirvala it is called the greatest bliss   The Buddha said   Sc Good man as I have explained conditioned phenomena as a whole are marked by aging and death Conscientious and attentive Is the place I call the immortal  Inattentive and not conscientious That I call mortal If you are not inattentive Then you can obtain the deathless place In like manner the inattentive Always proceed down a road of death If one is inattentive he is in created dharmas and the created dharmas constitute what is most painful Not to be inattentive thus refers to nirvala nirvala is marked by deathlessness and constitutes what is most pleasurable If one proceeds on the path of conditioned phenomena that I call the place of death where one receives the greatest pain But if one reaches nirvala this I call the place of deathlessness where one receives the greatest pleasure To not be inattentive even if one is involved with conditioned phenomena I would still call that a body that is pennanent blissful deathless and indestructible What is it to be inattentive What is it to be attentive Mundane ordinary people a dhanna I call inattentive and of constant death Supramundane holy people are attentive and have neither aging nor death Why is this Because they have entered the ultimate pennanent bliss that is nirvaQa It is in this sense that I say there is a dhanna that is painful and there is a different dhanna that is blissful there is dhanna that is self and there is a different dhanna that is nonself Like someone here on the ground who sees no traces of birds when looking up at the sky good man living beings who lack divine vision will not see their own tathagatanature existing right there in the midst of their own defilements This is why I have expounded the recondite teachings of nonself What is this about It is about the fact that without divine vision one cannot understand the true self and instead a self is constructed in a way that is inappropriate Anything created that is a product of the defilements is impennanent This is why I have said that there are dhannas that are pennanent and different dhannas that are impennanent He who is steadfast and strong As if standing on a mountaintop Constantly observes ordinary people On the ground and in the wilderness  Having ascended a palace of great wisdom A platfonn of unsurpassed wonder He has removed his own sorrow Yet sees the sorrow in living beings Having completely cut off the defilements in himself however numerous the Tathagata resides on a mountain of wisdom observing living beings who themselves are constantly the defilements hundreds of millions in number The bodhisattva Kasyapa then addressed the Buddha WorldHonored One The meaning of what you have expounded in these verses does not make sense to me Because those who have entered nirvaQa have neither sadness nor happiness How does one attain the ascent to a palace of wisdom Moreover what does it mean to live at the top of a mountain and observe living beings below The Buddha said Good man the palace of wisdom is just another name for nirvaQa He who has no sorrow refers to tathagatas he who has sorrow refers to ordinary people It is because ordinary people have sorrow that they regard tathagatas as not having sorrow The peak of Mount Sumeru refers to proper liberation Making diligent effort is a metaphor for the fact that there are no disturbances on Mount Sumeru The earth refers to conditioned phenomena these ordinary people who are settled on the earth they create these conditioned phenomena The term wisdom is thus a name for right awakening Freed from existence permanently abides and is therefore called tathagata Tathagatas have sympathy for the innumerable living beings that are continuously struck by the poisonous arrows of their various states of existence This is why I referred to the Tathagata as having sorrow The bodhisattva Kasyapa then addressed the Buddha WorldHonored One If a tathagata were to feel sadness then we could not call him a perfectly enlightened one   The Buddha then said t o Kasyapa All things have causes and conditions for coming into exi stence In accordance with the transformations that living beings are bound to go through the Tathagata takes birth and manifests himself among them But though he may undergo birth  in actuality no birth takes place This is why I say the Tathligata is a constantly abiding dharma just like the kiicilindi and cakraviika birds that are always together   IX Chapter Four The Nature of the Tathiigata Part  I n addition good man this situation is somewhat like the moon i n that when there are people who cannot see it it prompts them all to say The moon has sunk and so creates the idea of the moon sinking away In truth the nature of the moon is such that it does not sink away since its visibility shifts in other regions in those locations living beings will be thinking The moon has come out In truth the nature of the moon is that it never comes out either Because it is merely not visible when it is blocked by Mount Sumeru The moon is always in existence its nature is such that there is no coming out or sinking The Tathagata Worthy of Offerings Perfectly Enlightened One is also like this He comes out into the great trichiliocosm on occasion manifesting in Jambudvlpa with a father and mother Living beings all think that the Tathagata came into existence in Jambudvlpa or that the Tathagata has manifested his nirvaQa in Jambudvlpa but in fact there is no nirvaQa in the nature of tathagatas Living beings may all think that truly the Tathagata s parinirviila will be just like when the moon goes away but good man in truth the nature of the Tathagata is without coming into existence or going out of existence It is for the purpose of spiritually transforming living beings that a tathagata shows himself to come into or go out of existence Good man a full moon will manifest as only half full when viewed from another locale and what we see as half full will be seen as a full moon when viewed from another locale When people in Jambudvlpa see the first crescent of the moon they all think they perceive the first day of the month and when the moon is full they think of that as the fifteenth day and have the idea that the moon  s cycle is complete But the nature of the moon is such that it actually neither   b waxes nor wanes the increase or decrease in its size is due to Mount Sumeru Good man the Tathagata in Jambudvlpa is like this he manifests birth he manifests nirvalla and so forth When the infant takes those seven steps it is like the second day in a month  When he manifests himself entering school it is like the third day in a month When he leaves his household  it is like the eighth day in a month When he shines forth the subtle light of wisdom that can destroy the innumerable hordes of maras lurking among living beings it is like a full moon on the fifteenth day of the lunar cycle When he manifests his thirtytwo maj or and eighty minor physical marks adorning himself even while he shows himself to be passing into nirvalla it is like an eclipse of the moon Thus what living beings see is not the same they may see a halfmoon they may see a full moon or they may see a lunar eclipse And yet the nature of the moon is such that despite the appearance of it waxing and waning and going into eclipse in truth it is always fully rounded The body of the Tathagata is just like this That is why I refer to it as permanently abiding and unchanging Good man consider further the metaphor of the full moon in all its manifestations to viewers here and there how it appears in cities towns and villages reflected in water collected between mountains in wells ponds large bowls and water j ars There are living beings that over the course of traveling a hundred yojanas or one hundred thousand yojanas see the moon as constantly following them There are also ordinary ignorant people who having mistaken conceptions of their expenence may say I saw the moon previously when I was in town or when I was in my home They also wonder about the size and shape of the moon changing or if it is really shaped like the opening of a water jar Some say It looks like a big wheel Some say It seems to be fortynine yojanas  Everyone sees the light of the moon but some say what they are seeing is a sphere that looks like a golden disk The moon has only one nature but there are a variety of living beings and each sees something different in it Good man it is much the same with the Tathagata appearing in the world There are some humans and gods who think The Tathagata is present right here in front of me right now And there are those who are naturally unable to hear or unable to speak who perceive the Tathagata as also being unable to hear or unable to speak There are also various groups of living beings each using a different form of speech all of whom think that tathagatas all use the same language as their own And there are individuals who may also think He was present in my house when he accepted my offering There are also living beings that look upon the body of the Tathagata as being immeasurably large just as there are some who see it as extremely small There are some who will see the Buddha in the form of a sravaka and there are some who will see in the form of a pratyekabuddha There are also heretics who each think The Tathagata is present now so that he can become a renunciant to study our dharma And there are also living beings who think The Tathagata has come into the world now only just for me The true nature of the Tathagata may thus be compared to the moon in that his body is a dharma body rather than a body that is born into existence It is a body of expediency that becomes visible in conformity with the world As the result of innumerable causal forces set in motion in the distant past the Buddha thus becomes visible much like the moon does appearing to those who are in this or that locale as if he is being born where they are It is in this sense that I speak of the Tathagata as abiding permanently and immutable Moreover good man it is like the asura king Riihu holding back the moon with his hands which people throughout the world regard as the cause of lunar eclipses But the asura king is incapable of doing anything  that actually affects the moon itself what he does is block its light The moonglobe is not disturbed in any way when this happens it is only because of the moon s obstruction by the hands of the asura that it is rendered invisible When he pulls his hands away throughout the world it is thought that the moon has been restored to life with everyone saying that the moon has undergone considerable pain and suffering But in truth even a hundred thousand asura kings could not cause any trouble for the moon  The Tathagata is j ust like this Some living beings may show up at the Tathagata s location with violent intentions and cause him to bleed committing one of the five heinous crimes reaching the point of bee oming icchantika In a future time they will appear among living beings intent on creating problems attempting to rupture the sangha or cut off the dharma But hundreds of thousands even incalculable numbers of mar as would still be unable to injure the Tathagata s body causing him t o shed blood Why is this Because the body o f a tathagata is not made of flesh and blood sinew and muscle bone and marrow The truth is that there is no injuring the Tathagata Living beings all think the dharma and the sangha will be destroyed and the Tathagata will perish But the nature of a tathagata is truly without change or disintegration It is only in conformity with the world that such things seem evident In addition good man it is like two people sparring with swords or lances who cut each other and draw blood even if the injuries to one of them is so grave as to cause death it would not come from any intention to kill The karmic impact in a case like this would be light rather than heavy  For one who comes to where the Tathagata is with no thoughts of killing even if that person were to cause the Tathagata to bleed the karmic effect would be similarly light rather than heavy In this way the Tathagata has brought forth the doctrine of karmic retribution but only for the purpose of spiritually transforming living beings in the future In addition good man this is like the highly skilled physician who in enthusiastically teaching his son the basic principles of medicine explains These are the medicines made from roots these are the medicines made from stems and these are the colored medicines There is some variety in how each of them looks all of which you must know well Respecting whatever commands his father gave him the son studied diligently and thus gained a clear understanding about the medicines Sometime later when the elder physicians life had run its course and he died his son cried out Father It was you who originally taught me about medicines from roots medicines from stems such as these and medicines from flowers such as these showing me what colors and forms they have The Tathiigata is j ust like this After the Buddhas disappearance I want the bhikus to create an understanding of the profound meaning in this sutra the degree of seriousness in the precepts and the analytic statements about the dharma in the Abhidharma in the same way that the physician  s son  In addition good man it is like the fact that a human knows that a lunar eclipse occurs only once every six months yet gods above see eclipses in the space of an instant Because in the heavens a day is long while for humans it is short l Good man the Tathagata is just the same Gods and humans universally regard the Tathagatas lifetime as short but just like how frequently gods and humans see lunar eclipses lasting but an instant in an instant a Tathagata manifests a myriad nirvfuas in which he has cut off the defilementmara the aggregatemara and the mara of death which is why the hundreds of thousands of millions of maras in heaven all know the Tathagata has entered parinirviifJa and that the revelation of the innumerable hundreds of thousands of previous karmic attainments was in accordance with the variety of natures in the world  These displays are thus innumerable endless and inconceivable In addition good man this is analogous to a bright moon that living beings view with pleasure which is why they call the moon a j oyful sight If living beings are plagued by greed anger or stupidity they will not be inclined to admire the moon and call it a j oyful sight however But nothing is more admired as a j oyful sight than the Tathagata whose nature is invariably good pure and without even a trace of defilement Living beings that take j oy in the dharma look upon him in this way without enmity but those with malicious intent look at him with displeasure It is in this sense that the Tathagata is analogous to a bright moon Good man there is also the analogy of how the length of a day differs during the three seasons of spring summer and winter A winter day is short a spring day is average and a summer day is quite long The Tathagata is also like this in the way within the great trichiliocosm For those whose lifetimes are short and for sravakas he appears to have a short life span Based on what they see they all decry that the lifetime of a Tathagata is brief analogous to a winter day For the bodhisattvas he appears to have a mediumlength life span that may reach one kalpa or something less than one kalpa analogous to a day in spring It is only a buddha who sees the immeasurable length of another buddhas lifetime analogous to a summer day Good man as the recondite teachings of the wellbalanced Mahayana as expounded by the Tathagata are brought forth into the world a great dharma rain will fall upon it In the future if there are people who are able to preserve these texts and analytically show their implications benefiting living beings you should understand those individuals to be true bodhisattvas analogous to sweet rain falling at the height of summer Yet if there are sravakas or pratyekabuddhas present hearing the Tathagatas recondite teachings will feel like a winters day that makes them shiver with cold For those who are bodhisattvas however if they hear recondite teachings and admonitions such as these they will that it is the Tathagata s nature to abide permanently without change as a spring day when buds sprout on the vine In truth the nature of a tathagata is such that there is neither short nor long no time duration of any kind It is for the sake of the world that is manifest in these ways This is in fact the genuine dharmanature of the buddhas In addition good man are like a cluster of stars that do not appear during the day The people all reckon In the daytime the stars disappear but they have not really disappeared The reason they are not visible is because of how sunlight impacts what we see Tathagatas are also like this The sravakas and pratyekabuddhas are unable to see them just like people in this world cannot see stars in the daytime In addition good man this is also analogous to the sun and moon not being visible when the darkness ofa shadow  An ignorant person will say The sun and moon are gone But of course the sun and moon have not really gone anywhere When the truedharma of the Tathagata has completely disappeared the Three Jewels will also appear to be gone But in the same way these things will not be gone forever That is why you must understand that the Tathagata abides permanently and without any change whatsoever How can this be It is because the true nature of the Three Jewels is unstained by any form of defilement  In addition good man it is like a comet that appears at night during the dark half of the month The light of the comet bums for a brief period of time and then disappears Upon seeing this living beings may get the idea that this is a portent of something ominous Pratyekabuddhas react in similar fashion to a world in which no buddhas are present When living beings in general notice this they will say to themselves The Tathagata has truly passed into extinction and become filled with sadness And yet the body of the Tathagata in fact will not have passed into extinction just as the sun or moon are not destroyed when they are not visible  In addition good man one can make an analogy to the disappearance of all traces of fog or mist when the sun appears in the sky This Subtle Sutra of the Great Nirvana will have the same effect as it comes  forth into the world If living beings have the sutra pass through their ears just once they will be able to remove the negative karma accruing from all their transgressions even those that bring immediate retribution in hell The profound realm of this Great Nirvana is inconceivable Skillfully propounding the subtle tathagatanature it is on that basis that good men and good women should constantly abide in the thought that the Tathagata is immutable that the truedharma will never be cut off and that the sangha jewel will never disappear Therefore skillful means should be frequently cultivated and this sutra diligently studied and before long the individual who does so will attain anuttarii samyaksarrzbodhi Therefore I call this sutra the Assemblage of Immeasurable Merit I also call it the Awakening that Cannot be Exhausted And because it is inexhaustible I also call it the MahiiparinirviiIJa As glorious as a summer s day its body is without limit so I call it the Great Nirvana In addition the light from the sun and moon good man are the brightest of all no other sources of light can reach that level  The light of the Great Nirvana is like this for it surpasses the light of samiidhi in other sutras That is the light inherent in the samiidhis of other sutras cannot reach its level  Because the light of the Great Nirvana can enter the pores of living beings Even without the bodhicitta aspiration to awakening living beings are still able to create the causality that leads to awakening That is another reason why it is called the MahiiparinirviiIJa    c The bodhisattva Kasyapa then addressed the Buddha WorldHonored One The Buddha has explained that the light of this MahiiparinirviiIJasutra enters the pores of all living beings and that even without the aspiration to awakening a living being can still create the causality that leads to awakening But this does not make sense WorldHonored One if this light entered the bodies of those who commit one of the four grave offenses the bodies of those who commit one of the five heinous crimes or the bodies of the icchantikas and created a causality that brings awakening  then what would there be to distinguish these groups from those who have been pure in observing the precepts and have been cultivating practices that are morally wholesome If there are no distinctions among these groups then why does the Tathagata preach the importance of individuals the four refuges  WorldHonored One The Buddha has also said that if living beings heard just this one sutra the Mahiiparinirviia they would then be able to remove the defilements within themselves Then why did the Tathagata say previously that even if people brought forth personal aspirations before buddhas present in numbers as many as the grains of sand in the Ganges River and then heard the Mahiiparinirviia  they may still not comprehend its meaning If people do not understand the sutra s meaning then how can they eliminate all their defilements The Buddha said Good man with the exception of the icchantikas after having heard this sutra all living beings will be able to create the causal conditions needed for enlightenment When the sound and the light of the dharma enter a person  s pores that person will without fail attain anuttarii samyaksaTJIbodhi How does this happen If someone were to honor the innumerable buddhas with offerings he would thereby be able to hear the Mahiiparinirviiasutra But those whose religious merit is slight will thus be unable to hear it What is the reason for this It is because a virtuous person is capable of hearing a matter of such great significance but a vulgar or petty person is not able to hear it  And what is this matter of great significance It is the profound hidden treasury of which the buddhas speak what I refer to as buddhanature This is the meaning of this teaching and this is why I refer to it as a matter of great significance The bodhisattva Kasyapa then addressed the Buddha WorldHonored One How can those who have not brought forth the bodhicitta resolution obtain that which can serve as a cause for awakening The Buddha told Kasyapa If after having hearing this MahiiparinirviiIJasutra a person declares I have no need to commit to any aspiration to bodhi and denigrates the truedharma he will have a dream in which he encounters a riiasa demon He will be gripped with fear for the riiasa will say to him Hey good man  If you do not put forth your bodhicitta right now I will take your life   He will awaken in morbid fear and immediately resolve to attain bodhi When his life ends he may be reborn in one of the three unfortunate realms or as a human or as a deity but wherever he ends up he will continue to recall his bodhicitta resolution You should thus understand that at that point this person is a bodhisattvamahasattva Thus is the spiritual majesty of this MahiiparinirviiIJa  it can move those who have never brought forth bodhicitta to create causes that can bring about awakening Good man this is what I call the causality that produces bodhicitta You may also think of this good man like rain that pours down from a great cloud covering the sky bringing water to the earth dried trees rocky cliffs high plains and earthen mounds The water does not remain  l a where it falls but flows downward pouring into fields below filling reservoirs and benefiting innumerable living beings Thus it is with this Subtle Sutra of the Great Nirvana It rains down the dharma rain universally moistening living beings The only exception is the fact that it is not reasonable to expect icchantikas to produce the bodhicitta aspiration In addition good man is like a charred seed  Even if exposed to sweet rain for a billion kalpas in the end that seed will not germinate Those grouped as icchantikas are j ust like this Even if they hear this Subtle Sutra of the Great Nirvana in the end they will not be capable of producing anything that would germinate into bodhicitta And if they did manage to produce that aspiration it would be contrary to reason Because these people have cut off all their wholesome karmic roots and like charred seeds they are incapable of producing roots that could germinate into bodhi Good man this situation is also analogous to a mQi jewel   If placed in murky water its radiant power would make the water clear but if thrown into mud it would not have the same effect This Subtle Sutra of the Great Nirvana is also like this Placed amid the murky waters of the five iinantarya transgressions that bring immediate retribution or the four grave offenses committed by living beings it would have the effect of purifying the thoughts of such individuals to where they would aspire to awakening But when thrown into the muddy of icchantikas even after a billion years it would not be able to purify their thoughts to the point at which they would resolve to attain awakening Because icchantikas have destroyed their good karmic roots and as such they are not vessels  Even if they listened to this MahiiparinirviiIJasutra over the course of a billion years in the end they would still be incapable of producing bodhicitta within themselves Because icchantikas lack any of the meritorious states of mind  Good man another analogy is the medicinal tree called the medicine king so called because it produces the most excellent of all medicines Normally it is mixed with whey or honey or perilla or water or milk and then rolled into the form of a stick or a round ball Then it is smeared on a wound or used to smoke the body or rubbed on the eyes It may be seen or it may be smelled but one way or another it can eliminate any and all illnesses contracted by living beings Now this medicinal tree does not think If they take my leaves they should never take my roots If they take my wood they should never take my bark If they take my bark they should never take my wood This tree despite not having such thoughts effectively eliminates any disorder or ailment   Good man this Subtle Sutra of the Great Nirvana is also like this It can eliminate the negative karma accrued by any living being including the four piiriijika offenses and the five transgressions that bring immediate retribution regardless of whether the transgression was generated internally or externally It can be why those who have never formed the bodhicitta resolution thereupon do j ust that Because this subtle scripture is the king among sutras j ust like that medicinal tree is the king among medicines People who cultivate the Mahiiparinirviiaand even those who do notwill be struck when they hear that there is a sutra with this name Upon hearing it they will trust   b in it and find that all the serious ills stemming from their defilements will disappear With the exception of icchantikas whom it cannot impact this sutra will bring to abide in anuttarii samyaksarrzbodhi And just like the wondrous medicine  although capable of healing a wide variety of serious illnesses it is nevertheless ineffective for someone fated to die   In addition good man consider someone who has inj ured his hand Ifhe applies strong poisonous medicine such as scorpions tail directly to the wound the poison will penetrate into him But if he had no wound the poison could not seep inside him lcchantikas are like this Having no cause that could lead to liberation is like having no wound no strong poisonous medicine can enter them By the word wound I am referring to those causal conditions that lead one to unsurpassed enlightenment and by the word poison I am denoting the preeminently superb medicine  Those who are completely without wounds are what we call icchantikas   In addition good man consider the metaphor of a diamond that cannot be broken yet is capable of breaking all other things with the exception of tortoise shells and the horns of white rams This Subtle Sutra of the Great Nirvana is just like that for it is capable of establishing countless living beings on the path to enlightenment It is only the icchantikas whom it cannot move to produce any cause that would lead to awakening In addition good man this situation is like the purslane plant the salakf tree and the karikiira tree even if you cut off their branches and stalks they will continue to grow The tiila tree on the other hand is not like this it will not grow back after being cut down   Living beings are also like this If they manage to hear this Mahiiparinirviiasutra then even if they have committed one of the four piiriijika or five transgressions that produce immediate retribution they would still be able to generate causal conditions that produce bodhi But icchantikas are different Even if they hear and accept this subtle scripture they will still be incapable of generating causes that could bring them to the path leading to bodhi Good man icchantikas are somewhat like khadira or tinduka trees which do not regenerate after they are cut down just as charred seeds     Even when they do hear this MahiiparinirvalJasiltra will remain unable to produce the causal conditions that would lead to bodhi like charred seeds In addition good man it is like a great rain that after falling no longer remains in the sky This Subtle Sutra of the Great Nirvana is also like that The dharma rain falls universally but it does not remain with icchantikas An icchantika has a stiff body that is wound up very tight it is like a diamond in that nothing can penetrate it The bodhisattva Kasyapa then addressed the Buddha saying WorldHonored One you once uttered this verse Not seeing what is good  they will not do it Only seeing what is bad  this they may do On that basis one should be afraid As if on a dangerously steep path WorldHonored One would you explain what it was you were saying there The Buddha said Good man not seeing refers to not seeing the buddhanature What is good is anuttara samyaksabodhi itself To say they will not do it refers to being unable to approach a good friend who can guide him spiritually Only seeing refers to seeing without good reason The word bad here refers to their repudiation of the wellbalanced Mahayana sutras And this they may do refers to the fact that icchantikas do say there are no wellbalanced  The meaning of the verse is simply that icchantikas do not think in a way that  advances them toward the pure and good dharma What is the pure and good dharma It is nirvaQa itself To advance toward nirvaQa refers to the capacity to cultivate practices that are wise and good yet icchantikas have no practices that are wise and good This is why they are incapable of progressing toward nirvliQa On that basis one should be afraid refers to repudiating the truedharma Who should be frightened I am talking about those who are said to be wise Because anyone who denigrates the dharma has neither good thoughts nor skillful means The dangerously steep path refers to the composite things of the world  Kasyapa once again asked And what is the meaning of this verse also spoken by the Buddha  How to see what has been done How to obtain a good dharma On what basis is one not afraid As if on a kings level path What is this referring to The Buddha said Good man this allusion to how to see what has been done refers to coming forward with the harmful things  Every bad deed you have done from your birth until your death should be confessed until there is nothing left to speak of This is how you find the basis without fear The path metaphor refers to the righteous path walked by people and kings from which all bandits flee By confessing all your transgressions in this way without exception your fears will completely disappear In addition one may also speak of not seeing what has been done in reference to the fact that icchantikas do not admit to themselves the host of bad things they have done Because the icchantikas are arrogant even though they often do things that are harmful while doing them they initially have no sense of fear This is why icchantikas are unable to attain nirvfua they are like monkeys grabbing at the moon in the water Good man if all living beings however innumerable were to all at once attain anuttarii samyaksafbodhi the tathagatas would still not see the icchantikas attaining bodhi This is also the meaning of what I have called not seeing what has been done In addition the actions of whom else are not seen I am referring to not noticing what has been done by the tathagatas The Buddha has expounded the existence of buddhanature for the benefit of living beings but icchantikas transmigrate through sarpsara unable to discern what this is It is in this sense that I used the phrase not noticing what has been done by the tathagatas Icchantikas will also look at the complete nirvaIa of the Tathagata and say to themselves This truly shows impermanence nothing more than a lamp going out when its oil is extinguished Why are they like this Because their bad behavior does not distress them When bodhisattvas are present doing good deeds whose merit they tum over toward the goal of attaining anuttarii samyaksafbodhi even as the icchantikasbeing devoid of faith themselvesrevile those bodhisattvas and seek to ruin their efforts they find that bodhisattvas respond by offering to the icchantikas wanting to accomplish the path of excellence together with them Because the reality of the Buddhas dharma is naturally like this When something bad is done one does not feel immediately It is like fresh milk that curdles  Or like ashes covering a fire On which the fool blithely treads The icchantikas may be called blind For this reason they do not see the path of the arhat Similarly arhats do not course through the harsher paths in sarpsara and by means of their own blindness they malign the wellbalanced and do not want to practice what it is them In the same way that arhats approach the cultivation of compassion icchantikas are similarly not interested in practicing what is in the wellbalanced   Now you may hear someone speak like this I no longer bel ieve in the sravaka scriptures I bel ieve in the Mahayana  which I read recite and interpret For this reason I am now a bodhisattva All living beings have buddhanature and by dint of having this buddhanature their bodies contain the thirtytwo maj or and eighty minor physical marks  What I say is no different from what the Buddha says Now you and I together can destroy the innumerable evil defilements as easily as smashing a water j ar And by destroying those entanglements will behold the liberation of anuttarii samyaksafbodhi People like this despite such elocution do not truly believe in the existence of buddhanature and speak in this elaborate way only for personal gain Anyone who speaks like this I call a harmful person But harmful people like this do not feel the karmic effects quickly like milk curdling  Consider the analogy of an imperial envoy with expertise in diplomacy and who is skilled in using expedient means When in another country on a mission he knows it would be better to lose his life than do anything that would prevent the king  s message from reaching its destination Wise people are also like this for they do not begrudge their own lives among ordinary people to fulfill the imperative to disseminate what they know about the tathagata hidden treasury as extolled in the Mahayana wellbalanced namely that all living beings possess buddhanature Good man there are icchantikas who take on the persona of an arhat residing in desolate areas and disparaging the wellbalanced Mahayana scriptures Ordinary people who see someone like this will typically remark There goes a true arhat a great bodhisattvamahasattva  But these icchantikas are unsavory bhikus who live in the forest yet violate the dharma of forest life When seeing what is provided for others for example they become jealous They say things like All the wellbalanced Mahayana scriptures are nothing but the preaching of Mara Papiyas and also claim that tathagatas are impermanent dharmas They seek to destroy the truedhanna and break up the sangha These statements reflect the kind of thing that a Paplyas would say not a person of humility The dissemination of such fabrications reflects a deleterious contrary dharma These are people who do bad deeds but do not feel retribution immediately like fresh milk that curdles  or like ashes covering a fire on which fools blithely tread Someone like this I regard as an icchantika Therefore you should understand that the Mahayana wellbalanced scriptures are decidedly pure When thrown into murky water a mali jewel will cause the water to become clearthe Mahayana scriptures are also like this Good man consider the analogy of a lotus flower it cannot but open when it is bathed in sunlight All living beings are also like this anyone who had not previously produced the bodhicitta will do so when they perceive the sun that is the Mahiiparinirviia and this then indeed becomes the cause leading to their liberation That is why I have expounded the of the light of the Mahiiparinirviia that enters one  s pores and then without fail becomes the wondrous cause for  For those who are icchantikas although they possess buddhanature they are held down by the stain of their innumerable transgressions unable to get free like silkworms inside of cocoons Because of their karmic conditions they cannot produce a cause that would lead to bodhi and instead transmigrate through sarpsara with no end in sight In addition good man consider the fact that the blue lotus flower  the yellow lotus flower  the red lotus flower  and the white lotus flower all grow in mud yet in their final flowering they are untainted by that mud Living beings that cultivate this Subtle Sutra of the Great Nirvana are also like this despite the presence of the defilements in them in the end they are untainted by those defilements Why is this Because they understand the power in the nature and the form of the Tathagata Good man it is like a nation in which a pure cool wind frequently blows When that wind touches the skin of living beings it completely removes their burning distress This Mahayana scripture the Great Nirvana Sutra is like  that universally entering the pores of living beings and creating the subtle yet marvelous causes and conditions for liberation Except for the icchantikas In addition good man consider an excellent physician so skilled in all eight technical disciplines of he aling  that he is able to eradicate all forms of illness with the exception of those that inevitably bring death Thus are the entirety of the sutras meditations and samiidhis capable of curing all the ills the defilements of greed anger and stupidity They can pull out the poisoned needles and arrows of those defilements but they cannot cure someone of the effects of committing one of the four grave offenses or five heinous crimes Good man there are also physicians whose medical skills surpass the eight technical disciplines of healing and are thus capable of removing whatever pain or infirmity may strike living beings but even they cannot cure an illness that brings certain death This MahiiparinirviilJa Mahiiyiinasutra is just like in removing all the defilements that affect living beings bringing them to peacefully dwell within a pure wondrous causality a tathagata and enabling those who have yet to make their bodhicitta resolution to finally do so But it cannot do anything for an icchantika who faces certain death  In addition good man consider the analogy of an excellent physician possessing wonderful medicine that can cure those who have lost their sight He can enable them to see the light of the sun the moon the stars and the constellations to see a myriad of different colors and shapes Yet he does not have the ability to cure someone who is born blind This Mahayana scripture the Great Nirvana Sutra is like that capable of making sravakas and pratyekabuddhas open their eyes of wisdom enabling them to peacefully dwell within the innumerable endless stream of Mahayana scriptures It has the power to take anyone who has not aspired   c to liberation and enable that person to do so including someone who has violated one of the four grave offenses or committed one of the five heinous crimes But having been born blind the icchantikas are excluded In order to cure living beings of every pain or infirmity the physician applies a variety of different treatments For vomiting for example medicines may be smeared on the body inhaled or used to irrigate the nasal passage Some medicines are made in powdered form or rolled into pills But if the patient is poor and ignorant and does not want the treatment then the skilled physician out of pity may decide to take that person back to his home and force him to take the treatment Similarly if the placenta is not delivered when a woman gives birth a doctor administers treatment to make the placenta come out He may also calm the baby relieving it of any distress This Mahayana scripture the Great Nirvana Sutra is also like that in that it will reach anywhere even into a person  s home to take away the defilements that afflict living beings Even for those who have committed one the four grave offenses or five heinous crimes or who have not resolved to attain liberation it can nevertheless enable them to bring forth that resolution But this excludes icchantikas The bodhisattva Kasyapa then addressed the Buddha saying WorldHonored One Someone who commits one of the four grave offenses or five heinous crimes is known to be seriously depraved analogous to cutting off the top of a palmyra tree that will not grow back By themselves people like this would never make a resolution for awakening so what can be done to create the causality that would bring bodhi to them The Buddha explained When I was still in the womb he treated my mother with medicine to calm her and thanks to that she had an easy time of it Because of those conditions within her my life in the womb was completed without incident It is a miracle realy that my mother went through so much agony for a ful ten months while carrying me to term After I was bom she dried me off wiping off the moisture  and removing my impure urine and feces She fed me with her milk raised me and protected me This is why I wil repay her kindness by caring for her with sensitivity protecting her honoring her and complying with her wishes When a man who has committed the four grave offenses or five heinous crimes faces the end of his life he fix his concentration on this Mahayana Great Nirvana Sutra for no matter if he is rebom in the realms of hel among animals in the realm of hungry ghosts with the gods in the heavens or as a human being a sutra such as this wil empower him to create the causes needed for liberation But this excludes icchantikas In addition good man consider the analogy of an excelent physician and his son who was also an excelent physician They possessed a depth of knowledge exceeding that of other physicians including detailed knowledge of the best incantations to use in eliminating poisons Whether confronted with a dangerously poisonous snake a serpent demon or a pit viper they had a medicine they enchanted with their ritual incantations making it more effective They painted this a medicine on leather shoes and whenever those shoes came into contact with poisonous insects their poison would disappear But there was one exception namely the poison of what was caled the great serpent This Mahayana scripture the Great Nirvana Sutra also functions like this If there are living beings that have committed one of the four serious offenses or five heinous crimes can wipe away al their karmic issues enabling these individuals to dwel in the liberation of bodhi Just like the medicinal shoes that were able to eliminate the various forms of poison can move someone who had not previously aspired to liberation to endeavor to do so thereby enabling that individual to calmly settle in the path to bodhi This is possible because of the efficacious medicine that is this Mahayana Great Nirvana Sutra which empowers living beings to produce serene bliss within themselves The only exception would be the great serpent icchantikas Good man imagine a man who painted a great drum with a medicine made up of a mixture of poisons When he pounded that drum in a crowd even those with no inclination to listen would nevertheless hear it and all who did would die But there would be one exception a person who did not die unexpectedly from this This Mahayana scripture the Great Nirvana Sutra is like that It produces an audible sound everywhere and those living beings that do hear it will find their greed anger and stupidity completely destroyed Among them there will even be some who do not otherwise think about these things yet will notice that the causal power of the Great Nirvana has destroyed their defilements and their fetters have disappeared by themselves And when it comes to those who have transgressed by committing one of the four serious offenses or five heinous crimes upon hearing the sutra they too will create the causal conditions that lead to the highest bodhi gradually losing their defilements But this will not apply to icchantikas who is excluded from those who will not experience such an unexpected death Good man this is analogous to nighttime when all activities come to a halt Anyone who is not finished with something has to wait until the next day for the sunlight For those who study the Mahayana though they have cultivated all the samiidhis in the sutras they still have to wait for the sunlight that is the Mahayana Great Nirvana  Only after hearing this recondite teaching of the Tathagata will they undertake the actions of bodhi and settle themselves in the truedharma As rain from the heavens moistens and grows all seeds realizing their fruit that thoroughly eliminates hunger and brings wealth and happiness the immeasurable dharma rain that is the tathagata hidden treasury in like manner is capable of removing the eight types of fever   The many benefits accruing from the fruit realized when this sutra appears in the world means peace and j oy for all enabling living beings to see their buddhanature just as the eightthousand sravakas were able to realize the fruit of their received predictions in the Flower of the Dharma    In the fall one harvests and in the winter one stores as nothing more is produced at that time The icchantikas also feel they are in such a time for in regard to such wholesome dharmas for them there is nothing to be done In addition good man consider the analogy of an excellent physician who perceived that someone  s son had been possessed by something nonhuman Immediately he selected a special medicinal herb and sent it off with a messenger to whom he gave this instruction Take this medicine and quickly give it to that person If he has run into evil demons then by the power of the medicine the demons will all leave him If you think you might late then I b will go myself Whatever happens do not let him bend over and die prematurely If that ill person is able to see the authority held by a messenger or myself his suffering will be alleviated and he will obtain serenity and j oy This Mahayana scripture the Mahiiparinirvilzasutra is just like this If there are monks nuns laymen or laywomen or even nonBuddhists who effectively accept and embrace a sutra like this recite it and become thoroughly acquainted with it then analyze and explain it in detail to others write it down themselves or enable others to write it down these activities all become causes that lead to awakening Even if someone has committed one of the four grave offenses or five heinous crimes even for someone who has been seized by the poisonous venom of evil spirits to hear this sutra is to have all dangers disappear like the harmful spirit who departed upon seeing the skilled physician Understand that one is a true bodhisattvamahasattva Because being able to hear the Great Nirvana over a period of time means thinking about the Tathagata s permanence as well And because being able to hear the Great Nirvana over a period of time also means this how much more so if someone copies it embraces it or recites it Excluding the icchantikas all others would be bodhisattvamahasattvas Next good man consider those people born without the ability to hear sound The icchantikas are like this Even if they wanted to hear this sublime sutra they would be unable to do so The reason is that they are devoid of the karmic conditions to make this possible Now consider good man the example of an excellent physician for whom there were no illnesses beyond the efficacy of his treatments and who also had extensive knowledge of innumerable ritual incantations This physician examined the king and told him Great King the condition you have now is inevitably fatal The king answered But my good man you have not seen what is inside my belly How can you say for certain that I will die from this illness The physician answered If I you do not believe me then the king should take a laxative and purge everything from inside he can then examine the contents himself But the king did not comply with the suggestion and so did not take the recommended medicine At that point the physician used the power of incantations to create an ulcer around the king  s anus and from its pustules flowed a mixture of small worms and blood When the king saw this he became both frightened and embarrassed He then turned and praised the physician saying Excellent excellent My good man I did not utilize what you had previously told me But now I understand that what you have done for thi s body of mine is of great benefit he honored that physician with reverence just as he honored his own father and mother This Mahayana scripture the Great Nirvana Sutra is just like this Living beings may be plagued by desires or not but in either case the sutra has the power to make the defilements in their lives collapse and melt away Even to the point that if they see the sutra in their dreams they should still honor it with reverence as in the analogy of the king who honored the physician At the same time the physician knew the king  s illness was fatal and that he would not be able to cure him This Mahayana Great Nirvana Sutra is also like that for in the end it cannot cure icchantikas To restate good man analogous to a skilled physician who is so competent in all eight technical disciplines of healing that he can cure all forms of illness except that he cannot heal those who face certain death buddhas and bodhisattvas in like manner are able to provide subtle treatment for  all who have transgressed except that they cannot heal the icchantikas who likewise face certain death In addition good man consider the skilled physician thoroughly familiar with the eight technical disciplines of healing from careful study of the classic texts and who also has broad knowledge beyond those eight ways of healing His first priority is to teach everything he knows to his son helping the son understand what there is to know about medicinal plants that grow in water and on land on mountains and in streams In this way he gradually teaches him the eight disciplines and the other advanced healing techniques as well The Tathagata Worthy of Offerings Perfectly Enlightened One is just like this His first priority is to teach his childrenthe monks and other followersthe expedient means by which they can eliminate all the defilements and cultivate practices that purify their bodies of notions that are fragile or unsteady When I speak of water land mountains and streams water is a metaphor for the body being subj ect to pain and suffering like bubbles on the surface of water land is a metaphor for the body not being solid like the trunk of a banana tree and the image of mountains and streams is a metaphor for cultivating the notion of nonself from within the defilements This i s what I mean when I refer to the body as nonself   To his disciples the Tathagata teaches in succession the ninefold canon of scriptures so that they may become thoroughly familiar with that dharma It is only after this that he teaches the hidden treasury that is the tathiigatagarbha expounding the Tathagata s permanence for his disciples The Tathagata expounds the Mahayana scripture the Great Nirvana Sutra in this way for those who have already made their resolution for awakening as well as for those who have not thereby creating a karmic cause for bodhi in both with exception of the icchantikas Thus good man this Mahayana scripture the Great Nirvana Sutra is immeasurably innumerably and inconceivably rare You should understand it to be the most skilled of all skilled physicians foremost and superior the king among sutras In addition good man consider the analogy of a great ship that sails across the sea from this shore to that shore and then returns from that shore to this one The Tathagata Worthy of Offerings Perfectly Enlightened One is also like this He rides on the jeweled ship that is Mahiiparinirviia Mahiiyiina  going round and round back and forth delivering living beings Wherever there is anyone who should cross he enables that person to see the Tathagata s body It is in this sense that the Tathiigata is called the supreme pilot That is whenever there is a ship there should be a pilot and it is precisely because there is a pilot that the ferrying of living beings across the ocean of satpsara can be accomplished  The Tathagata s constant presence spiritually transforms living beings in this manner In addition good man consider the analogy of someone who boards a boat in the middle of the ocean hoping to be brought across it If there is a favorable wind it will not take long for him to cross over innumerable yojanas But if not then even if he resides in that boat for a long time even innumerable years he will not move from that original spot At some point the boat will disintegrate sinking into the water and he will die In this way living beings board ships coursing on the sea of birth and death delusion If they happen to encounter the powerful wind created by the Mahiiparinirviia then rather quickly will they be able to reach the shore of the supreme path If they do not encounter it they will continue transmigrating in satpsara for a considerable amount o f time and at some point things will disintegrate and they will fall into the realms of hell animals or hungry ghosts In addition good man consider the analogy if people did not encounter a wind king and had to remain at sea for a long time they would think We are going to die right here and now But if just as those thoughts occurred to them they did encounter a favorable wind they would follow it and make it across the ocean At that point they would say How wonderful  How extraordinary this wind enabling people like us to sail across this sea of difficulties in peace and safety Thus do living beings dwell in the delusory sea of satpsiira for a very long period of time Exhausted from hardship not coming into contact with a wind like this Great Nirvana they naturally think We are certain to fall into the realms of hell animals or hungry ghosts But it is precisely when they are thinking this way that they may suddenly  encounter the wind of the Mahayana Great Nirvana And by following it they would be blown into anuttara samyaksafbodhi In addition good man this is also like a snake that sheds its skin Now does that mean the snake is going to die Good man the Tathagata also expediently manifests the relinquishment of a poisonous body Would you say The Tathagata is impermanent and will disappear N o  WorldHonored One I n this world of Jambudvlpa the Tathagata expediently relinquishes his body just as a poisonous snake relinquishes its old skin This is why it is known that the Tathagata is a constantly abiding presence   In addition good man like a goldsmith who obtains fine gold that he then fashions into a variety of implements by using his imagination the Tathagata similarly manifests various material bodies among the twentyfive forms of existence for the purpose of spiritually transforming living beings so they can extract themselves from sarpsara This is why I say the Tathagata has what I call a boundless body and why despite the fact that he reveals himself in different bodies I also speak of the Tathagata as permanently abiding without change In addition good man this is also somewhat like the amra mango tree andjambu or rose apple tree    Within one year these trees change three times At one time they produce flowers with an effulgent luster At another time they produce leaves that grow thick and luxuriant And at a third time everything withers and dries out and the trees look like they are dying Good man what do you think Are these trees actually decaying or not No WorldHonored One Good man the Tathagata similarly displays three different bodies in the triple world There is a time for his birth there is a time for his adulthood and there is a time for his nirvfua Yet despite what these changes suggest  in truth the body of the Tathagata is not impermanent The bodhisattva Kasyapa praised these words saying Excellent That is truly a sacred teaching the Tathagata abides permanently without change Good man the recondite language of the Tathagata is profound and difficult to understand   It is analogous to what happens when a great king tells his retinue to bring him saindhava    The one word saindhava  refers to four different products  salt a drinking cup water or a horse Since the same word is used to designate four different things only the wise attendant understands what the king means when he calls for it If the king seeks saindhava when he is bathing he is to be given water If the king is eating and asks for saindhava then he is to be given salt If the king asks for saindhava when he has finished a meal and wants to drink alcohol then he is to be given something to drink with And if the king requests saindhava when he wants to travel then he is to be given a horse  In this way the wise attendants are able to decipher the four ways this abstruse word is used by the king In much the same way the Mahayana sutras have four notions of impermanence Wise attendants of the Mahayana should clearly understand what is meant  If the Buddha is in the world lecturing on the Tathagata s nirvfua to living beings a wise attendant would  understand this to be a case where for those who conceive of him as permanent the Tathagata expounds the characteristics of impermanence because he wants to have those bhikus cultivate their discernment of impermanence Or when he says The truedharma will disappear a wise attendant should understand this to be a case where for those who conceive of him as bliss the Tathagata expounds the characteristics of suffering because he wants to have those bhikus spend more time cultivating their discernment of suffering Or when he says I am suffering from illness now or The monastic communities are breaking up a wise attendant would understand this to be a case where for those who conceive of him as self the Tathagata expounds the characteristics of nonself because he wants to make the bhikus cultivate their discernment of nonself Or when he says The emptiness that I speak of is trueliberation a wise attendant would understand this to be a case where the Tathagata is saying that the twentyfive forms of existence are not found in true liberation because he wants to make the bhikus cultivate their discernment of emptiness This is why I speak of true liberation as empty and also as immovable The term immovable refers to the fact that within liberation there is no suffering and therefore cannot be moved True liberation is without any distinguishing marks or signs that can be perceived To say there are no distinguishing marks means there is no form sound smell taste touch and so forth that is why I also call it signless True liberation is permanent and immutable it is devoid of anything impermanent distressing or mutable For this reason I refer to liberation as permanent immutable cool and refreshing Or when preaches that all living beings have the tathagatanature the wise attendant would understand this to be a case where the Tathagata is expounding a dharma of permanence and he wants to make the bhiksus cultivate their discernment of this dharma that is genuinely permanent Know that any bhikus who are able to follow and study this are truly my disciples for they clearly understand the tathagata hidden treasury just like the wise attendants of a great king are thoroughly familiar with his intentions Good man if a kings dharma includes such enigmatic language why would the Tathagata s not be so Good man this is precisely why the recondite teachings of the Tathagata are difficult to fathom Only a person of wisdom will have the power to discern my profound buddhadharma it cannot be believed by worldly ordinary types of people   c In addition good man consider the fact that when the palasa tree the karikara tree or the aSoka tree experience drought none of them will bloom Indeed all other plants that grow on earth or in water will also dry up for there can be no growth if there is no moisture All medicines would also lack strength Good man this Mahayana Mahiiparinirvasutra is also like that After I disappear there will be living beings incapable of honoring it who will see it as devoid of any spiritual power Why will this come to pass Because they will not understand the recondite treasury that is the tathagatagarbha And why will they not understand Because their merit will be weak At that time there will be many bhius whose behavior is noxious They will not understand the recondite treasury containing a tathagata Lazy and unmotivated they will be incapable of reciting proclaiming or analyzing the Tathagata s truedharma It is like a foolish thief who throws away jewels only to walk away with the chaff of straw This harsh future world how frightening how painful it will be  Living beings will not make efforts to hear this Mahayana scripture the Great Nirvana Sutra Only bodhisattvamahasattvas will be able to grasp the true meaning in this sutra without being attached to its words In their preaching to other living beings they will accord with it rather than resist it In addition good man this is somewhat like a female cowherd who in coveting greater profit from selling milk adds water to double her supply She then sells it to other cowherd women who upon acquiring the milk add water to double the supply yet again They in tum sell it to women in a nearby town who also add water to double it These townfolk in tum sell it to other women in the town who upon acquiring it yet again add water to double its volume before they bring it to The Nirvana Sutfa Volume I the marketplace to sell At this time there was a man who has just taken a wife in order to have children Requiring quality milk to serve guests that she would be entertaining the new wife ventured into the marketplace hoping to buy some There she found numerous milk sellers seeking a plurality of prices  She responded to them by saying Your milk is full of water and not worthy of your price But I have to entertain guests presently so I will have to take it After acquiring the milk she returned home where she boiled it to make porridge producing a dish without a trace of milk flavor But although no one could taste in her dish it was still a thousand times better than the bitter flavors  Because the flavor of milk is that much superior to other flavors Good man after my nirvflm it will be more than eighty years before the truedharma disappears During that time this sutra will spread widely throughout Jambudvfpa But during that time there will also be harmful bhius who will simplify this sutra and divide it up into any number of parts They will succeed in destroying the sight smell and beautiful flavors of its truedharma Although these harmful people may read and recite a scripture like this one they will forsake the Tathagata s deeper core meanings and instead establish it as a worldly work adorned with flowery rhetoric and devoid of any real significance shrinking a former part and enhancing a latter part or shrinking a latter part and enhancing a former part  a Understand that harmful bhius like this are colleagues of Mara They condone keeping all manner of things that are impure all the while saying The Tathagata has given me complete permission to store these things Like cowherds adding water to milk these awful bhius will corrupt this sutra by mixing worldly language into it making it impossible for many living beings to explain copy or grasp it properly or revere praise or honor it with offerings Out of personal interest these harmful bhius will not disseminate this sutra very widely channels where it could be communicated will be few and even then it will not be sufficiently discussed Like those impoverished cowherd women who developed their milk for sale to the point where porridge made from it had lost all trace of any milk flavor this Mahayana scripture the Great Nirvana Sutra will thus have been developed such that it is so weakened as to lose its aromas and flavors But though it may be without aroma or flavor it will still surpass other sutras by a thousandfold just as the milk surpassed the bitter flavors by a thousandfold Why is this Because this Mahayana scripture the Great Nirvana Sutra is foremost among the sravaka sutras j ust like milk is the best among flavors This is precisely why I call this sutra the Great Nirvana In addition good man among good men and good women there are none who do not seek a male body  Why is this Because in all women are lodged a collection of things problematic In addition good man j ust as the urine of a mosquito would be unable moisten the surface of the earth that is how difficult it is to satisfy the lust of a woman When a man is engaged in lustful activity with a woman even if he were as the entire earth rolled into a ball the size of a peppergrass seed he would still be unable to satisfy her Even if there were men as numerous as the grains of sand in the Ganges River who engaged in lustful activity with one woman they would be unable to satisfy her Good man like an ocean that is not filled even when all the rains coming down from the heavens fill up a hundred rivers flowing into it such is the dharma of womanhood Even if every man were to have lustful relations with one woman that woman would not be satisfied and kanJikiira trees there are bees that come and suck their attractive and fragrant flavors but are not contented Women who desire men are like this they are insatiable Good man it is in this sense that good men and good women who listen to this Mahayana Great Nirvana Sutra will always decry the marks that characterize a female and seek to be male  Because this Mahayana scripture has the characteristic of manliness  I am referring to buddhanature If someone does not understand buddhanature then he does not have male characteristics Why do I say this Because he cannot grasp the fact that the buddhanature exists within himself I would say those unable to know the buddhanature are to be called women I would say those who are able to know themselves that   the buddhanature exists are characteristically male If a woman is able to know definitively that the buddhanature exists within herself you should know that this constitutes her as male Good man this Mahayana scripture the Great Nirvana Sutra is a collection of merit beyond measure limit or conception Because by having expounded the hidden treasury that is the tathiigatagarbha good men and good women who desire to quickly comprehend this recondite tathiigatagarbha will thereby expediently apply themselves to the practice of what is in this sutra The bodhisattva Kasyapa then addressed the Buddha WorldHonored One Thus it is thus it is as the Buddha has explained It is with this manliness that I have now been able to enter the tathagata hidden treasury and that is why the Tathagata has awakened me today for the first time It is by means of this that I have obtained definitive and clear understanding   The Buddha said Excellent excellent  Good man it is a dharma in accordance with the world that you now profess Kasyapa once again spoke But I do not a dharma in accordance with the world The Buddha praised Kasyapa Excellent excellent What you have now understood is that the flavor of this unsurpassed dharma is profound and difficult to understand yet it can be understood Just as a bee gathers flavors from different flowers you should also proceed in that way In addition good man j ust as the liquid produced by mosquitos would never be able to moisten this great earth such will be the dissemination of this sutra in the future And just like that mosquito liquid the truedharma is going to disappear and when it does this sutra will be the first to sink into the earth You should thus understand this to be a sign of the dissolution of the truedharma In addition good man this is analogous to the first month subsequent to summer called autumn for the rain in autumn is continual  This Mahayana scripture the Great Nirvana Sutra is like that Because there are bodhisattvas in the southern region it will spread widely there like a downpour of dharma rain filling that area When the truedharma is about to disappear the entire sutra with nothing missing will reach Kashmir and there it will sink into the earth and be lost There will be those who believe in it and there will be those who do not In this way the dharma flavor that is the ambrosia of immortality in these Mahayana wellbalanced sutras will all disappear into the ground After this sutra has disappeared the entire corpus of Mahayana sutras will have perished Anyone who manages to obtain this entire sutrawith nothing lacking will be an elephant king Bodhisattvas should understand that the unsurpassed truedharma of the Tathagata will be lost before long X Chapter Four The Nature of the Tathagata Part  At that time Mafijusrl addressed the Buddha with these words WorldHonored One It now appears that Cunda has doubts Pray give us another analysis so that these doubts may be dispelled in him The Buddha said Good man explain these doubts to me so that I may remove them  Mafijusrf said In his mind Cunda has doubts about the permanent abiding of the Tathagata arising from wondering whether he has the ability to discern the buddhanature If seeing buddhanature makes it permanent then when you have not seen it it should be impermanent But if something is impermanent before then it should be impermanent afterward as well Why is this Because things in this world that did not exist previously can indeed come into existence now and after they have existed they then return to nonexistence All things are equally impermanent in this way so in this sense there is no distinction made for buddhas bodhisattvas sravakas or pratyekabuddhas The WorldHonored One then uttered the following verse Previously existing now nonexisting Previously nonexisting now existing A dharma existing over the three time periods Is not possible  Good man it is in this sense that buddhas bodhisattvas sravakas and pratyekabuddhas are distinguished and are not distinguished Mafij usrl praised this saying Excellent This is truly a sacred teaching For the first time I have now understood that buddhas bodhisattvas sravakas and pratyekabuddhas are to be distinguished and are not to be distinguished The bodhisattva Kasyapa then spoke to the Buddha The Buddha has explained that there is no difference in the natures of buddhas bodhisattvas sravakas and pratyekabuddhas I beg the Tathagata to give blessings and peace of mind to all living beings by explaining this in a more expansive and detailed way The Buddha said Good man Listen carefully very carefully and I will explain this to you Good man this is comparable to a householder or the son of a householder who is raising many milk cows of various colors He always appoints one person to be in charge of protecting and nourishing the cows On one occasion in order to make an offering after milking the cows the milk is all put into one container and placed on an altar Looking down at the milk he sees how uniformly white it is and wonders why it is that while each of the cows is a different color the milk they produce is the same color He then reflects on the fact that the causes and conditions of living beings that lead to karmic retribution similarly yield a single color like that of milk Good man sravakas pratyekabuddhas and bodhisattvas all have identical buddhanatures just like that milk Why is this Because they equally exhaust their contaminants of mental defilements And yet liva ing beings say There are distinctions between buddhas bodhisattvas sravakas and pratyekabuddhas But although there are sravakas and ordinary people who wonder how there could be no distinction among the three vehicles after a period of time these living beings themselves will understand that everyone in the three vehicles has the identical buddhanature just as that person realized the karmic causality when looking at the characteristics of milk Good man this is analogous to gold ore After it is refined and the impurities are removed then and only then is it melted to become what people think of as gold Only after all this does its value increase enormously Good man sravakas pratyekabuddhas and bodhisattvas are also like this in that they all can accomplish the identical buddhanature Because removing their defilements is like removing impurities from gold ore In this sense there is nary a distinction among the identical buddhanatures of all living beings At first people only hear about the tathiigatagarbha It is later when they attain buddhahood that they understand it as a matter of course just like that elder came to understand the uniform character of milk How does this happen It happens by means of cutting away the incalculable defilements that plague each individual The bodhisattva Kasyapa addressed the Buddha saying WorldHonored One If all living beings have buddhanature then what is the difference between buddhas and living beings  As you have explained living beings have many errors in their ways but if they all possess buddhanature then by what causality would Sariputra and others a parinirviifa that is a minor nirvaIa a pratyekabuddha a parinirviifa that is a middle nirvaIa and a bodhisattva a parinirviifa that is a maj or nirvaIa If all these people have the same buddhanature then why are their parinirviifas not the same as the parinirviifa of a tathagata Good man the nirvaIa attained b y buddha worldhonored ones is not what is attained by sravakas and pratyekabuddhas This is why the mahiiparinirviifa is called an auspicious state Even if there were no buddha in the world that does not mean that followers of the two vehicles would not attain their two nirvItIas  Kasyapa spoke again What does that mean The Buddha said Over a period of incalculable endless asaJkhyeya kapas only one buddha has appeared in the world to reveal the three vehicles Good man the issue you raise about there being no difference between the parinirviias of bodhisattvas and followers of the two vehicles I have already addressed here in this Tathiigatagarbha Great Nirvana  of arhats is not an auspicious state but all arhats will attain this mahiiparinirviia     In this sense mahiiparinirviia contains the end point the final bliss which is why I call it mahiiparinirviia Kasyapa said Now for the first time I understand the meaning of what the Buddha was saying about what is distinguished and what is not distinguished What is this about It is about the fact that in the future bodhisattvas sravakas and pratyekabuddhas will find their way to mahiiparinirviia just like the waters flowing in so many rivers will find their way to the sea Therefore those who are sravakas and pratyekabuddhas is called permanent rather than impermanent In this sense there are distinctions and there are also no distinctions b Then Kasyapa said What are the distinctions in their natures   The Buddha said Good man sravakas are like fresh milk pratyekabuddhas are like milk curds bodhisattvas are either like fresh butter or clarified butter and buddha worldhonored ones are like the cream on the surface of clarified butter It is in this sense that within this Mahiiparinirviia I speak of four natures that are distinguished from one another Kasyapa then asked What characterizes that nature in living beings in general The Buddha said Good man Just like milk and blood are not yet separated in a newborn calf an ordinary person s nature is mixed together with the defilements in him Kasyapa then said In Kusinagara there was a caiila named Joyful The Buddha predicted that this person by means of bringing forth one thought of resolving to attain awakening would be among the thousands that will quickly attain the unsurpassed path of truth as a buddha in this world So why then does the Tathagata not predict the swift attainment of the Buddhas path for Venerable S ariputra and Venerable Maudgalyayana and others like them The Buddha said Good man there are sravakas pratyekabuddhas and bodhisattvas who make vows in which they say Far into the future will I take responsibility for supporting the truedharma Then and only then will I attain the unsurpassed path to buddhahood Because they can produce these vows quickly I can give them predictions of attainment quickly In addition good man you should also consider the analogy of a merchant who has a priceless jewel that he takes to the marketplace to sell A fool sees it but not recognizing it for what it is scoffs at its stated value The owner blurts out My jewel is valuable beyond measure   Upon hearing this the fool laughs out loud and says to the others around him That is not really a jewel at all it is only a crystal bead Good man sravakas and pratyekabuddhas are j ust like this If they heard a prediction that come quickly they would thereupon become unmotivated derisive and surly just like the fool who did not know a true jewel when he saw it In the future there will be bhikus incapable of cultivating the good dharma in a disciplined manner As a consequence of being extremely poor in painful circumstances or overwhelmed by hunger they will leave their households in order to gain nourishment for their bodies But as their resolve will be wobbly they will fall into improper ways of earning a living using guile and trickery If they were to hear that the Tathagata was granting predictions of speedy attainment to sravakas they would laugh out loud in contempt and disgust Understand that these things mean the destruction of morality Such people even falsely declare that they already possess superhuman faculties It is with this in mind that I follow someone  s quick production of a vow with a prediction of quick attainment and for someone who protects the dharma I will give a prediction of attainment in the distant future The bodhisattva Kasyapa spoke once again to the Buddha WorldHonored One How can bodhisattvamahasattvas achieve an assembly that is indestructible The Buddha told Kasyapa If bodhisattvas desire to protect the truedharma with diligence and zeal that will be the causal means by which they can achieve an assembly that cannot be disrupted The bodhisattva Kasyapa spoke once again to the Buddha WorldHonored One What causes the lips and mouths of living beings to become dry The Buddha told Kasyapa If they do not recognize that the Three Jewels are a permanent form of existence it will cause their lips and mouths to dry up It is like when a person  s mouth becomes dysfunctional and he can no longer discriminate among the six flavors of sweet bitter spicy sour salty and astringent All living beings that are ignorant and bereft of wisdom do c not understand that the Three Jewels are dharmas that abide permanently This is why I call that a mouth that has become dry Next good man consider a living being that does not know o f the permanent abiding of the Tathagata You should understand that he is like a person born blind When someone does know of this permanent abiding of the Tathagata though he may have vision with his physical eyes what I am speaking about here is vision with divine eyes Good man if one is able to understand the permanence of the Tathagata know that that person will have cultivated sutras like this one for some time When I speak about these things I am alluding to seeing with divine eyes But even if one has divine sight he still may not be able to understand the permanence of the Tathagata On other topics I may be alluding to physical eyes But some people are not even able to recognize the hands feet or other parts of their own bodies so how could they be able to make others understand It is in this sense that I have referred to their as operating through physical eyes In addition good man the Tathagata always serves as the father and mother for all living beings  Why do I say this There are many varieties of form among living beings such as having two legs four legs many legs or no legs The Buddha employs just a single sound in expounding the dharma for each and every kind  but each will gain their own understanding of what he says One by one each pleads with him  Tathagata would you please preach the dharma to me It is in this sense called their mother and father In addition good man think of a baby who for the fIrst sixteen months speaks but does not yet communicate Yet the father and mother want to teach the child how to speak so at fIrst they make the same sounds as the baby and then gradually teach the baby proper language Would you consider this way of speaking by the father and mother to be incorrect No WorldHonored One Good man the buddha tathagatas are also like this when they expound the dharma to living beings they adapt to the various sounds those living beings make For the purpose of enabling them to establish themselves in the truedharma the tathagatas will manifest in a variety of forms according to how they will be seen Now when the tathagatas adapt their language in this way should that be considered incorrect No WorldHonored One Because what i s spoken b y the Tathagata is like the roar of a lion In accordance with the various sounds of the world he illustrates the wondrous dharma for living beings Chapter Five The Query of the Entire Assembly At that time the WorldHonored One released a multicolored ray of light from his forehead that illuminated the body of Cunda shining green yellow incarnadine white red and purple Upon experiencing this Cunda and his kinsmen picked up their dishes of food and quickly brought them to the Buddha wanting to present their final offerings to the Tathagata and the bhius There were a variety of different plates filled to the brim that they intended to place before the Buddha but on that occasion there were powerful gods present who prevented them from proceeding any further The gods surrounded them and addressed Cunda saying Do not present those offerings   At that point the Tathagata once again released a variegated beam of light this time limitless in its scope Upon encountering this light the gods quickly moved aside and allowed Cunda to proceed to the Buddha s location and offer his donation Then the gods and other living beings each took up their own offerings and placed them before the Buddha knelt on one knee and said All we ask Tathagata is that you allow the bhikyus to accept this food and drink Aware of the occasion the bhikuS then picked up their robes and bowls and with uniform serenity  At that time Cunda spread out a variety of jeweled lion seats for the Buddha and the monks He hung silk banderoles and canopies and strewed fragrant flowers and garlands of precious stones The occasion was thus adorned with the finery of the great trichiliocosm just like the Sukhavatl Land of Bliss in the West   Then Cunda standing before the Buddha and filled with grief and lamentation addressed him in a serious tone I beseech you WorldHonored One May you look upon us with pity and remain living for one more kalpa or at least something close to a full kalpa  The Buddha said to Cunda  If you wish to have me remain in the world for a long time you should quickly present what will be the final completion of the perfection of charity for you At that time the same sound rang out in the different voices of the bodhisattvamahasattvas gods humans and other assorted creatures saying Amazing Cunda  You achieve such great merit in having the Tathagata accept what will be unsurpassed as the final offering The offerings we have prepared have become meaningless Wanting to fulfill the wishes of the entire assembly at that moment the WorldHonored One generated incalculable numbers of buddhas each one on a pore of his skin Each of these buddhas had what amounted to an incalculable number of bhiu sanghas These worldhonored ones as well as their surrounding assemblies were all shown to be accepting offerings just as the Tathagata S akyamuni himself had accepted what had been offered to him by Cunda At that time the meal of cooked rice brought by Cunda was enough to satisfy the entire state of Magadha for there were eight bushels  By means of the Buddha s supernatural power this also satisfied everyone in the assemblies present Upon seeing this Cunda was transported with j oy seemingly without end Everyone in the assemblies felt the same way At that point each person in that great crowd having received the Buddhas blessing thought Having now accepted our donations it will not be long before he enters nirvaQa And thinking this they felt both sadness and joy Meanwhile in that narrow strip of earth between the trees by means of the Buddhas supernatural power there were now innumerable buddha worldhonored ones and their retinues occupying spaces no bigger than the point of a needle sitting down and eating the donated food no differently than the others Upon seeing this the gods humans and asuras began to cry expressing their grief by saying Today the Tathagata has accepted our last offerings and having accepted those offerings he will attain parinirviifa To whom should we presb ent our offerings then We are now being separated forever from the Unsurpassed and Tamer  We will lose our sight and go blind At that time the WorldHonored One wishing to console everyone gathered in the assembly responded in verse  None of you should grieve For what is appropriate in the dharma of buddhas I enter nirvalJa Having passed through innumerable kalpas Always enj oying the greatest pleasures Eternally dwelling in a place of serene peace Listen now with your full attention As I explain about nirvalJa Having been freed from the notion of eating The end brings no trauma of hunger or thirst It is for you now that I explain this In accordance with the wishes of all living beings So that anyone in any group Can attain the bliss of serene peace Listen and cultivate your practice Of the permanent abiding of the dharma of buddhas If a crow and a homed owl Were to share the same roost in a tree Just like parents or brothers Then I would pass into the eternal extinction of nirvalJa The Tathagata regards everyone As if they were Rahula Always honored by living beings Why would I pass into the eternal extinction of nirvalJa If a snake a rat and a wolf Were to saunter into the same hole And love each other like brothers Then I would pass into the eternal extinction of nirvalJa The Tathagata regards everyone As if they were Rahula Always honored by living beings Why would I pass into the eternal extinction of nirvala If the flowers of saptaparlJa trees Were to turn into the fragrance of viirika  And the fruit of kiilaka trees Turned into the fruit of tinduka trees  The Tathagata regards everyone As if they were Rahula Why would I leave compassion behind And enter the eternal extinction of nirvala If icchantikas in their present bodies Were to accomplish the Buddhist path Forever dwelling in supreme bliss Then I would pass into the eternal extinction of nirvala The Tathagata regards everyone As if they were Rahula Why would I leave compassion behind And enter the eternal extinction of nirvala If every living being Were to accomplish the Buddhist path at the same time Freeing themselves from error and calamity Then I would pass into the eternal extinction of nirvala The Tathagata regards everyone As if they were Rahula c Why would he abandon that compassion And pass into nirvala forever If mosquito urine were to soak the entire earth mountains and swelling hundreds of rivers That filled the oceans as they poured into them If such a thing were to occur Then I would pass into the eternal extinction of nirvala As one whose compassionate thoughts regard everyone As if they were Rahula Always honored by living beings Why would I pass into the eternal extinction of nirvala This is precisely why all of you Should deeply appreciate the truedharma You should not let your anxiety grow Weeping and moaning If you yourself want to pursue the proper practice You must cultivate the Tathagata s permanence Contemplate the fact that a dharma like this Has had a long existence without change You should also keep this in mind The Three Jewels all abide permanently This will gain you great protection Like casting a spell on a dried plant to make it bear fruit This is what I how I refer to the Three Jewels And the fourfold community should listen carefully Having heard this you should be overjoyed And immediately bring forth bodhicitta resolutions for awakening If you can see your way to reckoning that the Three Jewels Do abide permanently the same as the ultimate truth That would the greatest wish Of all the buddhas If there are any monks nuns laymen or laywomen who ardently aspire to fulfill this greatest wish of the tathagatas know that such people are without delusion and worthy of being honored Through the power of their aspiration their virtue and karmic reward will be foremost in the world like those of an arhat Those who cannot conceive of the permanence of the Three Jewels are cmujiiias But those who can understand the permanent abiding of the Three Jewels and the actual causality of dharmas will free themselves from suffering and be in a state of blissno injury or obstacle could impede them After hearing this dharma the assembly of humans gods asuras and other beings was at that moment transported with j oy seemingly without end The minds became pliant they easily dissolved their internal obstacles their thinking lost its usual unevenness their bearing became dignified and pure and their countenances beamed with joyfor they grasped the eternal abiding of the Buddha And thus the assembly endeavored to provide ever more heavenly offerings by scattering a variety of flowers powdered incense and smearing incense and played heavenly music all in a spirit of paying homage to the Buddha At that time the Buddha said to the bodhisattva KliSyapa Good man you have seen these many extraordinary things have you not KliSyapa said Yes I have seen them WorldHonored One I have seen buddhas immeasurable limitless and indescribable accepting food offerings presented to them by people and gods in great assemblies In addition a I have seen the tremendous physical beauty of the buddhas how the space they occupy when seated is like the point of a needle and how the crowds surrounding them are not impeded by each other I have also seen the assembly make vows As you expounded those thirteen verses just now I understood how each one in the assembly thought Just now the Tathligata accepted only my offering Suppose the food offered by Cunda was minced into tiny pieces so that there would be one piece per buddha In that case there would not be enough to go around But through the spiritual powers of the buddha there is enough for everyone in the assembly Only bodhisattvamahlisattvas and Mafijusrf the Dharma Prince can understand extraordinary things like this These are all manifestations of the Tathagata s skillful means and this is how the great community o f sravakas and even asuras will all understand the Tathagata to be a permanently abiding dharma At that time the WorldHonored One turned to Cunda and said Is what you have just witnessed not rare and extraordinary It truly is WorldHonored One What I have seen are innwnerable buddhas with thirtytwo maj or and eighty minor marks adorning their bodies Now I have also seen how all the bodhisattvamahasattvas have fonns of uncanny exquisite beauty Before me I behold the Buddha s body appearing like a medicinal tree surrounded by bodhisattvamahasattvas The Buddha said to Cunda The innumerable buddhas that you saw before were transfonnations of myself created to benefit all living beings to bring them j oy The practices cultivated by these bodhisattvamahasattvas are beyond conception for they are engaged in the work that innumerable buddhas do Cunda you have now fully perfected the practices of a bodhisattvamahasattva and have attained to where you are residing in the ten stagesl Practices that are done by bodhisattvas are accomplished in you The bodhisattva KliSyapa then said to the Buddha WorldHonored One Just so just so Just as the Buddha has explained the bodhisattva practices accomplished by Cunda make me j oyous as well And now because the Tathagata wants innumerable living beings of the future to become beacons of bright l ight he expounds the Mahliyana Great Nirvana Sutra WorldHonored One should we regard everything expounded in the canon of sutras as having meanings that are incomplete in that there is something additional to consider  or as having meanings that are complete with nothing further to consider  Good man among my utterances there are some in which the meanings are incomplete and there are others in which the meanings are complete  Cunda then asked the Buddha WorldHonored One when these verses were spoken To take what you have And donate it in all cases Is only to be praised You will suffer no injury WorldHonored One what did you mean Why do you say  With the exception of one type of person  The Buddha said May I humbly ask you to elaborate on this The Buddha said To everyone else making donations is always something that should be praised something that yields great rewards Cunda asked another question What is the meaning of icchantika  The Buddha said Cunda when a monk nun layman or laywoman speaks in a malicious manner disparaging the truedharma and does this repeatedly never regretting his or her remarks or feeling shame I regard such a person as coursing the icchantika path To commit one of the four grave offenses or perpetrate one of the five heinous crimes knowing that such behavior is a serious violation yet from the outset feeling neither fear nor shame nor admitting to what he or she has done  Or if instead of forever protecting delighting in and furthering the Buddhas truedharma a person disparages it bel ittles it or speaks of it with reproachsuch a person I would also say is coursing the icchantika path The kind of person who would say there is no buddha dharma or sangha I would also say is coursing the icchantika path With the exception of icchantikas of this ilk donating to everyone else is to be praised At that time Cunda spoke to the Buddha again WorldHonored One When you say  violate the precepts  what do you mean by that The Buddha answered Cunda when a person commits one of the four grave offenses perpetrates one of the five heinous crimes or maligns the truedharma someone like that I call a violator of the precepts Again Cunda asked When someone violates the precepts can that karmic stain be removed said Cunda when there is just cause then indeed it can be removed If the person dons the robes of a monastic even without having fully renounced the world and his thoughts are constantly filled with shame and fear then he will reproach himself for what he has done saying Fie  Why did I commit such a serious crime How bewildering that I would have done a deed this cruel If as he feels regret he has thoughts of preserving the dharma such as I want to promote the truedharma To those who preserve the dharma I will make offerings To those who read and recite the Mahayana scriptures I will ask questions retaining what I receive to read and recite myself And after I have grasped the meaning and benefited from what I have learned I will also explain this in detail to others I declare that a person like this is not a violator of the precepts Good man like the sunrise can remove the darkness of even the smallest shadow when this Subtle Sutra of the Great Nirvana appears in the world it can remove the transgressions perpetrated by living beings over countless kalpas in the same way That is why in this sutra I have expounded that by preserving the truedharma one obtains a great reward and removes the karmic impact of their moral violations If someone who maligns the truedharma later comes to regret his actions and returns to that dharma on his own he will think of all the unwholesome things he has done as if he had injured himself He will be stricken by feelings of dread anxiety and shame except for the truedharma there will be no hope for deliverance and for that reason he simply must return to it If he can take refuge in what I have expounded in this way then to make donations to him will bring merit beyond measure for I would call such a person worthy of offerings in this world c If commits a depraved act such as those I have just mentioned and yet after fifteen days or a month have passed he is still not of a mind to take refuge and publicly confess what he did then if someone were to make a donation to this person the resultant karmic benefit would be extremely small Anyone who commits one of the five heinous crimes is in this situation But when such an individual does feel remorse and internally embraces his shame thinking This unwholesome act I have done is now something of profound misery to me What I should be doing is promoting and supporting the truedharma then I would no longer call this person someone of one of the five heinous crimes If you were to make a donation to this person you will obtain merit beyond measure By contrast the merit gained from making donations to people who have committed grave offenses but are not interested in supporting or taking refuge in the dharma is not worth mentioning Good man I would like to explain a bit more about this matter ofbehavior involving serious misdeeds so listen carefully and I will break it down and explain it in some detail for you What should be thinking is That which is called the truedharma is precisely this hidden treasury containing a tathagata therefore that is something I will support and foster If you make a donation to this type of person you will obtain a superior reward Good man Imagine a pregnant woman who near the end of her term sees her nation erupt into violent turbulence so she escapes to another land There she ends up giving birth in a shrine But soon after she hears that her old country has become peaceful and prosperous again so carrying her child in her arms she begins to make her way home On the way she wades into a river with turbulent and swiftly flowing waters When she is midway across she realizes that she cannot make it to the other shore while holding the baby At that moment she thinks I would rather die in this spot than abandon my child j ust to get across myself With that thought mother and child together sink into the water and their lives come to an end After her death she is reborn in a heaven because of the mercy she displayed in sacrificing herself in her efforts to get the child across the river In fact this woman s original nature was vile yet despite that she attained rebirth in a heaven due to her love for her child People who commit one of the four grave offenses or five heinous crimes but then feel they want to protect and care for the dharma will also be like this  although they may have engaged in unwholesome behavior in the past because they care for the dharma they can still become a field of merit unsurpassed in this world Caring for the dharma in this way has immeasurable karmic rewards Cunda then spoke up again W orldHonored One If an icchantika by himself comes to regret his actions and honors venerates and praises the Three Jewels would making donations to that person bring significant karmic reward or not The Buddha said Good man you should not speak about things in that manner Good man this is analogous to a person who spits out the pit of the mango he is eating onto the ground and then thinks Well inside that pit it should also be sweet So he picks it up again breaks it open in his hands and tastes the inside only to find it extremely bitter Regretting his decision he thinks I guess I made a mistake about the seeds inside the fruit He goes back collects the pieces puts them in the ground and then tries to nurture the seed pieces by watering them with sumanii oil and milk from time to time What would you say about what he is trying to do No WorldHonored One Even if the sweetest rains were to fall from the heavens still nothing would grow from that seed Good man the icchantikas are j ust like that They have burned away their karmic good roots so by what rationale would they be able to remove the impact of their transgressions Good man if their attitudes were wholesome and good then I would not call them icchantikas Good man it is in this sense that I say that the karmic rewards for charitable  acts are not without distinctions How does this work The rewards for donations given to sravakas differ the rewards for donations given to pratyekabuddhas also differ only donations given to tathagatas bring the maximum rewards This is why I say charitable acts as a whole are not without distinctions Cunda spoke once again Why did the Tathagata utter the verses on donating to monastics The Buddha said Cunda the reason why I spoke those verses was to respond to a lay Buddhist upiisaka in S ravasti who made offerings to a Jain Nirgrantha without clearly believing  and then came to ask me about the meaning of his act of charity Those were the circumstances in which I composed those verses It was also to expound the meaning of the secret tathiigatagarbha to the bodhisattvamahasattvas What was meaning of the verse The words in all cases referred to all cases of what is a small portion Understand that a bodhisattvamahasattva is a hero among the people welcoming those who maintain the precepts and donating necessities to them ridding of those who violate the precepts weeding them out like harsh barnyard grass In addition good man in the past I also expounded this verse All rivers Will have bends All forests Will be known by their trees All women Will use guile All who are free Will gain peace and happiness At that time the bodhisattvamahasattva Mafij usri rose from his seat respectfully bared his right shoulder knelt with his right knee on the ground and then came forward paying obeisance at the Buddha s feet before speaking beginning with these verses  All rivers Do not necessarily have bends All forests Are not necessarily known by their trees All women Do not necessarily use guile All who are free Do not necessarily gain peace and happiness that there are additional things to consider that are relevant to the meanings of these verses taught by the Buddha  only ask that you take pity on us and explain the reasoning behind them Why do  ask WorldHonored One within the great trichiliocosm there is a continent called Godanlya   This continent has a river called  S alya the banks of which are straight and do not bend Like a rope used as an inkline it goes straight to the Western Sea Rivers shaped like this have never been mentioned in the other sutras expounded by the Buddha Since these vaitulya and iigama sutras have expositions for there are other meanings to consider  beseech the Tathagata to enable bodhisattvas to grasp the deeper implications in those teachings WorldHonored One the Tathagata appears like someone who at first discerned where a gold mine was but afterward would not discern where the gold itself was You have completely understood the dharma but what you have explained to us is incomplete and does not exhaust the subject matter Although the Tathagata may have created other explanations on  you should also use indirect expedient means to help us understand what you intend to communicate All forests will be made of trees is also a statement for which there are additional things to consider Because people take various jeweled ornaments containing gold silver or vaicjurya and make them into the shape of trees and when these are brought together they are also called forests All women will use guile is another statement for which there are additional things to consider Because there are women who do an excellent job of maintaining the precepts no matter how restrictive They are accomplished in virtue and have great compassion  All who are free will gain peace and happiness is another statement that is incomplete Why do I say this Among those who are free are sacred sovereigns who are cakravartins Tathagata Dharma Kings who are not associated with the Mara of death and so do not pass away as well as Brahma S akra and other gods who although free are all impermanent If attaining permanent abiding and immutability is what you are calling freedom then that would refer to the Mahayana mahiiparinirviifJa  The Buddha said Good man what you have now said is a most eloquent discourse but stop a moment and listen Maiijusrl consider the case of a distinguished householder who was hampered by the pain of illness A skillful physician examined him and concocted a medicinal plaster for him But at that point the sick man very much wanted a large dose of medicine So the physician put it to him like this If you were able to eliminate it then you could take the large dose of medicine  But now your body is enervated so you should not ingest large quantities  You must understand that this plaster is called sweet dew but it is also called poisonous medicine If you were to receive a large dose of this medicine and it turned out you did not eliminate it that medicine we would then call poisonous  Good man do not think that what the physician has said amounts to violating his duties or losing confidence in the power in the plaster he created Good man the Tathagata is like him when it comes to kings queens regents princes and ministers There was an arrogance about King Prasenaj it and in his son and queen as well and in order to subdue that arrogance I made plain to them something that was frightening just like the physician did for his patient That was why I created these verses  All rivers Will have bends All forests Will be known by their trees All women Will use guile All who are free Will gain peace and happiness Mafij usrl you should now understand that there are no errors in the preaching of the Tathagata Even if the earth itself could be turned upside down there would never be any errors in the words of the Tathagata It is in this sense that I say that within the totality of what the Tathagata has said there are utterances in which there are additional things to consider  Then the Buddha praised Mafijusrl Excellent good man is your longstanding knowledge of what this kind of discussion is about It is because you feel mercy for others that you ask these detailed questions about the meaning of the Tathagata  s verse wanting to empower all living beings to attain wisdom At that point Mafijusrl the Dharma Prince came before the Buddha once again and quoted verses  In regard to the language of others Comply rather than oppose And do not examine What others do and do not do c Just examine where your own actions Have been good and have not been good WorldHonored One Expounding a dharma medicine such as this could not be the right teaching  l O When you say In regard to the language of others comply rather than oppose I beseech the Tathagata to take pity on us and provide us with the right teaching Why do I speak this way WorldHonored One you have always said that all ninetyfive kinds of heretical leaming    lead to coursing in the unfortunate realms but the sravaka disciples are all directed on the right path Those among them who continue to support the precepts maintain their comportment and are careful about the karmic roots they sow have a deep appreciation for the Great Dharma and will course in the fortunate realms   But why is it Tathagata that in our ninefold canon we see disdain expressed toward another person which then leads to reproach What was your intent in verses like those I just quoted Good man when I uttered those verses they were not meant as a universal statement for all living beings At the time I was speaking to King Ajatasatru   Buddha worldhonored ones would never speak contrarily without good cause There was a reason why I spoke to him in this way Good man after having killed his father King Ajatasatru came to see me Hoping to subdue me he asked me this Tell me would you say that the WorldHonored One has omniscience or not If you have omniscience then why would you allow Devadatta to j oin the sangha given the fact that for countless lifetimes Devadatta has continually harbored evil thoughts in following the Tathagata in order to kill you Good man when I spoke those verses that you quoted it was for the king in that situation In regard to the language of others Comply rather than oppose Do not examine What others do and do not do Just examine where your own actions Have been good and have not been good The Buddha then informed the great king Having killed your father you have committed a most serious crime that will immediately bring the most severe karmic result You must publicly admit what you have done and seek purification What circumstances could motivate you to instead look for faults in others Good man it was in this sense that I uttered those verses for that king In addition good man the verses were spoken in order to to support rather than malign the precepts and to observe the faults of others only after achieving disciplined comportment in himself If there are people who in accepting the admonitions of others distance themselves from their personal bounty of bad behavior and also teach others to help them to also move away from their own many bad behaviors such people would then be my disciples Then the WorldHonored One spoke these verses to Maiijusrf Everyone fears a weapon No one does not love life As I forgive myself should be the simile  Do not kill and do not take up arms Then MaiijusIi came before the Buddha again and reiterated these verses Not everyone fears a weapon Not everyone loves life a As I forgive myself should be the simile Devote yourself to creating skillful means Tathagata the meaning in this dharma verse also does not exhaust every possibility Why do I say this It is not plausible that a god human being or asura would pick up a sword and stab arhats cakravartin kings beautiful women elephants horses or ministers of the treasury And even if warriors strongwilled women horsemen alphamale horses leaders among wild animals and preceptkeeping bhikus run into such danger they would not be afraid It is with this meaning in mind that I say there are additional meanings to consider in the Tathagatas verses And the phrase   As I forgive myself should be the simile is also incomplete If an arhat were to take the self as a simile for viewing others then he would be carrying an idea of self and an idea of a personal lifetime If he were to hold notions of self and personal lifetime then he would have to guard and protect them Ordinary people should see all arhats as practitioners but if like this it would constitute a false view of things And if people embrace false views when their life ends they will be reborn in A vlci Hell Moreover to suppose that an arhat could have harmful thoughts toward living beings simply does not make sense and countless numbers of living beings are quite incapable of harming an arhat as well The Buddha said Good man to speak of an idea of self is to allude to the thoughts that arise in living beings of great compassion and the utter lack of any intent to inj ure another It is to allude to the impartial mind of an arhat Do not say that the WorldHonored One has spoken contrarily without good cause One day in the past there was a great hunter in Raj agrha who went after herds of deer and over time had killed many He invited me to eat the meat with him and although I accepted his invitation at that time I expressed the compassion I felt toward all living beings as if they were Rahula by speaking these verses to him You can be enabled to have a long life Dwelling in this world for so long But if you abided by the dharma of nonviolence Yours would be like the lifetimes of buddhas This is why I also uttered the verse you mentioned As I forgive myself should be the simile Do not kill and do not take up arms The Buddha said Excellent Excellent Mafij usrl is your questioning of the Tathagata s recondite teachings such a s these for the sake o f the bodhisattvamahasattvas Mafijusrl then uttered these verses to the Tathagata How could respecting my father and mother Obeying and revering them How could practicing this dharma Mean falling into A vici Hell The Tathagata responded to this by answering Maiijusrl with the following verses  If you are attached to your mother And delusional about your father b Obeying and revering in this way Will mean falling into A vlci Hell Then the Tathagata added these verses for the bodhisattva Maiij usrl In all cases depending on others Results in what we call suffering In all cases relying on oneself Means autonomy and joy In all cases arrogance Inclines one to excessive violence The wise and gracious Are loved by everyone At that point the bodhisattva Maiijusrl addresed the Buddha saying WorldHonored One What the Tathagata has expounded here also does not exhaust  All I ask is that the Tathagata bestow mercy upon us by expounding his reasoning further Why do I say this It is like the son of a householder When he studies under a teacher he is dependent upon that teacher is he not But if he depends upon that teacher he will never accomplish his own purpose Yet if he does not depend upon him he will not accomplish his goals either But even when he attains some autonomy he may still not accomplish anything That is why there are additional meanings to consider in what the Tathagata expounds   In addition WorldHonored One suppose there was a prince who never received any training Whatever he touched would lead to nothing He would have freedom or autonomy but he would be in the dark constantly suffering For someone like this prince if one were to say He was autonomous that would suggest that autonomous implied nonachievement But if one were to say He was dependent on another that would suggest that dependent also implied nonachievement It is in this sense that I allude to the meanings expounded by the Buddha as having something additional to consider That is also why In all cases depending on others does not necessarily mean that the person ends up suffering and why in all cases autonomy does not necessarily bring happiness WorldHonored One there are strongwilled women who go forth from their homes to study the Way out of arrogance yet they maintain the precepts comport themselves impeccably guard their sense faculties and do not let themselves become wild or scattered Therefore the fetters produced by arrogance do not necessarily lead a person to violence in all cases In the verse The wise and gracious are loved by everyone there are additional meanings to consider as well For there are people who after secretly committing one of the four grave piiriijika offenses do not abandon their dharma robes  but instead become quite strict about holding themselves to the rules of comportment When those who are protective of the dharma see these people they will not love them and when the lives of these offenders end they will surely fall into hell If a wise person commits a serious violation and a dharma protector sees it the dharma protector will immediately try to get that person expelled and returned to lay status It is with this in mind that I ask how could we say that in all cases those regarded as wise and gracious will always be loved   At that time the Buddha said this to Mafijusn There are reasons why the Tathagata has expounded these verses in which there are additional meanings and there are reasons why the buddha worldhonored ones preach this particular dharma On returning to her parents  home she took the opportunity to come to where I was whereupon she took refuge in the buddha dhanna and sangha And then she said No woman has the power to be free Yet every man has unencumbered autonomy At that moment I understood that woman  s mind and so I preached to her the verses I have quoted to you now about dependence and selfreliance  Mafijusrf what you have done is excellent excellent For the sake of all living beings you have now succeeded in questioning the Tathagata about his recondite teachings such as these MafijusrI spoke once again uttering these verses Every living being Relies on food and drink to survive Every one with great power Has a mind without j ealousy In every case it is due to eating or drinking That ailments are so often painful Every pure practice cultivated Brings peace and happiness Now the WorldHonored One has thus received the offering o f food and drink from Cunda There could not be any fear in the WorldHonored One could there At that time the W orldHonored One responded in verse yet again for MafijusrI It is not that every living being Relies entirely on food and drink to survive It is not that every one with great power Has a mind without jealousy It is not always due to eating That ailments are stressfully painful It is not that every pure practice Always brings peace and happiness MafijusrI if you become ill thus will I also suffer the pain of illness Why do I say this It is because arhats pratyekabuddhas bodhisattvas  and tathagatas in fact do not partake of food It is only from their desire to spiritually transform others that they make a show of enj oying the things that have been donated by countless living beings for by doing so they enable the donors to complete the perfection of charity thereby rescuing hell beings animals and hungry ghosts If someone asserts that the Tathagata s body was weak and thin during his six years of practicing austerities that view would be unfounded The buddha worldhonored ones have individually removed themselves from the existences  they are not the same as ordinary people How could they have a body that is weak Through their diligent praxis the buddha worldhonored ones have obtained adamantine bodies these are not the same as the fragile bodies of worldly people My disciples are also like this inconceivably they do not rely on eating In the verse Every one with great power has no j ealousy there is another meaning that remains unexpressed After all there are people in this world who go through their lives with long periods of never feeling j ealous and yet they also have no power In the verse The pains from all ailments are due to eating there is also another meaning that remains unexpressed One also sees people whose ailments are externally caused such as being pricked by a thorn cut by a sword or lanced by a spear In the verse Every pure practice brings peace and happiness there is something additional as well This world also has people who are following heretical paths cultivating pure brahmacarya practices and yet they still suffer pain and anxiety This is the sense in which the word every as used by the Tathagata in the verse includes some other things to consider I call this principle The Tathagata does not put forth a verse without a reason it is only due to particular causes that he speaks One day in the past there was a brahman in Ujjayinr called Kotira who came to me wanting to take the eight precepts on the fourth day of the lay observance a At that time bodhisattva Kasyapa addressed the Buddha and said WorldHonored One Which utterances are those that have no additional meanings to consider Which are those that have complete meanings Good man excluding only some auxiliary paths complete would refer to those blessed dharmas that are permanent and j oyous    At that the bodhisattva KaSyapas heart leaped with ajoy that overwhelmed him He came before the Buddha and said How rare this is WorldHonored One You do indeed equally view all of us as if we were Rahulas At that time the Buddha praised the bodhisattva Kasyapa What you have now perceived is both sublime and significant The bodhisattva Kasyapa then said to the Buddha WorldHonored One I would like to ask the Tathagata to expound on the merit to be attained from this Mahayana Mahaparinirvatzasutra  The Buddha then told Kasyapa Good man anyone who is able to hear the name of this sutra will gain merit But this cannot be fully communicated by sravakas or pratyekabuddhas for only buddhas can understand it Why is this They cannot conceive of this buddha realm How much less likely is it that will they take possession of read and recite develop expertise in and make copies of the rolls of this sutra Then gods humans and asuras came before the Buddha and spoke these verses the same sound arising from their each of their different mouths  The buddhas are difficult t o fathom The dharma and sangha are also so That is why we beseech you now Asking only that you remain here for a short while For the Venerable Kasyapa And Ananda and The members of their two groups It will be some time before their arrival Just so for the sovereign of Magadha Great King Ajatasatru Who sincerely admires the Buddha But has not yet arrived All we ask Tathagata Is to sympathize with us a little and stay In this great assembly Clear away this net of our doubts  Then the Tathagata also spoke in verse for the many groups assembled there My dharma s eldest son Named Mahakasyapa And Ananda diligent of effort Can cut away all your doubts You will ascertain the truth Ananda master listener Naturally will understand What is permanent and impermanent For that reason you should not Give in to sorrow At that time the great assembly presented offerings of various things to the Tathagata Upon presenting their offerings to the Buddha they immediately made resolutions to attain anuttarii samyaksalbodhi Bodhisattvas as numerous as the number of grains of sand in innumerable endless Ganges Rivers attained the first bhumi stage Then the WorldHonored One extended a consecration to Mafijusri bodhisattva Kasyapa and Cunda After their consecrations he spoke these words Good men cultivate your minds be conscientious and avoid indolence Now my back hurts my whole body aches and I want to lie down like a small infant or someone who is chronically ill You Mafijusrl shall expound the great teaching to the four groups of followers I now entrust this dharma to you In addition when Kasyapa and Ananda arrive I also entrust the truedharma to them At that point after the Tathagata had spoken those words he displayed pain in his body wanting to discipline the living beings present He then lay down on his right side like someone who is ill WisdomLife Ajnatakaundinya WisdomLife MahaMaudgalyayana WisdomLife Shariputra WisdomLife Mahakasyapa WisdomLife Rahula WisdomLife Bakkula WisdomLife Bhadrapala WisdomLife Bhadrashri WisdomLife Chandanashri the venerable Jangula WisdomLife Subhuti WisdomLife Revata WisdomLife Nandasena and WisdomLife Ananda and so forth and together with  BodhisattvaMahasattvas whose names are Maitreya Bodhisattva Sarvashura Bodhisattva Manjusri Bodhisattva Samantabhadra Bodhisattva Sudarshana Bodhisattva Bhaishajyasena Bodhisattva Vajrasena Bodhisattva and so forth and together with  Lords of heavens whose names are Lord Arjuna Lord Bhadra Lord Subhadra Lord Dharmaruci Lord Chandanagarbha Lord Chandanavasin Lord Chandana and so forth and together with  goddesses whose names are goddess Mrdamgini goddess Prasadavati goddess Mahatmasamprayukta goddess Glorious Eye goddess Prajapati vasini goddess Balini goddess Glorious Wealth goddess Subahuyukta and so forth and together with  dragon kings whose names are dragon king Apalala dragon king Elapatra dragon king Timimgila dragon king Kumbhasara dragon king Kumbhashirsha dragon king Causing Virtue the dragon king Sunanda dragon king Sushakha dragon king Gavashirsha and so forth They proceeded to the EaglePeak where the Bhagavan was staying Having reached there they touched their heads to the ground to bow to the Buddhas feet circumambulated the Buddha three times and then withdrew to one side At that time Sarvashura BodhisattvaMahasattva arose from his seat uncovered his right shoulder joined his palms together towards the Buddha and said to the Buddha Bhagavan billions of gods billions of goddesses billions of Bodhisattvas billions of Sravakas and billions of dragon kings have gathered and are seated for listening to true Dharma That being so may the Tathagata the Arhat the fully awakened one please preach the wonderful Dharma that can make living beings peaceful during their long night of transmigration and breaks all of their obstacles Then the Bhagavan praised Sarvashura Bodhisattva you can ask Tathagata on this topic for the sake of living beings It will be as you say The Bhagavan told Sarvashura Bodhisattva There is a DharmaGate  Sarvashura do you know that if anyone is blissful enough to hear this DharmaGate the mass of blessings and virtues that he gain will be greater than that is accumulated by one Buddha Sarvashura asked the Buddha How is that The Bhagavan said Sarvashura if anyone hears this DharmaGate the blessings and virtues that he will gain are equal to the blessings and virtues of Buddhas as many as Gangesriversands Sarvashura those who hear this Sanghata DharmaGate will never backslide from Anuttarasamyaksambodhi will see all Buddhas will achieve Anuttarasamyaksambodhi will not be disturbed by evil demons and will accomplish all virtuous Dharmas Sarvashura those who hear this DharmaGate will understand creation and destruction Then all the assembly arose placed the upper robe over one shoulder set the right knee on the ground joined their palms together towards the Buddha and said to the Buddha Bhagavan how many blessings and virtues does one Buddha have The Buddha said  Virtuous men listen attentively The blessings and virtues of one Buddha are as many drops of water as there are in the ocean as many as atoms of the planet If living beings as many as Gangesriversands all became Bodhisattvas of the tenth stage all the blessings and virtues of those tenth stage Bodhisattvas are less than that of one Buddha Sarvashura as for those living beings who hear this Sanghata DharmaGate the blessings they will gain is much more than that is uncountable and cannot be known by figure of speech  After hearing that everyone of the assembly was overjoyed and greatly increased his blessings and virtues Then Sarvashura Bodhisattva asked the Buddha Bhagavan what kind of living beings thirst for and enjoy the true Dharma The Bhagavan told Sarvashura Bodhisattva Mahasattva Sarvashura there are two kinds of living beings who thirst for Dharma Those of the first kind has an equal mind towards all living beings as for those of the second kind after hearing Dharmas they will equally preach to the public without desire Sarvashura Bodhisattva said Bhagavan by hearing what Dharmas one can get close to the Bodhi The Buddha said Sarvashura the ones who thirst for hearing Dharmas will get close to Bodhi the ones who enjoy hearing and accept Mahayana Dharmas will be close to Bodhi Then billions of gods goddesses dragons and human beings arose joining their palms together towards the Buddha and said Bhagavan we are thirsty for Dharmas May the Bhagavan fulfill our wishes  Then the Buddha smiled rays of various colors were emitted forth from his mouth shining throughout worlds of the ten directions up to the Brahma heaven and then the rays entered into the Buddha through his crown Then Sarvashura Bodhisattva arose from his seat uncovered his right shoulder placed his right knee on the ground joined his palms together and said to the Buddha Bhagavan for what causes and conditions Tathagata manifested this rare scene The Buddha told Sarvashura Bodhisattva All living beings in this assembly will acquire Anuttarasamyaksambodhi will get in the state of all Tathagatas thus the Buddha smiled Sarvashura Bodhisattva said Bhagavan by what causes and condition will the living beings in this assembly acquire Anuttarasamyaksambodhi The Buddha said Good good Sarvashura you can ask the Tathagata on this Sarvashura it is because of the great vow Sarvashura in times past countless eons and the living beings in this assembly who are staying in Buddha wisdom now were all deer At that time I vowed that I must make all those dear stay in Buddha wisdom After hearing that all the dear uttered a sound May it be so Sarvashura because of those virtuous roots members of this great assembly will acquire Anuttarasamyaksambodhi Thereupon Sarvashura Bodhisattva Mahasattva said to the Buddha Bhagavan if anyone hears this Dharma how long will his life be The Buddha said His lifespan will be fully  kalpas Sarvashura Bodhisattva said Bhagavan what is the measure of kalpa The Buddha said Virtuous man for example suppose there is a big city which is  yojanas in length  yojanas in width and  yojanas in height and is filled up with nothing but sesame seeds A long life man takes a single sesame seed every  years In such a manner when the sesame seeds in the city is exhausted a kalpa is not yet at its end Sarvashura for another example suppose there is a big mountain which is  yojanas in length  yojanas in width and  yojanas in height A long life man whisks it one time with a silken cloth every  years In such a manner when the mountain is wiped off a kalpa is not yet at its end That is the measure of kalpa Then Sarvashura Bodhisattva said to the Buddha Bhagavan just one vow can gain the blissful virtues of  kalpas lifespan How much more so then of those who widely practice the teachings of Buddhas The Buddha said Virtuous man if anyone who hears this Sanghata DharmaGate his lifespan will be fully  kalpas and how much more so then of those who write read and recite this sutra Sarvashura anyone who reads and recites this DharmaGate with pure belief will get more blessings than the formers He will be able to know his past lifetimes for  kalpas will be a wheelturningsageking for  thousand kalpas and will be respected by people in his present existence and swords poisons and poisonous insects will not be able to harm him When he is about to die he will see  billion Buddhas and the Buddhas will comfort him You need not fear because you have heard the Sanghata DharmaGate when you were alive now you are welcome to any of the pure lands of  billion Buddhas Sarvashura how much more so of those who completely hear this DharmaGate Then Sarvashura Bodhisattva said to the Bhagavan Sarvashura anyone who hears this sutra will gain blessings and virtues as many as all the blessings and virtues of the Buddhas as many as Ganges river sands Sarvashura said Bhagavan I will never be tired of listening to this DharmaGate The Buddha told Sarvashura Good good you will never be tired of listening to Dharmas I also will never be tired of speaking Dharmas how come common earthlings would be weary Sarvashura if any virtuous person hears this DharmaGate and believes in it he will not fall into the evil paths for a thousand kalpas will not become an animal for  kalpas will not be ignorant for  thousand kalpas will not be born in remote border lands  for  thousand kalpas will be born with good looks for  thousand kalpas will be born in heaven for  thousand kalpas will be celibate for  thousand kalpas will be able to become a monk for  thousand kalpas will be a true Dharma king for  thousand kalpas will practice the Buddhas teachings and meditate on death for  thousand kalpas Be born as hellbeing hungry ghost or animal Sarvashura that virtuous person will never think of committing sins again so that no evil demons will get any opportunity to harm him and he will never be reborn in any womb Sarvashura if anyone hears this Sanghata DharmaGate no matter where he will be born he will not fall into evil paths for  Asamkhya  kalpas will be able to uphold the Dharma he had heard for  thousand kalpas will abandon killing for  thousand kalpas will abandon telling lies for  thousand kalpas will abandon slander for  thousand kalpas Sarvashura this DharmaGate is difficult to meet and even its name is difficult to hear Then Sarvashura Bodhisattva arose from his seat uncovered his right shoulder set his right knee on the ground joined his palms together and said to the Buddha Bhagavan if anyone slander this DharmaGate how many sins will he produce The Buddha said Bhagavan how many sins will he produce The Buddha said Do not ask that virtuous man If someone has illwill towards the Buddhas the Tathagatas as many as sands in  Ganges Rivers if another one slanders this DharmaGate the latter will produce more sins than the former Why Sarvashura if one slanders this true Dharma he is having illwill towards Mahayana that is like burning himself out Sarvashura Bodhisattva asked the Buddha For example if someone cut off his own head with the sword the doctor help him by applying rockcandy ghee and various medicines on his wound Sarvashura what do you think about that Would that person survive Sarvashura said No Bhagavan The Buddha said That one in the turning wheel of transmigration is like such Sarvashura for another example if someone fought against another and both got many sword wounds and then a good doctor came and cured them with good medicines Although they had committed evil karma they can repent and do not abandon correct Dharmas therefore they can gradually gather all the Dharmas that help them escape from births and deaths For another example when a person have exhausted the resultant karma that built up his current lifetime his parents may cry sorrowfully but cannot save their child Those common earthlings cannot profit either themselves or others Likewise those who do not cultivate virtuous karma will have no dependence when they are about to die Sarvashura there are two kinds of living beings who have no dependence Those of the first kind do immoral things and those of the second kind slander true Dharmas People of those two kinds will have no dependence at the time of their death Sarvashura Bodhisattva asked the Buddha Bhagavan where will those who slander Dharmas be born in The Buddha told Sarvashura They will suffer in the Big Crying Hell for one kalpa suffer in the Crushing Hell for one kalpa suffer in the Burning Hell for one kalpa suffer in the Extremely Burning Hell for one kalpa suffer in the Black Rope Hell for one kalpa suffer in the Avichi Hell for one kalpa suffer in the Hair Staring Hell for one kalpa suffer in the Whirr Hell for one kalpa Sarvashura the living beings who slander Dharmas will suffer in these eight huge hells for fully eight kalpas Then Sarvashura Bodhisattva said to the Buddha Bhagavan it is too painful too painful to hear Then the Bhagavan spoke the verse  It cannot be heard because it is too horrible Hells are extremely painful places in which living beings are suffering Those who do virtuous deeds will get happy rewards Those who do immoral deeds will get painful retributions Being alive the pain of death is coming Being tied by grief sorrows and pains the common earthlings are always suffering without any little bit of happiness In order to seek happiness the wise people yearn towards Buddhas and believe in the immaculate Mahayana then they will not fall into the evil paths even though the karma is small at the time we create it it will produce immense retribution Even though the seed is small it can bear plenty of fruits Cultivating the blissful fields of Buddha will produce the fruits of bliss and liberation Having peace and happiness the wise ones enjoy all BuddhaDharmas keeping away from the evil paths they practice all virtuous Dharmas If anyone donates even a little bit of thing to Buddhas he will be very rich and have plenty of treasures for  thousand kalpas He will always think of donating in whichever place he will be born So Sarvashura the blessings gained by donating to Buddhas are very many Then Sarvashura BodhisattvaMahasattva said to the Buddha Bhagavan how to cultivate the BuddhaWisdom How much will the virtuous roots grow by hearing this Sanghata DharmaGate The Buddha told Sarvashura If someone offers sustains and donates various goods to the Buddhas as many as  billion Gangesriversands if another one hear this DharmaGate the blessings and virtues he will gain are as many as that gained by the former Sarvashura Bodhisattva asked the Buddha Bhagavan when can the virtuous roots be perfect The Buddha told Sarvashura BodhisattvaMahasattva When ones merits and virtues are equal to those of a Buddha his virtuous roots are perfect Sarvashura asked Who has the merits and virtues that equal to those of a Tathagata The Buddha said Virtuous man a DharmaTeacher has the virtuous roots that equal to those of a Tathagata Sarvashura Bodhisattva asked Bhagavan who is the DharmaTeacher The Buddha told Sarvashura Bodhisattva The one who circulates this Sanghata DharmaGate is called DharmaTeacher Sarvashura Bodhisattva asked the Buddha Bhagavan How many merits will one gain by hearing this DharmaGate And how many merits will one gain by writing reading and reciting this DharmaGate The Buddha told Sarvashura Bodhisattva Virtuous man suppose that at each of the ten directions there are  Gangesriversands Buddhas each of those Buddhas stay in the world and preach Dharmas for fully  kalpas If there is a virtuous man who preaches this Sanghata DharmaGate his merits and virtues will be equal to that of those Tathagatas If there is a virtuous man who writes this sutra then the Buddhas as many as  Gangesriversands cannot finish proclaiming his merits and virtues How much more so then of those who write read recite and uphold this sutra Sarvashura Bodhisattva asked the Buddha How many blessings will one gain by reading and reciting this sutra Then the Buddha answered in a gatha  The supreme blessings gained by reading even four sentences of the gathas of this sutra are equal to the blessings of the Dharmas that taught by the Buddhas as many as  Gangesriversands The blessings and merits gained by reading this DharmaGate are so many that no words can fully express them even if  billion Buddhas stay in the world for fully one kalpa All Buddhas of the ten directions are constantly glorifying the Dharmas of Mahayana they have always been preaching this DharmaGate and will never stop Meeting the Buddha is difficult so do meeting this Dharma At the time  billion gods came to the Buddha joined their palms together paid homage to the Buddha and asked How virtuous Bhagavan We wish that such DharmaStore can stay in Jambudvipa At that time  trillion Nirgranthas also came to the Buddha and said  Sramana Gautama we are superior to you The Buddha said to the Nirgranthas Tathagatas are always superior indeed you people believe in inverted theories how could you be superior Because of that now you should listen carefully In order to benefit all of you I have some words for you Mundane persons have neither wisdom nor joyance How could they be superior They do not know the correct Way How could they be superior I discern the destinies of living beings with the extremely deep Buddhaeye Those Nirgranthas then became angry with the Bhagavan At that time having seen that with his heavenly eyes SakradevanamIndra took up a Vajrapestle rubbed his weapon and aimed it at the Nirgranthas The  trillion Nirgranthas then panicked and cried sadly Subsequently the Tathagata disappeared from their sight Not seeing the Tathagata the Nirgranthas wept sorrowfully and said Neither parents nor brothers can save us it is like we see only wilderness and big marsh and cannot find the footpath In such a place there is no water or shade of a tree and also no other person Without companion we are suffering alone We suffer so much because we cannot see the Tathagata Then the Nirgranthas arose from their seat knelt with the right knee and cried out loudly Tathagata compassionate one please save us we are now willing to rely on the Buddha The Bhagavan then smiled and said to Sarvashura BodhisattvaMahasattva Virtuous man you should go to the Exteriorpath practitioners Nirgranthas dwelling to preach Dharmas for them  Exteriorpath Bhagavan for example all other mountains can not surpass the Sumeru Mountain King likewise Bhagavan in front of the Tathagata I dare not to preach Dharma At that time the Bhagavan told Sarvashura BodhisattvaMahasattva The Tathagata has many expedient means Sarvashura you should go to look through all the worlds of the ten directions where are the Tathagatas In which place do they set up their Tathagatathrones Sarvashura I will be in the Nirgranthas dwelling and preach Dharmas for them Sarvashura Bodhisattva then asked the Buddha Bhagavan by whose holy power shall I go Should I go by my own holy power or by the Buddhas holy power The Buddha told Sarvashura You should go by your own holy power and return by the Buddhas holy power Then Sarvashura BodhisattvaMahasattva arose from his seat uncovered his right shoulder bowed to the Buddha and thereupon disappeared The Bhagavan then preach Dharmas for the Nirgranthas Being alive is suffering being alive is agonizing There are lots of fears in the lifetime Having been born one will suffer from illness aging and death will suffer from imprisonments robberies water disasters fire disasters wind disasters whirlpools disasters toxins and will suffer from the misfortunes that are caused by his own karmas Then those Exteriorpath practitioners were frightened they said to the Buddha Bhagavan from now on we can no longer endure being alive After the Bhagavan had preached that Dharma those  trillion Exteriorpath practitioners removed themselves from dust and defilement set their mind on AnuttaraSamyakSambodhi and subsequently all of them achieved the tenth Bhumi Being great Bodhisattvas they then manifested various holy powers Some of them transformed themselves to elephants horses lions tigers goldenwingsbirds on the thrones When manifesting those supernatural powers and transformations  billion Bodhisattvas of them were in the south and other  billion Bodhisattvas were in the north At the same time the Tathagata was in Samadhi like he always does and simultaneity speaking Dharmas for all living beings with many expedient means Seven days after traveling by his own holy power Sarvashura Bodhisattva had reached the LotusSupremacy world and the Tathagata had knew that Then by the holy power of the Buddha Sarvashura Bodhisattva suddenly returned to where the Buddha was as quick as a vigorous person bend and extend his arm Having arrived he circumambulated the Buddha clockwise three times joined his palms together and bowed to the Buddha with pure mind and said Bhagavan I had traveled through numerous Buddhawords of the ten directions By one of my holy powers I saw  trillion Buddhaworlds by the second of my holy powers I saw  trillion Buddhaworlds and so on Unto the seventh day I had been to LotusSupremacy world and also had been to the world of immovable Tathagata Bhagavan in one of those worlds I saw that  trillion Buddhas were preaching Dharmas and saw that  trillion Buddhas in  trillion worlds had attained AnuttaraSamyakSambodhi on that very day I made offerings to all of them and proceeded on my way Bhagavan on that very day I had also been to  quadrillion Buddhawords and saw that  quadrillion Bodhisattvas left home and attained AnuttaraSamyakSambodhi Bhagavan I respectfully paid homage to all of them circumambulated them clockwise three times and proceeded on my way Bhagavan afterwards I had been to  billion worlds and saw  billion Buddhas I made offerings and respectfully paid homage to all of them and proceeded on my way Bhagavan I also saw that in  billion worlds  billion Tathagatas entered Nirvana I made offerings and respectfully paid homage to all of them and proceeded on my way Bhagavan I also saw that in  billion worlds the TrueDharmas of the Buddhas had completely disappeared I then became worrying and wept sorrowfully At that time I saw that the gods dragons Yaksas were also worrying and weeping sorrowfully just like some arrows had ripped into their hearts Bhagavan those worlds were being burnt by kalpafire all the oceans and Sumeru Mountains had been burnt up with no remains I then also made offerings to those worlds and proceeded on my way So as to the LotusSupremacy world Bhagavan when I arrived at that world I saw that trillions of thrones had been set up Bhagavan in the south of that world I saw that trillions of thrones had been set up in each direction of the east the west the north the upside and the downside trillions of thrones had also been set up Bhagavan each of those thrones is made from the seven treasures On every throne there was a Tathagata sitting crosslegged in the lotus position and preaching Dharma for the public Bhagavan having seen that I thought How rare it is and I asked those Bhagavans What is the name of this world One of those Buddhas answered me Virtuous man this worlds name is LotusSupremacy Bhagavan I then bowed to those Buddhas and asked What is the name of the Tathagata the Bhagavan That Buddha answered me The Buddha who constantly performs BuddhaActivities in this world is named LotusRepository I asked again There are innumerable Tathagatas in this world which is the body of LotusRepository Tathagata That Bhagavan said I will show you the LotusRepository Buddha Thereupon all other Buddhas disappeared only one Buddha remained all others on the thrones were Bodhisattvas At that time I bowed to the Buddha and then a thrown emerged from the Earth I sat on that thrown crosslegged in the lotus position and then suddenly innumerable thrones also emerged with no one sitting on them I asked that Buddha How come these thrones are empty That Buddha that Bhagavan then told me Virtuous man the living beings who do not cultivate their virtuous roots can not join this congregation Bhagavan I then asked that Tathagata Bhagavan which virtuous root is needed for joining this congregation That Buddha then told me Listen attentively virtuous man By the virtuous root of having heard the Sanghata DharmaGate one can be in this congregation and how much more so those who write read or recite this DharmaGate Sarvashura you are in this congregation because you had heard the Sanghata DharmaGate Those who have no virtuous root can not see this Buddha world I then said to that Buddha Bhagavan for anyone who hears this DharmaGate how many blessings and virtues will he gain Thereupon LotusRepository Tathagata smiled Bhagavan I then bowed and asked him Why the Buddha is smiling What is the reason for this rare scene LotusRepository Tathagata then said to me Virtuous man Sarvashura Bodhisattva suppose there is a wheelturning sage king who is very influential and ruling four worlds he has planted sesames everywhere and made the four worlds full of sesames So virtuous man is the number of those sesames very great I said Yes Bhagavan Sugata That Buddha said to me if some person gather those sesames to make a mass Sarvashura is there any person able to count the number of the sesames in that mass one by one I said to that Bhagavan They are uncountable Sugata Bhagavan LotusRepository Tathagata then told me Virtuous man if the Buddhas as many as those sesames together speak the merits and virtues gained by hearing this sutra they will never be able to finish speaking it Bhagavan how many blessings one will gain by writing this DharmaGate That Buddha told me Virtuous man for example suppose there are wheel turning kings as many as the sum of the sands dusts trees leaves grass woods so is the merits of all those wheel turning kings countable I said to that Buddha Bhagavan they are uncountable Sugata That Buddha told me Virtuous man all the blessings of those wheel turning kings are less than the blessings gained by hearing this Dharma For anyone who writes even one word of this DharmaGate his merits will be more than the blessings and virtues of all those wheel turning kings In fact virtuous man this DharmaGate converges all true Dharmas of Mahayana the blessings and virtues of wheel turning kings can not compare with it This DharmaGate can reveal the Dharma stores eliminate all afflictions light up the great DharmaTorch subdue the evil demons illuminate the abodes of all Bodhisattvas and preach all Dharmas At that time I said to that Buddha Yes virtuous man BrahmaPractice is rare and valuable If anyone carries out BrahmaPractice he will be able to constantly see the Tathagatas days and nights once he see the Tathagatas he will be able to see the Buddha worlds once he see the Buddha worlds he will be able to see the Dharma Store At the time of his death he will not fear will not be born in any wombs so that he will no longer suffer from the afflictions and will no longer be submerged by the river of sexual desire  BrahmaCarya Pure practices the practice that involves the cutting off of desire especially sexual desire Strictly speaking Brahmapractice means no leak of sexual energy that is no sexual intercourse no ejaculation no spermatorrhea no menses etc That Bhagavan then said again to me Virtuous man the Tathagatas appearances on the worlds are difficult to encounter I said Yes Bhagavan yes Sugata the Tathagatas appearances on the worlds are difficult to encounter That Buddha told me Sarvashura if anyone can hear this DharmaGate through his ear he will be able to remember his previous lifetimes for  kalpas will become wheel turning kings for  thousand kalpas will become SakraDevanamIndra for  thousand kalpas will become gods of the PureDwelling heavens for  thousand kalpas will become great Brahma gods for  thousand kalpas will not be reborn in the evil destinies for  thousand kalpas will not become a hungry ghost for  thousand kalpas will not become an animal for  thousand kalpas will not become an Asura for  billion and  thousand kalpas so he will not be hurt by the sword or glaives He also will not become an ignorant being for  thousand kalpas will have plenty of wisdom for  thousand kalpas and will have handsome appearances for  thousand kalpas with all the good characteristics just like the body of the Tathagata He will not become a woman for  thousand kalpas will not have illness for  thousand kalpas will have the heavenly eyes for  thousand kalpas will not become a dragon for  thousand kalpas will be free from anger for  thousand kalpas will not be born in any poor family for  thousand kalpas and will rule two worlds for  thousand kalpas Even if he is the poorest person he still will obtain these pleasures Also He will not become blind for  thousand kalpas will not become deaf for  thousand kalpas will cultivate forbearance for  thousand kalpas When he is about to die and his consciousness is about to disappear he will not have any upsidedown thought and will not be angry then he will see the  Gangesriversands Buddhas Tathagatas in the east will personally see the  billion Buddhas in the south will personally see the  Gangesriversands Buddhas Tathagatas in the west will personally see the  Gangesriversands Buddhas Tathagatas in the north will personally see the  billion Gangesriversands Buddhas Bhagavans in the above direction and will personally see the  billion Gangesriversands Buddhas Bhagavans in the downward direction Virtuous man those Bhagavans will comfort that person Virtuous man do not fear You had heard and accept the Sanghata DharmaGate Virtuous man do you see these trillions of Buddhas Bhagavans as many as numerous Gangesriversands Yes I have seen he will answer Then the Bhagavans will tell him These Tathagata have arrived to see you That virtuous person would ask What virtuous things have I done so that the Buddhas come to see me Those Buddhas will say Virtuous man when you were a human being you had heard the Sanghata DharmaGate because of that so many Buddhas come to see you That virtuous person would say to the Buddhas Bhagavans having heard of a little of the Sanghata DharmaGate I can obtain so many blessings how much more so those who fully accept and uphold the sutra Then those Buddhas will tell him Virtuous man that is hard to calculate Now I am just telling you the merits and virtues gained by hearing four lines of verse of the sutra Virtuous man the blessings and virtues that will be gained by hearing this DharmaGate are more than all the blessings and virtues of  Gangesriversands Buddhas Tathagatas If some person has offered and sustained  Gangesriversands Buddhas Tathagatas and if another person has heard four lines of verse of this DharmaGate the blessings and virtues gained by the later person are more than those gained by the former person and how much more so those who have completely heard this Dharma That Buddha told me again Virtuous man suppose the threethousandgreatthousand worlds are full of sesames and there are wheel turning kings as many as those sesames If some person donates to those wheelturning kings then it would be more beneficial to donate to one Srotaapanna if he donates to all Pratyekabuddhas in the threethousandgreatthousand worlds the blessings and virtues that he gains are less than those gained by donating to one Bodhisattva if he donates to all Bodhisattvas in the threethousandgreatthousand worlds it would be more beneficial to arouse pure mind towards one Tathagata but if he arouses pure mind towards all Tathagatas in the threethousandgreatthousand worlds and another mundane person hears this DharmaGate then the merits and virtues gained by the later person are much greater and how much more so those who write read recite and uphold it Sarvashura How much more so if some person can keep remembering this sutra with pure mind Sarvashura what do you think can any mundane person measure the great oceans with no tool I said Sarvashura what do you think can any mundane person hold all water of an ocean by using his fingers to pinch the ocean one time I answered No Bhagavan That Buddha told me Likewise those who delight in the lesser Dharmas are not able to hear and accept this DharmaGate Sarvashura if one had not seen  billion Gangesriversands Buddhas Tathagatas he would not be able to write this DharmaGate if one had not seen  billion Gangesriversands Tathagatas he would not be able to hear this DharmaGate if one had seen  trillion Tathagatas then he will not slander this DharmaGate when he hears it Sarvashura if one had seen  trillion Gangesriversands Tathagatas then he will be able to arouse the pure belief when he hears this DharmaGate he will think correctly and will not slander it If anyone can write even four lines of verse from this DharmaGate he will be reborn in Amitabha Buddhas world which is  trillion worlds away from here and he will gain a lifespan of  thousand kalpas Sarvashura if anyone had personally committed or asked others to commit or compliantly rejoiced the five heinous sins he would suffer in the five uninterrupted hells but if he can hear even four lines of verse from this Dharma then all those sins will be cleared Then that Buddha said these Gatha for me Now listen to me about the merits and virtues of hearing this Sutra In the past there was a person who had committed all the five heinous karmas including killing his parents destroying the solidarity of Sanghas demolishing the towers disturbing the Samadhis of Bodhisattvas and mangling the Buddha Dharmas Having committed those sins he became repentant worrying and weeping he thought I have committed many evil karmas which will destroy not only my present body but also the bodies of my consequent lifetimes for many kalpas I had lost both the mundanedharmas and the supermundanedharmas my virtuous roots are destroyed so that they cannot grow for immeasurable kalpas Just like a hall decorated with beautiful paintings suddenly be burnt by a fire then people will no longer like it Wherever I will be born in my consequent lifetimes the others will always despise strike scold and insult me poverty hunger and thirst will always be with me I will suffer from myriads of afflictions such retributions are all come from the five karmas that I had committed How miserable I am now who can save me So why not just go to the summit of a high mountain and jump down to end this life to avoid committing more evil karma and producing more afflictions My present lifetime and coming lifetimes are destroyed by the evil karmas both inside and outside my body there is not any dependence At that time from the sky a heavenly god said to him Because of your ignorance various afflictions have been born from your heart and you have no dependence or savior You yourself have committed the five heinous karmas Including killing your parents and so forth thus you are worrying now and willing to climb to a high mountain and kill yourself The holy Way of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas You are not yet able to proceed to Having reached there he found a supernatural person then bowed deeply with his face touching the ground joined his palms and said Please supernatural one please save me In days and nights when drinking eating sitting and lying I am always worrying without any little bit of happiness Now I believe and respect you supernatural one please tell me how to clear those evil karmas that I committed The supernatural person said to him Please sit down and listen you are so frightened and worrying you should confess your evil karmas The supernatural person continued to say You are so worrying hungry thirsty and helpless now I give you some food why not eat them first then I will speak Dharma for you to make all your sinful karmas cleared After eating The regretful person washed his hands circumambulate the supernatural person clockwise bowed to the supernatural one withdrew and sat down The supernatural person asked What evil karmas you have committed he answered I have killed my parents demolished the towers destroyed the solidarity of Sanghas disturbed the Samadhis of Bodhisattvas and mangled the Buddha Dharmas The supernatural one then said You are indeed an immoral person so that you have committed such evil karmas After hearing those words the person became more worrying for fear that he was not savable and will surely fall into evil reincarnations He then arose from his seat bowed to the feet of the supernatural person and said Supernatural one please pity me the one who have extremely weighty evil karmas I am agonizing and worrying so much please be my refuge Although I have confessed I do not know the way to escape Do not fear I can save you and reduce your evil karma retributions Now you just listen have you ever heard of a DharmaGate called Sanghata He replied No I havent heard of it The supernatural person said Who can speak Dharma for a person burnt by fire only the great compassionate ones can The supernatural person continued In the distant past immeasurable and boundless Asamkhya kalpas ago there was a king named PureMoon  who ruled the world according to correct Dharmas When the king PureMoon got a son he summoned an augural master to foretell the childs signs of virtue and evil The augur told the king According to my observation This child has very unpropitious signs The king asked When this child is seven years old he will kill his parents The king said I would rather let him kill me than kill my son A human body is difficult to obtain One has to cultivate for innumerable kalpas to obtain a human body thus one should not kill any living beings using his human body One month after the birth of the child he was already like a oneyearold child Knowing that the son will kill him The king PureMoon abdicated the crown to the son saying You are the ruler of this kingdom from now on you can use all money and possessions freely and you should rule the kingdom according to the correct Dharmas and do not commit nondharmas acts After his abdication the king PureMoon no longer give command in his kingdom At that time many ministers came to the king PureMoon and said to him Great king why did you give away your kingship The king replied I have been dealing with the affairs of kingdoms for many kalpas now I am tired of that thus I abandoned it to practice Dharmas Not long after The son committed the heinous sin by killing both his father and mother The supernatural person continued I remember that after killing his parents the son became worried He wept sorrowfully reproached himself and repented At that time I spoke the Dharmas for him with the great compassionate heart and his heinous sin was cleared after hearing the Dharma The person then asked What Dharma did you speak at that time The supernatural one answered What I spoke at that time was Sanghata DharmaGate If one hears this Dharma He will achieve Anuttarasamyaksambodhi clear all sins and conquer and cease all delusions Now listen I will speak it for you to make you achieve the liberation quickly after hearing it If you can be mindful of even four Gathas of it uninterruptedly You will get immeasurable blessings By practicing it You will extinguish all your sins and become a Srotaapanna  You will practice charity be distant from afflictions and liberate living beings from sufferings and fears The person then joined his palms bowed to the feet of the supernatural one and praised you are really a virtuous knowledgeable one who is good at clearing all nonvirtuous karmas and good at expounding the Sanghata DharmaGate Also Virtuous are all who listen At that time from the sky  thousand heavenly gods went to where the supernatural one was joined their palms bowed to his feet and said Great supernatural one  for the events you just recalled when did they happen  Four dragon kings and  hundred billion Yaksa kings also arrived there bowed to his feet and asked For the events you just recalled when did these happen  The great supernatural one answered Those events that I recalled had happened hundreds of thousands of billions Asamkhya kalpas before The visitors asked What virtuous roots allow you remember the events of so long ago He answered Because I had heard and accepted the Sanghata DharmaGate in that congregation everyone who heard this DharmaGate and aroused pure faith was awarded the mark of Anuttarasamyaksambodhi If anyone had committed the five heinous sins after hearing this DharmaGate all those sins will be cleared in a moment For innumerable hundreds of thousands of billions of kalpas doors to the evil paths will be closed and paths to heavens will be open By hearing just four gathas of this DharmaGate one can gain such merits and virtues how much more so of those who write read and recite it make offerings to it with flowers incenses streamers canopies etc respect and pay homage to it join their palms and bow to it and praise it even with one word such merits and virtues will be unimaginable Having stated what LotusRepository Tathagata had spoken about the Sanghata DharmaGate Sarvashura Bodhisattva asked Sakyamuni Buddha Virtuous man suppose someone has personally committed or asked others to commit or compliantly rejoiced in the five heinous sins if he can hear even four gathas from this DharmaGate join his palms pay homage to it and have pure faith in it then his five heinous karma will be eliminated How much more so of those who fully write read recite and make offerings to it such merits and virtues are immeasurable  Virtuous man for example Anavatapta Lake  which the light of the sun cannot reach is the source of the five great rivers Sarvashura do you think that any one can count all the water drops of those five great rivers one by one Sarvashura replied No Bhagavan The Buddha said to Sarvashura Bodhisattva Mahasattva The virtuous roots gained by hearing this DharmaGate are like that if someone were to count them he would not be able to finish even if he did the counting for hundreds of thousands of myriads of kalpas Sarvashura what do you think is it difficult to hear this DharmaGate even for a moment Sarvashura said Yes Bhagavan it is difficult The Buddha told Sarvashura Having faith in this DharmaGate is more difficult than that The merits gained by the believers are like the water drops of the five great rivers that originate from the Anavatapta Lake they are countless Sarvashura Bodhisattva Mahasattva asked the Buddha Bhagavan what are those five great rivers The Buddha told Sarvashura Bodhisattva The five great rivers are Ganges river Sita river Vaksa river Yamuna river and Chandrabhaga river they all flow into the oceans Each of these five great rivers has five hundred small rivers as its branches Sarvashura there are also five great rivers in the sky each of which has one thousand small rivers as its branches Sarvashura Bodhisattva asked the Buddha What are those five great rivers each of which has one thousand branches The Buddha told Sarvashura Bodhisattva The first river with one thousand branches is called Sudhara the second river with one thousand branches is called Shamkha the third river with one thousand branches is called Vahanti the fourth river with one thousand branches is called Chitrasena and the fifth river with one thousand branches is called Dharmavritta Sarvashura these five great rivers often benefit Jambudvipa They often produce rains to make flowers and fruits grow and the pure water that they rain down to Jambudvipa also make crops grow  Sarvashura the worldprotecting heavenly gods comfort and please Jambudvipa Likewise this Sutra benefits comforts and pleases all living beings in Jambudvipa like the gods of the Thirtythree Heavens  Sarvashura Bodhisattva asked the Buddha Bhagavan what is the Heaven of the thirtythree gods  The Buddha told Sarvashura Bodhisattva Where SakraDevanamIndra dwells in is the Heaven of the thirtythree gods Sarvashura the gods of that heaven always say if any living being practices virtuous speeches his merits and virtues will be countless if any living being practices evil speeches his sins will be countless so that he will fall into hell hungry ghosts and animals and suffer solely from great afflictions in those three evil paths of hell animal and hungry ghost with no salvation Those who practices evil speeches are evil advisors and those who practices virtuous speeches are virtuous advisors Meeting a virtuous advisor can make one see Tathagatas and seeing Tathagatas can clear all nonvirtuous dharma  in Jambudvipa Without hearing this DharmaGate one cannot achieve Anuttarasamyaksambodhi cannot turn the DharmaWheels cannot strike the DharmaDrum cannot sit on the Lion DharmaThrone cannot enter into the realm of Nirvana cannot achieve boundless luminosity and so forth Sarvashura without hearing this DharmaGate one cannot sit under the BodhiTree Sarvashura Bodhisattva Mahasattva then asked the Buddha Bhagavan I have a minor question and wish to ask the Bhagavan The Buddha said to Sarvashura Whatever you ask about I will remove your doubts Sarvashura said to the Buddha Who was the supernatural one that ferried the person who had committed the five heinous sins and made him stay in the nonretrograde stage The Buddha told Sarvashura Bodhisattva Virtuous man listen now the Tathagatas words are subtle and difficult to understand It was this Sanghata DharmaGate who manifested itself as a supernatural person and this DharmaGate can also appear as a Buddhas body For example in Ganges river the sands can be seen everywhere likewise this Dharma manifests itself to speak Dharma for people For example only a Buddha a Tathagata is equal to another Buddha likewise this Dharma is equal to a Buddha Wherever this Dharma exists the Buddhas are also there The Bhagavan continued to tell Sarvashura Bodhisattva Virtuous man I remember that  Asamkhya kalpas ago there was a Buddha called TreasureSuperior Tathagata and after him there were  billion Buddhas all of them were called TreasureSuperior too At that time my name was PureMoon I was practicing charity extensively those  billion Tathagatas were all offered and sustained by me I made offerings to them with clothes beds drinks foods soups medicines incenses flowers lamps and all delightful things but those Tathagatas did not award me the mark of AnuttaraSamyakSambodhi Sarvashura I also remember that in the past  billion Tathagatas had appeared in the world all of them were called PreciousLight At that time my name was DragonCorrectitude and I was also practicing charity extensively I made offerings to those Buddhas with fragrances flowers precious ornaments  etc and they did not award me the mark of AnuttaraSamyakSambodhi either Sarvashura I also remember that in the past  billion Buddhas had appeared in the world all of them were called Sikhin Thus Come One Worthy of offerings Of correct and universal knowledge I made offerings to those Buddhas with various delightful things and those Tathagatas did not award me the mark of AnuttaraSamyakSambodhi either Sarvashura I also remember that in the past  billion Buddhas all called Kasyapa had appeared in the world I made offerings to those Buddhas with fragrances flowers streamers canopies clothes and all delightful things and those Tathagatas did not award me the mark of AnuttaraSamyakSambodhi

giving away everything I made offerings to all those  billion Buddhas Tathagatas with fragrances flowers streamers canopies clothes beds foods drinks soups medicines etc any they did not award me the mark of AnuttaraSamyakSambodhi either Sarvashura I also remember that in the past  billion Buddhas Tathagatas had appeared in the world all of them were called Sakyamuni Worthy of offerings Of correct and universal knowledge I made offerings to all those  billion Sakyamuni Tathagatas with fragrances flowers streamers canopies drinks foods clothes beds soups medicines and all delightful things and they did not award me the mark of AnuttaraSamyakSambodhi either Sarvashura I also remember that in the past  million Buddhas had appeared in the world all of them were called Krakutsanda Thus Come One Worthy of offerings Of correct and universal knowledge I made offerings to those Buddhas with various fragrances flowers streamers canopies clothes beds drinks foods and all delightful things and those Tathagatas did not award me the mark of AnuttaraSamyakSambodhi either Sarvashura I also remember that in the past  billion Tathagatas had appeared in the world all of them were called Kanakamuni Thus Come One Worthy of offerings Of correct and universal knowledge I made offerings to all those Tathagatas with fragrances flowers streamers canopies clothes beds drinks foods soups medicines and all delightful things and those Tathagatas did not award me the mark of AnuttaraSamyakSambodhi either Sarvashura I also remember that in the past  billion Buddhas Tathagatas had appeared in the world

proper laws with various fragrances flowers precious ornaments  streamers canopies clothes beds drinks foods and all delightful things and worshiped and glorified those Tathagatas and they did not award me the mark of AnuttaraSamyakSambodhi either Sarvashura I also remember that in the past  billion Buddhas Tathagatas had appeared in the world all of them were called Vipasyin Thus Come One Worthy of offerings Of correct and universal knowledge At that time I was also a monk and made offerings to all those Tathagatas with flowers fragrances streamers canopies clothes drinks foods beds soups medicines and all delightful things and those Tathagatas did not award me the mark of AnuttaraSamyakSambodhi either The last Vipasyin Tathagata spoke this DharmaGate then after the living beings in Jambudvipa had heard that myriads of the seven treasures were rained down from the sky thereupon no one in Jambudvipa was poor At that time I was still not awarded the mark of AnuttaraSamyakSambodhi but heard a voice from the sky telling me You will be awarded the mark of AnuttaraSamyakSambodhi shortly Sarvashura Bodhisattva asked the Buddha Bhagavan when were you awarded the mark of AnuttaraSamyakSambodhi The Buddha told Sarvashura Bodhisattva Listen attentively virtuous man  billion Asamkhya kalpas after then a Buddha named BurningLamp  Thus Come One Worthy of offerings Of correct and universal knowledge had appeared in the world At that time I was a Manavaka and was carrying out pure practices in the dwelling of BurningLamp Buddha Once I saw the BurningLamp Tathagata I made offering to him with a sevenstemmed green lotus and transferred that virtuous root to AnuttaraSamyakSambodhi Right after that BurningLamp Tathagata awarded me the mark Manava in the future after an Asamkhya kalpa you will become a Buddha named Sakyamuni Thus Come One Worthy of offerings Of correct and universal knowledge Sarvashura at that time having heard the sound of the awarding of the mark I flew upward stayed in the sky at a height of twelve Talatrees and achieved the UncreatedDharmaForbearance  Then the pure practices that I had been cultivating for countless Asamkhya kalpas the correspondences with the Six Paramitas and the virtuous roots were all revealed in front of me I saw them like seeing an Amala fruit on my palm Sarvashura at that time I had made innumerable living beings stay in Virtuous Dharmas how much more so when I have now achieved AnuttaraSamyakSambodhi and am benefiting all living beings I observe living beings to find out how they should be ferried  and speak Dharma for them with expedient means according to their suitability For heavenly beings I appear as heavenly beings and speak Dharma for them in dragons palaces I appear as dragons and speak Dharma for them among Yaksas I appear as Yaksas and speak Dharma for them among hungry ghosts I appear as hungry ghosts and speak Dharma for them for human beings I appear as human beings and speak Dharma for them for those who should be enlightened through Buddhas Bodies I manifest Buddhas Bodies and speak Dharma for them for those who should be enlightened through Bodhisattvas Bodies I manifest Bodhisattvas Bodies and speak Dharma for them By observing living beings to find out how they should be ferried in such ways I manifest myself in front of the living beings and speak Dharma for them according to their suitability Sarvashura why do I use various expedient means and appear as various forms to speak Dharma for living beings Because after hearing the Dharma those living beings who have virtuous roots will have all their virtuous roots grow those who are miserly will begin to donate those who lack blessings and virtues will cultivate blessings and virtues will benefit themselves and others and meditate on death Because of hearing the Dharma they will produce such virtuous roots and their previous virtuous roots will also grow and become brighter then they will gain benefits throughout the long night and will be able to bring peace and happiness to heavenly and human beings Sarvashura once this DharmaGate reaches anyones ear it will produce countless merits and virtues Sarvashura at one time some living beings were discussing with each others about whether there are virtuous Dharma cultivations and the achievement of AnuttaraSamyakSambodhi The virtuous living beings said There are Dharmas which are donating cultivating virtuous speaking and so forth Such Dharmas can make us gain virtuous fruitrepayment up to the unsurpassed Way The ignorant persons said There is no Dharma no donating no virtuous or evil fruitions and no karmic rewards for virtuous speeches Those ignorant persons then gained tremendous sinful retributions of revolving within the evil paths They fell into hells and had been suffering from great bitter retributions for eight great kalpas had been Asuras for  kalpas had been reborn as ghosts and spirits for nine thousand kalpas had been hungry ghosts for twelve kalpas had been born dumb for fourteen thousand kalpas had died inside their mothers wombs myriads of times for sixteen thousand kalpas had been reborn as flesh lumps for twelve thousand kalpas and had been born blind for eleven kalpas Their parents said For this child that I have given birth to I have been toiling in vain I have been protecting the fetus for nine months and endured the afflictions of hunger thirst cold heat etc but cannot gain the repayment of my kindness from this child Sarvashura it is thus Those living beings who slander Dharma will fall into the categories of hell being animal and hungry ghost When they are about to die they will be shot and carried away by the arrow of worry Sarvashura those who had been practicing virtuous speaking had said There are Dharmas and donating and there are fruitrepayment for virtues and evils By reason of such virtuous roots those persons had been reborn in Uttarakuru  and enjoying heavenly bliss for  kalpas When their heavenly lifetimes ended they were reborn in Uttarakuru without entering wombs At that time their eyes saw hundreds of thousands of worlds all called PeaceandBliss and saw all the Buddhas in those worlds Then without a movement they achieved Sambodhi  and make them fully observe the pure precepts Moreover Sarvashura there are some living beings saying The Tathagatas ferry living beings  day and night but the realms of living beings did not come to an end Innumerable living beings had aroused the will to Bodhi innumerable living beings had been born in heavens and innumerable living beings had entered into Nirvana but it did not come to an end why At that time some Brahmans and other Exteriorpath practitioners said We should query Sramana Gautama about this Then  billion Exteriorpath practitioners including the Brahmans came to Rajagriha The Bhagavan then smiled kindly and radiantly Maitreya Bodhisattva then arose from his seat bowed to the feet of the Buddha joined his palms towards the Buddha and asked Bhagavan for what cause and relationship did the Tathagata smile If there is no cause and relationship the Tathagata will not manifest rare things Please Bhagavan tell us the reason for the smile The Buddha told Maitreya Bodhisattva Virtuous man listen attentively and I will tell you Maitreya today in this Rajagriha city there will be a great congregation Maitreya Bodhisattva asked the Buddha Bhagavan what gathering of beings will join the congregation Are they heavenly gods dragons Yaksas human beings or nonhuman beings The Buddha told Maitreya Bodhisattva Virtuous man many heavenly gods dragons Yaksas and so forth will come to the congregation and besides  thousand Brahmans and  billion Nirgranthas are coming to debate with me I will convince them and speak Dharma for them then the Brahmans will all arouse AnuttaraSamyakSambodhi Heart and the  billion Nirgranthas will all achieve the Reverse of Streams  Moreover  thousand dragon kings will come to the congregation and all will arouse AnuttaraSamyakSambodhi Heart after hearing my DharmaSpeech and six thousand billion lords of PureAbode heavens will also come to the congregation three thousand billion demons and their followers will also come to the congregation  thousand Asura kings will also come to the congregation and five hundred great kings and their followers will also come to the congregation and listen to my DharmaSpeech and after hearing the Dharma they will all arouse AnuttaraSamyakSambodhi Heart  PureAbode heavens the five heavens of formmaterial realm above the heavens of desire realm Then Maitreya Bodhisattva arose from his seat bowed to the feet of the Buddha circumambulated the Buddha clockwise three times and suddenly disappeared At that time Sarvashura Bodhisattva Mahasattva arose from his seat uncovered his right shoulder placed his right knee on the ground joined his palms towards the Buddha and said to the Buddha Bhagavan what are the names of those five hundred kings The Buddha told Sarvashura Listen attentively virtuous man The first one is called Joyful King the second is called Virtuous Joy King the third is called Upananda the forth is called Superior Jump King the fifth is called Brahma Commander King the sixth is called Brahma Sound King the seventh is called Virtuous Vision King the eighth is called Virtuous Bliss King the ninth is called Joyful Commander King the tenth is called Joyful Righteous King the eleventh is called Bimbisara King the twelfth is called Prasenajit King the thirteenth is called Growth King and so forth Such five hundred great kings each has hundreds of billions of followers will all arouse AnuttaraSamyakSambodhi Heart except the Growth King Moreover from the east three thousand billion BodhisattvaMahasattvas will come to the congregation from the south five thousand billion Bodhisattvas will come to the congregation from the west six thousand billion Bodhisattvas will come to the congregation from the north eight thousand billion Bodhisattvas will come to the congregation from the downward direction nine thousand billion Bodhisattvas will come to the congregation and from the upward direction ten thousand billion Bodhisattvas will come to the congregation Those Bodhisattva who are all of the tenth Bhumi will come to this Rajagriha great city the location of the Tathagata They will never retrograde from AnuttaraSamyakSambodhi At that time the Bhagavan said to Sarvashura Bodhisattva Mahasattva Virtuous man go to the BuddhaWorlds in the ten directions and tell those Bodhisattvas The Tathagata is speaking great Dharma in Rajagriha city today you Bodhisattvas in the ten directions should all join your palms and pay homage And you should come back quickly to listen to the Dharma among the congregation Sarvashura Bodhisattva then arose from his seat bowed to the feet of the Buddha circumambulated the Buddha three times and suddenly disappeared Thereupon Sarvashura Bodhisattva traveled to the worlds in the ten directions and told those Bodhisattvas Today the Tathagata is speaking great Dharma in Rajagriha city you all should praise How virtuous it is  so that you will gain everlasting peaces bliss and benefits Then having traveled to the worlds in the ten directions and made offerings to the Buddhas and delivered the message to the Bodhisattvas Sarvashura Bodhisattva returned to this world Just in the time it takes for a vigorous man to bend and extend his arm Sarvashura reached Rajagriha city and appeared in front of the Tathagata At that time all those Brahmans and Exteriorpath practitioners had congregated many heavenly gods dragons Yaksas Asuras human and nonhuman beings had also joined the congregation the five hundred great kings and their followers had also joined the congregation and three thousand billion demons and their followers had also joined the congregation At that time in Rajagriha city the earth shook greatly in all BuddhaWorlds of the ten directions myriads of sandalwoods powdered incenses and wonderful heavenly flowers were rained down they fell on the Tathagata and then became a great platform made of flowers and many Vajra Mighty Ones who were holding Vajrapestles appeared in front of the Tathagata At that time from the four directions there came four Lords of wind They entered into Rajagriha city and blew away the citys excrements dirt dusts and sands Then in the worlds of the ten directions myriads of fragrant water Utpala flowers Kumuda flowers and Pundarika flowers were rained down and transformed into great canopies in the sky Moreover there appeared in the sky eight thousand and four hundred billion lionthrones made of the seven treasures and on each of the thrones was a Buddha speaking wonderful Dharma At that time the threethousandgreatthousand worlds shook in six ways Then Sarvashura Bodhisattva Mahasattva asked the Buddha Bhagavan for what cause and relationship did such rare things appear in Rajagriha city The Buddha said to Sarvashura Bodhisattva Virtuous man listen carefully Suppose there was a person who was poor but arrogant One day he went in front of the gate of the kings palace and due to his arrogance he entered it directly The guards then caught him hit him and tied him up Having heard that someone entered directly into the royal gate the king thought This person must want to murder me so that he entered directly Then the king became angry and ordered his officers Execute this person and his parents brothers and sisters that persons relations then became worried and wept sorrowfully Likewise when the Tathagata is speaking Dharma the mundane persons who are arrogant having seen the Buddhas body and heard the Dharma speaking might say various words according to their arrogance They might adhere to egotism might not listen or accept the Dharma much less that they would speak Dharma If someone says even one verse or one simile they also might not listen or accept it They might say I had already known such things Why Because they are in the state of Selfarrogance Or a person might be proud of his wide knowledge and therefore become indolent He might stay together with fools or ignorant persons without hearing correct Dharma Being proud of his wide knowledge he might be indolent and speak not according to the correct Dharma He might create sermons by himself and preach to all people in the world He might cheat himself by saying You should offer money to me if you have because I am the farmland of blessings Such an ignorant person cheats both himself and the world He accepts offerings given by his believers but he does not deserve it therefore he becomes greatly frightened when he is about to die When others ask him You have many techniques why dont you save yourself he will answer Now my techniques cannot save myself I am sorrowful and worrying His followers might say But we had killed our parents and relations on account of you It is like thus many living beings fall into hells or become animals or hungry ghosts because they draw themselves near to evil advisers Therefore the Buddha said to the Brahmans and Nirgranthas Do not be lazy For example a baby bird who has not yet grown his feathers and wings cannot fly high in the sky likewise you have no holy power so that you cannot fly to the realm of Nirvana And what you are practicing which is not the ultimate Way will finally decay When you are about to die you will regret I have gained this body and lifetime in vain because my practices cannot gain heavenly bliss human happiness or Nirvana This body of mine is wasted what path of transmigration will I go to What body will I have Then the Bhagavan told the Brahmans and Nirgranthas  the exteriorpath practitioners saying It is like a great treasure in Jambudvipa which fulfills all your wishes in the midst of the Buddhas Dharma treasures you should not study others If you have any question just ask the Tathagata and the Buddha will analyze and explain for you Then the Brahmans and Nirgranthas all arose from their seats uncovered their right shoulders placed their right knees on the ground joined their palms paid homage to the Buddha and said to the Buddha Bhagavan days and nights the Tathagatas ferry living beings from birth and death to the shore of liberation but the realm of living beings does not expand or shrink Bhagavan why are living beings still coming into being and vanishing uninterruptedly At that time in order to light up a great Dharma Torch  to ask about a great thing Medicine King Army  Bodhisattva Mahasattva who was sublimed by his great vows said to the Buddha Bhagavan in the future there will be no young living beings or old living beings who come into being and vanish The Buddha said to Medicine King Army Living beings become old and then become young again it is in this way that they come into being and vanish Virtuous man for example a person washed his hair and came out from his house wearing a new cloth when others saw him they said How nice it is that he washed his hair and is wearing a new clean cloth  And another person also washed his hair and wore an old but washed cloth Although his old cloth was washed others said It is nice that his hair is washed but his cloth is not good Likewise Medicine King Army being old is considered not good in Jambudvipa but being young though it is considered good it is also in births and deaths Then the Brahmans and Nirgranthas asked the Buddha Bhagavan who are called old and who are young The Buddha told those Exteriorpath practitioners Those who frequently fall into the categories of hungry ghosts animals hell beings and so forth and suffer from that but never feel tired of it are called old beings Then all the Brahmans heavenly gods dragons and great kings said to the Buddha Bhagavan we can no longer bear to suffer from births and deaths At that time the Nirgranthas said Then there is no young living being at all Then Medicine King Army said to the Buddha Bhagavan see how difficult it is to ferry these living beings  The Buddha said to Medicine King Army Bodhisattva The Tathagata will analyze and explain it today you should listen attentively Now there are  billion youths  in the presence of the Tathagata they did not pay obeisance to and did not inquire after the Tathagata Medicine King Army Bodhisattva asked the Buddha Bhagavan why is it that these living beings did not pay obeisance to and did not inquire after the Tathagata and did not request the Buddha to solve their doubts The Buddha told Medicine King Army Bodhisattva Virtuous man listen attentively and I will tell you Virtuous man if someone says that there is no young living being at all he should know that these youths are young living beings Those youths then said We are young living beings Bhagavan we are young living beings The Buddha said Yes yes you are young living beings Although you are called young you have been cultivating and practicing for eons At that time those  billion youths all gained the tenth stage  they flied upward and stayed in the sky Medicine King Army Bodhisattva then said to the Buddha Bhagavan these living beings are joyful that they have gained the great benefit and have terminated their births and deaths Bhagavan these living beings are free from births and deaths and are staying at the tenth stage At that time the dragons kings demons and their followers and the Exteriorpath practitioners  the Brahmans and Nirgranthas came close to the Buddha and said to the Buddha Bhagavan we have come to where the Buddha is to listen to this DharmaGate We wish that we will all gain the wonderful and beautiful body of the Tathagata  will have the same appearance as the Tathagata we wish that we will have the correct and universal omniscience like the Tathagata The Buddha said Yes yes virtuous men you have come to where the Buddha is to listen to this DharmaGate and have aroused AnuttaraSamyakSambodhi Heart you will achieve AnuttaraSamyakSambodhi shortly Right after the Tathagata had spoken those words that host of beings including those Exteriorpath practitioners all achieved the UncreatedDharmaForbearance  and became Bodhisattvas of the tenth stage Then those Bodhisattvas by using their own supernatural power ascended into the sky at a height of seven Talatrees miraculously created myriads of mansions made of the seven treasures to make offering to the Tathagata and manifested myriads of transcendental transformations At that time being mindful of the Buddha the gods of heavens rained down from the sky myriads of wonderful flowers onto the Tathagata and an idea arose in their minds that their own bodies are BuddhaBodies Innumerable hundreds of thousands of Chiefs of heavenly gods scattered flowers upon the Buddha and said What a great benefit that they have gained Sramana Gautama is really a great excellent farmland of blessings for the universe He fully has all the Samadhis and unrestricted powers therefore those living beings who have gained expedient means of Dharma gradually can be free from births and deaths by just one virtuous speech of the Buddha At that time Medicine King Army Bodhisattva Mahasattva arose from his seat uncovered his right shoulder joined his palms and said to the Buddha Bhagavan for what cause and relationship did those heavenly lords speak such words manifest such supernatural scenes and praise the Tathagata The Buddha told Medicine King Army Bodhisattva Virtuous man those Bodhisattvas were not praising me they were praising themselves because they were sitting on the throne of Dharma King and emitting forth the light of Dharma from their own bodies They are protected by all Buddhas and speak Dharma with the Correct Awakening  AnuttaraSamyakSambodhi Then Medicine King Army Bodhisattva Mahasattva asked the Buddha Bhagavan the great virtuous World Honored Ones ferry innumerable living beings day and night but living beings are still endless why The Bhagavan said to Medicine King Army Bodhisattva Mahasattva How virtuous how virtuous virtuous man that you can ask the Tathagata about this Virtuous man for example there is a very rich person who has lots of servants extensive farmlands houses gardens forests and plenty of paddies rice barleys wheat beans sorghums sesames and so forth He plants all the crops in spring when the crops are mature he harvests them and stores them separately In every year he repeats the same work again and again Medicine King Army living beings are like such Because of the causes and relationships affected by their karma they separately plant various seeds some are virtuous and some are evil when these karma mature the fruitrepayments they gain are also separately obtained When they are mature they will produce all virtuous Dharmas when the virtuous Dharmas are produced the Bodhisattvas will gain the great joy Medicine King Army because of their joyful heart they will not lose their blissful repayments even though hundreds of billions of kalpas elapse Then Medicine King Army they are called the Bodhisattvas who have initially aroused their hearts They will not fall into the evil categories  and will know all Dharmas collectively Medicine King Army Bodhisattva asked the Buddha Bhagavan why do the Bodhisattvas who have initially aroused their hearts have dreams The Buddha told Medicine King Army Bodhisattva Virtuous man a Bodhisattva who has initially aroused his heart will dream of many frightening things why Because almost all of his karma are purified thus he cannot suffer from any affliction bodily then being affected by the remaining sins he will dream of frightening things Medicine King Army Bodhisattva asked the Buddha Bhagavan what frightening things will a Bodhisattva who has initially aroused his heart dream of The Buddha told Medicine King Army Bodhisattva Virtuous man he will dream of a group of blazing fire Then the Bodhisattva should think like this Let this group of fire burn out all my defilements and delusions Medicine King Army this is the first frightening thing that he will dream of Furthermore he will dream of a flowing stream of water which is defiled and turbid Then the Bodhisattva who has initially aroused his heart should think like this Let it rinse all my afflictions and the ropes and knots of delusions Medicine King Army this is the second frightening thing that a Bodhisattva who has initially aroused his heart will dream of Furthermore he will dream that he shaves his own head He should think like this Let me shave off my greed anger ignorance and the possibility of being born in the six realms of transmigration  Virtuous man such a Bodhisattva will not fall into the categories of hell beings animals hungry ghosts dragons or heavenly beings Medicine King Army a Bodhisattva who has initially aroused his heart will only be reborn in pure BuddhaWorlds The Buddha told Medicine King Army In the future ending age in the last five hundred years there will be some Bodhisattvas who wish to achieve Bodhi with their hearts Since they have aroused their hearts they will be rebuked insulted beaten and scolded by many people Medicine King Army you should speak Dharma for them that a Bodhisattva should not arouse anger from his heart The Buddha said to Medicine King Army I had been carrying out myriads of austerities for immeasurable hundreds of thousands of billions of kalpas Virtuous man I did it not for necessities of life lands or any possessions I did it just to understand the Reality of all things Medicine King Army I did not achieve AnuttaraSamyakSambodhi by the austerities but virtuous man when I heard this Dharma I achieved AnuttaraSamyakSambodhi in that very day Medicine King Army this Dharma is very profound and the name of such a DharmaGate is difficult to hear If anyone hears the name of this DharmaGate he will surely achieve AnuttaraSamyakSambodhi Medicine King Army such a person will transcend births and deaths of one thousands kalpas and be reborn in a pure BuddhaWorld He will understand well about the truth of the cessation of suffering and the truth of the Way to Nirvana he will understand the first Way and the first virtuous root will achieve matchless supernatural powers and will understand the matchless extinction Medicine King Army what do you think what is called extinction Medicine King Army Bodhisattva said to the Buddha Bhagavan where the Dharma is is called extinction The Buddha said to Medicine King Army Where is the Dharma Medicine King Army said to the Buddha Bhagavan the Dharma is where the Dharma is Just as what the Bhagavan said be diligent in advancing be diligent in preceptskeeping and be diligent in forbearance then it is called the DharmaStore The Buddha praised Medicine King Army Bodhisattva Excellent Excellent Virtuous man on this question of the Buddha you have explained well Chow SuChia Revised by Upasaka Shen ShouLiang Thus I have heard While wandering through many lands to convert the beings Bhagavan arrived at Vaisali He dwelt under a resounding tree and with him was a big crowd of beings including eight thousand monks thirtysix thousand Great Bodhisattvas as well as kings ministers brahmins laydisciples the eight groups of dragons and other celestial beings such as kimnaras and the rest This infinite mass surrounded him with devotion He preached to them Then Manjushri son of the Dharmaking and chief disciple of the Buddha rose from his seat He bared one of his shoulders bent his right knee to the ground in the direction of Bhagavan bowed joined the palms of his hands and reverently said Worldhonoured We only wish you would tell us such and such names of the Buddha their original vows and their boundless virtues so that the hearers may know how to keep away from all karmic hindrances by their wisdom to the blessing and joy of all beings who live in the formal period of Buddhism Then the Worldhonoured praised the disciple Manjushri and said Excellent Manjushri Out of great pity you asked me to mention the names of the Buddhas and the virtues achieved from their original vows so as to pull out from all beings the hindrances of the karma which bind them to the blessing and joy of those who live in the formal period of Buddhism Now listen well and bear in mind to what I shall tell you Manjushri said We are glad to listen Then the Buddha said to Manjushri Eastward from here beyond Buddhaland about ten times as numerous as the sands of the Ganga there is a world called The Pure Crystal Realm the Paradise of Yao Shih Its Buddha has a few titles such as The Master of Healing Azure Radiance Tathagata The Arhat of Perfect Knowledge The Prefect Mind and Deed The Well Departed Sugata The Knower of the World The Peerless Nobleman The Man Who Brings The Passions of Men Under Control The Teacher of Devas And Men The Buddha and Bhagavan At the time when that Worldhonoured Buddha of Medicine became a Bodhisattva he made Twelve Great Vows to grant all beings with whatever they pray The first vow I vow that after my reincarnation and having attained unexcelled complete Enlightenment my body should be shining like a brilliant light throwing beams on infinite and boundless worlds adorned with a retinue of thirtytwo forms of the Great Men and with eighty physical characteristics of the Buddha I shall make all beings wholly equal to me The second vow I vow that after my reincarnation and having attained Perfect Enlightenment my body should be like a crystal in spotless purity both within and without with splendorous radiant light in the majesty of its virtue sitting serenely adorned with the aureole brighter than the sun and the moon I shall reveal my great power to all the beings in obscurity in order that they may act freely according to their bent The third vow I vow that after my reincarnation and having attained Perfect Enlightenment I should grant by means of boundless wisdom to all beings the inexhaustible things that they may need and that they may be free from any want The fourth vow I vow that after my reincarnation and having attained Perfect enlightenment I should bring those who have gone the heterodox ways to dwell tranquilly in the way of Bodhi and those who travel on the Vehicle of the Sramana and the Pratyekabuddha on the Vehicle of the Sramana and the Pratyekabuddha to stand firmly in the Great Vehicle of Bodhisattva The fifth vow I vow that after my reincarnation and having attained Perfect Enlightenment I should enable the innumerable beings to observe all the moral laws to mend their ways to pure living and to obey the three cumulative commandments Should there be any relapse or violation they shall again become pure once they hear of my name then they shall not fall into evil existences The sixth vow I vow that after my reincarnation and having attained Perfect Enlightenment those beings who are physically inferior with imperfect senses such as the ugly stupid blind deaf mute crippled paralysed humpbacked leprous lunatic or sick in many respects shall all of them when they hear my name regain their normal appearances and become intelligent All their senses shall be perfectly restored and they shall not suffer from diseases The seventh vow I vow that after my reincarnation and having attained Perfect Enlightenment those who are tormented by diseases who have nobody to whom they can seek for help without a refuge without a doctor without medicine without relatives without a home these poor and miserable beings shall all of them be free from diseases and troubles and shall enjoy perfect health of body and mind once my name reaches their ears They shall have families friends and properties aplenty and shall all be brought to the supreme Enlightenment of Buddha The eighth vow I vow that after my reincarnation and having attained Perfect Enlightenment women who are tormented by the hundred of sufferings of the female sex who are much wearied of life and long to make bodily sacrifice shall all of them when they hear my name be transformed into men instead of women in the next rebirth they shall get the form of manhood and shall in the end attain the supreme Enlightenment of Buddha The ninth vow If they should have fallen into the dense forest of false doctrines I should assist and lead them to the noble truths and gradually induce them to lead the life of a Bodhisattva and soon they shall attain supreme Enlightenment of Buddha The tenth vow I vow that after my reincarnation and having attained Perfect Enlightenment I should bring it to pass that all those who are recorded and condemned by the royal law to be bound and whipped to be enchained in prisons to be sentenced to capital punishment too meet numerous other disasters and insult to be afflicted with sorrow and anguish to be troubled both in body and in mind shall when they hear of my name escape evil kalpas through the aweinspiring majesty of my blessedness and virtue The eleventh vow I vow that after my reincarnation and having attained Perfect Enlightenment I should bring it to pass that all beings who are tormented by hunger and thirst and who in order to obtain drink and food if they can carefully remember my name and cherish it then I should let them taste the flavour of the Dharma and eventually lead a tranquil and happy life The twelfth vow I vow that after my reincarnation and having attained Perfect Enlightenment all beings who are poor and naked tormented day and night by mosquitoes and wasps by cold and heat when they hear my name and carefully remember and cherish it shall receive the wonderful garments of all kinds as well as valuable ornaments chaplets of fragrant flower and various kinds of instrumental music shall resound Whatever they dream of they shall have in abundance Manjushri these are the twelve wonderful sublime vows made by the Worlds Most Venerable Buddha of Medicine when he was a Bodhisattva Now Manjushri when the Buddha Medicine as a Bodhisattva made his vows the stern virtues of them have reached the Buddhaland if I should speak kalpa after kalpa about these virtues I could not mention all of them Verily this Buddhaland is eternally pure it has no women nor has it any evil influences and no screams of pain are heard there The ground is of lapis lazuli golden cords set bounds to the ways of this land the walls towers castles halls verandas and bird nets are made of seven precious things In all aspects it is equal to the Western Paradise There is no difference between the two There are two Great Bodhisattvas in this country the name of one is Radiance of the Sun that of the other Radiance of the Moon They are the chiefs of a host of Bodhisattvas They represent the Buddha Therefore Manjushri all good men and women who have confidence in faith should wish to be born in the world of Buddha Then the Buddha spoke further on to the disciple Manjushri and said When they see a beggar they are not glad in heart When they have to bestow a charity it is like cutting a piece of flesh from the body A deep and painful regret ensues There are other innumerable greedy and stingy beings who gather money but do not use it even for themselves so how could you expect them to give it to their parents wives children servants or beggar These beings after their death shall be reborn as hungry ghost or as animals There are others who though not trespassing against the Commandments trespass against the minor rules Others who though neither trespassing against the Commandments nor against the minor rules have not got the right views Still Others who though having the proper ideas neglect to learn and thus they are unable to understand the deep meaning of the Sutras taught by the Buddha Because their hearts are beclouded with pride so they think highly of themselves and think little of others They criticise the correct doctrine of the Buddha and become the companions of Mara These fools are not only themselves erring but they also dig pitfalls for millions of others But if there should be any among them who are unable to turn from wickedness who do not follow the right teaching and who fall into evil destinies as a consequence then they still have the chance to become men in the next rebirth in case that through the magic power of the vows of this Tathagata they are able to hear his name chanted just for a moment They cling implicitly to the teaching of the Tathagata swerve no more from it and from the right principles and learn more then they will understand the profound meanings Far from being haughty they do not criticise the right teaching do not become companions of Mara Gradually they will enter the way of Bodhisattvas and will soon attain perfect enlightenment Furthermore Manjushri there are beings who are avaricious and envious During innumerable millenniums they suffer misery after their death they will be reborn among men but as oxen horses camels or donkeys They will be tormented constantly by whip by hunger and by thirst they must carry heavy loads on their backs and walk long ways When such beings in a former incarnation heard the name of the Buddha of Medicine they will now be save by Him They pray to the spirits of the mountains trees and tombs They kill living things take their bleeding flesh and offer it to the Yaksas and Rakshasas They write down the name of their enemy make a picture of him and by the use of sorcery they curse over it They use black magic and poison They conjure up a ghost from corpse This puts an end to the life of the enemy and destroys his body When by chance these beings hear of the name of the Buddhas of Medicine then all these evil things will lose power to harm them They wish to be of service they wish to make each other happy When they hear the name of the Buddha of Medicine at the time of their death then there will be eight Bodhisattvas who with magic powers will traverse the intervening space to come to show them their ways and amidst the colourful flowers of that world they will be born there by transformation Sometimes they are also born in the Heaven Though they are born in Heaven the original good roots are still there they will not fall into evil destinies again When their life in Heaven is ended they will again become men Or they may become supreme rulers governing the four inhabited continents of the Universe and rule in independent majesty Innumerable beings are established in the excellent Karma resulting from the practice of the Ten Commandments Some are born as Kshatriyas or as Brahmins some as laydisciples some born in a large family They abound in riches with their treasuries and granaries overflowing Their appearance are aweinspiring They have enough relatives and kinsmen they are clever and they gain in wisdom If it is a woman who heard the name of the Buddha of Medicine and if she wholeheartedly cherishes it she shall never again become a woman in the next rebirth Then Manjushri when the Master of Healing Azure Radiance Tathagata had attained perfect Enlightenment to become the Buddha of Medicine he saw by virtue of his vows that the beings were suffering from all sorts of diseases such as tuberculosis bilious fever or that they were affected by a spell or by poison or that some were by their nature shortlived or that some have died a violent death World honoured I swear that I will pray Buddhatruth I shall cause by many means all male and female devotees to hear the names of the Master of Healing Azure Radiance Tathagata I shall shout the names of the Buddha into their ears even in their sleep World honoured when someone learns this Sutra by heart and reads proclaims and expounds it to other people copies it himself or has it copied makes offerings reverently and seriously with various fragrant flowers perfumed unguents sandalpowder and burning incense with garlands strings of pearls flags and music he also makes bags of fivecoloured silk and puts Sutra into them sweeps clean a place displays the bags the bags on a high table that they may lie there in readiness then the four great Kings of Heaven with their retinue and the other innumerable hundreds and thousands of celestial hosts will come to make offerings and to protect the Sutra Worldhonoured where the treasures of this Sutra flow out and can be received through the blessing of the Vow of this World honoured Buddha of Medicine and his name can be heard then they will know that no violent death will ever occur at that place and nobodys spirit will ever be seized by evil demons and evil spirits And if it has already been wrested from him he can still restore it as he was before he will have peace both in Body and mind Then the Buddha said to Manjushri So it is so it is It is exactly as you say Manjushri if a devout man or woman who wishes to make an offering to this world honoured Buddha of Medicine he or she must first make an image of this Buddha prepare a clean place to erect it strew various flowers burn all sorts of incense adorn the place with curtains and flags for seven days and seven nights keep the eight prohibitory commands eat clean food take baths so that one may have a clean odour put on clean clothes free the mind from dirty angry and malicious thoughts wish to be of service to others and try to bring happiness to everybody Moreover he must remember the blessing of the Vows of Tathagata read aloud this Sutra meditate upon its meaning recite and explain it What he wishes for will all be fulfilled If he wishes for wealth he will become rich If he wishes to become an official he will become an official if he wishes to have a son or a daughter he will get a son or a daughter When he has a bad dream sees evil omens sees strange birds flocking together or has his room filled with strange apparitions if this man will all the sacred implements worships and make offerings then the World honoured Buddha of Medicine will bring it to pass that the bad dreams and the bad omens which prophecy ill luck will vanish completely and will do him no harm He will be protected from the dangers of water fire sword poison elephants lions tigers wolves bears snakes scorpions millipedes mosquitoes gnats and other frightful and unpleasant things if he wholeheartedly remembers the Buddha worships Him  then all troubles will vanish Furthermore Manjushri in case there is a pious man or woman who does not care for other gods during his or her whole life and whose only thought is to become a Buddhist disciple and who observes either five or ten of the Commandments or the four hundred commandments of the Bodhisattva the two hundred and fifty of the monk or the five hundred of the nun and who fears he may relapse into sin and fall into evil destinies if he or she can only recite the name of the Buddha worships Him and makes offerings to Him he and she will certainly not suffer from the three paths of transmigration the hells hungry ghost and animals A woman may suffer from great pain while giving birth If she can wholeheartedly worship the Buddha of Medicine and to invoke the name Tathagata worship Him and make offerings to Him all pain will vanish the newly born baby will have a sound and healthy body whoever sees him will rejoice at his being so clever so strong and healthy and no demon comes to rob him of his vitality Then the Buddha spoke to Ananda If I praise the virtues of the Buddha of Medicine and let you know that the actions of the Buddha have an occult meaning that it is difficult to understand Can you believe me Ananda said Virtuous World honoured One I have no doubt in my belief about the Sutras of Tathagata My reason for this belief is that the karma of Tathagatas formed through deeds words and thoughts is perfectly pure Worldhonoured the disc of this sun and moon may be torn down the inconceivable high Sumeru mountain may be shaken but the words of the Buddhas will never change Worldhonoured the beings whose faith is as yet insufficient may question the occult meaning of the Buddhas acts They think How is it possible that by only remembering the name of the Master of Healing Azure Radiance Tathagata we can reap so many blessings Then they do not believe nay they challenge Such people forfeit their blessing and joy over one long night they fall into evil existences and drift eternally in the stream of miserable life Then Buddha told Ananda When all these beings hear the name of the Worldhonoured Master of Healing Azure Radiance Tathagata and cherish it wholeheartedly and have no more doubts then it is impossible for them to fall into evil destinies again Ananda this is the occult meaning of the acts of the Tathagatas it is hard to believe You can conceive of it now and so you know that all that I have told you has its root in the power of the Tathagatas Ananda all Shramanas and Pratyekabuddhas and the Bodhisattvas who have not yet reached the ten stages are unable to believe the full truth and to expound it only the Bodhisattva who has only one life that binds him can do it Ananda it is difficult to get a human body It is also difficult to have faith in the Triple Gems to believe and to revere them But it is still more difficult to hear the name of the Master of Healing Azure Radiance Tathagata Ananda the Bodhisattva deeds of the Buddha of Medicine his skilful means to convert the beings and his far reaching vows are innumerable If I should expound them in great detail I could speak kalpa after kalpa and even longer the kalpas would soon be exhausted but the deeds the vows and the skilful means of the Buddha would not be exhausted There was at that time a great Bodhisattva in the community Virtuous World honoured in the decline of the formal period there shall be beings who are exhausted by many misfortunes they are thin in consequence of long illness Such a being can neither eat nor drink his lips and throat are dry Everything he sees is dark The signs of death are presently manifest His parents family relatives and friends stand around him weeping His body lies on the bed he sees the messengers of Yama leading his spirit to the judge Verily all beings have a spirit which originates with them Everything they have done be it good or bad was in the record Everything was kept with judge Yama Just at that time this judge questions the man He sums up his deeds He assigns him his place according to the proportion of his good and bad deeds If at that time the relatives and friends of this sick man could make him believe in the Buddha of Medicine and ask the monks to recite this Sutra light a sevenlayer lantern hang up either consciousness may returns after seven twentyone thirtyfive or fortynine days At that time when he returns consciousness he feels like awakened from a dream he remembers the award he has received for his good or bad deeds For he has himself been a witness of the reward of his deeds He remembers this throughout his lifes hardships he no longer commits any evil deed Therefore men and women who are firm in their faith cherish the name of the Master of Healing Azure Radiance Tathagata worship Him and make offerings to Him with what they can At that time Ananda asked the Bodhisattva Seeker of Salvation Pious man how shall we worship the Buddha of Medicine and make offerings to Him What are the significances of the banners and the lanterns The Bodhisattva Seeker of Salvation said Virtuous One for the sick people whom one wishes to free from their sufferings it is necessary to keep the eight prohibitory commands during seven days and nights and to make offerings of food and drink and other things according to ones capability to the congregation of monks to perform worship according to the ritual for six times day and night and have offerings made to the Buddha of Medicine to recite this Sutra fortynine times to light up fortynine lamps to have seven image of the Tathagata made to have seven lamps put infront of each image the flame of each lamp may illuminate a cartwheel For fortynine days these lamps must be kept burning unceasingly Hang up fivecoloured banners fortynine spans long and set free various kinds of animals to the number of fortynine In this way the sick people are made to overcome the danger of being violently killed by evil spirits Furthermore Ananda in case of a Kshatriya or an Abhisecana or King at a time when calamity arises such as pestilence among the population invasion by foreign countries revolution in his own country ominous displacement in a constellation eclipse or the sun or the moon wind and rain out season or drought through no rain this Kshatriya or Abhisecana King must then have pity on all beings set all captives free perform the above mentioned ceremonies of offering and make offerings to the Virtuous Buddha of Medicine As a consequence of these good deeds and the power of original vow of Tathagata he will bring about the result that his country will be delivered that wind and rain will come in good time and will let the crops ripe that the people will be happy without sickness that no cruel Yaksha in his country will torment the people and that all evil omens will at once disappear And the Kshatriyas or Abhisecana Kings life material appearance vitality and sickless independence will all be benefited Ananda if the Queen the wives of the princes the crownprince the princes the ministers the court councillors the ladies of the palace the provincial officials or the common people suffering from diseases or if another calamity occurs he shall also hang up fivecoloured banners for warding off all the evil spirits light lamps and keep them burning set animals free strew many coloured flowers burn precious incense then the diseases will be cured and all afflictions will vanish Then Ananda asked the Bodhisattva Seeker of Salvation Pious man how can a life that has come to an end be prolonged The Bodhisattva Seeker of Salvation said Virtuous One did you hear that the Tathagatas say that there are nine kinds of violent deaths Therefore I exhort you to hang up the life prolonging banner to light up the lamps and to perform the pious deeds By performing the pious deeds ones life come to a natural end without suffering from any painful experience Ananda asked what are the nine kinds of violent deaths The Bodhisattva Seeker of Salvation said The nine violent deaths are There are beings who become sick Though the sickness is not serious but there is neither medicine nor a doctor for the treatment In case they take the wrong medicine they may meet violent death which can very well be avoided They believe in heterodox views not recognising the doctrine of moral karma This leads in the end to a violent death They enter into hell and can never get out of it This is the first violent death Some hunt for pleasure lead and unrestrained life with women and wine and dissipated without halt and limit Some come to a violent end by being burnt by fire Some come to a violent end by falling from a steep cliff Some come to a violent end by being destroyed by poison by image spell Vetala by spokenspell Dharani or by demonical influence to resurrect a corpse and cause it kill another person Some suffer hunger and thirst do not get anything to eat or drink and thus die an untimely death These are what Tathagata briefly named as the nine kinds of violent deaths Besides there are innumerable other kinds which cannot all be told here In addition Ananda the judge Yama keeps a complete list with the deeds of each inhabitant on earth recorded if any of the beings are not filial and commit the five mortal sins revile the Triple Gems infringe the laws of the country and violate the natural moral laws then the judge Yama examines whether their sins were grave or light and punishes them accordingly Therefore I now ask all beings to light up the lamps and hang up the banners to set free the animals and to do good deeds so that misery and grief can be overcome and the life hardships can be avoided At that time there were twelve Yaksha spiritual generals in the assembly viz General Kumbhira General Vajra General Mihira General Andira General Majira General Shandira General Indra General Pajra General Makura General Sindura General Catura General Vikarala These twelve Yaksha Generals each having seven thousand Yakshas in his retinue raised their voices simultaneously and saluted the Buddha by saying Worlds Most Venerable we have experienced today the wondrous power of the Buddha by permitting us to hear the name of the Master of Healing Azure Radiance Tathagata we have no further fear of the evil destinies All of us are of one mind that is as long as this form lasts we shall have recourse to Buddhist Trinity We swear to bear the responsibility to let all beings be benefited by the path of truth and to let them be abound with happiness Wherever it may be in villages cities capitals or even in unfrequented forests when any one preaches this Sutra and cherishes the names of the Master of Healing Azure Radiance Tathagata worships Him and makes Him offerings we and our retinues shall guard and protect him deliver him completely from all distress fulfil all his wishes When he falls ill and calls for help he should also read this Sutra take a fivecoloured skein and tie it into knots forming the letters of our names and untie the knots when his wishes are fulfilled At that time the Worlds Most Venerable praised the Yaksha Generals and said Excellent excellent Great Yaksha Generals If you want to return the favour of the Master of Healing Azure Radiance Tathagata you must always be of service to all beings and make them happy Then Ananda saluted the Buddha and said What is this revelation called By what name shall we cherish it Then Buddha said to Ananda This revelation is called The Blessing of the Original Vow of the Master of Healing Azure Radiance Tathagata The scared formula which tells how the twelve Yaksha spiritual generals vowed to be useful to all beings So you shall bear in mind When Bhagavan was preaching these words all the Great Bodhisattvas and the Great Sramanas the kings and the great ministers the Brahmins the Upasakas the gods the dragons the Yaksas Gandharvas Asuras Garudas Kinnaras Mahoragas human and nonhuman beings all others in the assembly heard the words of the Buddha All of them could turn the noregress Dharma wheel Whoever heard any of their names would not regress from the unsurpassed bodhi mind Dharma Wisdom Bodhisattva Lion Wisdom

Bodhisattva Great Thunder Bodhisattva Guiding Teacher Bodhisattva No False Views Bodhisattva Mastering All Dharmas Bodhisattva Maitreya Bodhisattva and Mañjuśrī Bodhisattva From countless Buddha Lands BodhisattvaMahāsattvas as numerous as the sands of sixty Ganges Rivers and innumerable gods dragons yakṣas gandharvas asuras garuḍas kinaras and mahoragas gathered there to pay respects and make offerings A Miraculous Manifestation At that time in the great sandalwood tower the WorldHonored One was properly seated and in samādhi Using His spiritual power he produced a miraculous manifestation There appeared countless thousandpetaled lotus flowers in various colors and with various fragrances Although not yet unfurled each bud was as large as a carriage wheel Each and every lotus flower emitted immeasurable radiance and all of them simultaneously unfurled Then through the Buddhas spiritual power they withered in an instant revealing the conjured Buddhas seated crossedlegged  each Buddha emitting countless hundreds and thousands of beams of light Seeing this extraordinary adornment of the world all in this assembly rejoiced exuberantly However they were perplexed by this unprecedented display and wondered why these countless wonderful flowers suddenly withered and became black stinky and loathsome Then the WorldHonored One knowing the perplexity of the multitude of Bodhisattvas told Vajra Wisdom Bodhisattva Good man if you have any doubts about the Buddha Dharma you may ask questions as you please Then Vajra Wisdom Bodhisattva who knew the perplexity of the multitude asked the Buddha WorldHonored One why did these countless lotus flowers contain conjured Buddhas rise up into the open sky to cover the world and wither in an instant to reveal all conjured Buddhas seated crosslegged each emitting countless hundreds and thousands of beams of light All in this assembly witnessed this and joined their palms in reverence Then Vajra Wisdom Bodhisattva spoke in verse Never before have I seen Such a miraculous manifestation as displayed today Conjured Buddhas by the hundreds of thousands of koṭis Are seated in the lotus flower stores  Each Buddha emitting countless beams of light That pervade all Buddha Lands These taintfree guiding teachers Adorn all worlds When these lotus flowers suddenly withered They became loathsome to all For what reason Do you display this miraculous manifestation I have seen Buddhas as numerous as the sands of the Ganges And Their countless miraculous manifestations Never before have I seen such a manifestation as displayed today I pray that You will explain to us in detail Nine Analogies Then the WorldHonored One said to Vajra Wisdom Bodhisattva and other Bodhisattvas Good men there is a mahāvaipulya sūtra called Tathāgata Store  It is because I will expound this sūtra that I display this auspicious sign We will be delighted to hear it  The Buddha said Good men in my manifestation when countless lotus flowers suddenly withered and turned into something loathsome innumerable conjured Buddhas are revealed who have majestic appearances are seated crosslegged and emit vast radiance Indeed good men I use the Buddha eye to observe all sentient beings and see that in the midst of their afflictions such as greed anger and delusion they have the Tathāgata wisdom the Tathāgata eye and a Tathāgatas body seated crosslegged and solemnly motionless Good men although all sentient beings transmigrate through various lifepaths in their afflictionladen bodies is the Tathāgata store which is free from taints and bears marks of virtue no different from me Moreover good men just as someone with the god eye sees that the unfurled flowers contain Tathāgatas bodies seated crosslegged which will be revealed when the withered flowers are removed likewise a Buddha sees the Tathāgata store in sentient beings Wanting to reveal it He expounds to them the Dharma in sūtras to enable them to remove their afflictions and reveal their Buddha nature Good men such is the way of Buddhas Whether or not a Buddha appears in the world the Tathāgata store in all sentient beings is ever abiding and changeless However sentient beings are shrouded by their afflictions Therefore a Tathāgata appears in the world to widely expound the Dharma to enable them to remove their fatiguing afflictions and acquire the pure overall wisdomknowledge  Good men if a Bodhisattva believes and delights in this teaching and intently practices and learns he will achieve liberation become a SamyakSabuddha and do Buddha work in the world Then the WorldHonored One spoke in verse In the analogy of flowers that wither Before they have unfurled Someone with the god eye can see that inside each Is a Tathāgatas body free from taints After a withered flower is removed A guiding teacher with unimpeded wisdomknowledge is fully revealed To end sentient beings afflictions The most victorious one appears in the world A Buddha sees that all sentient beings Have the Tathāgata store in them Which is shrouded by countless afflictions Like being fettered by filthy flower petals For all sentient beings To remove their afflictions I expound the true Dharma  To enable them to quickly attain Buddha bodhi Using the Buddha eye I see that the Buddha store steadily abides In all sentient beings bodies So I expound the Dharma to reveal it Moreover good men as an analogy pure honey is stored in a tree on a cliff guarded by countless bees An intelligent man removes the bees by skillful means and takes the honey Then he eats the honey at will and benefits others near and far Similarly good men all sentient beings possess the Tathāgata store like that pure honey in the tree on a cliff It is shrouded by afflictions as if guarded by bees I use the Buddha eye to observe sentient beings as they truly are and use skillful means to expound the Dharma according to their capacities for them to remove their afflictions acquire a Buddhas knowledge and views and do Buddha work in the world Then the WorldHonored One spoke in verse As an analogy the honey in a tree on a cliff Is surrounded by countless bees A honey collector First removes the bees by skillful means A sentient beings Tathāgata store Is like the honey in a tree on a cliff It is fettered by fatiguing afflictions As if guarded by bees I expound the true Dharma to sentient beings By skillful means To enable them to remove their beelike afflictions Open their Tathāgata store Acquire unimpeded eloquence Expound the Dharma like showering down sweet dew Attain true enlightenment and With great compassion And benefit sentient beings Moreover good men as an analogy before the husk of rice is removed even the poor loathe it and say that it should be discarded Indeed good men I use the Buddha eye to observe sentient beings and see that their husklike afflictions sheathe a Tathāgatas immeasurable knowledge and views Therefore I expound the Dharma by skillful means according to their capacities to enable them to remove their afflictions acquire the pure overall wisdomknowledge and attain true enlightenment in the world Then the WorldHonored One spoke in verse As an analogy before the husk of Rice is removed Even the poor loathe it And say that it should be discarded Although it seems useless because of its outside Its inside is unspoiled After its husk is removed Rice becomes a food fit for a king Seeing that sentient beings afflictions Conceal their Buddha store I teach them how to remove their afflictions And acquire the overall wisdomknowledge As I have Tathāgata nature So too do sentient beings I teach them to achieve purity And quickly attain the unsurpassed bodhi Moreover good men as an analogy  pure gold has fallen into a filthy place and for years is hidden from view Although pure gold is indestructible no one knows about it Then someone with the god eye says to the multitude In this filth lies a treasure of pure gold and you can excavate it and enjoy it at will Good men the filthy place is  countless afflictions the treasure of pure gold is his Tathāgata store Therefore a Tathāgata widely expounds the Dharma to enable sentient beings to remove their afflictions attain true enlightenment and do Buddha work Then the WorldHonored One spoke in verse As an analogy  pure gold buried in filth Is hidden from view Only someone with the god eye can see it And he tells others To remove it from filth And cleanse it to reveal its purity Then they can enjoy it at will And benefit their kin and friends Likewise the Sugata uses the Buddha eye To observe sentient beings And sees that their Tathāgata nature in the mire of their afflictions Is indestructible He expounds the Dharma according to their capacities To enable them to do the right things To remove their afflictions that shroud their Buddha nature And to reveal its purity Moreover good men as an analogy a poor family has a treasure store buried under the floor of their house but the treasure cannot announce I am here It neither knows itself nor has speech Then no one can open this treasure store Likewise all sentient beings have in their bodies a great treasure store which includes a Tathāgatas knowledge and views Ten Powers and Four Fearlessnesses However they neither know it nor hear about it as they follow their afflictions and five desires to transmigrate through their cycles of birth and death undergoing immeasurable suffering Therefore Buddhas appear in worlds to reveal the Tathāgata store in their bodies and enable them to open it acquire the pure overall wisdomknowledge and unimpeded eloquence and become great almsgivers Indeed good men I use the Buddha eye to see that all sentient beings possess the Tathāgata store Hence I give this teaching to Bodhisattvas Then the WorldHonored One spoke in verse As an analogy a poor family Has a treasure store under the floor of their house The owner neither sees nor knows it And his treasure cannot speak For years no one tells him about it And he remains in the darkness of ignorance Because he does not know his own treasure He remains in poverty I use the Buddha eye to see that Although sentient beings transmigrate through the five lifepaths The great treasure in their bodies Is always there changeless Having made this observation I tell sentient beings And let them know about their treasure store So that they will become hugely wealthy and widely benefit others Whoever believes in my statement that All possess the treasure store And diligently trains by skillful means Will quickly attain the unsurpassed bodhi Moreover good men as an analogy the pit of an āmra  contains an unspoiled seed Once planted in the ground it grows into a huge tree Indeed good men I use the Buddha eye to observe sentient beings and see that the precious Tathāgata store inside the shell of their ignorance is like a seed in an āmras pit Good men the Tathāgata store is cool free from the heat of burning afflictions an aggregate of great wisdom and quietly in nirvāṇa Good men after a Tathāgata has observed sentient beings to enable BodhisattvaMahāsattvas to acquire a Buddhas pure wisdomknowledge  He reveals this meaning Then the WorldHonored One spoke in verse As an analogy a seed in An āmras pit is unspoiled Once planted in the great earth It grows into the king of trees A Tathāgata uses the afflictionfree eye To observe all sentient beings In whose bodies the Tathāgata store Is like a seed in a fruits pit You all should believe and know that Ones ignorance shrouds ones Buddha store Which abides in samādhi and wisdom That nothing can destroy Therefore I expound the Dharma To reveal their Tathāgata store So that they can quickly attain the unsurpassed bodhi Like a seed becoming the king of trees Moreover good men as an analogy a man carries a holy statue in pure gold as he travels to another country Traveling perilous roads for fear of bandits he wraps it in filthy rags to hide it Then he dies on his way and his gold statue is discarded in a wilderness Travelers trample it and say that it is fifth However someone with the god eye sees that within the filthy rags is a holy statue in pure gold He takes it out and all salute it Likewise good men I see that as sentient beings with various afflictions transmigrate through countless births and deaths in the long night the wondrous Tathāgata store in their bodies is stately and pure no different from me Therefore I the Buddha expound the Dharma to sentient beings to enable them to end their afflictions acquire the pure Tathāgata wisdom and then transform and guide all others in the world Then the WorldHonored One spoke in verse As an analogy a man carries a gold statue As he travels to another country Wrapped in filthy rags It is discarded in a wilderness Someone with the god eye sees it And tells the multitude To remove the filthy rags to reveal the gold statue Then all greatly rejoice Likewise I use the Buddha eye To observe sentient beings and see that Fettered by afflictions and evil karmas They undergo suffering through repeated birth and death I also see that in the midst of Their dirtlike ignorance and afflictions Their Tathāgata nature remains motionless And indestructible Having seen this I the Buddha tell Bodhisattvas that Their afflictions and evil karmas Shroud a Tathāgatas supreme body  They should diligently remove them To reveal the Tathāgata wisdom And to be revered by all Such as gods humans dragons and ghosts Moreover good men as an analogy a poor and ugly woman is loathed by all However she is pregnant with a noble son who will become a holy king to rule the four continents She does not know this and for a long time thinks as do others that a lowly woman gives birth to a lowly child Indeed good men a Tathāgata observes all sentient beings and sees that they transmigrate through repeated birth and death undergoing suffering though the precious Tathāgata store is in their bodies Like that woman they do not know this Therefore a Tathāgata expounds the Dharma to all saying Good men do not belittle yourselves Buddha nature is in your bodies If you diligently make energetic progress and end your evils you will be called a Bodhisattva then a WorldHonored One and will transform and deliver innumerable sentient beings Then the WorldHonored One spoke in verse As an analogy a poor woman With ugly features Is pregnant with a noble son Who will become a WheelTurning King To possess virtues and the seven prescious things And to rule the four continents However she does not know this And regards herself as lowly I observe sentient beings in suffering And see that they are like that woman They do not know that They carry the Tathāgata store in their bodies Therefore I tell Bodhisattvas Do not belittle yourselves Because the Tathāgata store in your bodies Will bring  light to relieve the world If you diligently make energetic progress You will soon sit in a bodhimaṇḍa Attain the supreme bodhi And deliver innumerable multitudes  Moreover good men as an analogy a foundryman casts a statue in pure gold After casting is finished he places the mold on the ground Although its outside is scorched and blackened the statue inside is unchanged When the mold is removed the golden color is dazzling Indeed good men a Tathāgata observes all sentient beings and sees that the Buddha store in their bodies is replete with all excellent marks Having made this observation He widely expounds the Dharma to bring sentient beings tranquility and teach them how to use vajra wisdom to destroy their afflictions and reveal a Buddhas pure body like taking the gold statue out of the mold Then the WorldHonored One spoke in verse As an analogy a master foundryman Casts countless statues in pure gold Fools see only a blackened mold outside Which is scorched clay The foundryman waits for the mold to cool Then opens it to reveal what is inside After the filthy mold is removed The gold statue with excellent features is fully revealed I use the Buddha eye To observe sentient beings And see that in the mire of their afflictions There is Tathāgata nature I teach them to use vajra wisdom To destroy their afflictions like removing the mold And to open the Tathāgata store Like uncovering the gold statue Having made this observation I tell Bodhisattvas You all should accept and uphold  And transform sentient beings Merit Acquired by Upholding This Sūtra Then the WorldHonored One said to Vajra Wisdom BodhisattvaMahāsattva Whether a monastic or a householder if a good man or woman accepts and upholds this Sūtra of the Tathāgata Store reads recites or copies it makes offering to it or widely expounds it to others the merit acquired will be immeasurable To plant roots of goodness he makes offerings to present Buddhas more numerous than the sands of the Ganges and uses the seven treasures to build towers more numerous than the sands of the Ganges Each tower is ten yojanastall and one yojana in length and width Inside each tower are couches made of the seven treasures and spread with celestial silks For each and every Buddha every day he uses the seven treasures to build towers more numerous than the sands of the Ganges and offers these towers to Buddhas Bodhisattvas and voicehearers As he makes such offerings to all present Buddhas more numerous than the sands of the Ganges so too for countless billions of kalpas he builds treasure towers more numerous than the sands of fifty Ganges Rivers and offers these towers to present Buddhas Bodhisattvas and voicehearers all of whom are more numerous than the sands of fifty Ganges Rivers However Vajra Wisdom that Bodhisattva cannot compare with someone who aspiring to attain bodhi accepts and upholds this Sūtra of the Tathāgata Store reads recites or copies it makes offerings to it or uses only one of its analogies Vajra Wisdom although that Bodhisattva has planted various roots of goodness under innumerable Buddhas and acquired immeasurable merit his merit is less than one hundredth or one thousandth of the merit acquired by whoever accepts and upholds this sūtra reads recites or copies it or expounds it to others Suppose that someone who seeks bodhi Hears and upholds this sūtra Copies it and makes offerings to it Even if for only one stanza If he expresses sympathetic joy Over hearing its teachings On the wondrous Tathāgata store His merit acquired is immeasurable Suppose that a Bodhisattva who seeks bodhi Abides in great transcendental powers For inconceivable koṭis of kalpas To make offerings to Buddhas Bodhisattvas And voicehearers in worlds in the ten directions All of whom are more numerous than the sands of the Ganges For each and every Buddha He builds wonderful treasure towers Each ten yojanas tall And one yojana in length and width Inside each tower are couches made of the seven treasures Adorned with wonderful things And spread with celestial silks and cushions Different from couch to couch He offers such towers More numerous than the sands of the Ganges To Buddhas and Their multitudes Day and night without rest For a billion kalpas And receives corresponding merit If someone hears this sūtra And explains to others Even if only one of its analogies His merit acquired Surpasses the merit of that Bodhisattva Beyond calculation or analogy If a Bodhisattva intently ponders The profound Tathāgata store Possessed by all sentient beings He will quickly attain the unsurpassed bodhi Vajra Wisdom Bodhisattva Received This Teaching in a Past Life Then the WorldHonored One told Vajra Wisdom Bodhisattva Before inconceivable asakhyeya kalpas in the distant past there was a Buddha called Constantly Emitting Radiance King Tathāgata Arhat SamyakSabuddha Knowledge and Conduct Perfected Sugata Understanding the World Unsurpassed One Tamer of men Teacher of Gods and Men BuddhaBhagavān Vajra Wisdom why was He called Constantly Emitting Radiance King Because when that Buddha was still walking the Bodhisattva Way after His consciousness descended into His mothers womb He constantly emitted radiance illuminating everywhere in worlds in the ten directions worlds as numerous as the dust particles in a thousand Buddha Lands If sentient beings saw His radiance they would rejoice and their afflictions would end They would acquire bodies with good appearances and strength become accomplished in meditation possess wisdom and acquire unimpeded eloquence If King Yama helldwellers hungry ghosts animals or asuras saw His radiance they would quit their evil lifepaths and be reborn as humans or gods If humans or gods saw His radiance they would not regress from the unsurpassed bodhi mind but would acquire the five transcendental powers Those who would never regress on the Bodhisattva Way would acquire endurance in their realization that dharmas have no birth and acquire the turnaround dhāraṇī with fifty virtues Vajra Wisdom the ground of the worlds illuminated by His radiance became pure like celestial aquamarine  Golden cords on the ground marked eight boulevards Each was lined with various jeweled trees whose abundant flowers and fruits gave off profuse fragrance When breezes blew these trees rustled with wonderful tones expounding the virtues of the Three Jewels and Bodhisattvas the Five Roots the Five Powers the Seven Bodhi Factors the Eightfold Right Path meditation and liberation Those who heard  acquired Dharma delight and firm faith and were forever free from taking evil lifepaths Vajra Wisdom all sentient beings in worlds in the ten directions because they were touched by His radiance in the six periods of day and night joined their palms in reverence Vajra Wisdom that Bodhisattva from His staying in his mothers womb to His birth to His attaining Buddhahood and to His entering nirvāṇa without remnants constantly emitted radiance After His parinirvāṇa His relics enshrined in pagodas constantly emit radiance as well For this reason gods and humans call Him Constantly Emitting Radiance King Vajra Wisdom when Constantly Emitting Radiance Tathāgata Arhat SamyakSabuddha first attained Buddhahood with twenty koṭi Bodhisattvas in his retinue in His Dharma  there was a Bodhisattva called Infinite Light Infinite Light BodhisattvaMahāsattva asked that Buddha to expound the Sūtra of the Tathāgata Store That Buddha sat in His seat for fifty large kalpas expounding this sūtra in detail To protect and support all Bodhisattvas His voice reached worlds as numerous as the dust particles in ten Buddha Lands Through countless causes and conditions He used  analogies to expound to Bodhisattvas this Mahāyāna Sūtra of the Tathāgata Store Those who heard it accepted and upheld it read and recited it and trained accordingly They all have attained Buddhahood except for four Bodhisattvas Vajra Wisdom do not think otherwise Is Infinite Light Bodhisattva then a different person now He is none other than yourself The four Bodhisattvas who have not yet attained Buddhahood are Mañjuśrī Avalokiteśvara Great Might Arrived  and you Vajra Wisdom Vajra wisdom this Sūtra of the Tathāgata Store can benefit all Whoever hears it will attain Buddha bodhi Then the WorldHonored One spoke in verse Before countless kalpas in the past There was a Buddha called Radiance King Who constantly emitted vast radiance Illuminating  countless worlds When that Buddha first attained Buddhahood Infinite Light Bodhisattva Asked Him about this sūtra And He immediately expounded it Those who encountered that most victorious one And heard this sūtra Have attained Buddhahood Except for four Bodhisattvas Mañjuśrī Avalokiteśvara Great Might Arrived and Vajra Wisdom Of these four Bodhisattvas who Heard this sūtra Vajra Wisdom was a Buddhason Foremost in transcendental powers When you were called Infinite Light You heard this sūtra When I was seeking bodhi I received this sūtra From Lion Banner Buddha And trained in accordance with its teachings as heard Because of these roots of goodness I quickly attained Buddha bodhi Therefore all Bodhisattvas Should uphold this sūtra Listen to its teachings and train accordingly Then they will attain Buddhahood as I have Whoever upholds this sūtra Should be saluted as a WorldHonored One Whoever has acquired this sūtra Is called a Master of the Buddha Dharma He is protected by the world And praised by Buddhas Whoever upholds this sūtra Is called a Dharma King He is the eye of the world And should be praised as a WorldHonored One After the WorldHonored One pronounced this sūtra Vajra Wisdom and other Bodhisattvas His retinues and four groups of disciples gods gandharvas asuras and all others heard the Buddhas words and joyfully carried out His teachings Sūtra of Achieving a Clear Understanding of the Mahāyāna Translated from Sanskrit into Chinese in the Northern Zhou Dynasty by The Tripiṭaka Master Jñānayaśas from India Fascicle   The Assembly Thus I have heard At one time the Bhagavān was staying atop the Malaya Mountain beside a splendid lake in a great garden Inaccessible to humans this place was the abode of great vidyādharas and the abode of those with spiritual attainment He was accompanied by  great bhikṣus All of them were great voicehearers who had completed their endeavor  and transcended the ground of ordinary beings Also present were BodhisattvaMahāsattvas who had acquired all Bodhisattva samādhis and dhāraṇīs All of them abided on Bodhisattva grounds Among them were the holy Maitreya BodhisattvaMahāsattva Great Wisdom BodhisattvaMahāsattva Excellent Wisdom BodhisattvaMahāsattva Firm Wisdom BodhisattvaMahāsattva Quiet Wisdom BodhisattvaMahāsattva Endless Wisdom BodhisattvaMahāsattva Boundless Wisdom BodhisattvaMahāsattva Ocean Wisdom BodhisattvaMahāsattva Peaceful Wisdom BodhisattvaMahāsattva Pure Wisdom BodhisattvaMahāsattva and Knowledge Wisdom BodhisattvaMahāsattva Such BodhisattvaMahāsattvas had received the prophecy of their attaining anuttarasamyaksabodhi in certain worlds and turning the Dharma wheel In attendance as well were great gods dragons yakṣas gandharvas asuras garuḍas kinaras mahoragas vidyādharas and nonhumans who assumed different shapes and facial features wore different crowns and different garments and held staffs banners and canopies They all gathered there to hear the Dharma At that time the WorldHonored One was surrounded by multitudes as massive as the ocean The Dharma he expounded was good in the beginning good in the middle and good in the end Its meaning was profound and His words were skillful He broadly expounded the pure Brahma way of life Viviśana King of Laṅkā Meanwhile the rākṣasaking Viviśana who ruled the city of Laṅkā  heard that the Buddha was staying beside a splendid lake in a great garden that the place inaccessible to humans was the abode of vidyādharas and the bode of those with spiritual attainment and that He was accompanied by  great bhikṣus and was expounding to them the Brahma way of life Then Viviśana king of Laṅkā thought Rare like the udumbara flower throughout an immeasurable timespan hardly heard even once is the name of a Tathāgata not to mention encountering a Buddha For an immeasurable timespan like a blind turtle trying to enter a hole in a piece of driftwood I have been unable to hear the Dharma Much harder would be to encounter a Buddha and His Dharma to enter a Buddhas state and to attain Buddha bodhi I should take a great many treasures pearl necklaces countless flowers choice incense powdered incense solid perfumes magnificent crowns and garments jeweled banners and canopies and silks and should play music sing songs of praise and go together with my retinue to where the Buddha is Upon arrival I will make these offerings to the Tathāgata and ask for the true Dharma to make my life worthwhile Then Viviśana king of Laṅkā announced to his rākṣasas All of you should with one mind take abundant gold silver precious jewels jade aquamarine  coral emerald ruby pearl necklaces choice incense and countless diverse flowers and should play music sing songs of praise and go to where the Buddha is The Tathāgata is the Dharma King the supreme one in the Three Realms of Existence Having accumulated unexcelled merits He has excellent physical marks and all wisdomknowledge He is the unsurpassed fortune field We should make these offerings to Him Because it takes an immeasurable timespan for a Buddha to appear in the world It is hard to see a Buddha to hear the Three Jewels and to leave behind the eight difficulties Then Viviśana king of Laṅkā made his announcement in verse Sentient beings like carriage wheels Transmigrate through the six lifepaths Among them helldwellers hungry ghosts And animals suffer the most To benefit sentient beings And enable them To leave behind the eight difficulties A Buddha like a lamp appears in the world His sunlight of wisdom shines And dispels the darkness of ignorance We should go to His place To make offerings to the unsurpassed honored one The teacher of gods and humans Making offerings to Him will bring great fruits After Viviśana king of Laṅkā spoke these stanzas through the Buddhas spiritual power a web of  beams of light appeared in the open sky and illuminated the great city of Laṅkā Touched by its radiance Viviśana and all his rākṣasas felt joyful and exuberant Then a voice in that vast flaming radiance expounded the profound Dharma in verse Dharmas have always been quiet and empty And have no self No sentient being can be captured In the past present or future Like illusions dreams bubbles mirages Fog lightning foam And a flaming wheel drawn by whirling a torch All dharmas arising through causes and conditions are unreal From ignorance and thirsty love  of being the roots of birth and death Ones world arises Observe that ignorance and thirsty love have no selfessence Because dharmas are innately pure Like the open sky Beyond description with words After hearing these stanzas spoken by the web of radiance Viviśana king of Laṅkā forthwith acquired endurance in the realization that dharmas have no self Among the rākṣasas some acquired endurance of adversity some activated the bodhi mind some acquired endurance in accord and some saw the truth Viviśana king of Laṅkā acquired a perfect understanding of the Buddha Dharma without doubts about it He donned the armor of unwavering faith and made a vow in verse Gods asuras The Brahmaking and all Brahma gods Do not see or know The unsurpassed wondrous Dharma I will master the Dharma in the future Acquire all hindrancefree wisdomknowledge Attain Buddhahood in this world And deliver countless koṭis of sentient beings I will expound the wondrous Dharma of Buddhas Such as the unexcelled Eightfold Right Path And acquire boundless wisdom And a sublime body adorned with the thirtytwo marks  I will enable sentient beings To diligently do pure karmas Complete the virtuous training for Buddhahood And discard their fears I will accumulate merits end all afflictions And widely benefit sentient beings My face as radiant as the sun and moon I will become a Buddha in the Three Realms of Existence Then Viviśana king of Laṅkā attained  no regress from the anuttarasamyaksabodhi mind He manifested various wonderful flowers choice incense powdered incense solid perfumes magnificent crowns and garments jeweled banners and canopies silks and pearl necklaces and he played music clapped his hands and sang songs of praise His wonderful voice pervading everywhere he praised the Tathāgatas superb merits and sublime appearance Holding these offerings walking across the open sky like a gooseking he and his retinue went to the place where the Buddha was Upon arrival they descended from the sky and joined their palms facing the Buddha They prostrated themselves at the WorldHonored Ones feet a hundred times and circled Him three times and even a thousand times Then Viviśana king of Laṅkā like a felled tree prostrated himself before the Buddha He said Namo  immeasurable merit and majesty the supreme dharma body the lion among men the supreme WorldHonored One in the Three Realms of Existence ākyamuni Tathāgata Arhat SamyakSabuddha Then he rose joined his palms and praised the Buddhas merits in verse In koṭis of His past lives To seek bodhi He diligently did what was hard to do And practiced asceticism He gave solicitors as alms Food and drink clothing vehicles And the seven treasures in the koṭis For an inconceivable number of kalpas without regrets For koṭis of kalpas He relinquished things hard to relinquish Such as His country villages subjects Majestic palaces and abundant treasures In a past life He was Prince Siddhārtha In a mountain forest He gave away His wife He relinquished His life to save a starving tigress suckling its cubs Cut off His flesh to feed hungry doves And gave His eyes to a blind Brahmin Without resentment or regret To cultivate the cause of bodhi With delight He gave away his head to a solicitor To cultivate purity He observed the precepts In His holy training Without omission or violation He never took lives Or stole others things As He led the Brahma way of life With no attachment to the worldly ways He never used false speech Or drank alcohol And He protected sentient beings As if they were Himself He never used divisive speech abusive speech Or suggestive speech out of anger The WorldHonored One always did good and stayed away from evil And was never offended or angered by sentient beings To accumulate merits He never followed the wrong views or harbored malice And He sincerely made offerings to the Three Jewels He renounced family life And discarded the five desires He abided by the Buddha precepts And trained to achieve liberation He endured adversity suffering Slander abuse and false blame He harbored no malice toward sentient beings Because he endured suffering for their sake With lovingkindness he gazed upon sentient beings As if they were his sons Life after life the Buddha trained in endurance  Aiming to deliver koṭis of suffering sentient beings In a past life the Tathāgata was a ṛṣi called Endurance Advocate  Who sought bodhi When his body was mutilated by the king of Kaliṅga He endured pain without harboring malice toward that king Then He expounded the Dharma to that king and his queen To delight them For inconceivable koṭis of kalpas He made energetic progress in Removing indolence evil thinking and narrowmindedness He endured all practices of asceticism And made vast energetic progress in attaining bodhi He did walking meditation without sleep or fatigue And reverently made offerings to innumerable Buddhas He satisfied sentient beings needs And trained to attain Buddhahood and acquire the unsurpassed Dharma He practiced meditation to tame his mind And attained the four dhyānas  And the four samādhis of the formless realm His attainment in samādhi and right mindfulness Led to the five transcendental powers As He mastered meditation free from afflictions The Tathāgatas wisdom is perfect and affliction free He knows that dharmas are illusory and false and that There is no autonomous self no person no sentient being and no everlasting soul Yet sentient beings are trapped in the web of afflictions And transmigrate according to their karmas The desire realm is impure Because sentient beings have the four defilements However the realm of sentient beings has always been pure Knowing the purity of that realm He achieved the six pāramitās Who can better expound the wisdomknowledge and skillful means To accumulate the endless merits required for Buddhahood I revolve before the Tathāgata To do excellent karmas using my body voice and mind I bow down to the Buddha Praying that I will attain Buddhahood in a future life After Viviśana king of Laṅkā spoke these stanzas he again manifested wonderful flowers choice incense powdered incense solid perfumes magnificent crowns and garments and jeweled banners and canopies and he played music sang songs of praise and reverently attended the Buddha As he properly made these offerings to the Buddha voicehearers and great Bodhisattvas so too did his rākṣasas to delight the Buddha Questions and Answers After Viviśana king of Laṅkā made his offerings he asked the Buddha WorldHonored One I have questions and would like to ask the Tathāgata Arhat SamyakSabuddha I pray that the WorldHonored One will explain to me The Buddha answered King of Laṅkā you have my permission to ask your questions at your pleasure I will explain to delight your heart What Is a Sentient Being With the Buddhas permission Viviśana asked the Buddha WorldHonored One what is a sentient being Why is a sentient being called a sentient being The Buddha answered King of Laṅkā a sentient being is called a sentient being because it is an assemblage of multiple conditions such as name and form the six faculties and the six domainsearth water fire wind space and consciousness Moreover  a sentient being is the requital for its past karmas which are like a bundle of reeds A sentient being mistakenly holds the selfimage of having an autonomous self and being a person a sentient being and an everlasting soul and regards itself as a nurturer a knower a perceiver a doer a toucher and a recipient Viviśana asked WorldHonored One for a sentient being what is its root in what does it abide and what is its cause The Buddha answered King of Laṅkā for a sentient being ignorance is its root in love  it abides and karmas are its cause Viviśana asked WorldHonored One how many kinds of karmas are there The Buddha answered King of Laṅkā there are three kinds of karmas What these three pure impure and neither Then Viviśana asked WorldHonored One how does a sentient being abandon this life to accept the next life and how does it abandon its old body to accept a new body The Buddha answered King of Laṅkā after a sentient being abandons its body the karmic wind blows its  consciousness away to accept the requital for the karmas it has done whether good evil or neither Driven by the karmic wind a sentient being effortlessly accepts a new body in a place whether through a womb an egg moisture or miraculous formation though karma does not know what requital it brings King of Laṅkā this is how a sentient being abandons its old body and life to accept a new body and life Viviśana asked WorldHonored One after a sentient beings  consciousness has abandoned its dead body and before it accepts a new body where does it stay in the interim The Buddha asked King of Laṅkā what is your opinion When a seed in the field sprouts does the seed perish before the sprout emerges does the sprout emerge before the seed perishes or does the sprout emerge when the seed perishes Viviśana answered WorldHonored One the seed does not perish before the sprout emerges Nor does the sprout emerge before the seed perishes It is when the seed perishes that the sprout emerges The Buddha said Indeed King of Laṅkā Likewise the old consciousness does not end before the new consciousness arises Nor does the new consciousness arise before the old consciousness ends The arising of the new consciousness and the end of the old consciousness take place simultaneously King of Laṅkā as an analogy when an inchworm moves its body always follows its head and flexes and extends without interruption Indeed indeed King of Laṅkā likewise when  consciousness sees that the life  has ended without interruption it transfers itself into a new body Viviśana asked WorldHonored One if so there is no interim body The Buddha answered King of Laṅkā for a sentient being born through an egg its  consciousness abandons its dead body and enters an egg However captured by the karmic wind it stays in the egg unconscious Consciousness arises only after  the egg is ripe to hatch Because this is the way of a sentient being born through an egg Before the new body is ripe it has no awareness Because of the karmic force King of Laṅkā if a sentient being has a great store of merits he can be reborn into a WheelTurning Kings family When he is in his mothers womb he is neither blended with nor tainted by the impurities in the womb King of Laṅkā a WheelTurning Kings son usually is born through miraculous formation However if he is born through the womb his  consciousness enters a completely formed body in the womb and breaks the placenta to be born Therefore King of Laṅkā there can be an interim body Then Viviśana asked WorldHonored One what is the size of a sentient beings consciousness and what is its form The Buddha answered King of Laṅkā a sentient beings consciousness is immeasurable in size It has no form no shape no appearance no hindrance and no definite place It is invisible and indescribable Viviśana asked WorldHonored One if consciousness is immeasurable in size with no form no shape no appearance no hindrance and no definite place and is invisible and indescribable is it nonexistent The Buddha answered King of Laṅkā I now will use analogies to explain to you King of Laṅkā as an analogy when you great king sit comfortably in your palace or a high tower you are surrounded and attended by beautiful maidens wearing various garments and necklaces In your magnificent garden there are aśoka trees and various flowers When gentle or strong winds blow across the aśoka garden fragrance flows into your palace Do you smell it Viviśana answered Yes WorldHonored One I smell the fragrance The Buddha asked King of Laṅkā can you distinguish the fragrance of different kinds of flowers The king answered Yes WorldHonored One I can The Buddha asked King of Laṅkā do you see the size or form of the fragrance you say that you know The king answered No WorldHonored One Why not Because fragrance has no form no appearance no hindrance and no definite place Therefore I do not see its size or form The Buddha asked King of Laṅkā what is your opinion If the size of that fragrance cannot be seen is this evidence of its nonexistence Viviśana answered No WorldHonored One If that fragrance were nonexistent no one could smell it The Buddha said Indeed indeed King of Laṅkā you should see consciousness in the same way King of Laṅkā if consciousness ceased there would be no difference between birth and death King of Laṅkā consciousness is pure However it is covered by visitorlike afflictions such as ignorance greed and habits King of Laṅkā as an analogy the pure open sky is covered by four visitorlike things What are these four They are smoke cloud dust and fog King of Laṅkā likewise consciousness has always been pure ungraspable and free from taints However it is covered by visitorlike afflictions Because King of Laṅkā if you observe with true wisdom no sentient being can be captured There is no self no person no sentient being no everlasting soul no nurturer no knower no toucher no recipient no viewer and no hearer and there is no form no sensory reception no perception no mental processing and no consciousness  King of Laṅkā if you observe with true wisdom no differentiation can be made King of Laṅkā dharmas have no selfessence because they are assemblages of conditions Although you have learned about the true reality of a sentient being you should not abandon the wilderness of birth and death What is meant by understanding the true reality of a sentient being It means achieving a clear understanding of the Mahāyāna Then the WorldHonored One spoke in verse Those driven by karmic force Are not taking the supreme Eightfold Right Path If they remove their evil karmas and realize what is free from afflictions They will take unexcelled actions to benefit sentient beings The Realm of Sentient Beings Then Viviśana said WorldHonored One sentient beings are as numerous as the countless sands of the Ganges Some have crossed the vast deep ocean of the Three Realms of Existence to its opposite shore and some wish to do the same Some have crossed the ocean by riding the VoiceHearer Vehicle some by riding the Pratyekabuddha Vehicle and some by achieving a clear understanding of the Mahāyāna In the future there will be sentient beings as numerous as the countless sands of an asakhyeya Ganges Rivers riding any of the Three Vehicles to enter nirvāṇa Yet the realm of sentient beings neither increases nor decreases in number Therefore I feel disheartened The Buddha said King of Laṅkā do not feel disheartened Because as the dharma realm and the domain of space have no beginning and no end so too does the realm of sentient beings Therefore King of Laṅkā because the realm of sentient beings is indescribable we know that it neither increases nor decreases Thus in the ocean of the Three Realms of Existence although some sentient beings have crossed it and some will cross it the realm of sentient beings neither increases nor decreases King of Laṅkā as an analogy the domain of space neither increases nor decreases and has no beginning middle or end Therefore it cannot be known Yet it pervades everywhere with no hindrance no shape no action and no appearance Indeed indeed King of Laṅkā one can never find the beginning middle or end of the realm of sentient beings King of Laṅkā only achieving a clear understanding of the holy teachings can be called ending the realm of sentient beings though the path of saskṛta dharmas never ends King of Laṅkā the path of liberation is not apart from the path of saskṛta dharmas Because this is the natural way of the realm of sentient beings Therefore it has no beginning middle or end Analogies Then Viviśana asked WorldHonored One what is an analogy for a sentient beings cycle of birth and death The Buddha answered King of Laṅkā a sentient beings cycle of birth and death is like an immense ocean Then Viviśana asked WorldHonored One what is an analogy for the Dharma of Buddhas The Buddha answered King of Laṅkā the Dharma of Buddha is like a ship Then Viviśana asked WorldHonored One what is an analogy for a bhikṣu who has accepted the complete  precepts The Buddha answered A bhikṣu who has accepted the complete precepts is like a merchant who rides a ship Then Viviśana asked WorldHonored One what is an analogy for whoever fully observes the Buddha precepts without violation The Buddha answered Whoever follows the Dharma fully observes the Buddha precepts without violation and makes energetic progress is like a merchant who brings full provisions to ride a sturdy ship Then Viviśana asked WorldHonored One what is an analogy for a beneficent learned friend The Buddha answered King of Laṅkā a beneficent learned friend is like a ship captain Then Viviśana asked WorldHonored One what is an analogy for diligently walking the Eightfold Right Path The Buddha answered King of Laṅkā diligently walking the Eightfold Right Path is like the right wind driving the ship to sail fast  Then Viviśana asked WorldHonored One what is an analogy for dhyāna samādhi and transcendental powers The Buddha answered King of Laṅkā dhyāna samādhi and transcendental powers are like a treasure land Then Viviśana asked WorldHonored One what is an analogy for the Seven Bodhi Factors The Buddha answered King of Laṅkā the Seven Bodhi Factors are like the seven treasures Then Viviśana asked WorldHonored One what is an analogy for completing the Seven Bodhi Factors and achieving a clear understanding of the Mahāyāna The Buddha answered King of Laṅkā completing the Seven Bodhi Factors and achieving a clear understanding of the Mahāyāna are like taking the seven treasures and becoming hugely wealthy and completely satisfied It is good to renounce family life to follow my Dharma and attain the unsurpassed Buddhahood Then the WorldHonored One spoke in verse Observe ones own and others suffering In the Three Realms of Existence He who renounces family life And the fetters of existence to follow my Dharma Is called a Buddhason The most virtuous one amid multitudes Training diligently in accordance with the Dharma He will become a WorldHonored One Then Viviśana asked WorldHonored One suppose that someone has renounced family life to follow the Buddha Dharma However he cannot observe the precepts He either violates the precepts such as the precept for celibacy or gives up his Dharma robe and returns to secular life WorldHonored One what is an analogy for this fool The Buddha answered If someone has renounced family life to follow my Dharma and has accepted the precepts then violates them this fool will likely be reborn to go down an evil lifepath He is like a merchant who drowns at sea because his ship is broken Viviśana asked WorldHonored One what is an analogy for someone who will be reborn to take a good lifepath though he has violated the precept for celibacy and still claims that he diligently trains in the Brahma way of life What is an analogy for someone who will be reborn to take a good lifepath though he has given up his Dharma robe and the precepts and returned to secular life The Buddha answered King of Laṅkā he is like a merchant who after his ship is broken grabs a ship board or a corpse or stays afloat on his own power If he holds onto a ship board he may be blown to an island If he holds onto a corpse he may be washed ashore Because the sea does not lodge a corpse If he has the power to stay afloat he may swim somewhere with the compassionate help of the sea god Indeed indeed King of Laṅkā likewise if someone renounces family life to follow my Dharma but cannot observe the precepts with purity or if someone gives up his Dharma robe and the precepts and returns to secular life he may nevertheless be reborn to take a good lifepath The reason is that he has acquired the right faith that he retains innate purity that he constantly takes compassionate actions or that he continues to make energetic progress Therefore King of Laṅkā because of my Dharma whoever has violated the precepts or returned to secular life may nevertheless be reborn to take a good lifepath Then the WorldHonored One spoke in verse For the multiple sins committed In ones countless thousands of koṭis of past lives If one repents of them and vows never to commit any new sin Ones sins are expunged and will never increase Aids to Attain Bodhi Then Viviśana asked WorldHonored One how many aids are there to attain bodhi The Buddha answered King of Laṅkā there are thirtyseven aids to attain bodhi What are these thirtyseven They comprise the Four Abidings of Mindfulness the Four Right Endeavors the Four Ways to Attain Samādhi the Five Roots the Five Powers the Seven Bodhi Factors and the Eightfold Right Path These are called the thirtyseven aids to attain bodhi Then Viviśana asked WorldHonored One how many liberation doors are there The Buddha answered King of Laṅkā there are Three Liberation Doors emptiness no appearance and no wish Then Viviśana asked WorldHonored One how should one train The Buddha answered One should train to eradicate afflictions end suffering and enter nirvāṇa Then Viviśana asked WorldHonored One how many remedial practices are there  The Buddha answered King of Laṅkā there are three remedial practices What are these three Those with a greedy mind should meditate on the impurities  those with an angry mind should meditate on lovingkindness and compassion those with a deluded mind should meditate on the dependent arising of dharmas These are the three remedial practices Then Viviśana asked WorldHonored One what things should one skillfully train to know The Buddha answered King of Laṅkā one should skillfully train to know four things skillful means Then Viviśana asked WorldHonored One what observations should one make The Buddha answered King of Laṅkā one should observe the cause and effect revealed in the profound Four Noble Truths and the Twelve Links of Dependent Arising Training to Attain Bodhi Then Viviśana king of Laṅkā circled the WorldHonored One three times and showered on the Buddha flowers made of varicolored seven treasures Then facing the Buddha he knelt with his right knee on the ground joined his palms and reverently asked the Tathāgata in verse What holy training should a Bodhisattva do To make energetic progress in benefiting the world Making the supreme resolve to attain bodhi He practices almsgiving observing the precepts enduring adversity and making energetic progress As he seeks wisdom free from afflictions He draws in and transforms koṭis of sentient beings Adorned with taintfree treasures He attains Buddhahood in a splendid land Then the WorldHonored One answered Very good very good King of Laṅkā you ask the Tathāgata about this matter Hearken hearken and ponder well King of Laṅkā a BodhisattvaMahāsattva should constantly train in the six pāramitās and harbor no malice toward any sentient being King of Laṅkā a Bodhisattva should never regress from this training but should increase his mastery of the Buddha Dharma With no attachment to worldly dharmas he draws in teaches and transforms innumerable sentient beings He purifies Buddha Lands and achieves a clear understanding of the Mahāyāna in order to master the Buddha Dharma hindrance free Then Viviśana asked WorldHonored One how should one train to attain anuttarasamyaksabodhi The Buddha answered King of Laṅkā one should discard pride arrogance and jealousy and cultivate the Four Immeasurable Minds One should delight in benefiting all sentient beings and should refrain from killing stealing sexual misconduct drinking false speech divisive speech abusive speech and suggestive speech One should never lose the bodhi mind even temporarily but should diligently train in the six pāramitās Whatever one does should be done to bring peace and joy to sentient beings In the midst of saskṛta dharmas ones mind should remain quiet and peaceful Moreover King of Laṅkā if you aspire to seek bodhi you should know that bodhi is but a name a word called bodhi With no bottom bodhi is profound and hard to know Bodhi has no word  no appearance and no analogy and is quiet pure unsurpassed and inconceivable Bodhi seeks nothing and has no end no destruction and no decay Bodhi has no selfessence no action no indication and no hindrance Bodhi has no illumination and no continuous flow of afflictions King of Laṅkā how does one seek bodhi Seeking nothing is seeking bodhi Because King of Laṅkā if one has no attachment to anything one can attain anuttarasamyaksabodhi If one discards the selfimage of having a self and being a person a sentient being an everlasting soul a nurturer a doer a recipient a knower and a perceiver then one can attain anuttarasamyaksabodhi If one has no attachment to dharmas the five aggregates or the eighteen spheres nor to Buddhas or Bodhisattvas then one can attain anuttarasamyaksabodhi Because King of Laṅkā nofixation is bodhi If one does not fixate on the permanence or impermanence of dharmas one will attain bodhi in a future life Because King of Laṅkā all dharmas will perish Then Viviśana asked WorldHonored One what should one know about all worldly dharmas The Buddha answered King of Laṅkā one should know that all dharmas are like illusions manifestations dreams mirages a moon in the water and a gandharvas city This is the way to observe know and understand all worldly dharmas Forthwith Viviśana king of Laṅkā acquired the Bodhisattva samādhi called WisdomKnowledge of Unequaled Dharma Radiance and acquired the dhāraṇī called All Wonderful Sounds as well as countless other samādhis and dhāraṇīs Then Viviśana said WorldHonored One now that I have acquired this samādhi and this dhāraṇī I know all worldly dharmas The Buddha asked King of Laṅkā what do you know about them Viviśana answered World Honored One all worldly dharmas are like dreams illusions echoes mountain cascades the moon in the water the wind blowing illusory flowers in the sky autumn clouds the radiance of a jewel lamp flames dewdrops on a flower a gandharvas city bubbles on water rainbows and mirages WorldHonored One I now realize that worldly dharmas are impermanent Bestowing the Prophecy of Attaining Buddhahood Then the WorldHonored One emitted from the top of His head vast radiance in  koṭi nayuta diverse colors such as blue yellow red white purple crystal and golden It illuminated countless asakhyeyas of Buddha Lands Then it returned and entered into the top of His head Then the honorable Mahāmaudgalyāyana rose from his seat facing the Buddha bared his right shoulder knelt with his right knee on the ground joined his palms and asked the Tathāgata in verse The Buddhas release of a web of pure radiance Is not without reason I pray that the Buddha will explain that His web of radiance Prophesies someones attainment of the unsurpassed enlightenment The Buddha asked Mahāmaudgalyāyana Do you see that Viviśana this king of Laṅkā with joined palms is standing properly before me making vast offerings to me voicehearers and Bodhisattvas and using this merit to activate the anuttarasamyaksabodhi mind Mahāmaudgalyāyana answered WorldHonored One I see this I see this The Buddha said Mahāmaudgalyāyana Viviśana this king of Laṅkā after my time will make offerings to and attend  koṭi nayuta Buddhas Then using the power of his roots of goodness he will be reborn in a world called Lotus Flower City That world has a Buddha called Lotus Flower Merit and Thunder Mighty King Tathāgata Arhat SamyakSabuddha who now resides there and expounds the Dharma That BuddhaTathāgata has an immeasurable lifespan in that pure world After Viviśana this king of Laṅkā is reborn there through miraculous formation he will forthwith ascend to the first Bodhisattva ground the Joyful Ground Then he will ascend  even to the tenth Bodhisattva ground After countless kalpas he will be born in this Sahā World and become a Buddha called Wonderful Thunder Pure Golden Radiance That Reveals the Jeweled Canopy of Merit Adorning the Topknot Vairocana King Tathāgata Arhat SamyakSabuddha Knowledge and Conduct Perfected Sugata Understanding the World Unsurpassed One Tamer of men Teacher of Gods and Men BuddhaBhagavān His world will be called Lightning Jeweled Crown Its ground will be level without mountains craters cliffs rocks or filthy things There will be no women or evil lifepaths The purity of that Buddha Land will surpass that of Amitābha Tathāgatas Buddha Land Bodhisattvas will fill that land The kalpa in which He will appear will be called Observation of Illumination In this final life that BuddhaTathāgatas lifespan will be immeasurable Mahāmaudgalyāyana that is why the Tathāgata SamyakSabuddha smiled and emitted radiance from the top of His head Viviśana king of Laṅkā after receiving the prophecy of his attaining anuttarasamyaksabodhi was joyful and exuberant his entire body shaking with Dharma delight As a sentient being is born and dies No dharma can be captured The beginning middle and end have no selfessence Nor does a sentient beings life However a sentient being receives requitals according to its karmas And endlessly transmigrates through lifepaths If one trains to attain bodhi One will come to know that dharmas have no selfessence After speaking these stanzas Viviśana king of Laṅkā descended from the sky and circled the Buddha three times Through the Buddhas awesome spiritual power he stepped back and sat on one side Meanwhile in this oceanlike assembly some gods dragons and asuras acquired spiritual fruits some yakṣas and rākṣasas activated the bodhi mind some kinaras and mahoragas acquired freedom from doubts about the Buddha Dharma some garuḍas gandharvas and vidyādharas acquired dhāraṇīs and spiritual fruits with no regress Then the great earth quaked and radiance naturally pervaded everywhere in this Buddha Land even illuminating the large and small iron mountain ranges All suffering on evil lifepaths was removed The sky rained down celestial flowers and sounded celestial drums and calls Celestial garments naturally unfurled in the sky Then Viviśana king of Laṅkā said to his multitude Together you should come to the WorldHonored One to pay homage and activate the anuttarasamyaksabodhi mind Then countless hundreds of thousands of rākṣasas assembled Facing the Buddha they joined their palms and said WorldHonored One we are assembled here From now on we take refuge in the Buddha the Dharma and the Saṅgha and activate the bodhi mind WorldHonored One from now on we will do Mahāyāna training as the Tathāgata can verify WorldHonored One we will in a future life attain true enlightenment in this Sahā World because we will definitely end evil karmas and benefit all sentient beings The Buddha said Very good very good If you can activate the bodhi mind you should do four kinds of good dharmas If you do these dharmas well you will not lose the bodhi mind What are these four If you can fully do these four kinds of dharmas you will not lose the bodhi mind A Past Life of Viviśanas Then the dragonking Sāgara rose from his seat facing the Buddha bared his right shoulder knelt with his right knee on the ground joined his palms and asked WorldHonored One what roots of goodness did Viviśana king of Laṅkā develop in the past which enabled him to make vast offerings to the Buddha and innumerable voicehearers and Bodhisattvas to activate the bodhi mind with no regress and to receive the prophecy of his attaining anuttarasamyaksabodhi The Buddha answered DragonKing before countless asakhyeya kalpas in the past there was a Buddha called

life to follow His Dharma and to practice asceticism some plant bodhi seeds in order to cross to the opposite shore of the ocean of existence with afflictions Good man all Buddhas can use such skillful means to enable innumerable sentient beings to cross to that opposite shore Good man know that transcendental powers displayed in an impure world are produced by a Buddhas response body or a Bodhisattvas skillful means The Three Bodies of a Buddha Then OceanDeep Mastery Wisdom and Transcendental Powers Bodhisattva asked the Buddha WorldHonored One how many bodies does a Buddha have The Buddha answered Good man in brief a Buddha has three bodies What are these three They are  the truth body He asked WorldHonored One what is a Tathāgatas reward body The Buddha answered Good man a Buddhas reward body is like the body you now see that I have displayed Also Tathāgatas who attain Buddhahood in the present or future in pure Buddha Lands are in Their reward bodies He asked WorldHonored One what is a Tathāgatas response body The Buddha answered Good man all Tathāgatas who demonstrate attainment of Buddhahood in the present or future in impure worlds are in Their response bodies such as a Tathāgata walking energetically a Tathāgata subjugating māras a Tathāgata eliciting great compassion a Tathāgata descending from Tuṣita Heaven or a Tathāgata entering parinirvāṇa in order to sustain His Dharma in the true Dharma age the Dharmalikeness age and the Dharmaending age Good man know that a Buddhas response body displays such things He asked WorldHonored One what is a Tathāgatas dharma body  The Buddha answered Good man a Tathāgatas truth body is invisible It has no form no appearance no hindrance no indication no dependency no grasping no birth no death and no analogy and abides nowhere Thus good man a Tathāgatas ineffable body dharma body wisdom body unequaled body peerless body Vairocana body sky body endless body indestructible body boundless body ultimate reality body nofalsity body and noanalogy body are called His truth body He asked WorldHonored One if a Buddhas truth body has no form no appearance and is even ineffable is it nonexistent The Buddha asked Good man what is your opinion Is the open sky nonexistent or existent He answered WorldHonored One the open sky never ends and has no appearance Because if it were nonexistent it could not be described as hindrance free If it were existent it would have components a boundary a form and matter Therefore WorldHonored One the open sky is neither nonexistent nor existent and pervades everywhere The Buddha said Very good very good good man Indeed indeed good man A Tathāgatas truth body is neither nonexistent nor existent Because good man if it were nonexistent no Buddha could appear in the world or display His immeasurable transcendental powers If it were existent then it would have components and a place that can be found and all ordinary beings  could attain Buddhahood simultaneously not successively according to their readiness Therefore good man a Tathāgatas truth body is neither nonexistent nor existent Yet it does Buddha work for all sentient beings sake He asked WorldHonored One of the merits acquired by making offerings to a Tathāgatas truth body reward body and response body which is the greatest The Buddha answered Good man by making offerings to one of a Buddhas bodies one makes offerings to all His bodies Because good man all radiance can dispel darkness and bring brightness and because radiance does not coexist with darkness Indeed indeed good man If one makes an offering to any of a Buddhas bodies the merit one acquires can dispel all darkness of ignorance and illuminate the road of liberation hindrance free Request to Display the Second Buddha Ground Then OceanDeep Mastery Wisdom and Transcendental Powers Bodhisattva asked the Buddha WorldHonored One I pray that You will display the second Buddha ground The Buddha asked Good man can you see it He answered WorldHonored One I would like to see its appearance Then the WorldHonored One emitted from one pore vast radiance called illuminating without appearance illuminating an ineffably ineffable number of Buddha Lands and all their forms disappeared Then He asked the multitude of Bodhisattvas What do you see now They answered WorldHonored One we see nothing but radiance The Buddha asked Good men what is this radiance that you see like They answered WorldHonored One we see Buddha Lands as numerous as the sands of countless hundreds of thousands of koṭis of nayutas of Ganges Rivers only as an expanse of radiance Then the WorldHonored One withdrew the radiance and all those Buddha Lands became visible as before He told this multitude of Bodhisattvas Even if the Tathāgata described the second Buddha ground it would be hard for all of you to understand what you heard not to mention your coming to see the third through the tenth Buddha ground Good men as an analogy the radiance of the sun and moon brings great benefits to all sentient beings and their power enables sentient beings to know day and night one day and half a day one month and half a month years and seasons However sentient beings cannot see the physical forms of the sun and moon and can see only the shape of a disk of light Indeed indeed Likewise a Tathāgata Arhat SamyakSabuddha brings great benefits to all sentient beings Because of Him they come to know dharmas whether good or evil worldly or supraworldly with afflictions or without afflictions Then they can realize the truth and cross the wilderness of all existences However sentient beings cannot see the physical form of a Tathāgatas reward body and they can only see His response body and its displays of transcendental powers Therefore all of you should know that Buddha grounds are beyond description using all sounds and words Only their names can be told What One Will Accomplish by Upholding This Sūtra Then OceanDeep Mastery Wisdom and Transcendental Powers Bodhisattva asked the Buddha WorldHonored One who can be delivered from all evil lifepaths The Buddha answered Good men whoever enters Vairocanas store of all Buddha wisdom to hear the ten Tathāgata grounds in this profound Sūtra of Achieving a Clear Understanding of the Mahāyāna and after hearing it elicits faith accepts and upholds it reads and recites it copies and teaches others to copy it widely expounds it and upholds the name of this sūtra will be delivered from any evil lifepath even if he should go down it  WorldHonored One who will activate the bodhi mind Good man whoever upholds this sūtra or even only its name WorldHonored One who will take Bodhisattva actions Good man whoever upholds this sūtra WorldHonored One who will quickly achieve the six pāramitās Good man whoever upholds this sūtra WorldHonored One who will encounter a Buddha Good man whoever hears this sūtra WorldHonored One who will encounter a Buddha and receive from Him the prophecy of his attaining Buddhahood Good man whoever keeps this secret of a Tathāgata WorldHonored One who will be a great guiding teacher of sentient beings Good man whoever upholds this profound Tathāgata store WorldHonored One who will be a Buddhason Good man whoever believes in this sūtra WorldHonored One who will acquire all Bodhisattva grounds Good man whoever hears this sūtra WorldHonored One who will acquire the Dharma of all Buddhas Good man whoever makes offerings to this wonderful Dharma torch WorldHonored One who knows the ways of voicehearers and Pratyekabuddhas but does not ride either of their vehicles to nirvāṇa Good man whoever accepts this wondrous Dharma store WorldHonored One what is the name of this sūtra How should we uphold it Good man this sūtra is called Achieving a Clear Understanding of the Mahāyāna also called Entering Vairocanas Store of All Buddha Wisdom Uphold it as such Then the WorldHonored One spoke in verse If one wants to attain Buddha bodhi To make unsurpassed energetic progress To turn the holy afflictionfree Inconceivable Dharma wheel To erect the Dharma banner To beat the Dharma drum To light the Dharma lamp To blow the Dharma conch To acquire radiant wisdom To dispel the darkness of ignorance To deliver sentient beings To establish bodhi wisdom To subjugate māra legions To make offerings to all Buddhas To illuminate the world To bring superb purity To remain untainted by worldly dharmas To acquire the afflictionfree wisdom To take every action to benefit sentient beings And to be reborn

Dynasty by The Tripiṭaka Master Xuanzang from China The Assembly Thus I have heard It was decked with interlaced wonderful adornments and its size was boundless and immeasurable beyond the scales of the Three Realms of Existence surpassing whatever arises from supraworldly roots of goodness It used the extremely pure consciousness as its appearance It was a Tathāgatas abode where great Bodhisattvas assembled and was protected by innumerable gods dragons humans and nonhumans Sustained by the delight of the vast Dharma flavor it provided benefits to sentient beings ended their afflictions and tribulations and warded off māras Its majesty surpassed that of all other abodes because it was where a Tathāgatas majesty abided Its road was great mindfulness wisdom and actions He was free from the appearance of the two kinds of actions knew that dharmas have no appearance  and abided where a Buddha abides He realized the equality of all Buddhas and arrived at the hindrancefree place His Dharma could not be moved  His teachings established  were inconceivable and His actions were hindrance free He playfully entered the three time frames  because they are equal by nature and manifested His body everywhere in all worlds He attained the greatest enlightenment through all His meritorious actions and possessed true wisdomknowledge of all dharmas with no doubts about them The bodies He manifested were beyond differentiation though they were distinctive and His wisdomknowledge was sought by all Bodhisattvas He abided on the Buddha Ground of equality in the ultimate dharma realm throughout the domain of space and the endless future He was accompanied by innumerable great voicehearers who were welltamed Buddhasons Their minds were liberated  their wisdom was liberated  and their observance of the precepts was pure Seeking Dharma delight they heard much of the Dharma and retained what they heard These BodhisattvaMahāsattvas were headed by Wonderful Birth Bodhisattva

reflections of dharmas as does a perfect mirror Thus in a Tathāgatas mirror of wisdomknowledge the reflections of a sentient beings twelve fields six sense objects and six consciousnesses appear A perfect mirror is used as an analogy because a Tathāgatas wisdomknowledge is impartial  as is a perfect mirror Therefore this mirror of wisdomknowledge is called the great mirrorlike wisdomknowledge

BodhisattvaMahāsattva asked the Buddha WorldHonored One in the pure dharma realm is a Tathāgata the only one who enjoys using the wisdomknowledge of things combined into one flavor Can Bodhisattvas enjoy using it as well The Buddha answered They too can enjoy using the wisdomknowledge of things combined into one flavor Wonderful Birth Bodhisattva then asked the Buddha What kind of Bodhisattvas can enjoy using the wisdomknowledge of things combined into one flavor The Buddha answered They are Bodhisattvas who have acquired endurance in their realization that dharmas have no birth When a Bodhisattva acquires endurance in this understanding he has remedied his perception of duality From then on he no longer perceives self and others as different but enjoys using the wisdomknowledge of things combined into one flavor Wonderful Birth Bodhisattva then asked the Buddha I pray that the Tathāgata will use analogies to enable Bodhisattvas to understand this profound meaning and widely circulate His teachings according to their connections with sentient beings enabling sentient beings after hearing these teachings to quickly acquire endurance in their realization that dharmas have no birth The Buddha answered As an analogy gods in the Thirtythree Heavens who are outside the garden of various trees cannot experience things or feelings without imagining that one has a self and its belongings This garden has such virtues that gods who enter it can combine all their celestial requitals whether things or feelings and enjoy them without thinking Likewise a Bodhisattva who has not acquired endurance in his realization that dharmas have no birth cannot acquire the impartial mind or equability in his feelings Then he is no different from voicehearers or Pratyekabuddhas Because he has the perception of duality he cannot abide in enjoying the wisdomknowledge of things combined into one flavor If he has acquired endurance in his realization that dharmas have no birth he has rid his perception of duality and acquired the impartial mind Then he is different from voicehearers and Pratyekabuddhas Because of his impartial mind he can abide in enjoying the wisdomknowledge of things combined into one flavor In addition Wonderful Birth as another analogy before various rivers flow into the immense ocean their waters depend on different things and are different in quality and their small volumes increase or decrease according to their different karmas Their waters are relied upon by a few aquatic creatures After the rivers have entered the immense ocean their waters have no difference and no limit  and neither increase nor decrease They are relied upon by a vast number of aquatic creatures Likewise if Bodhisattvas have not entered a Tathāgatas immense ocean of the pure dharma realm they have different kinds of small wisdomknowledge which increases or decreases They do different karmas according to their wisdomknowledge which is relied upon by a few sentient beings to ripen their roots of goodness If they have entered a Tathāgatas immense ocean of the pure dharma realm they have the same wisdomknowledge which is boundless and neither increases nor decreases They enjoy using the wisdomknowledge of things combined into one flavor wisdomknowledge that is relied upon by innumerable sentient beings to ripen their roots of goodness Then the WorldHonored One spoke in verse After the Bhagavān pronounced this sūtra BodhisattvaMahāsattvas including Wonderful Birth as well as voicehearers gods asuras and all others in the assembly having heard the Buddhas words greatly rejoiced They believed in accepted and carried out His teachings Sutra Preface When the World Honored One had attained the Way he thought To leave desire behind and to gain calmness and tranquillity is supreme He abided in deep meditative concentration and subdued every demon and externalist In the Deer Park he turned the Dharmawheel of the Four Noble Truths and took across Ajnatakaundinya and the other four disciples who all realized the fruition of the Way Section  Leaving Home and Becoming an Arhat The Buddha said People who take leave of their families and go forth from the householder life who know their mind and penetrate to its origin and who understand the unconditioned Dharma are called Shramanas They constantly observe the  precepts and they value purity in all that they do By practicing the four true paths they can become Arhats Arhats can fly and transform themselves They have a life span of vast eons and wherever they dwell they can move heaven and earth Superior to the Arhat is the Anagamin At the end of his life an Anagamin vital spirit will rise above the nineteenth heaven and he will become an Arhat Superior to the Anagamin is the Sakridagamin who ascends once returns once more and thereafter becomes an Arhat Prior to the Sakridagamin is the Srotaapanna who has seven deaths and seven births remaining and then becomes an Arhat Severing love and desire is like severing the four limbs one never uses them again Section  Severing Love and Renouncing Greed The Buddha said Shaving their hair and beards they become Shramanas who accept the Dharmas of the Way They renounce worldly wealth and riches In receiving alms they accept only what enough They take only one meal a day at noon pass the night beneath trees and are careful not to seek more than that Craving and desire are what cause people to be stupid and dull Section  Clarifying Good and Evil The Buddha said Living beings may perform Ten Good Deeds or Ten Evil Deeds What are the ten Three are done with the body four are done with the mouth and three are done with the mind The three done with the body are killing stealing and lust The four done with the mouth are duplicity harsh speech lies and frivolous speech The three done with the mind are jealousy hatred and stupidity To put a stop to these evils is to perform the Ten Good Deeds  Section  Reducing the Severity of Offenses The Buddha said If a person has many offenses and does not repent of them but cuts off all thought of repentance the offenses will engulf him just as water returning to the sea will gradually become deeper and wider If a person has offenses and realizing they are wrong reforms and does good the offenses will dissolve by themselves just as a sick person who begins to perspire will gradually be cured Tolerating Evildoers and Avoiding Hatred The Buddha said When an evil person hears about your goodness and intentionally comes to cause trouble you should restrain yourself and not become angry or blame him Then the one who has come to do evil will do evil to himself  Section  Evil Returns to the Doer The Buddha said There was a person who upon hearing that I observe the Way and practice great humane kindness intentionally came to berate me I was silent and did not reply When he finished abusing me I asked If you are courteous to people and they do not accept your courtesy the courtesy returns to you does it not  It does he replied I said ow you are scolding me but I do not receive it so the misfortune returns to you and must remain with you It is as inevitable as an echo that follows a sound or as a shadow that follows a form In the end you cannot avoid it Therefore be careful not to do evil  Section  Abusing Others Defiles Oneself The Buddha said An evil person who harms a sage is like one who raises his head and spits at heaven Instead of reaching heaven the spittle falls back on him It is the same with someone who throws dust against the wind Instead of going somewhere else the dust returns to defile his own body The sage can not be harmed Misdeeds will inevitably destroy the doer By Returning to the Source You Find the Way The Buddha said Deep learning and a love of the Way make the Way difficult to attain When you guard your mind and revere the Way the Way is truly great Joyful Charity Brings Blessings The Buddha said When you see someone who is practicing giving aid him joyfully and you will obtain vast and great blessings  A Shramana asked is there an end to those blessings  The Buddha said Consider the flame of a single torch Though hundreds and thousands of people come to light their own torches from it so that they can cook their food and ward off darkness the first torch remains the same Blessings too are like this  Section  Giving food to a million Srotaapannas is not as good as giving food to a single Sakridagamin Questions about the Way and Past Lives A Shramana asked the Buddha By what causes and conditions can I know my past lives and understand the ultimate Way  The Buddha said Purifying your mind and preserving your resolve you can understand the ultimate Way Just as when you polish a mirror the dust vanishes and brightness remains so too if you cut off desire and do not seek you then can know past lives Asking about Goodness and Greatness A Shramana asked the Buddha What is goodness What is the foremost greatness To unite your will with the Way is greatness Section  What is the utmost brilliance Patient people since they are not evil will surely gain the respect of others Then the mind defilements are gone completely so that it is pure and untainted that is the utmost brilliance When there is nothing from before the formation of the heavens and the earth until now in any of the ten directions that you do not see know or hear when you have attained omniscience that may be called brilliance  Section  Casting Aside Love and Attaining the Way The Buddha said People who cherish love and desire do not see the Way Just as when you stir clear water with your hand those who stand beside it cannot see their reflections so too people who are entangled in love and desire have turbidity in their minds and therefore they cannot see the Way When the stains of love and desire disappear you will be able to see the Way  Section  When Light Arrives Darkness Departs The Buddha said Those who see the Way are like someone holding a torch who enters a dark room dispelling the darkness so that only light remains When you study the Way and see the truth ignorance vanishes and light remains forever  Section  Thoughts and So Forth Are Basically Empty The Buddha said my Dharma is the mindfulness that is both mindfulness and nonmindfulness If you are off by a hairsbreadth you will lose it in an instant Contemplating Both the False and the True The Buddha said Contemplate heaven and earth and be mindful of their impermanence Contemplate the world and be mindful of its impermanence With this awareness one quickly attains the Way  Section  Realize that the Self Is Truly Empty The Buddha said You should be mindful of the four elements within the body Though each has a name none of them is the self Since they are not the self they are like an illusion Fame Destroys Life Roots The Buddha said There are people who follow emotion and desire and seek to be famous Those who are greedy for worldly fame and do not study the Way simply waste their effort and wear themselves out  Section  Wealth and Sex Cause Suffering The Buddha said People are unable to renounce wealth and sex They are just like a child who cannot resist honey on the blade of a knife Even though the amount is not even enough for a single meal serving  he will lick it and risk cutting his tongue in the process A Family Is Worse than a Prison The Buddha said People are bound to their families and homes to such an extent that these are worse than a prison Eventually one is released from prison but people never think of leaving their families Sexual Desire Obstructs the Way The Buddha said Of all longings and desires there is none as strong as sex If there were something else like it no one in the entire world would be able to cultivate the Way  Section  The Fire of Desire Burns The Buddha said Person with love and desire is like one who carries a torch while walking against the wind he is certain to burn his hand  Section  Demons from the Heavens Try to Tempt the Buddha The heaven spirit offered beautiful maidens to the Buddha hoping to destroy his resolve The Buddha said What have you skinbags full of filth come here for Go away Ive got no use for you  Then the heaven spirit became very respectful and asked about the meaning of the Way The Buddha explained it for him and he immediately attained the fruition of Srotaapanna One Attains the Way after Letting Go of Attachments The Buddha said Person who follows the Way is like a floating piece of wood that courses along with the current If it does not touch either shore if people do not pluck it out if ghosts and spirits do not intercept it if it is not trapped in whirlpools and if it does not rot I guarantee that the piece of wood will reach the sea If students of the Way are not deluded by emotion and desire and if they are not caught up in the many crooked views but are vigorous in their cultivation of the unconditioned I guarantee that they will certainly attain the Way Don Indulge the Wild Mind The Buddha said Be careful not to believe your own mind your mind is not to be believed Be careful not to get involved with sex involvement with sex leads to disaster After you have attained Arhatship you can believe your own mind  Section  Proper Contemplation Counteracts Sexual Desire The Buddha said Be careful not to look at women and do not talk with them If you must speak with them be properly mindful and think I am a Shramana living in a turbid world I should be like the lotus flower which is not stained by the mud  Think of elderly women as your mothers of those who are older than you as your elder sisters of those who are younger as your younger sisters and of very young girls as your daughters Bring forth thoughts to rescue them and put an end to bad thoughts Section  Stay Far Away from the Fire of Desire The Buddha said People who cultivate the Way are like dry grass it is essential to keep it away from an oncoming fire People who cultivate the Way look upon desire as something they must stay far away from Section  When the Mind Is Still Desire Is Dispelled The Buddha said There was once someone who was plagued by ceaseless sexual desire and wished to castrate himself The Buddha said to himTo cut off your sexual organ would not be as good as to cut off your mind Your mind is like a supervisor if the supervisor stops his employees will also quit If the deviant mind is not stopped what good does it do to cut off the organ  The Buddha spoke a verse for him Desire is born from your intentions The Buddha said this verse was spoken by the Buddha Kashyapa  Section  Emptying out the Self Quells Fear The Buddha said People worry because of love and desire That worry then leads to fear If you transcend love what worries will there be  Section  Wisdom and Clarity Defeat the Demons The Buddha said People who cultivate the Way are like a soldier who goes into battle alone against ten thousand enemies He dons his armor and goes out the gate He may prove to be a coward he may get halfway to the battlefield and retreat he may be killed in combat or he may return victorious Shramanas who study the Way must make their minds resolute and be vigorous courageous and valiant Not fearing what lies ahead they should defeat the hordes of demons and obtain the fruition of the Way By Staying in the Middle One Attains the Way One evening a Shramana was reciting the Sutra of the Teaching Bequeathed by the Buddha Kashyapa The sound of his voice was mournful as he reflected remorsefully on his wish to retreat in cultivation The Buddha asked him In the past when you were a householder what did you do  He replied I was fond of playing the lute  The Buddha said What happened when the strings were slack  He replied They didnt sound  What happened when they were too tight  He replied The sounds were cut short  What happened when they were tuned just right between slack and tight  He replied The sounds carried  The Buddha said It is the same with a Shramana who studies the Way If his mind is harmonious he can attain the Way If he is impetuous about the Way his impetuousness will tire out his body and if his body is tired his mind will become afflicted If his mind becomes afflicted then he will retreat from his practice If he retreats from his practice his offenses will certainly increase The Sequence that Leads to Success The Buddha said It is difficult for one to leave the evil destinies and become a human being Even if one does become a human being it is still difficult to become a man rather than a woman Even if one does become a man it is still difficult to have the six sense organs complete and perfect Even if the six sense organs are complete and perfect it is still difficult for one to be born in a central country Even if one is born in a central country it is still difficult to be born at a time when there is a Buddha in the world Even if one is born at a time when there is a Buddha in the world it is still difficult to encounter the Way Even if one does resolve one mind on Bodhi it is still difficult to be beyond cultivation and attainment  Section  Birth Leads to Death The Buddha asked a Shramana How long is the human life span  He replied Few days The Buddha said You have not yet understood the Way  He asked another Shramana How long is the human life span  The reply was The space of a meal The Buddha said You have not yet understood the Way  He asked another Shramana How long is the human life span  He replied The length of a single breath The Buddha said Excellent  Section  When you eat honey it is sweet on the surface and sweet in the center it is the same with my Sutras Section  The Way Is Practiced in the Mind The Buddha said Shramana who practices the Way should not be like an ox turning a millstone Such a one walks the Way with his body but his mind is not on the Way  Section  A Straight Mind Gets Rid of Desire The Buddha said One who practices the Way is like an ox pulling a heavy load through deep mud The ox is so extremely exhausted that it dares not glance to the left or right Only when it gets out of the mud can it rest The Shramana should regard emotion and desire as being worse than deep mud and with an undeviating mind he should be mindful of the Way Then he can avoid suffering  Section  Understanding that the World Is Illusory The Buddha said I look upon royalty and high positions as upon the dust that floats through a crack I look upon treasures of gold and jade as upon broken tiles I look upon fine silk clothing as upon cheap cotton xviiTHE SCRIPTURE OF THE ENLIGHTENMENT SUPERNATURAL TRANSFORMATIONS AND EMPOWERMENT OF MAHVAIROCANA Translated by ubhākarasiṃha the Tripiṭaka Master from India together with the ramaṇa Yixing during the Greater TangFascicle One Chapter I The Stations of the Mind When Entering the Mantra Gateway Thus have I heard At one time the Bhagavān was residing in the vast adamantine palace of the Dharma realm empowered by Tathāgatas in which all the vajradharas had all assembled the great pavilion the king of jewels born of the Tathāgatas faithandunderstanding play and supernatural transformations was lofty without a center or perimeter and variously adorned with great and wondrous jewelkings and the body of a bodhisattva formed a lion throne Those vajras were called the vajradhara Gaganāmala the vajradhara Gaganavikrama the vajradhara Gaganasaṃbhava the vajradhara Vicitrāmbaradhara the vajradhara Vicitracārin the vajradhara Sarvadharmasamatāvihārin the vajradhara Anantasattvadhātuparitrāṇa the vajradhara Nārāyaṇabalin the vajradhara Mahānārāyaṇabalin Suvajradhara the vajradhara Paramavega the vajradhara Vimala the vajradhara Vajrāgra the vajradhara Tathāgatavarman the vajradhara Tathāgatapadodbhava the vajradhara Aprapañcavihārin the vajradhara Tathāgatadaśabalasaṃbhava the vajradhara Vimalanetra and Vajrapāṇi Lord of Mysteries Accompanied by a multitude of vajradharas equal in number to the dust motes of ten buddha elds with these at their head and surrounded in front and behind by great bodhisattvas such as the bodhisattva Samantabhadra the bodhisattva Maitreya the bodhisattva Mañjuśrī and the bodhisattva Sarvanīvaraṇaviṣkambhin expounded the Dharma namely the Dharma gateway of the state of the equality of body speech and mind b through the empowerment of the Tathāgatas sun which transcends the three periods  Then with the bodhisattvas headed by Samantabhadra and the vajradharas headed by the Lord of Mysteries through the empowerment of the Tathāgata Vairocana there was swiftly made manifest the inexhaustible treasury of adornments of the body likewise there were swiftly made manifest the inexhaustible treasuries of adornments of the equality of speech and mind These were not produced by the body or speech or mind of the Buddha Vairocana and the limits of their arising and disappearing in all places cannot be apprehended Yet all the actions of Vairocanas body all the actions of his speech and all the actions of his mind proclaim everywhere and always in the realms of sentient beings the Dharma of the words of the mantra path Then the vajradhara Lord of Mysteries who was seated in this assembly said to the Buddha Worldhonored One how did the Tathāgata worthy of worship and perfectly allknowing  obtain the knowledge of an omniscient one  Should there be any being who ought to be delivered by a buddha then assumes the form of a buddha alternatively he may assume the form of a śrāvaka or he may assume the form of a pratyekabuddha or the form of a bodhisattva or the form of the god Brahmā or the form of Nārāyaṇa or Vaiśravaṇa through to the form of a mahoraga a human a nonhuman and so on conforming with the speech of each and abiding in various modes of conduct And yet this path of the knowledge of an omniscient one is of one taste namely the taste of the Tathāgatas liberation Worldhonored One just as for example the element of empty space is free from all differentiation without differentiation and without nondifferentiation so too is the knowledge of an omniscient one free from all differentiation without differentiation and without nondifferentiation Worldhonored One just as for example the great earth is the support of all beings so too is the knowledge of an omniscient one the support of gods humans and asuras Worldhonored One just as for example the element of re insatiably burns all fuel so too does the knowledge of an omniscient one insatiably burn all the fuel of ignorance Worldhonored One just as for example the element of wind removes all dust so too does the knowledge of an omniscient one clear away all the dust of mental afictions Worldhonored One just as for example the element of water is a delight for the support of all beings so too is the knowledge of an omniscient one a benet and joy for gods and worldlings It is excellent Vajrapāṇi that you have asked me about this matter You should listen attentively and pay very careful attention as I now explain it Vajrapāṇi said So be it Worldhonored One I am eager to listen The Buddha said The bodhimind is its cause compassion is its root and expedient means is its culmination Lord of Mysteries what is bodhi It means to know ones mind as it really is Lord of Mysteries this is anuttarā samyaksaṃbodhi  and there is not the slightest part of it that can be apprehended bodhi has the characteristic of empty space and there is no one to comprehend it nor is there any understanding of it Because bodhi has no characteristics Lord of Mysteries all dharmas are without characteristics That is to say they have the characteristic of empty space Then Vajrapāṇi again said to the Buddha Worldhonored One who is it that seeks omniscience Who is it that accomplishes perfect awakening on account of bodhi Who is it that generates the knowledge of an omniscient one The Buddha said Lord of Mysteries it is in ones own mind that one seeks bodhi and omniscience Because its original nature is pure The mind is neither within nor without nor can the mind be apprehended between the two Lord of Mysteries the Tathāgata worthy and perfectly and fully awakened is neither blue nor yellow nor red nor white nor crimson nor the color of crystal neither long nor short nor round nor square neither bright nor dark and neither male nor female nor neuter Lord of Mysteries the mind is not of the same nature as the realm of desire nor is it of the same nature as the realm of form nor is it of the same nature as the realm of nonform nor is it of the same nature as the destinies of gods nāgas yakṣas gandharvas asuras garuḍas kiṃnaras mahoragas humans or nonhumans Lord of Mysteries the mind does not reside in the realm of the eyes nor does it reside in the realms of the ears nose tongue body or mind and neither is it visible nor does it manifest itself the mind which has the characteristic of empty space is free from all differentiation and nondifferentiation Why is that That whose nature is the same as empty space is identical to the mind and that whose nature is the same as the mind is identical to bodhi In this manner Lord of Mysteries the three entities of mind the realm of empty space and bodhi are without duality They have compassion as their root and are fullled by the pāramitā of expedient means For this reason Lord of Mysteries I teach the dharmas in this manner so as to make the multitudes of bodhisattvas purify the bodhimind and know their mind Lord of Mysteries if a man of family or a woman of family wishes to know bodhi they should know their own mind in this manner Lord of Mysteries how is one to know ones own mind It cannot namely be apprehended by seeking it in distinctions or colors or shapes or external objects or in form or sensation ideation volition or consciousness or in I or mine or in the grasper or the grasped  or in the pure or in the elements or sense elds or in any other distinctions Lord of Mysteries this gateway to the bodhisattvas pure bodhimind is called the path whereby the Dharma becomes clear for the rst time If a bodhisattva trains while dwelling therein he will then without prolonged hardship attain the samādhi that removes all obscurations If he attains this  then he will dwell on a par with buddhas and bodhisattvas he will generate the ve supernatural faculties obtain the dhāraṇī of immeasurable languages words and sounds know the workings of the minds of beings be protected by buddhas remain undeled even in birthanddeath  not shirk fatigue for the sake of beings throughout the Dharma realm succeed in abiding in the unconditioned precepts be free from wrong views and thoroughly understand right views Furthermore Lord of Mysteries a bodhisattva dwelling in this that removes all obscurations will through the power of his faithandunderstanding and without prolonged exertion satisfy all the dharmas of a buddha Lord of Mysteries in short this man of good or woman of good will fully achieve the accomplishment of immeasurable merits Then the vajradhara Lord of Mysteries again questioned the Buddha in verse And by what signs does one know that one has generated the bodhimind I beg you to explain the arising of the knowing mind the mind and excellent spontaneous knowledge Great Striving Hero  through how many stages does the mind successively arise I beg you O Buddha to explain in full the characteristics of the mind and the time  As well as the mass of merits and the practice of cultivated practices The mind and the distinctions possessed by the mindplease O Great Muni explain them When Vajrapāṇi had nished speaking thus the Worldhonored One Mahāvairocana addressed him saying The characteristics of the successive arising of the mind the supreme state of the Great Vehicle Are the great secret of the buddhas unknowable by nonBuddhists I shall now reveal it all with singlemindedness you should listen attentively By transcending the one hundred and sixty mind vast merits are produced And their nature forever rm one knows that bodhi has arisen b Lord of Mysteries ordinary people foolish and childlike who have been dwelling in beginningless birthanddeath cling to the notion of self and to the possessions of the self and differentiate among immeasurable distinctions of the self Lord of Mysteries if they do not discern the ownnature of the self then I and mine are born Lord of Mysteries ordinary people and their ilk foolish and childlike are just like rams Reecting on this small thing they engender joy and practice it from time to time Lord of Mysteries this represents the initial stage of the seed from which wholesome actions arise Then with this as the cause on the six days of abstinence they make gifts to their parents male and female  and kinsmen this represents the second sprouting Then they present these gifts to those who are not kinsmen or acquaintances this represents the third budding this represents the fourth leang Then they joyfully present these gifts to musicians and so on and proffer them to venerable elders this represents the fth owering Then with these gifts they engender thoughts of affection and make offerings of them this represents the sixth bearing fruit Next Lord of Mysteries they observe the precepts so as to be born in heaven this represents the seventh taking in seeds This is a god a great god who bestows all happiness If you worship him with devotion all your wishes will be fullled Each of these should be duly worshiped Upon hearing this their hearts are lled with blessed joy and respectfully revering them they practice accordingly Lord of Mysteries this is called the eighth mind of the young child the basis of fearlessness for common people foolish and childlike as they transmigrate through birthanddeath Lord of Mysteries next there is a special practice Following their instructions they dwell in a special state whereupon there arises the wisdom that seeks liberation This is namely permanence impermanence and emptiness and they follow these teachings Lord of Mysteries it is not that they understand emptiness and nonemptiness permanence and c annihilation With regard to both nonexistence and nonnothingness they consider what they differentiate to be without differentiation How is one to differentiate emptiness They do not know the varieties of emptiness and they will never be able to know nirvana Therefore one should realize that emptiness is dissociated from annihilation and permanence Then Vajrapāṇi made another request of the Buddha saying Worldhonored One please explain those mind When Vajrapāṇi Lord of Mysteries had nished speaking thus the Buddha addressed him saying Lord of Mysteries listen attentively to the characteristics of the mind Lord of Mysteries what is the mind of

Lord of Mysteries multiplying by two once twice three times four times and ve times there are altogether one hundred and sixty minds When one transcends the mundane three false attachments the supramundane mind is born That is to say having thus understood that there are only the aggregates and noself one lingers on in cultivation associated with the sense organs sense objects and elements ie six consciousnesses pulls out the stumps of karma and mental afictions and the seeds of ignorance whence are born the twelve causes and conditions of dependent arising and dissociates oneself from the schools of established and so on Such deep serenity cannot be known by any nonBuddhists and previous buddhas have proclaimed it to be free from all faults Lord of Mysteries with this supramundane mind dwelling in the aggregates such wisdom may arise correspondingly If one is to give rise to freedom from attachment to the aggregates one should observe foam bubbles a plantain tree a mirage and an illusion thereby attaining liberation That is to say the aggregates sense elds elements and the grasper and the grasped are all removed from Dharmanature and when one realizes the realm of quiescence in this manner it is called the supramundane mind Lord of Mysteries when one has left behind the sequence of eight minds incompatible and compatible  and the web of karma and mental afictions this represents the yogins practice for transcending one eon Next Lord of Mysteries there is the practice of the Great Vehicle whereby one generates the mind of the vehicle without any object and that dharmas have no selfnature Lord of Mysteries if one thus abandons noself  the mindlord being absolutely free one awakens to the fact that ones own mind is originally unborn Because Lord of Mysteries the anterior and posterior limits of the mind cannot be apprehended When one thus knows the nature of ones own mind this represents the yogins practice for transcending a second eon c Next Lord of Mysteries bodhisattvas cultivating bodhisattva practices via the gateway of mantras accomplish all the immeasurable merit and knowledge accumulated during immeasurable and incalculable hundreds of thousands of koṭis of nayutas of eons and all the immeasurable wisdom and expedient means for fully cultivating all practices they become a refuge for the worlds of gods and humans they transcend the stages of all śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas and they are attended and revered by akra Devendra and so on is born the mind utterly without ownnature Lord of Mysteries such an initial mind the Buddha has declared to be the cause for becoming a buddha although liberated from karma and mental afictions it still has karma and mental afictions at its base The world will venerate and should always make offerings to him Next Lord of Mysteries in the stage of practice with faithandunderstanding one observes the three minds the vision of wisdom immeasurable pāramitās and the four means of conversion The stage of faithandunderstanding is unparalleled immeasurable and inconceivable and one establishes the ten minds and boundless knowledge is born Everything whatsoever that I have taught is all obtained on the basis of this  Therefore the wise person should reect on this stage of faithandunderstanding in omniscience and transcending one more eon he should ascend to dwell in this stage One quarter of this will take one beyond the stage of faithandunderstanding Then the vajradhara Lord of Mysteries said to the Buddha Worldhonored One I beg you O savior of the world to explain the characteristics of the mind How many stations of fearlessness are there to be obtained by a bodhisattva When Vajrapāṇi had nished speaking thus the Worldhonored One Mahāvairocana addressed him saying Listen attentively and consider most carefully  Lord of Mysteries when those ordinary people foolish and childlike cultivate wholesome actions and renounce unwholesome actions they will obtain fearlessness of the wholesome If they know the self as it really is they will obtain fearlessness of the body If they observe their own body composed of the aggregates of attachment abandoning any material image of themselves they will obtain fearlessness of noself If they renounce the aggregates and dwell in the cognition of dharmas they will obtain fearlessness of dharmas If they renounce dharmas and dwell without any object  they will obtain fearlessness of the noself of dharmas Again all aggregates elements and sense elds the grasper and the grasped self life and so on as well as dharmas and objectlessness are empty and their ownnature is without any naturewhen this knowledge of emptiness is born they will obtain fearlessness of the equality of the ownnature of all dharmas Lord of Mysteries if bodhisattvas cultivating bodhisattva practices via the gateway of mantras examine in deep cultivation the ten propositions about dependent arising they will master mantra practices and achieve realization therein What are the ten  Lord of Mysteries those bodhisattvas cultivating bodhisattva practices via the gateway of mantras should observe in the following manner What is an illusion It is just as when through the art of magic and the power of drugs various visible images both those creating and those created deceive ones eyes so that one sees remarkable things that produce one another in succession coming and going in the ten directions and yet they neither go nor do they not go Because their original nature is pure In the same way illusions mantras are able to produce anything through success in recitation Next Lord of Mysteries a mirage is by nature empty it is in dependence on the false notions of worldlings that it is established and may be spoken about In the same way the notion of mantras is merely a provisional designation a Next Lord of Mysteries just as things seen in a dream last for a day a muhūrta  a kṣaṇa  a year or some other  are of various strange kinds and cause experiences of all manner of suffering and happiness yet upon awakening there is nothing whatsoever to be seen so too should the dreamlike mantra practices be known to be thus Just as a face in dependence on a mirror manifests an image of the face so too should one understand siddhi mantras Next Lord of Mysteries with the analogy of an gandharva city one comprehends the accomplishment of a palace siddhi Next Lord of Mysteries with the analogy of an echo one comprehends the sound of mantras Just as an echo exists in dependence on sound so too should the mantrin understand  Next Lord of Mysteries just as the moon rises with the result that it shines upon clear water and manifests a reected image of the moon so too should the vidyādhara thus explain the likening of mantras to the moon in the water Next Lord of Mysteries just as the heavens cause rain to fall producing bubbles so too should the various transformations of siddhi mantras be known to be thus Next Lord of Mysteries it is just as in space there are neither beings nor life and no creator can be apprehended and yet because the mind is deluded and confused it produces these various false visions of nonexistent owers and so on in empty space if someone holding it in his hand then whirls it around in the air there will appear the image of a wheel Lord of Mysteries in this manner one should understand this state of the Great Vehicle this state of the mind this state of what is equal to the unequaled this state of certainty this state of perfect and full awakening and this state of gradual birth in the Great Vehicle One will be able to completely possess the riches of the Dharma bring forth great knowledge with various skills and fully know all notions about the mind as it really is Chapter II Full Accoutrements and Mantras for Entering the Maṇḍala Thereupon the vajradhara Lord of Mysteries said to the Buddha It is remarkable Worldhonored One that you should explain this saṃbodhi selfrealized by the buddhas the inconceivable Dharma realm which transcends the mindground and that by various means and ways you expound the Dharma for the varieties of beings in accordance with their own nature and faithandunderstanding I beg you Worldhonored One next to explain the cultivation of mantra practices and the great king of maṇḍalas Born of the Matrix of Great Compassion for the fulllment of immeasurable beings in future ages and for their salvation and happiness Then the Bhagavān Vairocana having completely surveyed the great assembly addressed the vajradhara Lord of Mysteries saying Listen attentively Vajrapāṇi I shall now explain the Dharma gateway for cultivating maṇḍala practices and bringing to fulllment the knowledge of an omniscient one Then because the Worldhonored One Vairocana had formerly vowed to accomplish the inexhaustible Dharma realm and liberate realms of beings without exception all the Tathāgatas gathered together and he gradually entered the samādhi Generation of the Matrix of Great Compassion From every part of the Worldhonored One there appeared gures of Tathāgatas that for the sake of beings ranging from those who had generated the mind for the rst time to those of the tenth stage pervaded the ten directions and then returned to their own positions in the Buddhas body where abiding in their own positions they reentered  Then the Bhagavān again addressed the vajradhara Lord of Mysteries saying Listen attentively Vajrapāṇi to the layout of the maṇḍala First the ācārya should have generated the bodhimind he should have wondrous b wisdom and compassion combine various arts be well skilled in the cultivation of prajñāpāramitā have mastered the three vehicles fully comprehend the true meaning of mantras know the minds of beings have faith in the buddhas and bodhisattvas have received the consecrations for transmitting the teachings and so on and be well versed in the drawing of a maṇḍala by nature he should be adaptable and free from selfattachment and he should have duly gained decisiveness in the practice of mantras have thoroughly practiced yoga and dwell in the intrepid bodhimind Lord of Mysteries such an exemplary ācārya is extolled by the buddhas and bodhisattvas Next Lord of Mysteries should that ācārya see a being who is suitable as a receptacle for the Dharma is free from sullies has great faithandunderstanding assiduity and profound faith and is always thinking of beneting othersshould the disciple possess such characteristics the ācārya should of his own accord go and exhort him addressing him as follows Son of the Buddha these methods of the path of mantra practice in the Great Vehicle I shall now explain for a receptacle for the Great Vehicle The Fully and Perfectly Awakened Ones of the past and the Worldhonored Ones Of future ages and of the present abide in bringing benet to beings These worthy ones understand the wondrous method of mantras Striving Heroes they have obtained faceted knowledge while seated in characteristicless bodhi The power of mantras is without compare and the Lion of the ākyas savior of the world Was able to destroy the very strong and extremely wrathful army of Māra Lord of Mysteries having selected a site he clears away pebbles broken earthenware potsherds skulls hair chaff ashes cinders thorns bones rotten wood and so on as well as insects ants dung beetles and poisonous or stinging kinds  Once such aws have been removed on the morning of a propitious day having determined a day on which the time lunar mansion and planets are all in harmony and at a time before the meal with an auspicious sign he should rst make obeisance to all the Tathāgatas and arouse the Earth God with these verses You O Goddess are witness to how the buddhas guiding teachers Performed special practices and puried the stages and pāramitās Just like the Lion of the ākyas savior of the world who defeated the hosts of Māras army I too will vanquish Māra and I shall draw a maṇḍala He should kneel down with his hand stretched out upon the ground and chant this verse repeatedly He should make offerings of unguent owers and so on and after having made offerings the mantrin should again take refuge in all the Tathāgatas Then he prepares the site in accordance with procedures so that it possesses many virtues Then the vajradhara Lord of Mysteries bowed down at the feet of the Worldhonored One and spoke these verses Taking gomayī and gomūtra that have not fallen to the ground one mixes them together and smears them  Then with the mantra for perfumed water one puries by sprinkling  White sandalwood is used to paint the ne round maṇḍalas  The rst in the center is for myself  the second is for the worldsaviors And the third like theirs is for the BuddhaMother Gaganalocanā The fourth is for Padmapāṇi the fth is for the vajradhara  And the sixth for Acalanātha is mindfully placed below that  svāhā The mantrareciting practitioner next engenders thoughts of compassion And repairing to the western quarter with focused thoughts he goes to sleep Thinking of noself in the purity of the bodhimind In his dreams he may see bodhisattvas of great renown And buddhas without measure appear and perform various deeds Or with thoughts of comfort they may encourage the practitioner Because you are mindful of beings you construct a maṇḍala And what is the meaning of maṇḍala The Buddha said This is called the Maṇḍala Which Generates the Buddhas It is of a taste that is utterly without compare and of a taste that is unsurpassed and therefore it is referred to as maṇḍala Furthermore Lord of Mysteries because of pity for boundless realms of beings this is in a broad sense the maṇḍala Born of the Matrix of Great Compassion Lord of Mysteries is empowered by the anuttarā samyaksaṃbodhi accumulated by the Tathāgata during immeasurable eons and therefore it is endowed with immeasurable virtues You should understand as follows Lord of Mysteries it was not for the sake of one being that the Tathāgata attained perfect and full awakening nor was it for two nor for many  it was out of pity for the realms of beings with complete predictions and incomplete predictions that the Tathāgata attained perfect and full awakening and by the power of his vow of great compassion he expounds the Dharma in immeasurable realms of beings in accordance with their own nature Lord of Mysteries those who have not practiced the Great Vehicle in the past and have never thought about the practices of the Mantra Vehicle are unable in the slightest degree to see or hear them rejoice in them and accept them on faith But Vajrasattva if those sentient beings have in the past advanced through the immeasurable gateways of the path of the Mantra Vehicle of the Great Vehicle and have already been practicing it it is for them that terms and numbers have been established within these limits The ācārya too should with thoughts of great compassion make the following vow to receive immeasurable beings and create the causes and conditions for the seeds of bodhi so as to deliver realms of beings without exception The mantrareciting practitioner having received in this manner Commands them to take the Three Refuges makes them confess their previous sins Gives them unguent owers and so on to offer to the holy deities And should confer upon them the precept of knowledge unobstructed throughout the three ages Next he should give them tooth sticks of either uḍumbara Or aśvattha and so on protected  puried Adorned with perfume and owers straight and conforming with top and bottom face either east or north and having chewed the sticks they cast them down will know the signs of whether these beings are suitable as receptacles or not A sūtra with three knots is then tied to their left arms Its activities wondrous without compare and always based on the two truths This vehicle is most excellent and you will dwell in this path b Then the vajradhara Aprapañcavihārin said to the Buddha Worldhonored One I beg you to explain the precept of knowledge unobstructed throughout the three ages for if a bodhisattva abides in it it causes buddhas and bodhisattvas all to rejoice When he had nished speaking thus the Buddha addressed the vajradhara Aprapañcavihārin and the others saying Son of the Buddha listen attentively When a person of family abides in this precept he unites his body speech and mind making them one and does not create any dharmas What is precept It means to observingly renounce ones own person and offer it up to the buddhas and bodhisattvas If one renounces ones own person then one renounces three things What are three They are the body speech and mind Therefore a person of family by receiving the precept of body speech and mind gains the designation bodhisattva Why is that Because he is dissociated from his body speech and mind The bodhisattva and mahāsattva should train in this manner Next on the following day having empowered himself as Vajrasattva and made obeisance to the Worldhonored One Vairocana should take a clean ask and ll it with perfumed water reciting the mantra of Trailokyavijaya he empowers it places it outside the rst entrance and uses it to sprinkle over people  The ācārya offers them puried perfumed water which he makes them drink so that their minds may be puried Then the vajradhara Lord of Mysteries questioned the Buddha in verse The maṇḍala should be constructed always on this night The Dharmatransmitting ācārya should thus then take A vecolored sūtra  and bowing down to all the buddhas He empowers himself as Great Vairocana Starting from the eastern quarter facing  holds the sūtra In the air level with his navel and moves gradually around to the right And so to the south and west nishing in the northern quarter The second is for establishing the boundary and he again begins from the initial quarter Calling to mind the Tathāgatas and his actions are as described above The Earthbearing God  holding up a ask kneels reverently The appearance of an omniscient one in the world Is like an uḍumbara ower which appears only once every now and then The path whereby mantras are practiced is far more difcult again to encounter All sinful actions performed during immeasurable koṭis of eons Will when one sees this maṇḍala be extinguished without any residue whatsoever And how much more so if someone of immeasurable renown abides in the methods of mantra practice Practicing mantras of this unsurpassed state saviors of the world He will bring evil destinies to an end and no suffering will arise And if he cultivates such practices his subtle wisdom will be profound and unwavering Then all the great multitudes that had gathered together as well as the vajradharas extolled Vajrapāṇi with one voice saying Excellent excellent Great Striving Hero You who have already cultivated mantra practices Do well to ask about all matters regarding mantras We too all have thoughts on our minds We shall all indeed bear witness for your sake For we abide in the power of mantra practice And other multitudes with the great mind of bodhi Will attain mastery of the mantra method Then the vajradhara Lord of Mysteries again spoke to the Worldhonored One uttering these verses Therefore it is explained as great emptiness and consummates sarvajña Enlightenment Supernatural Transformations and Empowerment of Mahāvairocana Chapter II Full Accoutrements and Mantras for Entering the Maṇḍala Then the Worldhonored One Vairocana and all the buddhas gathered together and each proclaimed paths of samādhi for all śrāvakas pratyekabuddhas and bodhisattvas Thereupon the Buddha entered the samādhi Swift Power of the Single Essence of All Tathāgatas and while in this the Worldhonored One again addressed the bodhisattva Vajradhara  saying Formerly when I was seated at the site of bodhi I vanquished the four demons And with the voice of a great striving hero I removed the fears of beings At that time Brahmā and other gods rejoiced in their minds and together blazoned it forth And consequently all worlds call me Great Striving Hero I awoke to original nonbirth transcended the path of speech Obtained liberation from all faults dissociated myself from causes and conditions And knew emptiness which is like empty space and knowledge concordant with the real character was born Having been freed from all darkness foremost reality is unsullied The destinies are merely notions and names and the Buddhas characteristics are also the same Through the power of empowerment this foremost apex of reality Is explained by means of the written word in order to deliver the world c The buddhas are most remarkable and their expedients and knowledge are inconceivable The spontaneous knowledge of the DharmaBuddha is free from all frivolous arguments And yet it is taught for the sake of the world and fullls all wishes The characteristics of mantras are likewise always dependent on the two truths Should there be any beings who know this Dharma teaching Worldlings should worship them just as they would revere a caitya Then when Vajradhara had nished speaking these verses he gazed steadily at Vairocana without blinking for even a moment and remained silent Next Lord of Mysteries the path of samādhi for bodhisattvas who have mastered the eighth stage is such that they do not apprehend any dharmas they are free from existence and birth and they know everything to be an illusory transformation Therefore the world refers to them as masters of vision Next Lord of Mysteries multitudes of śrāvakas dwelling in the stage with objects  recognize birth and extinction reject the two extremes of annihilation and permanence and with the knowledge of utter observation obtain the causes of practice that does not conform  this is called the path of samādhi for śrāvakas Lord of Mysteries pratyekabuddhas observing cause and result and dwelling in the Dharma of speechlessness do not preach and are speechless and in all dharmas they realize the samādhi of the utter extinction of speech this is called the path of samādhi for pratyekabuddhas this is called the path of samādhi for world Then the Worldhonored One spoke these verses Lord of Mysteries you should know that these are the paths of samādhi If one abides in teachings for the Worldhonored Buddha the worldsaving bodhisattva The pratyekabuddha or the śrāvaka one will destroy all faults In the case of the gods mundane path of the teachings of the mantra method The Striving Hero has thus in order to benet beings Then the Worldhonored One addressed the vajradhara Lord of Mysteries saying Lord of Mysteries you should listen attentively to the characteristics of mantras Vajrapāṇi said Very well Worldhonored One I am eager to listen Thereupon the Worldhonored One further spoke these verses The Fully and Perfectly Awakened Ones mantras are characterized by syllables words and clauses As in the school of Indra all objectives are accomplished Sometimes Dharmaphrases are added so that the original intent of the mantra and the practice will correspond If the word oṃ and the word hūṃ as well as phaṭaka Or hrīḥ these are designations of BuddhaCrowns If gṛhṇa  khādaya  bhañja  Hana  māraya  phāṭaya and the like They are the mantras of servant messengers and wrathful ones Furthermore Lord of Mysteries these characteristics of mantras are not something created by all the buddhas nor did they cause others to create them nor would they rejoice  Therefore whether the Tathāgatas appear or whether the Tathāgatas do not appear dharmas naturally abide thus Lord of Mysteries what is the mantra path of the Tathāgatas It is namely the empowering of these written letters Lord of Mysteries with the words of truth the four noble truths the four stations of mindfulness the four supernatural faculties the ten powers of a Tathāgata the six pāramitās the seven precious of bodhi the four Brahmic abodes and the eighteen unshared qualities of a buddha that the Tathāgatas have accumulated and cultivated during immeasurable hundreds of thousands of koṭis of nayutas of eonsLord of Mysteries in short with the Tathāgatas knowledge of an omniscient one the power of the ownmerit and knowledge of all the Tathāgatas the power of the knowledge of their own vows and the power of the empowerment of the entire Dharma realm and in conformity with the varieties of beings they reveal the mantra teachings And what are the mantra teachings the gateway of the letter A because all dharmas are originally unborn  the gateway of the letter Ka because all dharmas are dissociated from action  the gateway of the letter Kha because all dharmas are inapprehensible like empty space  the gateway of the letter Ga because all going is inapprehensible in all dharmas the gateway of the letter Gha because agglomeration is inapprehensible in all dharmas the gateway of the letter Ca because all dharmas are dissociated from all transiency  the gateway of the letter Cha because shadows are inapprehensible in all dharmas the gateway of the letter Ja because birth is inapprehensible in all dharmas the gateway of the letter Jha because enemies are inapprehensible in all dharmas the gateway of the letter a because pride is inapprehensible in all dharmas the gateway of the letter ha because nurturing is inapprehensible in all dharmas the gateway of the letter a because resentment is inapprehensible in all dharmas the gateway of the letter ha because grasping is inapprehensible in all dharmas the gateway of the letter Ta because thusness is inapprehensible in all dharmas the gateway of the letter Tha because a dwelling place is inapprehensible in all dharmas the gateway of the letter Da because giving is inapprehensible in all dharmas the gateway of the letter Dha because the Dharma realm is inapprehensible in all dharmas the gateway of the letter Pa because supreme truth is inapprehensible in all dharmas the gateway of the letter Pha because all dharmas are unsolid and like foam  the gateway of the letter Ba because bondage is inapprehensible in all dharmas the gateway of the letter Bha because all existence is inapprehensible in all dharmas the gateway of the letter Ya because all vehicles are inapprehensible in all dharmas the gateway of the letter Ra because all dharmas are dissociated from all delement  the gateway of the letter La because all characteristics are inapprehensible in all dharmas the gateway of the letter Va because the path of speech is cut off in all dharmas the gateway of the letter a because all dharmas are originally quiescent by nature  the gateway of the letter a because all dharmas are by nature dull ṣaṭha for śaṭha fool blockhead the gateway of the letter Sa because all truths are inapprehensible in all dharmas and the gateway of the letter Ha because cause is inapprehensible in all dharmas Lord of Mysteries a a a Na and Ma are sovereign over all samādhis and quickly able to effectuate all deeds and the objectives of what is undertaken are all accomplished Then the Worldhonored One spoke these verses Endowed with many excellent vows the denitive meaning of mantras Transcends the three ages and is unsullied like empty space Dwelling in an inconceivable mind one performs various deeds And he who reaches the stage of cultivation is granted inconceivable results This is the foremost truth revealed by the buddhas And if one knows this Dharma teaching one will attain the siddhis Sound which is the supreme truth mantras and the characteristics of mantras Thinking clearly upon these the practitioner will obtain the indestructible state c Then the vajradhara Lord of Mysteries said to the Buddha Worldhonored One the inconceivable method of the path of the characteristics of mantras taught by the Buddha is remarkable it is not shared with any śrāvakas or pratyekabuddhas nor is it for all beings everywhere If one believes in this mantra path meritorious dharmas will all be fullled I but beg you Worldhonored One to explain next the requisite procedures for the maṇḍala When Vajrapāṇi had nished speaking thus the Worldhonored One again addressed him uttering these verses When a mantrareciting practitioner worships the holy deities He should offer up owers pleasing to the mind immaculate white yellow or red in color The padma  blue lotus  dragonower  puṃnāga Kesara malli  tagara campa Sorrowless  tilaka pāṭala  and śāla  These owers fresh and exquisite are auspicious and liked by all He gathers them makes garlands of them and offers them respectfully Namely Aprapañcavihārin Gaganāmala Vimalanetra and Vicitrāmbaradhara The large lotus ower in the center has eight petals as well as stamens And on the petals in the four quarters are four accompanying bodhisattvas There because of the power of the former vows of these great beings Thereupon Vajrapāṇi said to the Buddha Worldhonored One if any men of good or women of good enter the samaya of this great king of maṇḍalas Born of the Matrix of Great Compassion how great an accumulation of merit will they obtain When Vajrapāṇi had nished speaking thus the Buddha addressed him saying Lord of Mysteries the total accumulation of merit from the initial generation of the mind through to becoming a Tathāgata is exactly equivalent to the accumulation of merit by these men of good or women of good  Lord of Mysteries by means of this gateway to the Dharma you should know thus that these men of good and women of good are children of the Buddhas mind born of the Tathāgatas mouth Wherever these men of good and women of good may be there is a buddha performing buddha deeds Therefore Lord of Mysteries should one wish to worship the Buddha then one should worship these men of good and women of good  and should one wish to see the Buddha then one should look at them Then the vajradharas headed by Vajrapāṇi and so on and the bodhisattvas headed by Samantabhadra and so on spoke in unison saying Worldhonored One from now on we shall revere and worship these men of good and women of good  Because Worldhonored One seeing these men of good and women of good is the same as seeing the Worldhonored Buddha c Thereupon the Worldhonored One Vairocana again gazed upon the entire assembly and addressed the vajradhara Lord of Mysteries and the other vajradharas as well as the great multitude saying Good sirs there are mantra phrases the mark of the Tathāgatas supramundane and immeasurably vast speechcircle  which are like a variegated maṇi fulll all wishes accumulate immeasurable merit abide in unimpeded conduct and have a power incomparable through the three ages When he had nished speaking thus Vajrapāṇi the Lord of Mysteries and the other vajradharas as well as the great assembly spoke in unison saying Worldhonored One now is the time Sugata now is the time Thereupon the Worldhonored One Vairocana dwelled in the samādhi Observation from the High Peak of the Pure Dharma Banner in which fullling all wishes he protruded his vast tongue and completely covered all buddha elds Then the Buddha rose from meditation whereupon he emitted a voice that pervaded the Dharma realm of all Tathāgatas taking pity on the realms of beings without exception and uttered this vidyārājñī Very Powerful Great Protection svāhā Then as soon as all the Tathāgatas and the multitudes of sons of the Buddha had uttered this vidyā buddha elds everywhere shook in six different ways and all the bodhisattvas having experienced something unprecedented with wideopen eyes spoke these verses in front of the buddhas with words pleasing to the mind It is most remarkable that the buddhas have uttered this Very Powerful Protection The protection by all the buddhas a citadel and moat that are completely impregnable If one dwells protecting the mind with it all obstructors Vināyakas and rākṣasas of evil form Will all disperse through the power of thinking on the mantra Then the Bhagavān having empowered the vast Dharma realm dwelled at once in the samādhi MatrixTreasury of the Dharma Realm and rising from this state of meditation uttered the vidyā Entry into the Buddhas Samaya svāhā As soon as he had uttered this vidyā Entry into the Samaya in the midst of all the assemblies of bodhisattvas in all buddha elds the sons of the Buddha who had heard it together would no longer transgress any dharmas Then the Bhagavān also uttered the mantra birth in the Dharma realm Namaḥ samantavajrāṇāṃ vajrātmako ham Namaḥ samantabuddhānāṃ ararakalalabaliṃ dadāmi baliṃ dade mahābali svāhā Namaḥ samantabuddhānāṃ mahāmaha tathāgatajihva satyadharmapratiṣṭhita svāhā svāhā Chapter III The Quelling of Obstacles Then Vajrapāṇi again questioned the Worldhonored One Vairocana uttering these verses You have done well to speak these words In order to remove their cause one thinks on the bodhimind Which is well removed of false differentiation born from the mind and thought And by recollecting the bodhimind the practitioner will be free from faults One should always think in ones mind of the mahāsattva Acala And bind his mystic seal whereby one will be able to remove all obstructions Lord of Mysteries listen further how to tie down turbulent wind With the letter A transformed into ones own person and keeping the lettergateway Ha in mind One smears gandha on the ground to make great dots of emptiness Even the honored ones akra and Brahmā should they not follow my teaching Will be burned not to mention other beings c Thereupon Vajrapāṇi said to the Buddha Worldhonored One insofar as I understand the meaning of what the Buddha has said I too thus know that dwelling in their own maṇḍala stations the holy deities bring about what is aweinspiring Because they dwell in this manner the Tathāgatas injunctions cannot be obfuscated Because Worldhonored One the samaya of all mantras is to abide in their own lineage Therefore bodhisattvas cultivating bodhisattva practices via the gateway of mantras should also dwell in their proper station and perform deeds  Moreover Lord of Mysteries if colors have been mentioned  you should know that the holy deities maṇḍala stations and the deities gures are also the same  this has been taught by previous buddhas Lord of Mysteries in future ages beings of inferior intelligence and no faith will on hearing these explanations be unable to accept them on faith because they have no intelligence and their doubts will increase If they merely hear them and remain set in their ways without practicing they will harm themselves and harm others and they will make statements such as NonBuddhists have such methods but they were not taught by the Buddha These ignorant people will produce such faithandunderstanding Then the Worldhonored spoke these verses The omniscient Worldhonored One has gained sovereignty over dharmas And in accordance with what he has mastered he delivers beings by expedient means This was taught by previous buddhas to bring benet to those who seek the Dharma The foolish person does not know the characteristic of the dharmas by the buddhas I have taught that the characteristic possessed by all dharmas is that they are all empty aChapter IV A Treasury of Mantras in Common Use Thereupon the vajradharas with the Lord of Mysteries at their head and the host of bodhisattvas with Samantabhadra at their head bowed down to the Buddha Vairocana and out of a desire to expound in this great king of maṇḍalas Born of the Matrix of Great Compassion the Dharmaphrases of their mantras in accordance with the pure gateway to the Dharma realm that they had mastered they appealed each in his own words to the Worldhonored One  Then the Worldhonored One empowered them with the indestructible nature of dharmas and addressed the vajradharas and bodhisattvas saying Good sirs you should expound in accordance with the Dharma realm as you have mastered it those formulae of truth that cleanse the realms of beings Then the bodhisattva Samantabhadra promptly dwelled in the samādhi Adornment of the Buddhas Sphere and uttered the mantra of unobstructed strength svāhā Then the bodhisattva kāśagarbha entered the samādhi Sphere of Purity and uttered his own heartmantra svāhā b Then the bodhisattva Sarvanīvaraṇaviṣkambhin entered the samādhi Power of Compassion and uttered mantra O you who have risen from compassion svāhā Then the bodhisattva Kṣitigarbha dwelled in the samādhi Sphere of Adamantine Indestructible Conduct and uttered mantra Namaḥ samantabuddhānāṃ he he kumāraka vimuktipathasthita smara smara pratijñāṃ svāhā svāhā Then Vajrapāṇi dwelled in the samādhi Great Adamantine Invincibility and uttered his own heart and the mantras of his attendants Namaḥ samantavajrāṇāṃ triṭ triṭ jayanti svāhā O you who have risen from the vajra you who are everywhere unimpeded Namaḥ samantavajrāṇāṃ sarvadharmanirvedhani vajrasūci varade svāhā Namaḥ samantavajrāṇāṃ hūṃ hūṃ hūṃ phaṭ phaṭ phaṭ jaṃ jaṃ svāhā Namaḥ samantavajrāṇāṃ he he kiṃ cirāyasi gṛhṇa gṛhṇa khāda khāda paripūraya svapratijñāṃ svāhā Namaḥ samantabuddhānāṃ sarvakleśaniṣūdana sarvadharmavaśitāprāpta gaganasamāsama svāhā Namaḥ samantabuddhānāṃ vaṃ vaṃ vaṃ hūṃ hūṃ phaṭ svāhā Namaḥ samantabuddhānāṃ dhriṃ dhriṃ riṃ riṃ jriṃ jriṃ svāhā The mantra of Nanda and Upananda Namaḥ samantabuddhānāṃ nandopanandayoḥ svāhā For Nanda and Upananda svāhā Then the Worldhonored One Vairocana wishing to explain that his teachings are of infallible siddhi the mantra of the vidyārājñī Gaganalocanā mother of all buddhas and bodhisattvas svāhā Next in order to quell all obstacles the Bhagavān dwelled in the samādhi Born of Fire and uttered this mantra of the great destroyer of obstacles the holy one Acalanātha Namaḥ samantabuddhānāṃ sarvabuddhabodhisattvahṛdayanyāveśani namaḥ sarvavide svāhā svāhā The mantra of all buddhas Namaḥ samantabuddhānāṃ sarvathā vimativikiraṇa dharmadhātunirjāta saṃ saṃ ha svāhā Namaḥ samantabuddhānāṃ durdharṣa mahāroṣaṇa khādaya sarvāṃ tathāgatājñāṃ kuru svāhā Namaḥ samantabuddhānāṃ he mahāpracaṇḍābhimukha gṛhṇa khādaya kiṃ cirāyasi samayam anusmara svāhā Namaḥ samantabuddhānāṃ sarvatrānugate

mantra of Ratnakara Namaḥ samantabuddhānāṃ saṃ Namaḥ samantabuddhānāṃ bhaḥ Homage to all Buddhas Bhaḥ The mantra of the Three BuddhaCrowns Namaḥ samantabuddhānāṃ hūṃ ṭruṃ The mantra of Sitātapatroṣṇīṣa Namaḥ samantabuddhānāṃ laṃ Namaḥ samantabuddhānāṃ si Si The mantra of Tejorāśyuṣṇīṣa Namaḥ samantabuddhānāṃ triṃ The mantra of the young Vasumatī Namaḥ samantabuddhānāṃ hili The mantra of Mahāmaitryabhyudgata Namaḥ samantabuddhānāṃ ṭhaṃ Then there is the following mantra Namaḥ samantabuddhānāṃ jaṃ The mantra of Gaganāmala Namaḥ samantabuddhānāṃ haṃ Namaḥ samantabuddhānāṃ manorama dharmasaṃbhava vibhavakana saṃ saṃ svāhā Namaḥ samantabuddhānāṃ guṃ ī guṃ i maṃsane The mantra of asuras Namaḥ samantabuddhānāṃ raṭaṃ raṭaṃ dhvantaṃ vra pra The mantra of mahoragas Namaḥ samantabuddhānāṃ garalaṃ garalaṃ Namaḥ samantabuddhānāṃ hasanaṃ vihasanaṃ The mantra of humans  Namaḥ samantabuddhānāṃ icchāparaṃ manomaye me svāhā it is the lettergateway A it is where all mantras reside and herein do mantras obtain certainty  Enlightenment Supernatural Transformations and Empowerment of Mahāvairocana Chapter V Mundane Accomplishment Thereupon the Worldhonored One again addressed the vajradhara Lord of Mysteries uttering these verses in accordance with the mantra teachings one will accomplish that result The letter should intercorrespond with the letter and the base likewise with the base Performing mental visualization one recites  well abiding one lakṣa  The rst letter is the bodhimind and the second is called sound One thinks of the base as ones deity and locates it in ones own person The second base one should know to be the excellent base of the buddhas The practitioner visualizes residing there a lunar disc quite round and clear In the middle of which he conscientiously contemplates the letters in their proper order Placing the letters and words in the center and imagining that he puries his life Chapter VI The Manifestation of Siddhi Thereupon the Worldhonored One again gazed upon the entire great assembly and wishing to fulll all wishes again expounded Dharmaphrases for the consummation of knowledge determined by immeasurable gateways throughout the three ages Empty space is unsullied without ownnature and bestows various kinds of skillful knowledge Because its ownnature is originally always empty it is dependently arisen most profound and difcult to see And in special progress over a long period of time it grants the unsurpassed result as desired For example just as dwellings in all destinies although dependent on empty space are not attached to it So too is this pure Dharma like that and the three existences without exception are born pure Because the excellentborn the imposing one of yore cultivated this he acquired the conduct of all Tathāgatas There is no other state that is as difcult to obtain and it completely illuminates the world just like the Worldhonored One It would not be proper for us ourselves to proclaim in the presence of the Honored Bhagavān the Dharma as mastered by each of us Verily Worldhonored One it is only because we wish for the weal and happiness of future beings Thereupon the Bhagavān Vairocana addressed all the vajradharas saying Excellent excellent good sirs The Vinaya of the Dharma taught by the Tathāgata extols one dharma namely having modesty If a man of good or a woman of good who has modesty thus sees the Dharma two things will quickly occur namely they will not do what should not be done and they will be extolled by all There are two further things that will occur namely they will attain what they have not yet attained and they will gain association with buddhas and bodhisattvas There are two further things  namely they will abide in śīla and they will be born among humans and gods Now then listen attentively and consider it carefully as I proclaim the phrases correspondent to the emanation of the accomplishment of mantras phrases correspondent to emanation in which bodhisattvas cultivating bodhi via the gateway of mantras will quickly obtain mantra siddhi Lord of Mysteries in the realm of desire for example there is śvaras vidyā Delighting and Satisfying the Mind he is able to do benet for beings throughout the triple thousand great thousand worldsystem creating every enjoyment and full enjoyment and he gives them to the gods of Pure Abode and also enjoys them himself Again the mantras of an illusionist for example are able to manifest various gardens woods people and things the mantras of asuras for example produce illusory transformations worldly magical arts for example counteract poison as well as fever and so on the mantras of the Mātṛs are able to inict epidemics and pestilences on beings and mundane magical arts eliminate poisons as well as chills and fever and so on and can transform a blazing re producing refreshing coolness  This potency of mantras does not come from within mantras nor does it enter beings nor can it be apprehended in the reciter himself Good sirs because of the mantras power of empowerment it arises naturally and there is nothing that is passed over by it because it transcends the three ages and because of the most profound and inconceivable principle of dependent arising Therefore good sirs you should follow and master Dharmanature which is inconceivable and never discontinue the mantra path Then the Worldhonored One dwelled in the samādhi Treasury of the Purity of Adornments the support of power unimpeded throughout the three ages and the support of the inconceivable power of the Tathāgatas empowerment whereupon the Worldhonored One emitted from within samāpatti inexhaustible manifestations of speech in inexhaustible realms On the basis of the power of the Dharma realm unequaled power and the faithandunderstanding of the Perfectly and Fully Awakened One there owed forth from a single sound the four stations  which pervaded the entire Dharma realm and were coextensive with empty space and there was nowhere not reached by them In every way a ā aṃ aḥ As soon as the heart of the Perfectly and Fully Awakened One had spread everywhere from this  the vocal gateways of the entire Dharma realm mutually sounded forth from the sound symbolic of the Perfectly and Fully Awakened One When the bodhisattvas heard this having experienced something unprecedented with wideopen eyes they uttered sublime words and spoke these verses in front of the Omniscient One who is free from torment How marvelous is mantra practice able to endow vast knowledge If pervaded by it one becomes a buddha honored among twolegged beings Therefore one should strive energetically with regard to the essence of the buddhas speech And always perform uninterrupted practice purifying the mind and free from self Then the Bhagavān further spoke these Dharmaphrases He who would attain accomplishment in the heart of the Perfectly and Fully Awakened One Should in a park a monastery or inside a cave Or anywhere delightful to the mind observe the bodhimind Until he reaches the rst abode of repose without engendering a doubting mind Namaḥ sarvatathāgatebhyo viśvamukhebhyaḥ sarvathā khamudgate spharahīmaṃ gaganakaṃ svāhā At the full of the moon the practitioner next engages in the performance of recitation On a mountain peak inside a cow pen in a cemetery or on a river sandbar At a crossroads at the foot of a solitary tree or in a shrine of the Mātṛs With everything the color of the vajra  solemnly puried and like a vajra The obstructors inside are subjugated their minds confused It is square right around with one entrance and a passageway Vajras are linked together in the manner of an adamantine coupling In the entrances are the two guards Durdharṣa and Abhimukha Pointing their hands with the ngers raised  their eyes red and wrathful in appearance Lord of Mysteries the Tathāgatas of the present and so on in all worldsystems worthy and perfectly and fully awakened have mastered the pāramitā of expedient means and although these Tathāgatas know that all differentiation is originally empty by nature by means of the power of the pāramitā of expedient means they bring to the fore the conditioned in the unconditioned Responding in turn to the circumstances of beings they appear throughout the Dharma realm for the sake of beings causing them to see the Dharma dwell in happiness and generate a joyful mind or else they obtain long life enjoy themselves by disporting among the ve desires and make offerings to the Worldhonored Buddhas No worldlings are able to believe the realization of such a state but because the Tathāgatas perceive its purpose with a joyful mind they teach these procedural rules for the bodhisattvas path of mantra practice that which cannot be obtained were one to seek it diligently for immeasurable eons cultivating ascetic practices those bodhisattvas who practice the path via the gateway of mantras will achieve in this lifetime Next Lord of Mysteries if a bodhisattva cultivating bodhisattva practices via the gateway of mantras recites three lakṣa and performs accomplishment with a ketu  khaḍga  parasol sandal cintāmaṇi añjana drug or rocanā  he will also obtain siddhi Lord of Mysteries if a man of good or a woman of good endowed with expedient means acts in accordance with what they desire they will obtain success merely through mastery of the mind Lord of Mysteries those who hanker after cause and result Lord of Mysteries those foolish people are unable to understand mantras and the characteristics of mantras It is taught that the cause is not the agent and its result is not produced Even as a cause this cause is empty and so how can there be any result One should know that the results of mantras are completely dissociated from cause and action When his body experiences the samādhi without characteristics Then the mantrin will obtain siddhi born from the mind c Then Vajrapāṇi said to the Buddha Worldhonored One I but beg you to further explain this state of the Perfectly and Fully Awakened One the state of the accomplishment of siddhi Men of good and women of good who see this Dharma obtain joy in their hearts experience a state of happiness and do not violate the Dharma realm Worldhonored One all the Tathāgatas worthy and perfectly and fully awakened have explained that the Dharma realm is called the inconceivable realm Therefore Worldhonored One bodhisattvas cultivating bodhisattva practices via the gateway of mantras gain the understanding that the Dharma realm cannot be divided or destroyed When the vajradhara Lord of Mysteries had nished speaking thus the Worldhonored One addressed him saying Excellent excellent Lord of Mysteries It is indeed excellent that you have asked the Tathāgata about this matter You should listen attentively and consider it carefully as I now explain The Lord of Mysteries said So be it Worldhonored One I am eager to listen The Buddha addressed the Lord of Mysteries One achieves accomplishment by means of the lettergateway A Either in a place inhabited by monks or inside a mountain cave or in a clean chamber one places the letter A on all ones limbs and recites three lakṣa  Again if one repeatedly recites it with such lightness of body and mind one will obtain purity of mind and purity of body wherever one is born If one places on ones ear and recites it one will obtain purity of the organ of hearing If one perfoms exhalation and inhalation with the lettergateway A meditating three times  and if the practitioner is then able to maintain this he will be longevous and live in the world for long eons You should listen attentively and consider it carefully as I now explain Lord of Mysteries what is the dance of practice that produces all the vast results of becoming and decay and which the mantrin realizes for himself in its entirety Thereupon the Worldhonored One spoke these verses This the Perfectly and Fully Awakened Ones have taught to be the sign of the truth of the self Then the Worldhonored One Vairocana further dwelled in the samādhi Adamantine Play Which Vanquishes the Four Demons and uttered words of adamantine syllables for vanquishing the four demons liberating the six destinies and satisfying the knowledge of an omniscient one ḥ vi ra hūṃ khaṃ Then Vajrapāṇi the Lord of Mysteries and the other vajradharas Samantabhadra and the other bodhisattvas and the entire great multitude having experienced something unprecedented with wideopen eyes bowed down to the allsarvajña and spoke these verses This is the treasury of buddhas and worldsaving bodhisattvas With which all buddhas and worldsaving bodhisattvas As well as who awaken to causes and conditions and śrāvakas who slay mental afictions Are able to exercise various supernatural faculties wherever they go And they obtain unsurpassed knowledge the unsurpassed knowledge of the Perfectly Awakened One Therefore we beg you to explain in full the expedient means of this teaching As well as various deeds such as the mental arrangement of letters on different parts of the body Those who seek after the unsurpassed mantra practices of the Great Vehicle Seeing the Dharma and dwelling in peace will obtain the abode of joy When they had nished speaking these verses the Worldhonored One Vairocana said All of you should listen attentively dwelling singlemindedly in mental equipoise Then he empowered his lower body as the great adamantine ground And in order to expound this Dharma manifested a bodhiseat this is called the great adamantine state If bodhisattvas cultivating practices via the gateway of mantras Make of themselves the letter A the internal and the external as being all the same Abandon all objectives equally pebbles gold and jewels And dissociate themselves from all sinful actions as well as covetousness anger and so on They will all obtain purity like the Buddhas and Munis Be able to bring about benets and be free from all faults Next with respect to the letter Va the practitioner relying on yoga And understanding the performance of rites in order to benet beings Becomes a worldsavior in his inner person everything is like this With the waters of his mind calm and full to overowing pure white like snow or milk He should engender a resolute mind and exude throughout his entire body So that owing most purely they spread to all his pores From where they overow within and permeate the earth Lord of Mysteries when one visualizes  various and sundry kinds of formations are born in an instant of thought from that which has neither shape nor form and by merely reciting them one is able to produce the seeds of all wholesome actions such as these Furthermore Lord of Mysteries there is nothing that the Tathāgata does not do For bodhisattvas cultivating practices via the gateway of mantras he is like a reection he adapts to all places adapts to the minds of all beings appears before them all and causes all beings to obtain joy It is all because the Tathāgata has no differentiating mind and has dissociated himself from objective realms Then spoke these verses Therefore omniscience the result of the Tathāgatas siddhi Is regarded as the state most revered and one should perform accomplishment Chapter VII The Accomplishing of Siddhi Then the Auspicious Vajra opened his eyes wide in wonder In his hand he twirled a vajra seal which scintillated like the light of a re Its brilliance illuminating all buddha elds everywhere And with sublime sounds he extolled the Muni sovereign over dharmas You teach mantra practices but those practices are inapprehensible May the buddhas explain this state beyond which there is none higher The goal to which all dharmas return just as streams proceed to the sea When the vajradhara Lord of Mysteries had nished speaking thus the Worldhonored One addressed him saying Everything that is differentiated is all born of the mind The distinguishing of white yellow red and the like arises from the mind A xed mind when joyful is described as the inner locus of the heart Mantras located in that position are able to bestow vast results One thinks of a lotus ower there with eight petals and spread with stamens On the owery pedestal is the lettergateway A with a wreath of ames and quite nelooking Its radiance allpervading so as to illumine beings It is like the cooccurrence of one thousand ashes of lightning and has the variegated forms of a buddha in a round mirror in a deep recess it manifests itself in all places And it appears everywhere before beings like the moon in clear water Such has been proclaimed to be the true mind by buddhas of yore That is to say With this empowerment by the Buddha bodhisattvas of great renown Are unobstructed in the Dharma and able to extinguish all suffering I take refuge in the bodhimind I take refuge in you who have generated the bodhimind I bow down to the essence of practice the stages and pāramitās I pay reverence to you who have previously done it and I take refuge in you who have realized emptiness I am the original beginning of everything and am called the support of the world My teaching of the Dharma is peerless originally quiescent and unsurpassed c Then the Buddha having spoken this gāthā performed empowerment in such a way that on account of his empowerment the vajradharas and bodhisattvas were able to see the most excellent bodhiseat of the Buddha with the Worldhonored One devoid of frivolous arguments like empty space and characterized by the yoga of nondual practice which represented the maturation of karma Immediately the limbs of the Worldhonored Ones body all manifested this letter which for all mundane and supramundane śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas who diligently cultivate the accomplishment of siddhi in contemplation and meditation is the same as life the same as a seed the same as a support and the same as a worldsavior bodhisattvas cultivating bodhisattva practices via the gateway of mantras are able to perform buddha deeds and manifest physical bodies everywhere and all Dharma revolves on the lettergateway A Therefore Lord of Mysteries if bodhisattvas cultivating bodhisattva practices via the gateway of mantras wish to see the Buddha wish to make offerings  wish to realize the generation of the bodhimind wish to associate with bodhisattvas wish to benet beings wish to seek siddhi and wish to seek the knowledge of an omniscient one they should diligently practice in this essence of all buddhas Then the Worldhonored One Vairocana again denitively explained the supernatural faculties of samādhi the mantra practices and the inconceivable methods for arranging the positions of the holy divinities in the king of maṇḍalas Born of the Matrix of Great Compassion The ācārya rst dwells in the letter A the gateway to omniscience and holding a sūtra  he bows down to all the buddhas extends it to the eastern quarter turns round to the south and then to the western quarter and moves around to the northern quarter Next he makes Vajrasattva by empowering himself as Vajradhara either with his seal or with the letter Va Entering inside  he lays out the maṇḍala Likewise in the second maṇḍala too because he empowers himself with original quiescence he has the form of nondual yoga the form of the Tathāgata and the form of emptiness Next he leaves the path are performed and the two sections corresponding to the abodes of the holy divinities and quitting these three sections he dwells in the position of the Tathāgatas  From the eastern quarter he extends the sūtra and goes around the perimeter In the remaining two maṇḍalas too he should perform the deeds by this means Then he empowers himself as Vairocana thinks of the vast Dharma realm and arranges the colors The mantrapractitioner should start with immaculate white spoke these verses His physical appearance just like genuine gold in a state of meditation he destroys all poisons Rays of light spread everywhere and he is golden in color like the Muni Next he should apply the color green which liberates one from birthanddeath He imagines the lettergateway Va the bodhiseat of the great tranquil one  And the color of his body like a rainbow he removes all fear Lastly he applies the color black its hue most mysterious He imagines the lettergateway Ha producing a circle of light all around Just like the erce ames of the calamity of an eon with a jeweled crown and raising a seal in his hand He terries all evil ones and vanquishes the army of Māra b Then the Worldhonored One Vairocana rose from samādhi and dwelled in the samādhi Immeasurable Victory and while in state of meditation he revealed the vidyārājñī Universally Inviolable Strength born in the sphere of all Tathāgatas He bows his head to the Worldhonored One and Prajñāpāramitā and recites this vidyārājñī eight times he rises from his seat circumambulates the maṇḍala enters inside and with the power of great kindness and great pity he thinks of his disciples The ācārya then empowers himself as KarmaVajrasattva with the lettergateway Va as well as Varadavajra  whereupon he should draw the great maṇḍala Born of the Matrix of Great Compassion In the center he calmly fashions the Worldhonored One Mahāvairocana seated on a white lotus ower wearing on his head a crown of hair done in a topknot with paṭa for his undergarment and wearing sheer silk on top his physical appearance golden in

motion or at rest are all mystic seals and you should know that the many utterances made by the tongue are all mantras Therefore Lord of Mysteries bodhisattvas cultivating bodhisattva practices via the gateway of mantras should after having generated the bodhimind abide in the stage of the Tathāgata and draw a maṇḍala If they do otherwise it is tantamount to slandering buddhas and bodhisattvas and they will transgress the samaya and certainly fall into an evil destiny Enlightenment Supernatural Transformations and Empowerment of Mahāvairocana Chapter X The Wheel of Letters Thereupon the Bhagavān Vairocana addressed the vajradhara Lord of Mysteries saying Listen attentively Lord of Mysteries There is an allpervading gateway to the Dharma and if Lord of Mysteries a bodhisattva dwells in these lettergateways all his undertakings will be completely successful Kaṃ khaṃ gaṃ ghaṃ caṃ chaṃ jaṃ jhaṃ ṭaṃ ṭhaṃ ḍaṃ ḍhaṃ taṃ thaṃ daṃ dhaṃ paṃ phaṃ baṃ bhaṃ yaṃ raṃ laṃ vaṃ śaṃ ṣaṃ saṃ haṃ kṣaṃ These nasalized syllables all have the rst vowel pronounce them with their proper sound Namaḥ samantabuddhānāṃ aḥ Namaḥ samantabuddhānāṃ saḥ The Worldhonored Buddhas of the past future and present have taught it will teach it and are now teaching it Lord of Mysteries as I now survey buddha elds everywhere there is none where I do not see this allpervading gateway to the Dharma nor is there any among the Tathāgatas who does not proclaim it Therefore Lord of Mysteries if they wish to understand  bodhisattvas cultivating bodhisattva practices via the gateway of mantras should diligently train in this allpervading gateway to the Dharma If one adds initials medials and nals to ka ca ṭa ta and pa and thereby enters the varieties of mental equipoise one will spontaneously attain the bodhimind practice the accomplishment of full and perfect awakening and parinirvāṇa These lettergateways explained  when combined with ritual instructions for mantras may be accompanied by initials medials and nals If a mantrin knows this he will obtain mastery according to his mind He should employ every single one of these phrases with resolve and if he understands them with intelligence he will be granted an unsurpassed and special state In this way does the wheel of letters revolve from a single wheel On account of having understood this the mantrin will always illuminate the world like the Worldhonored One Vairocana and turn the Dharma wheel Chapter XI The Secret Maṇḍala Thereupon the Bhagavān Vairocana surveyed the entire Dharma realm with the eyes of a Tathāgata and entered the kośa of the Dharma realm the samādhi Treasury of the Adornments of Equality with the Tathāgatas resolute speed in order to manifest the inexhaustible adornments of the Dharma realm and in order to deliver realms of beings without remainder with this gateway of mantra practices and fulll his original vow Furthermore from every single pore there emerged additional bodies of the Dharma realm and after they had appeared commensurate with empty space they expounded throughout immeasurable worldsystems and with the verbal manifestation of the Dharma realm consisting of a single sound the verses on generation of the Tathāgata It produces in forms according to their kind the dharmamarks of dharmas Buddhas śrāvakas worldsaving pratyekabuddhas Multitudes of striving and heroic bodhisattvas and likewise the honored among humans Beings and the physical world are established in succession And dharmas that are born abide and so on are forever produced in this manner On account of their being endowed with wisdom and expedient means they are free from ignorance and doubt And because they have observed this path the Perfectly Allknowing Ones teach  Then the body of the Tathāgata born of the Dharma realm completely lled the entire Dharma realm with clouds of transformations of his own physical manifestation The Worldhonored One Vairocana in the mere time it takes to generate a thought emitted immeasurable buddhas from his pores and after they had been empowered one after another they again entered the palace of the Dharma realm At this the Worldhonored One Vairocana again addressed the vajradhara Lord of Mysteries saying Lord of Mysteries there are instances in which the positions seed and insignia of the holy deities of the maṇḍala are set up  You should listen attentively and consider it carefully as I now explain The vajradhara Lord of Mysteries said So be it Worldhonored One I am eager to listen Then the Bhagavān spoke in verse b The mantrin rst situates circular altars in his own body From the feet to the navel constitutes a great vajra circle From here to the heart he should imagine a water circle Above the water circle is a re circle and above the re circle is a wind circle Then he should keep in mind the ground and draw the various images Then Vajrapāṇi rose to the stage of the body speech and mind of the Worldhonored One Vairocana observing that dharmas are equal he thought of future beings and in order to sever all doubts he uttered the great king of mantras Namaḥ samantabuddhānāṃ asamāptadharmadhātugatiṃ gatānāṃ sarvathā āṃ khāṃ aṃ aḥ saṃ saḥ haṃ haḥ raṃ raḥ vaṃ vaḥ svāhā hūṃ raṃ raḥ hra haḥ svāhā raṃ raḥ svāhā raṃ raḥ svāhā When the vajradhara Lord of Mysteries had nished uttering this king of mantras all Tathāgatas dwelling in worldsystems in the ten directions each extended their right hand and caressed the vajradharas head and with exclamations of applause they praised him saying Excellent excellent Son of the Buddha You have ascended to the stage of the body speech and mind of the Worldhonored One Vairocana and out of a desire to illumine bodhisattvas everywhere dwelling in the mantra path of equality you have uttered this king of mantras The Worldhonored One Vairocana worthy and perfectly and fully awakened when seated on the bodhiseat observed the Dharma realm with twelve syllables and vanquished the four demons These born of the Dharma realm owed forth from three places and destroyed the hosts of the army of the heavenly demon  Then he obtained the equality of the body speech and mind of a Worldhonored One the measure of his body being identical with that of empty space and likewise the measure of his speech and mind He attained the arising of boundless knowledge became sovereign over all dharmas and expounded the Dharma namely this twelvesyllable king of mantras Son of the Buddha because you have now realized the equal body speech and mind of the Worldhonored One Vairocana you will be recognized by all as being identical to a perfectly allknowing one They then spoke these verses You have asked the omniscient Vairocana the Honored One who is perfectly awakened About the supreme mantra practices and he will explain the ritual instructions In former times we awakened wondrous bodhi by this means Revealed all dharmas and caused to reach nirvana The buddhas presently in realms in the ten directions have all realized this Then Vajrapāni endowed with virtue rejoiced greatly in his heart and empowered by the awesome divinity of the buddhas he spoke these verses This Dharma is never exhausted has no ownnature and does not abide  It is liberated from karma and birth and is the same as the Perfectly Allknowing One The expedient means of worldsaviors operating in accordance with their vows of compassion I have come to understand unborn knowledge that the characteristics of dharmas are thus Then the vajradhara Lord of Mysteries again spoke some udāna verses asking the Worldhonored One Vairocana to resolve for the sake of beings in future ages any doubts concerning this great maṇḍala Born of the Matrix of Great Compassion You have severed all doubts your faceted knowledge is free from torments And for the sake of beings I beg leave to ask questions of you the Guiding Teacher And the seats of the holy divinitiesI beg you to explain the instructions for them The mystic seals the appearance  the layout of the positions of the holy divinities the actual manifestation of their awesome efcacy and the goals of their samādhisthese ve are the practices of the empty space of the Dharma realm whereby buddhas of former times accomplished bodhi and their original vow was to liberate realms of beings without remainder out of a desire to benet and make happy those bodhisattvas cultivating bodhisattva practices via the gateway of mantras Vajrapāṇi said So be it Worldhonored One I am eager to listen Then the Bhagavān spoke in verse First the layout of the maṇḍala of the Perfectly Awakened One That born of the matrix of great compassion the secret of secrets As well as immeasurable mundane and supramundane maṇḍalas All the gures for these I shall explain in proper order Be sure to listen is square all around with one entrance and a passageway It is adorned right around with vajra seals and in the center is a karmavajra  On top of which is a wondrous lotus ower open and containing seeds On it is the seal of a great lotus adorned with great dots of emptiness Its eight petals are perfectly arranged and lovely with stamens Next Lord of Mysteries to the secret maṇḍala Of Avalokiteśvara listen singlemindedly O Son of the Buddha He who is fully learned in mantras and has mastered the Secret Altar Burns away for his disciple all his sins in accordance with the rules He completely extinguishes life so that it is never reborn And having been reduced to ashes his life is again restored That is to say with a letter he burns a letter  And on the basis of a letter he is born again All his lives and births are pure and completely unsullied And the twelve component syllables are formed on that receptacle With this samaya he is equal to and not at variance with All Tathāgatas and worldsaving bodhisattvas As well as multitudes of the Buddhas śrāvakas and mundane  There appeared a great king of lotus owers the insignia of the Dharma realm born by virtue of the Tathāgatas vow of faithandunderstanding and the Tathāgatas body having the nature of the Dharma realm was resting in the middle of it and bringing joy to beings in accordance with their various inclinations Then from all the Tathāgatas limbs whose strength cannot be impeded there immediately emerged signs of adornment with immeasurable shapes and colors born of faithandunderstanding in the ten powers of wisdom bodies that had been nurtured by the merits of the perfections of giving morality forbearance energy meditation and wisdom over incalculable hundreds of thousands of koṭis of nayutas of eons When they had emerged in great assemblies throughout all worldsystems they uttered these verses in a loud voice The buddhas are most remarkable and their expedients and knowledge are inconceivable Their wisdom without any ālaya incorporates the exposition of dharmas If one understands the dharmamarks of dharmas which are inapprehensible One will apprehend that which is not apprehended and obtain the state of the buddhas and Guiding Teachers c When they had uttered these sounds they reentered the inconceivable Dharma body of the Tathāgata Then the Worldhonored One again addressed the vajradhara Lord of Mysteries saying Good sir listen attentively to the internal maṇḍala Lord of Mysteries the bodily site is empowered by the empowerment of mantras and mystic seals which have the ownnature of the Dharma realm for their original nature is pure Inside there appears a great king of lotus owers born of the mind and eightpetaled it has a stalk and is spread with stamens brightly colored and beautiful In its center is a Tathāgata the body of the most revered in all worlds who has transcended the levels of body speech and mind reached the mindground and attained results that are special and pleasing to the mind To his east is the Tathāgata Ratnaketu in the south is the Tathāgata Saṃkusumitarāja in the north is the Tathāgata Dundubhisvara in the west is the Tathāgata Amitāyus in the southeast is the bodhisattva Samantabhadra in the northeast is the bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara in the southwest is the bodhisattva Mañjuśrīkumārabhūta and in the northwest is the bodhisattva Maitreya Among all the stamens is the Mother of buddhas and bodhisattvas adorned with her attendant six pāramitās and samādhis Below are arrayed multitudes of vidyādharas and wrathful ones The bodhisattva Lord of Vajradharas acts as its stalk and it is situated in an inexhaustible ocean encircled by all earthdwelling gods and so on immeasurable in their number Then the practitioner in order to accomplish the samaya should with incense owers lamps unguents and various dishes born of the mind make to it offerings of them all The mantrin should conscientiously draw the maṇḍala Regarding his own person as the Great Self he puries the sullies with the letter Ra Resting in the yoga posture he thinks of the Tathāgatas And bestows on the heads of the disciples the letter A with a great dot of emptiness  The wise person hands ne owers and has them scatter them over his own person He explains to them the places to be revered by the practitioners which he sees within  Since this is the supreme altar he should confer the samaya Chapter XIV The Eight Secret Seals Thereupon the Worldhonored One Vairocana again gazed upon the entire great assembly and addressed the vajradhara Lord of Mysteries saying Son of the Buddha there are eight secret seals which are most secret When used in the stations of the holy divinities  their awesome divinity is the same  they are characterized by their own mantra path and have maṇḍalas and one should intercorrespond with them as with ones own deity If they rely on ritual teaching bodhisattvas cultivating bodhisattva practices via the gateway of mantras should know that they themselves will dwell in the form of their own deity rm and unmoving and after having known their own deity they will abide in the manner of their own deity and obtain siddhi What are the eight seals This is the seal birth of the Worldhonored Ones great majesty Its maṇḍala is triangular and has rays of light This is the seal adamantine indestructibility of the Worldhonored One Its maṇḍala is like the letter Va in appearance and has adamantine light svāhā Then with the rst seal spread the ring ngers and middle ngers apart This is called lotusower matrix seal Its maṇḍala is like a lunar disc in appearance and is surrounded by padma owers This is the seal adornment with the Tathāgatas myriad virtues Its maṇḍala is like a halfmoon in shape and is surrounded by great dots of emptiness This is the seal birth from all the Tathāgatas limbs Its maṇḍala is in shape like a kalaśa a full moon and is surrounded by vajras This is the seal Worldhonored Ones dhāraṇī Its maṇḍala is like a rainbow and it is completely surrounded by the insignia surrounding the foregoing maṇḍalas and is hung with a vajrabanner This is called seal of the Tathāgatas abiding state of the Dharma Its maṇḍala is like empty space surrounded by variegated colors and it has two dots of emptiness This is called seal of the Worldhonored Ones swift support Its maṇḍala is again like empty space use blue dots to decorate it The mantra is svāhā Lord of Mysteries these are called the secret seals of the Tathāgata and they are supreme and secret Abiding in which ritual teachings does one recognize their potency Freedom from time place activity and right and wrong How does one quickly accomplish  I beg the Buddha to explain that length  About that which was taught by previous buddhas which brings about siddhi I ask the Omniscient One perfectly awakened and honored among twolegged beings For the sake of future beings The precepts that arise in dependence on vidyāsabide in these precepts like a perfectly awakened one And they will bring about the accomplishment of siddhi for the benet of the world Generating the truth of the self and without engendering any doubting thoughts One always abides in mental equipoise and the cultivation of the precepts will end If the bodhimind and dharmas as well as training action and results Are combined into a single characteristic one will be far removed from all activities One will be like the Buddhas knowledge in ones possession of the precepts and anyone who does otherwise does not possess the precepts aChapter XVI The True Knowledge of the cārya Thereupon the vajradhara next further asked the Worldhonored One Mahāvairocana about the essence of the mantras of the maṇḍalas uttering these verses He is a Tathāgata and is also called a Buddha A bodhisattva Brahmā Viṣṇu Mahera ditya Candra Varuṇa akra Lord of the World  Kālarātri Yama and so on Pṛthivī Sarasvatī A brahman and an initiated householder and is also called a celibate A monk who has exhausted his outows  auspicious a holder of secrets Allknowing and allseeing sovereign over dharmas and wealthy If one dwells in the bodhimind and in the nature of the knowledge of sound And is not attached to any dharmas one is called allpervading This is a mantrin a holder of auspicious mantras A king of true speech  and the seal of Vajradhara Next Lord of Mysteries listen singlemindedly O Son of the Buddha To how to arrange the lettergateways as taught by the buddhas The letter Ka is below the larynx the letter Kha is on the palate The letter Ga is identied with the neck the letter Gha is inside the throat The letter Ca is identied with the tongue the letter Cha is in the middle of the tongue The letter Ja is identied with the tip of the tongue the letter Jha is where the tongue arises The letter a is identied with the shanks the letter ha should be known as the thighs The letter a is explained as the hips the letter ha is the buttocks The letter Ta is the anus the letter Tha should be known as the abdomen The letter Da is identied with both hands the letter Dha is called the armpits The letter Pa is identied with the back the letter Pha should be known as the chest The letter Ba is identied with both upper arms the letter Bha is identied with the lower arms The letter Ma resides in the heart the letter Ya is the genitals The letter Ra is called the eyes the letter La is identied with the forehead I and  are in both canthi U and  are identied with both lips E and Ai are identied with both ears O and Au are identied with both cheeks The letter Aṃ is the locus of bodhi and the letter Aḥ is parinirvāṇa Knowing this entire method the practitioner will accomplish perfect awakening The assets of an omniscient one will always be in his heart And the world will call him omniscient I shall now explain the path of skillful practice If a bodhisattva and mahāsattva abides in this he will gain mastery of the Great Vehicle Lord of Mysteries the bodhisattva keeps the precept of not taking life which should not be done he keeps the taking of what is not given sexual misconduct mendacious speech harsh speech slanderous speech meaningless speech covetousness anger and wrong views in all of which he should not engage Lord of Mysteries this basis of training the bodhisattva practices in accordance with the training in the same way as do the perfectly awakened Worldhonored Ones and bodhisattvas in this manner should he train Then the vajradhara Lord of Mysteries said to the Buddha The Worldhonored Bhagavān has also explained this path of ten wholesome actions for the śrāvaka vehicle and people in the world at large and nonBuddhists too b are always desirous of cultivating the path of ten wholesome actions Worldhonored One what are the differences with those What are its various special qualities When the vajradhara Lord of Mysteries had nished speaking thus the Buddha addressed him saying Excellent excellent Lord of Mysteries It is indeed excellent that you have asked the Tathāgata about this matter Lord of Mysteries you should listen attentively as I now explain the Dharma gateway of the different paths and the one path Lord of Mysteries in the case of the code of training for the śrāvaka vehicle I have taught it it is divorced from wisdom and expedient means enjoins the achievement of morality fosters sided knowledge and is not the same as practicing the path of ten wholesome actions Worlds furthermore because they are divorced from attachment to the self are subject to another cause  The bodhisattva cultivates the Great Vehicle enters the equality of all dharmas and embraces wisdom and expedient means and his actions unfold for the sake of both himself and others Therefore Lord of Mysteries the bodhisattva here takes hold of wisdom and expedient means enters the equality of all dharmas and should be diligent in his training Then the Worldhonored One again gazed upon the realms of beings with eyes of great compassion and addressed the bodhisattva Vajrapāṇi saying Lord of Mysteries those bodhisattvas keep the precept of not taking life for as long as they live They should forsake the sword and the rod be free from murderous intent and guard the life of another as if it were their own There is another expedient means in order to liberate some kinds of beings from retribution for evil deeds in accordance with their deeds the taking of life is carried out but without thoughts of enmity or animosity Next Lord of Mysteries the bodhisattva keeps the precept against taking what is not given With regard to possessions belonging to others he does not give rise to thoughts of touching or taking them let alone taking other things that are not given There is another expedient means if he sees beings who are miserly hoard things and do not cultivate the merit of giving then according to their kind and in order to counter their miserliness he performs giving on their behalf free from thoughts of self and other Lord of Mysteries if a bodhisattva engenders thoughts of covetousness and touches or takes  this bodhisattva will fall back from the factors conducive to bodhi and violate the unconditioned Vinaya rules Next Lord of Mysteries the bodhisattva keeps the precept of not committing adultery There is another expedient means Next Lord of Mysteries the bodhisattva keeps the precept of not lying for as long as he lives Even for the sake of saving his life he should not lie for this would betray the buddhas bodhi Lord of Mysteries this is called the bodhisattvas abiding in the supreme Great Vehicle If one lies one violates the dharma of the Buddhas bodhi Therefore Lord of Mysteries you should know this Dharma gateway in this manner and renounce untruthful speech Next Lord of Mysteries the bodhisattva observes the precept of not engaging in harsh abuse He should embrace beings with the speech of gentle thoughts and with words that are appropriate Lord of Mysteries the rst practice of the bodhisattva is to bring benet and happiness to beings Alternatively another bodhisattva seeing someone dwelling in a cause of an evil destiny may exhibit harsh speech in order to confute him Next Lord of Mysteries the bodhisattva observes the precept of not using speech that causes discord he dissociates himself from divisive speech and dissociates himself from hurtful speech He who violates is not called a bodhisattva who does not cause thoughts of dissension among beings There is a different expedient means if those beings produce attachment in accordance with their viewpoints he will utter divisive speech according to their kind and make them abide in the one path that is to say the path to the knowledge of an omniscient one Next Lord of Mysteries the bodhisattva keeps the precept of not engaging in idle talk With appropriate words and conforming to time and place he produces benets causes all beings to engender thoughts of joy and puries the path of the organ of hearing Because the bodhisattva possesses a diverse vocabulary Alternatively another bodhisattva may put jocularity to the fore create pleasure for beings and make them dwell in the Buddhas Dharma Although he utters much meaningless speech such a bodhisattva is not attached to transmigration through birthanddeath Next Lord of Mysteries the bodhisattva should keep the precept of noncovetousness He does not give rise to deled thoughts toward anothers things of which he makes use Because there is no bodhisattva who produces thoughts of attachment If a bodhisattvas mind has deled thoughts he will become powerless at the gateway to omniscience and will fall to one side Again Lord of Mysteries the bodhisattva should engender joy and produce the thought It is most excellent that whatever I must do is made to be done spontaneously repeatedly feeling happy for himself for he must not cause beings to lose their property Next Lord of Mysteries the bodhisattva should keep the precept of nonanger In all circumstances he always cultivates tolerance and is not attached to anger or joy and his mind operates equably toward foe and kin A bodhisattva does not harbor illwill Why is that Because the bodhisattva is by his original nature pure Therefore Lord of Mysteries the bodhisattva should keep the precept of nonanger Next Lord of Mysteries the bodhisattva should abandon wrong views He practices right views fears the otherworld and is without animosity without deceit and without trickery his mind is upright and his mind has become xed upon the Buddha Dharma and Sangha Therefore Lord of Mysteries wrong views are deemed to be the very greatest of faults they cut off all the bodhisattvas roots of goodness and they are regarded as the mother of all unwholesome dharmas Hence Lord of Mysteries one should not give rise to the causes and conditions of wrong views even in jest Then the vajradhara Lord of Mysteries said to the Buddha Worldhonored One I beg you to explain the cutting off whereby the precepts of the path of ten wholesome cut off the ultimate roots of unwholesome actions How does a bodhisattva while acting freely in the position of a king dwelling in a palace surrounded by his parents wife children and attendants and experiencing heavenly pleasures not commit any faults When the vajradhara had nished speaking thus the Buddha addressed him saying Excellent excellent Lord of Mysteries You should listen attentively and consider it carefully as I now explain the skill in determining the Vinaya of bodhisattvas Lord of Mysteries know that there are two kinds of bodhisattvas What are two They are the householder and the renunciant Lord of Mysteries the householder bodhisattva observes the ve bases of the precepts acts freely in positions of power conforms to time and place with the path of various expedient means acts freely to embrace  and seeks an omniscient one That is to say endowed with expedient means he displays various arts such as those of dancers and temple masters and following these expedient means he embraces beings with the four means of conversion causing them all to seek after anuttarā samyaksaṃbodhi He keeps namely the precept of not taking life and the precepts against taking what is not given mendacious speech sexual misconduct and wrong views These are called the ve bases of the precepts for householders The bodhisattva observing the wholesome precepts as they have been taught should have clear faith and should be diligent in his training Following the bases of training of Tathāgatas of former times he abides in the conditioned precepts is endowed with wisdom and expedient means and attains the aggregate of the Tathāgatas unsurpassed and auspicious unconditioned precepts There are four kinds of fundamental sins that should not be committed even for the sake of saving ones life What are four They are slandering the Dharma abandoning the bodhimind miserliness with the Dharma and causing harm to beings Why is that They are by nature deled and do not represent the keeping of the bodhisattva precepts The Perfectly Awakened Ones of the past those of future ages And the honored among humans in the present endowed with wisdom and expedient means Cultivate unsurpassed awakening and obtain the siddhi of no outows Also taught are other bases of training and knowledge divorced from expedient means You should know Great Striving Hero that these are for guiding śrāvakas aChapter XIX The Exposition of the Arising of the Hundred Letters Thereupon the Worldhonored One Vairocana surveyed the entire great assembly and expounded the infallible teaching the sovereign of mantras which accomplishes everything in accordance with desires the king of mantras the leader of mantras the great potent one Resting in the three samayas and in order to consummate the three dharmas with a wondrous voice he addressed Vajrapāṇi of great power saying Striving Hero with singlemindedness listen attentively to the mantraleader of mantras whereupon he dwelled in the samādhi Birth of Knowledge and uttered a mantra which produces various kinds of skillful knowledge and shines everywhere with one hundred light rays This is of all mantras The mantra worldsavior which accomplishes great potency It is the Perfectly Awakened One sovereign over dharmas and the Muni It destroys the darkness of ignorance and appears everywhere like the suns orb It is my own essence empowered by the Great Muni And its responsive transformations perform miracles in order to benet beings And cause everything to arise in accordance with ones wishes All of which is able to produce the unsurpassed state of miracles Therefore one should in every way purify the body dissociate oneself from sullies Always strive in accordance with reason and aspire to the Buddhas bodhi bChapter XX Intercorrespondence with the Fruit of the Hundred Letters Thereupon the Worldhonored One Vairocana addressed the vajradhara Lord of Mysteries saying Lord of Mysteries if one enters the stage of initiation into the great knowledge of the Great Awakened Worldhonored One one will see oneself dwelling in the state of the three samayas Lord of Mysteries when one enters initiation into the Bhagavāns great knowledge then one will manifest buddha deeds in the form of dhāraṇīs Then the Great Awakened Worldhonored One dwells conformingly in front of all beings performing buddha deeds and expounding the state of the three samayas The Buddha said Lord of Mysteries observe the sphere of my circle of speech which is a gateway to purity that is vast and extends throughout immeasurable worldsystems a gateway that in accordance with their own nature expresses the Dharma realm as is appropriate for different kinds of beings and causes all beings to all obtain joy Again it is like the present Worldhonored One ākyamuni who pervades inexhaustible realms of empty space and diligently performs buddha deeds in lands Lord of Mysteries sentient beings do not realize that from this attribute of the circle of speech of the Worldhonored One there ow forth wondrous sounds of the Perfectly Awakened One like decorative strings of jewels and that images of the Buddha born from the matrix  generate joy in accordance with the inclinations of beings Then the Worldhonored One in the gateway to the sea of immeasurable worldsystems pervades the Dharma realm earnestly encourages the accomplishment of bodhi and produces the bodhisattva Samantabhadras vow of practice Then he seeks after the state of samyaksaṃbodhi and because he knows that the mind is immeasurable he knows that the body is immeasurable because he knows that the body is immeasurable he knows that knowledge is immeasurable because he knows that knowledge is immeasurable he knows that beings are immeasurable and because he knows that beings are immeasurable he knows that the realm of empty space is immeasurable Lord of Mysteries on account of the immeasurableness of the mind he obtains four kinds of immeasurableness Having obtained them he accomplishes supreme perfect awakening is endowed with the ten powers of wisdom vanquishes the four demons and fearlessly speaks with the roar of a lion The Buddha spoke this verse Striving Hero all these states of the Unsurpassedly Awakened One Are the essence taught by the buddhas in the hundredgated basis of training Chapter XXI The Accomplishment of the Station of the Hundred Letters Thereupon the vajradhara Lord of Mysteries having gained the unprecedented spoke these verses Please explain Great Striving Hero best of speakers I beg you to reveal all this Thereupon the Bhagavān sovereign over dharmas the Muni Who is completely perfect and allpervading pervades all worldsystems And is an omniscient onethe Honored One Vairocana addressed saying Excellent Mahāsattva Vajrapāṇi of great virtue I shall explain in its entirety the subtle secret the supreme marvel The secret essentials of the buddhas which nonBuddhists cannot know a Next Lord of Mysteries bodhisattvas cultivating bodhisattva practices via the gateway of mantras generate the image from their own body in this manner there is none so special as to surpass a saṃbuddha Just as the eyes ears nose tongue body mind and so on are an assemblage and agglomeration of the four elements so too is it thus empty of ownnature and there is only that which is grasped by name it is just like empty space and there is nothing to be attached to like a reection That Tathāgata accomplishes perfect awakening in uninterrupted mutual dependent arising If something arises from conditions then it arises like a reection Therefore the deity is oneself and oneself is the deity and they generate each other The body produced by the body arises as the image of the deity Lord of Mysteries observe how this Dharma is dependent on the penetrating wisdom and the penetrating wisdom is dependent on the Dharma Lord of Mysteries how does there arise from the mind the image produced by the mind Lord of Mysteries it is for instance just as when someone applies the mind to either white or yellow or red and a mind imbued with that color arises In the same way the body also operates Lord of Mysteries again it is like when one internally visualizes a maṇḍala in ones mind and treats fever  whereupon that beings fever will be cured instantly without any doubt The maṇḍala is not different from the mind and the mind is not different from the maṇḍala Because has the selfsame characteristic as the maṇḍala Lord of Mysteries again it is as if an illusionist illusorily created a man and that man again created an apparition Lord of Mysteries what do you think Which of them would be superior Thereupon Vajrapāṇi said to the Buddha Worldhonored One there would be no difference between these two Worldhonored One because they have not actually arisen and because these two men are by their original nature empty they are the same as illusions So it is Lord of Mysteries The mind producing things and that which is produced by the mind are in this manner both empty nondual and not separate Chapter XXII Recitation for the Accomplishment of the Hundred Letters Thereupon the Worldhonored One addressed the vajradhara Lord of Mysteries saying Listen attentively Lord of Mysteries With respect to the mantra worldsavior there is not any difference between its body and the body  The mind arises from the mind and when it has been well puried light ows forth everywhere therefrom and arises correspondingly throughout the limbs The likes of foolish people never know this nor do they attain this path Furthermore because the reduplication born of the body are of immeasurable kinds in the same way the reduplication of the mantra worldsavior are also said to be immeasurable It is for example like the auspicious cintāmaṇi which brings about benets according to ones desires In this manner there are no objectives whatsoever that the body of the worlds worldilluminator does not accomplish Lord of Mysteries how do all activities unfold in the Dharma realm which is undifferentiated In this manner the knowledge of an omniscient one which is without differentiation is commensurate with empty space and functions internally and externally for all beings Then the Worldhonored One also proclaimed phrases that purify inexhaustible realms of beings phrases that bring forth samādhi phrases that are inconceivable and phrases that are gateways to transforming others If existents though originally nonexistent arise in conformity with the world How does the understanding of emptiness arise in this yogin Their ownnature being thus he realizes that names are inapprehensible And the spacelike mind namely the bodhimind will arise He should generate compassion conforming with all worlds And abide in the practice of thoughtonlythis is termed buddhas He should know that is created by thought and observing this he regards emptiness as empty Just as the method of counting numbers operates with being distinguished by increases of one So too Striving Hero is emptiness increasing sequentially These letters A and so on are namely empowered by spontaneous knowledge Lord of Mysteries in this manner the letter A abides as various adornments arranged in depicted positions Because all dharmas are originally unborn  it reveals its own form Alternatively because of the meaning of inapprehensibility it manifests the form of the letter Va Alternatively because dharmas are far removed from activity  it manifests the form of the letter Ka Alternatively because all dharmas are like empty space  it manifests the form of the letter Kha Alternatively because going is inapprehensible it manifests the form of the letter Ga Alternatively because the characteristic of agglomeration ghana compact  is inapprehensible in dharmas it manifests the form of the letter Gha Alternatively because all dharmas are dissociated from birth and extinction  it manifests the form of the letter Ca Alternatively because all dharmas have no shadow  it manifests the form of the letter Cha Alternatively because birth is inapprehensible in all dharmas it manifests the form of the letter Ja Alternatively because all dharmas are dissociated from enemies  it manifests the form of the letter Jha Alternatively because all dharmas are dissociated from pride  it manifests the form of the letter a Alternatively because all dharmas are dissociated from nurture  it manifests the form of the letter ha Alternatively because all dharmas are dissociated from resentment  it manifests the form of the letter a Alternatively because all dharmas are dissociated from calamities  it manifests the form of the letter ha Alternatively because all dharmas are dissociated from thusness  it manifests the form of the letter Ta Alternatively because all dharmas are dissociated from a dwelling place  it manifests the form of the letter Tha Alternatively because all dharmas are dissociated from giving  it manifests the form of the letter Da Alternatively because elements are inapprehensible in all dharmas it manifests the form of the letter Dha Alternatively because supreme truth is inapprehensible in all dharmas it manifests the form of the letter Pa Alternatively because all dharmas are unsolid and like foam  it manifests the form of the letter Pha Alternatively because all dharmas are dissociated from bondage  it manifests the form of the letter Ba Alternatively because visualization is inapprehensible in all dharmas it manifests the form of the letter Bha Alternatively because vehicles are inapprehensible in all dharmas it manifests the form of the letter Ya Alternatively because all dharmas are dissociated from all dust  it manifests the form of the letter Ra Alternatively because all dharmas have no characteristic  it manifests the form of the letter La Alternatively because all dharmas are dissociated from quiescence  it manifests the form of the letter a Alternatively because all dharmas are by their original nature dull  it manifests the form of the letter a Alternatively because truth is inapprehensible in all dharmas it manifests the form of the letter Sa Alternatively because all dharmas are dissociated from cause  it manifests the form of the letter Ha Lord of Mysteries enter in sequence each single one of these samādhi gateways Lord of Mysteries if you observe them then the thirtytwo attributes of a great person will all arise from them These appear in sequence and accomplish the minor marks of a samyaksaṃbuddha Chapter XXIII The Mantra Method for the Hundred Letters Next Lord of Mysteries in this samādhi gateway one will empowered by emptiness become sovereign over all dharmas and accomplish supreme perfect awakening Therefore this letter is regarded as the deity then spoke these verses Lord of Mysteries you should know that the letter A is the primary state Its bright dharma allpervading and surrounded by a circle of letters This deity has no characteristics and is far removed from seeing and characteristics Yet although without characteristics holy deities manifest characteristics and come forth from its midst Sounds emerge from the letter  the letter produces mantras And mantras effect resultsso have the honored worldsaviors taught You should know that the nature of sound is empty and that it has been created by emptiness Chapter XXV The Three Samayas Thereupon the vajradhara Lord of Mysteries said to the Buddha As for the three samayas mentioned by the Worldhonored One why are they described as the three samayas When the vajradhara Lord of Mysteries had nished speaking thus the Worldhonored One addressed him saying It is excellent excellent Lord of Mysteries that you have asked me about this matter Lord of Mysteries you should listen attentively and consider it carefully as I now explain Vajrapāṇi said So be it Worldhonored One I am eager to listen The Buddha said There are three kinds of dharmas that arising as a continuum and in conjunction with the removal of obstacles are called the three samayas How do these dharmas arise as a continuum Namely at the time of the initial aspiration one does not see ones own nature From this wisdom is generated and knowledge concordant with reality arises free from the web of inexhaustible differentiation This is called the second mind with the characteristic of bodhi without differentiation and representing the state of perfect and full awakening Next Lord of Mysteries there are three samayas The rst is the mind of the Perfectly Awakened One  the second is called the Dharma And the arising of that mind as a continuum is called the harmonious Sangha These three samayas have been taught by the buddhas and Guiding Teachers If one dwells in these three equalities and cultivates practices for bodhi Then starting with the gateways of guidance and in order to benet beings One will achieve bodhi and the three bodies will operate freely c Lord of Mysteries the samyaksaṃbuddha in order to establish the teachings empowers himself as a single body namely the rst transformation body Next Lord of Mysteries in single body he displays three kinds  namely the Buddha the Dharma and the Sangha Next Lord of Mysteries on the basis of this he establishes and expounds three kinds of vehicles widely performs buddha deeds manifests parinirvāṇa and maturates beings Lord of Mysteries see how those bodhisattvas cultivating practices for bodhi via the gateway of mantras if they comprehend the three equalities and perform accomplishment with the rules for mantras are not attached to any false grasping and cannot be hindered except those who do not desire  are lazy engage in protless talk do not engender faith and accumulate property Furthermore one should not do two things namely drink liquor and sleep on a bed Chapter XXVI The Exposition of Tathāgata Thereupon the vajradhara Lord of Mysteries said to the Worldhonored One What is called a bodhisattva What is a Perfectly Awakened One O Guiding Teacher and Great Muni I beg you to sever my doubts Bodhisattvas of great renown having abandoned their doubting thoughts Will cultivate the Mahayana the king of practices unsurpassed Then the Bhagavān Vairocana surveyed the entire great assembly and addressed the vajradhara Lord of Mysteries saying It is excellent excellent Vajrapāṇi that you have asked me about this matter Lord of Mysteries you should listen attentively and consider it carefully as I now explain the path of the Mahayana verse Bodhi has the characteristic of empty space and is free from all differentiation One who wishes to seek that bodhi is called a bodhisattva One who has accomplished the ten stages has fully mastered freedom dharmas are empty and illusionlike knows that these dharmas are all the same And understands mundane destinies is on that account called a Perfectly Awakened One dharmas have a characteristic akin to empty space and are nondual and of only one characteristic And has accomplished the ten powers of wisdom of a buddha is on that account termed a saṃbuddha One who has destroyed ignorance with only wisdom and selfrealized wisdom Whose ownnature is dissociated from speech is on that account called a Tathāgata Chapter XXVII The Mundane and Supramundane Homa Rituals Next Lord of Mysteries once in former times when I was a bodhisattva practicing bodhisattva practices and residing in the world of Brahmā  Brahmā came and questioned me saying Great Brahmā we would like to know how many kinds of re there are I replied as follows Next Mahābrahmās son was called Pāvaka The beginning of mundane re his son was called Brahmodana His son was called Pitara Vaiśvānara He further begat Havana Havyavāhana Pārśvasaṃvīta and Atharvaṇa His sons were Prathita and Puṣkaroda These re gods were born from each other in succession Next at the time of conception use the re Māruta Later when wishing to bathe yourself the re Vahamāna For use when bathing your wife use the re Maṅgala After the birth of the child use the re Pragalbha The Fire of Wisdom is the rst called Mahendra How does one employ sprinkling And spread the auspicious grass properly How does one set out all the materials The Buddha addressed the Lord of Mysteries the vajradhara saying The hearth for the re should be a cubits measure its four sides equal to each other Its rim made four phalanges  and surrounded by vajra seals One spreads this with fresh rushes going around the hearth toward the right And not placing the tips over the bases the bases should be placed over the tips Next one takes some auspicious grass and sprinkles to the right according to the rules This is called internal homa and it has been taught for bodhisattvas Chapter XXVIII The Exposition of Deity Samādhi Thereupon the vajradhara Lord of Mysteries said to the Buddha Worldhonored One I beg you to explain the actual manifestation of the physical forms and awesome efcacy of the deities so as to make bodhisattvas cultivating bodhisattva practices via the gateway of mantras visualize their deitys form in such a way that their deitys body is identied with their own body and they will without any doubt obtain siddhi When the vajradhara Lord of Mysteries had nished speaking thus the Buddha addressed him saying Excellent excellent Lord of Mysteries It is excellent that you have asked me about this matter Now then listen attentively and apply your mind very carefully as I now explain Vajrapāṇi said So be it Worldhonored One I am eager to listen The Buddha said Lord of Mysteries the deities have three kinds of bodies namely syllable  seal  and physical form  The syllables are of two kinds namely sound and bodhimind The seals are of two kinds namely with form and without form The deitys body is also of two kinds namely pure and impure The pure body of realization is dissociated from all characteristics while the impure conceptualized body has a manifest form and various colors The two kinds of deityforms accomplish two kinds of deeds on account of the conceptualized one accomplishes siddhi with characteristics and on account of the unconceptualized there accordingly arises siddhi without characteristics He then spoke these verses The Buddha has taught that on account of the conceptualized one will desire to accomplish with characteristics And by abiding in the unconceptualized one will obtain siddhi without characteristics Therefore one should in every way abide in the nonconceptualized Chapter XXIX The Exposition of Samādhi without Characteristics Next the Bhagavān Vairocana addressed the vajradhara Lord of Mysteries saying Lord of Mysteries those bodhisattvas cultivating bodhisattva practices via the gateway of mantras who wish to accomplish samādhi without characteristics should think as follows From where do concepts arise Is it from my body or from my mind Were they to arise from the body the body is like grass trees and pebbles its ownnature is such that it is dissociated from activity incognizant and born of cause and action and it should be viewed as being the same as external things Again it is like a constructed image which can be damaged by neither re nor water nor sword nor poison nor vajra and so on and which should one become angry with it and speak harshly to it can be moved in the slightest Even if gods and worldlings serve it and provide it with food and drink garments unguents and garlands of owers or with various special articles of enjoyment such as the likes of unguents sandalwood and camphor it will not engender joy The ordinary person foolish and childlike gives rise to differentiating thoughts born of his own self perverse and unreal with regard to that image which is by its ownnature empty and he either worships it or does harm to it Lord of Mysteries in this manner should one dwell cultivating mindfulness of the body and observing how it is by nature empty Next Lord of Mysteries because the mind has no ownnature and is dissociated from all concepts one should consider it to be by nature empty Lord of Mysteries seek though one may the mind cannot be apprehended in the three ages for it transcends the three ages In this manner its ownnature is far removed from characteristics Lord of Mysteries that there are mental concepts is the product of differentiation on the part of ordinary people foolish and childlike Because they do not understand they have false misconceptions such as these which should thus be considered unreal and unborn Lord of Mysteries these bodhisattvas cultivating bodhisattva practices via the gateway of mantras will realize the samādhi without characteristics and because they dwell in the samādhi without characteristics the true speech uttered by the Tathāgata will personally face them and always appear in their presence Chapter XXX Mundane and Supramundane Recitation Next Lord of Mysteries I shall now explain the secret method for reciting mantras In internal and external yoga I have taught that there are four kinds In the case of mundane recitation there is a continuum of objects  And one dwells in seedsyllables and phrases or else the mind attends on ones own deity Therefore it is said to have an object of cognition and recitation with the outgoing and incoming breath is regarded as the best  One should know that the supramundane mind is far removed from syllables Ones self and the deity become one and nondual without grasping or attachment And one does not sunder the mind and the physical imagedo not act contrary to the rules Do not act contrary to this teaching regarding the number of recitations cChapter XXXI The Entrustment Thereupon the Worldhonored One addressed the entire assembly saying You must now not be negligent with regard to this gateway to the Dharma If you do not know their basic nature you should not confer it on other people apart from my disciples who possess the attributes I shall now explain them and so you should listen singlemindedly The entire assembly having made vast offerings with various adornments bowed down at the feet of the Buddha and they reverently clasped their palms together and spoke these words We but beg you to proclaim the worldsaving phrases of empowerment for this Dharma teaching so that the path of Dharma vision may pervade everywhere and long remain in the world Then the Worldhonored One uttered the mantra of the phrases of empowerment for this gateway to the Dharma svāhā Then when the Buddha had nished expounding this scripture all the vajradharas and the bodhisattvas headed by Samantabhadra and so on hearing what the Buddha had said were all overjoyed and believed accepted upheld and practiced it

you should singlemindedly form the seal for subduing demons The wise person should rotate it everywhere while intercorresponding with the mantra Able to remove evilminded beings of extreme ferocity You will see adamantine blazing ery light all over the ground The mantra for vanquishing demons is Namaḥ samantabuddhānāṃ samantānugate bandhaya sīmāṃ mahāsamayanirjāte smaraṇe apratihate dhaka dhaka

three times For other articles of offering to be offered up Follow these rules purifying them with Acalanātha You should clasp the left and right palms together with the ve ngers interlaced This is the general offering seal for holding things The mantrin endowed with wisdom in revering the holy deities Also performs a mental ritual pure and most pleasing Everything offered lls equally like the Dharma realm This region and other lands entering all destinies everywhere Produced by the merit of buddhas and bodhisattvas Banners and pennants chapleted canopies vast and wondrous pavilions The king of heavenly jeweled trees all with the implements of worship And clouds of unguent and owers unbounded like empty space Each raining down offerings offered to accomplish buddha deeds With the power of my merit and the power of the Dharma realm They are easy to obtain at all timesvast and also pure Clouds of arrays of great offerings ow forth from the oceanlike assembly Of all Tathāgatas and multitudes of bodhisattvas On account of the empowerment of all buddhas and bodhisattvas The merits accumulated by deeds performed according to the rules I redirect to the accomplishment of siddhi for the benet of beings Speak with such thoughts wishing that your vidyā practices may be pure For obstacles to be eliminated and merits to be consummated of their own accord Cultivate right practices at any timethere is no xed term If mantrins seek siddhi in this life First they should recite according to the rules and just perform mental offering Universally bestowing siddhi and all merits The Dharma is free from sully unchanging incomparable and most excellent Commensurate with empty space it cannot be compared And even ten million particles of dust would not approach one of its  Forever in vows to accomplish results in the realms of beings are inexhaustible with regard to siddhi and are therefore beyond comparison Their compassion always unsullied arises from effort And accomplishes siddhi according to their vows by nature unable to be obscured I but pray that the holy ones will grant me siddhi for the compassionate relief of sentient beings Then out of a desire to benet others visualize everywhere clouds of transformations of the Buddha Through the merit that I have cultivated the empowerment of the buddhas and Samantabhadras own power of the Dharma realm They sit on lotusower pedestals and go in the ten directions guiding beings in accordance with their inclinations Relying on the Tathāgatas own vows they cleanse all inner and outer obstacles And make manifest supramundane implements lling them in accordance with their faithandunderstanding Adorned by my merits and arisen in the pure Dharma realm On account of empowerment by the Tathāgatas supernatural power they accomplish the objectives of beings And replenish the buddhas repository inconceivable in its discharging of inexhaustible treasures Recite three times the vidyā Proceeding from the Treasury of Empty Space  the appearance of the mystic seal is as was explained earlier He who intercorresponds with the samādhi of his own deity places that heart on his heart as a seed He should observe himself thus resting in the pure bodhimind The gure known by many he follows in his practice and it must not differ He should know that the holy one the honored Mañjuśrī is in physical appearance like the color of saffron On top of his head he displays a young boys mark of ve topknots in his left there is a vajra on a blue lotus And with his right hand bestowing fearlessness or forms the adamantine wishgranting seal The lettergateway Ka explained in the scriptures is that all dharmas are without activity  With the light of this principle you should meditate on the true meaning of this sound The seal of the cintāmaṇi king of jewels interlock the ve ngers of the left and right hands It is the form of the adamantine handclasp common to all bodhisattva rites One is dependent on time and the second is dependent on signs Time means the completion of the expected number and xed periods such as terms of days or months Signs means blazing light and sounds emitted by a buddhas stupa or a painting or image You should know that these are signs that the mantra practitioners obstacles sins have been cleansed It is as is explained in the sutra having rst recited with mental application then recite a full one lakṣa  Thereafter spend a second month practicing expedient means complete with the limbs and then perform rites of accomplishment in accordance with your prime wish If there are obstacles rst relying on the gateway for the manifestation of signs use mental recitation and then in the second month do worship complete with the limbs Thus should it be known Then for him who desirous of practicing the gateway to the Tathāgatas three mysteries One month has passed the expedient means will next be explained If the practitioner recites the mantra with seal of Mahāvairocana The Perfectly Awakened One he should rely on the following method The seed heart of Vairocana is Namaḥ samantabuddhānāṃ a The gateway to the letter A means that all dharmas are originally unborn as was explained earlier The bodily mystic seal for this is that of the Perfectly Awakened Ones white tuft attribute  The right hand an adamantine st and rests between the eyebrows The mantra of the Tathāgatas rṇā is Namaḥ samantabuddhānāṃ āḥ haṃ jaḥ Dwelling in the yoga of your own deity apply the ve letters To the lower part of the body the navel the heart the top of the head and between the eyebrows manipulate their forms and establish them while in samāhita  By dwelling in accordance with this method you will be identical with the honored one muni The letter A completely golden in color is used to form a vajra circle c These ve kinds of mantrahearts have already been explained in Chapter II In addition these ve verses should be supplemented somewhat with the meaning of the sutra by those who have been ordained so as to elaborate on their wording Your body adorned with ve letters potency is fully accomplished And the blazing torch of great wisdom extinguishes all sinful actions The hosts of the army of the heavenly demon and other obstructors Will see such a person as being resplendent like a vajra Furthermore inside your head place the king of universal illumination with one hundred light rays  And you will establish unsullied eyes brightly shining like lamps  In this manner other mystic seals and mantras of the Perfectly and Fully Awakened One may be used each based on the main sutra Again in accordance with the earlier expedient means you should visualize the lettergateway being transformed into the person of your deity and dwelling in the methods of yoga you should arrange the seed and then recite the mantra a you have received If you abide by this practice of the Tathāgata you will in the king of maṇḍalas Born of the Matrix of Great Compassion obtain consecration as an ācārya and be t for full practice this is not suitable for those who have obtained only the consecration for reciting vidyās As for the procedures of the expedient means of the fourlimbed dhyāna gateway even if the ritual rules explained in other sutras have deciencies you will gain freedom from faults if you practice in accordance with this method Because your deity will rejoice it will increase its awesome power and merit will accrue accordingly Then when you have nished reciting use this method frequently to protect yourself Even though it may not be explained in other sutras you should apply its intent generally and it will cause the practitioner to obtain success quickly Having made offerings he should then singlemindedly clasp his palms together and with adamantine chanting and other sublime words extol the true merits of the Tathāgata Then with all the good that he has performed he redirects it and makes a vow uttering these words It is not that I seek bodhi for my own sake alone As long as I repeat birthanddeath to save beings so that they may similarly obtain allfaceted knowledge I will always cultivate merit and knowledge without engaging in any other actions I pray that we may attain foremost happiness and that the soughtafter siddhis will be all consummated free from any obstacles In addition he thinks further Let me be quickly endowed with various pure and wondrous jewels both internal and external and myself adorned therewith May they continuously and uninterruptedly ow forth everywhere and by reason of this fulll every wish of all beings Thus has it been explained above in brief When practicing more extensively you should do as is explained in Samantabhadras Vow of Practice and other sutras of the Great Vehicle reciting them with resolve Just as buddhas and bodhisattvas aroused vows of great compassion what they themselves had realized so too do I make a vow Next you should offer up argha Form the handclasp of homage place it on top of your head think of the true merits of buddhas and bodhisattvas make obeisance with utmost sincerity and speak these verses In all those who have long been free from all faults whose bodies are adorned with immeasurable merits And who are intent on bringing benet to beings I now take refuge and make obeisance to them all The buddhas here present the worldsaving bodhisattvas And those who have reached the special stage without discontinuing the teachings of the Great Vehicle I but pray that the multitude of holy divinities will acknowledge me with certainty And may each according to their abode later deign to come again out of pity c Then using the samaya mantra and mystic seal you should release the seal on top of your head and engender the thought that all the protection and empowerment has been released With this expedient means the deities earlier invoked each return to their abode otherwise they will be compelled to remain on account of their unequaled great vows Next use the essence of the Dharma realm to empower yourself think of the pure bodhimind and dwell in the person of Vajrasattva The vidyās and seals for this have already been explained in Chapter II When you have nished reciting empower yourself with those three seals and all the gateways to mantra practices having come to an end the rules will have all been fullled Then in accordance with the earlier expedient means you should visualize the letter of the Dharma realm  marking the top of your head with it Don adamantine armor and on account of this secret adornment you will become indestructible like a vajra in nature All those who hear your voice or see or touch you will most certainly be in anuttarā samyaksaṃbodhi with all merits completely accomplished and you will be equal to the Worldhonored One Vairocana with no difference Next arouse thoughts of advancement and practice special deeds In a clean place adorned with fragrant owers rst make yourself into the bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara or dwell in the ownnature of the Tathāgata and following the earlier expedient means empower with a mantra and mystic seal Then with thoughts of a Dharma gift read aloud the Vaipulya scriptures of the Great Vehicle or else recite them in your mind and invite heavenly divinities and so on to listen to them As is said in these verses In the Adamantine Pinnacle Sutra it is taught that Avalokiteśvara lotuseyed Is identical with all buddhas a body of inexhaustible adornments Alternatively use the Guiding Teacher of the world sovereign over all dharmas And taking either of their names perform empowerment with their original nature The seed heart of Avalokiteśvara is Namaḥ samantabuddhānāṃ saḥ The true meaning of lettergateway is that all dharmas are undeled With the enunciation of the sound you should perform such a visualization The appearance of the bodily mystic for this is the socalled lotusower seal Like the seat offered earlierI have already explained it separately Next the mantra of Avalokiteśvara is When what has to be done has been completed next rise from your seat and with a peaceable countenance you should attend to human affairs Then in order to obtain sustenance for your body next go begging for food or else it is obtained either through an invitation by a dānapati or within the sangha You should eschew sh meat smelling vegetables and leftovers from offerings to your deity and the buddhas as well as various scraps that are unclean Nor should you consume any liquor or juices from the fruits of trees which may intoxicate people Next present morsels of food offering them to your deity and perform the food rite as you please If there happen to be any leftovers then put aside a small amount for the relief of the starving and the needy In order to maintain my physical vessel and practice the path in peace I accept these morsels of food just as the linchpin of a cartwheel is greased in order to make it reach the destination without breaking down the seed for this is like the mantra for the letter Vaṃ explained  Then recite the vidyā for bestowing the ten powers eight times and eat the food This vidyā is svāhā Dwelling thus rst accomplish the yoga of your deity When you have nished eating you should offer the leftover food that has been touched to those who deserve to eat it with the mantraheart for accomplishing all deeds You should use the mantra of the holy one Acala infallible and most wrathful You should recite it once and the recipient will rejoice constantly follow the practitioner and think protectively of him hūṃ traṭ hāṃ māṃ Having nished eating rest for a short while and then you should again worship the buddhas and repent of your sins in order to purify your mind Cultivate regular actions in this manner as well as reading the scriptures aloud as before and always dwell thus So too is it in the latter part of the day In the rst watch and nal watch of the night think uninterruptedly of the Great Vehicle On reaching the middle watch of the night don adamantine armor with the actionvajra as before and pay reverence to all the buddhas and great bodhisattvas Then you should make offerings with the mind according to the rules and form this thought Because I seek after the causes and conditions of the most important thing for the sake of all beings I shall sleep for a short while out of solicitude for this body It is not because of craving for the pleasures of sleep First you should arrange your physical posture and lie down on your right side with both feet placed one on top of the other Should your limbs become tired you may turn over as you please without offense In order to make yourself wake up quickly you should always x your mind on something bright Moreover you should not lie down on a bed Next on other days too practice in this manner The mantrin by not neglecting the rules and practicing diligently without interruption gains the designation of one who cultivates bodhisattva practices via the gateway of mantras Because the practitioner is assiduous and never rests the holy ones mystically illuminate his mind whereupon he experiences the establishment of awesome divinity and gains freedom from obstacles In this there are two things that you should not forsake Namely you should not forsake the buddhas and bodhisattvas nor the thought of bringing benet to inexhaustible beings Your mind never wavers in its wish for omniscience and for this reason you will most certainly achieve the appropriate siddhi no such should be considered If it is for maintaining the body bathe at any time to remove grime In a river current and so on according to the ritual instructions and in conjunction with mantras and seals With the heart of the Dharma realm purify the waters and use Acala and Trailokyavijaya as appropriate Protecting the quarters and so on with their mantras and seals and dwell in meditation on the ownnature of your deity Then you should mantrify clean earth three times and constantly engage singlemindedly in right thinking In the ritual for the bodily mystic of the honored one Trailokyavijaya You should use the vewisdom vajra seal for accomplishing deeds Next the mantra of Trailokyavijaya is Having thus bathed and sprinkled for purication and endowed with the samaya  protect parts of your body Think of the inexhaustible multitudes of holy divinities and thrice taking scoops of water offer it to them In order to purify your body and mind and benet others pay reverence to the Tathāgatas and sons born of the Jina And far removed from the differentiation of the three poisons and so on and with your sense organs disciplined betake yourself to the meditation chamber The Dharma without characteristics most profound is unsuitable for those of inferior intelligence In order to cater for them there also exists the teaching of that which has characteristics a The above ritual of worship from the Scripture of the Enlightenment Supernatural Transformations and Empowerment of Mahāvairocana collected by the ācārya ends herewith The transmitter is quite satised with it Moreover out of a desire to reduce its volume duplicated mantras have been deleted they are to be transposed and used  The practitioner should simply combine the meaning of the passages before and after  Enlightenment Supernatural Transformations and Empowerment of Mahāvairocana Prologue  The Occasion for the Teaching Thus have I heard at one time the Buddha was staying in the city of rāvastī in a sublime abode in Prince Jetris Grove together with a gathering of great monks twelve hundred fifty in all They had completely transcended all existence and their perfect demeanor inspired awe in every place they went They followed the Buddha in turning the Wheel of Dharma supremely worthy of what he had bestowed upon them Stern and pure in their adherence to the monastic code they were great exemplars for beings in the three realms of existence To liberate beings they appeared in countless bodies in response to what those beings required and in the future they would rescue other beings who thereby would transcend the burden of their attachment to senseobjects The Arhats leaders were āriputra great in wisdom and MahāMaudgalyāyana MahāKauṣṭhila Pūrṇamaitrāyaṇīputra Subhūti Upaniṣad and others Innumerable Solitary Sages who needed no further  As noted in the introduction this and all other headings and subheadings have been added by the present translators as an aid to understanding  I refers to nanda the Buddha ākyamunis cousin and attendant who recited the Buddhas teachings to the assembly of enlightened disciples after the Buddhas nirvana  The grove was donated to the Buddhas order by Prince Jetri Skt It was part of a park called the Garden of the Benefactor of Orphans and the Childless the park itself was donated to the Buddha by the Buddhist layman Anāthapiṇḍada anāsrava Outflows refers to the flowing out of vital energies toward the objects one perceives including objects of desire See the introduction note  and part  note   PROLOGUE instruction as well as other beings who had only recently made a resolve to attain full awakening also came to the place where the Buddha and the monks were staying It was during the Days of Unburdening at the conclusion of the summer retreat Bodhisattvas from all ten directions were gathered there as well they desired counsel to resolve their doubts All were respectful and obedient to the aweinspiring compassionate ThusCome One as they prepared themselves to understand his hidden meaning Beyond these two outflows and the greatest of the three is the outflow of ignorance which is the source of all afflictions When this outflow is ended the other two are ended also aśaikṣa Ch Those who need no further instruction are the Solitary Sages and the Arhats at the fourth stage as opposed to śaikṣa Ch you xue  Arhats who are at the first three stages and who still need instruction  including nanda who at the outset of the Sutra is at the first stage pu ti  full awakening pravāraṇa the final days of the monastic retreat during the rainy season The references given in parentheses at the end of each passage or paragraph of commentary cite the volume and page number at which the excerpts may be found in the Buddhist Text Translation Societys  edition of this Sutra  THE OCCASION FOR THE TEACHING The ThusCome One having arranged his seat sat quietly and peacefully and then for the sake of everyone assembled there spoke of the profound and mysterious The assembly pure in mind and body learned at that banquet of Dharma what they had not known before The Immortals voice was like the call of the kalaviṅka bird and it could be heard in worlds throughout all ten directions As many Bodhisattvas as there are sandgrains in the Ganges gathered at that place for awakeningwith Mañjuśrī as their leader King Prasenajit on the anniversary day of mourning for his father the late king had arranged a vegetarian feast in the banquet hall of the palace He had invited the Buddha and he welcomed the ThusCome One in person to a meal of savory delicacies He also invited in the great Bodhisattvas Meanwhile in the city elders and other laity had also prepared meals for the Sangha and they stood waiting for the Buddha to come receive their offerings The Buddha directed Mañjuśrī to designate Arhats and Bodhisattvas to accept the pure vegetarian food that the donors were offering Only nanda was late for this assigning of the Sangha Earlier he had traveled for some distance to accept a special invitation and had not yet returned No senior monk was accompanying him as his teacher he was returning on the road alone  Skt So far that day nanda had received no offerings At the appropriate time therefore he took his almsbowl out and as he walked through the town he accepted alms in sequential order While receiving alms from his first to his last donor  he thought to himself that he would accept pure food from everyone not only from Kṣatriyas of honorable family and others from the purer classes but also from Caṇḍālas and others who were considered impure While practicing impartiality and compassion he would not favor the humblest people only he was determined to assist all beings in creating merit beyond measure nanda knew that the ThusCome One the WorldHonored One had admonished the Arhats Subhūti and Mahākāśyapa for being prejudicial on their almsrounds nanda revered the ThusCome Ones instruction let alms be received impartially so that people will not be led to doubt or slander Why did nanda want to practice impartiality and compassion during his almsround Having crossed the city moat nanda walked slowly through the outer gates his manner stern and proper as he followed strictly and respectfully the rules for accepting offerings of pure food Because he was receiving alms sequentially he soon chanced to pass a house of courtesans and there he was waylaid by a powerful artifice Wielding a spell that Kapila had obtained from a god of the Brahma Heavens a young Mātaṅga woman seduced nanda onto her bed Then she caressed him lasciviously until the power of his vows was on the verge of being broken Knowing that nanda was succumbing to the carnal influence of the spell the ThusCome One ended his meal immediately and returned to the monastic grounds The king his senior ministers the elders and the other laity desiring to hear the essentials of the Dharma followed after the Buddha Then from the crown of his head the WorldHonored One poured forth invincible light which was as dazzling as a hundred gems The Buddha akyamuni made appear within that light a Buddha who seated in fulllotus posture on a thousandpetaled sacred lotus proclaimed a spiritually powerful mantra  An ancient Indian sage who was the founder of the Sāṅkhya School  The Brahma Heavens belong to the realm of form and correspond to the level of singleminded meditation known as the first dhyāna See part b I The Nature and Location of the Mind   The Request for Dharma When nanda saw the Buddha he bowed and wept in sorrow He regretted that since time without beginning he had devoted himself to erudition but had not fully developed his practice on the Path Respectfully and repeatedly he asked the Buddha to explain for him the elementary steps that lead to attainment in the wondrous practices of calming the mind contemplative insight and meditation in stillness  practices through which the ThusCome Ones from all ten directions had become fully awakened Meanwhile as many Bodhisattvas as there are sandgrains of the River Ganges along with the great Arhats Solitary Sages and others from the ten directions all eagerly wished to listen They sat down and waited silently to hear instruction from the Sage The Buddha said to nanda You and I are members of the same family and we share the affection that is natural among relatives At the time you first made the resolve to become enlightened what excellent attributes did you see in my Dharma that immediately led you to reject the deep familial affection and conjugal love found in the world nanda said to the Buddha I saw the thirtytwo hallmarks of the ThusCome One which were so supremely wondrous and incomparable that his entire body shone like crystal with an interreflecting radiance I often thought to myself that a body with such hallmarks could not be the consequence of an act of sexual love The energies of desire are coarse and murky Foul and putrid intercourse results in a turbid merging of procreative substances such things as that cannot generate a body with such a wondrous pure magnificent and brilliant concentration of purplegolden light  THE REQUEST FOR DHARMA The Buddha said Excellent nanda All of you should know that since time without beginning all beings have been undergoing death and rebirth over and over simply because they have not been aware of the pure understanding which is the essential nature of the everlasting true mind Instead the workings of their minds are distorted and because the workings of their minds are distorted they are bound to the cycle of death and rebirth Now you all wish to inquire about unsurpassed enlightenment and to discover the truth of your own nature You should answer my questions straightforwardly because that is the path that the ThusCome Ones everywhere throughout the ten directions have taken as they freed themselves from death and rebirth Their minds and their words were straightforward and therefore at every point in their progress from the first stage to the last they were never in the least evasive Now nanda I ask you this when in response to the thirtytwo hallmarks of the ThusCome One you first made the resolve to attain full awakening just what was it that saw those hallmarks and who was it that took delight in them and loved them nanda said to the Buddha WorldHonored One I delighted in them and loved them with my mind and eyes Because I saw with my eyes the excellent hallmarks of the ThusCome One my mind admired and delighted in them In this way I became resolved to extricate myself from death and rebirth The Buddha said to nanda It is as you say your mind and eyes were the reason for your admiration and delight Someone who does not know where his mind and eyes are will not be able to overcome the stress of engagement with perceived objects Consider for example when bandits invade a country and the king sends forth his soldiers to drive them out the soldiers must first know where the bandits are It is the fault of your mind and eyes that you are bound to the cycle of death and rebirth I am now asking you precisely where are your mind and eyes  Ch chen lao  nanda Proposes That the Mind Is in the Body WorldHonored One nanda then said to the Buddha The ten classes of beings in all the worlds believe that the conscious mind dwells in the body and as I regard the bluelotus eyes of the ThusCome One I know that they are part of the Buddhas face It is evident that those physical organs which respond to four kinds of perceived objects are part of my face and so my conscious mind too is surely found within my body The Buddha said to nanda Now as you sit in the Dharma Hall of the ThusCome One you can see Prince Jetris Grove Where is the grove This great and sacred Dharma Hall with its many stories WorldHonored One is in the Garden of the Benefactor of Orphans and the Childless and the Prince Jetris Grove is outside the hall nanda what is the first thing that you see from your place in the hall WorldHonored One here in the hall I am looking first at the ThusCome One I can also see the great assembly then as I gaze out I see the grove in the park Why is it nanda that when you look out you can see the grove in the park WorldHonored One since the doors and windows of this great hall have been thrown open wide I can be in the hall and yet see into the distance The Buddha said to nanda It is as you say Someone in the hall can see far into the grove and park when the doors and windows are open  In part  below the Buddha describes twelve kinds of beings according to the manner of their birth  THE LOCATION OF THE MIND wide Now could that person in the hall not see the Buddha and yet see outside the hall nanda answered It would not be possible WorldHonored One to be in the hall and be able to see the grove and fountains and yet not be able to see the ThusCome One nanda the same is true of you If your mind with its clear understanding were inside your body then the inside of your body would be what your mind would first come into contact with and have knowledge of Are there beings that see the inside of their bodies first before they can observe things outside Even if they could not see their heart liver spleen or stomach they still at least would detect the growing of their nails and hair the twisting of their sinews and the throbbing of their pulse Why then are you not able to see these things And since your mind is definitely not visually cognizant of what is inside your body how can it have knowledge of what is outside your body Thus you can know that when you say the mind that is aware and makes distinctions is inside the body you state what is impossible B nanda Proposes That the Mind Is Outside the Body nanda bowed and said to the Buddha Now that I have listened to the ThusCome One explain the Dharma in this way I realize that my mind must be located outside my body instead Why do I say this For example a lamp lit in a room will certainly illuminate the inside of the room first and then its light will stream through the doorway and reach the recesses of the hall beyond it Since beings do not see inside their bodies but only see outside them it is as if the lamp were placed outside the room so that it cannot shed its light inside the room This principle is perfectly clear and beyond a doubt it conforms to the Buddhas ultimate teaching  and so it cant be wrong can it  According to Buddhist teaching the cognitive faculty acts together with the eyefaculty in the process of visual perception of objects  Here nanda offers a second proposition and he brings forth his own instance  THE NATURE AND LOCATION OF THE MIND The Buddha said to nanda The monks who followed me to rāvastī to receive their alms in sequential order have by now returned to Prince Jetris Grove and they are eating their meal with their fingers I have finished my meal but consider the monks can all of them be full when only one person has eaten nanda answered No WorldHonored One Why not These monks are all Arhats but their physical bodies their own separate lives are distinct How could one person cause everyone to be full The Buddha said to nanda Then if your mind that sees is aware discerns and knows really were outside your body your body and mind would be separate and unrelated to each other The body would not be aware of what the mind has knowledge of and the mind would have no knowledge of what the body is aware of Now as I hold up my hand which is as soft as cotton does your mind distinguish it when your eyes see it nanda said It does WorldHonored One The Buddha told nanda Then if your mind and eyes work together to perceive my hand how can the mind be outside If which is however very similar to the one the Buddha proposed above  THE LOCATION OF THE MIND your awareness were in your body your mind would not have an awareness of it nanda Proposes That the Mind Is in the EyeFaculty nanda said to the Buddha WorldHonored One it is as the Buddha has said Because I do not see inside my body my mind is not located there and because the body and the mind work together and are not separate from each other my mind is not outside my body either Now that I think of it I know just where the mind is The Buddha said Where is it then nanda said Because the mind that discerns and is aware knows nothing of what is inside but can see what is outside I believe upon reflection that the mind is hidden in the eyes  THE NATURE AND LOCATION OF THE MIND The Buddha said to nanda Let us assume the mind is hidden in the eyes as you assert in your instance of the crystals When the person in your example places crystal cups over his eyes and looks at the mountains the rivers and all else on this great earth does he see the crystal cups too He does World Honored One He sees the crystal cups when he places them over his eyes The Buddha said to nanda If in fact your mind can be compared to someones eyes with crystals placed over them then when you look at the world of perceived objects why dont you see your own eyes If you could see your eyes your eyes would be part of your external surroundings But then your mind and eyes could not work together to make distinctions And since you cannot see your eyes why did you say that the mind that is aware and makes distinctions is concealed within the eyefaculty as in the example of the eyes with crystal cups placed on them Know then that when you say the mind that is aware and makes distinctions is concealed in the eyefaculty like eyes with crystal cups placed on them you state what is impossible The Buddha points out that if nanda could see his eyes that would mean that his eyes would be outside of him not part of his body nanda Reconsiders Seeing Inside and Seeing Outside nanda said to the Buddha WorldHonored One I now offer this reconsideration Our viscera are located inside our bodies while our orifices are open to the outside Our viscera lie concealed in darkness but at the orifices there is light Now facing the Buddha with my eyes open I see light Seeing that light I would call seeing outside Seeing darkness when I close my eyes I would call seeing inside How does that idea sound  nanda now proposes in his fourth supposition that what is dark is inside and what is light is outside so that he can return to his first supposition that the mind is located  THE LOCATION OF THE MIND nanda is more intelligent than we are He has one opinion after another The Buddha said to nanda Consider this question then when you close your eyes and see darkness is that darkness in front of your eyes If the darkness is in front of your eyes how can it be inside But if in fact it were inside then if you were in a room that was completely dark because it was not lit by the sun or by the moon or by lamps the darkness in the room would have to be the darkness of your own insides Besides if the darkness were not in front of you how could you see it But suppose you did see inside in a way that is distinct from how you see outside In that case  if we grant that closing your eyes and thus seeing darkness would be to see the inside of your body  then when you open your eyes and see light why dont you see your own face Since you cant see your own face there can be no seeing inside because if you could see your face then your eyes and also your mind that knows and understands would be suspended in the air If your eyes and mind were actually suspended in the air then it would follow that they would not be part of your body If however they were part of your body and yet they were suspended in the air then the Buddha who now sees your face would be part of your body as well Thus when your eyes became aware of something your own body would be unaware of it If you press the point and say the body and the eyes each have a separate awareness then you would have two awarenesses so that you one person would eventually become two Buddhas Therefore you should know that when you say that to see darkness is to see inside you state what is impossible E nanda Proposes That the Mind Comes into Being in Response to Conditions nanda said to the Buddha I have heard the Buddha teach the four assemblies that because a state of mind arises various perceived objects ones eyes and mind Since the face is part of the body the eyes and mind would then have to float in empty space external to the body I am now thinking and that very act of thinking which is an instance of a state of mind arising in response to perceived objects is my minds true nature Thus the mind comes into being by combining with perceived objects wherever they arise It does not exist in just one of the three locations  inside outside and the middle Then the Buddha said to nanda Now you are saying that when perceived objects arise various states of mind arise and therefore that the mind comes into being by combining with those perceived objects wherever they arise But such a mind as this would have no essential nature of its own and so could not combine with anything If having no essential nature of its own it still were able to combine with perceived objects then there would be a nineteenth constituent element of perception because such a mind would be combining with a seventh category of perceived object  and that is impossible The Buddha refutes nandas new proposition as follows But there is no such category of object Furthermore if such a mind did have an essential nature of its own then if you were to pinch yourself where would your mind that has awareness of the pinch be coming from Would it be coming forth from the inside of your body or would it be coming in from outside If it came out from inside then once again you would see the inside of your body If it came in from outside it would see your face first nanda said It is the eyes that see It is the mind and not the eyes that is aware To suppose that the mind sees is not my idea The Buddha said If the eyes could see then by analogy when you were in a room it would be the doorway not you that would see what is outside the room when someone has died with his eyes still intact his eyes would see But how could a dead person see nanda if your mind which is aware and knows and makes distinctions indeed has an essential nature of its own then would it have a single essential nature or multiple essential natures Would this essential nature pervade your body or wouldnt it Suppose it were a single essential nature then if you were to pinch one limb wouldnt you feel that pinch in all four limbs If you did the feeling of the pinch would not be confined to one place And if the feeling of the pinch were confined to one place it would follow that your mind cannot have only one essential nature But if your mind had multiple essential natures you would be many people Which of those essential natures would you be Furthermore if a single essential nature did pervade your body then a single pinch  as in the previous instance  would be felt throughout your body  THE LOCATION OF THE MIND you touched your head and touched your foot at the same moment you would feel the touch on your head but would not feel the touch on your foot Yet that is not what your experience is Therefore you should know that when you say the mind comes into being by combining with perceived objects wherever they arise you state what is impossible F nanda Proposes That the Mind Is in the Middle nanda said to the Buddha WorldHonored One I have also listened when the Buddha was discussing true reality with Mañjuśrī and other disciples of the DharmaKing The WorldHonored One then said that the mind is neither inside the body nor outside of it And so I am now thinking that if the mind were inside it would not see anything and if it were outside its awareness would be separate from the body But since the mind is not aware of what is inside it cannot be inside and since the awareness of the mind is not separate from the body it makes no sense to say the mind is outside Therefore since the minds awareness and the bodys awareness are not separate and since the mind does not see what is inside the mind must be in the middle The Buddha replied You say that it is in the middle Where is this middle of yours If it existed at the surface it would not be in the middle and to be within it would be the same as to be inside it If so is there some indication of that location If there were no indication of its location then the middle would not exist Suppose that someone were to place a marker to indicate the location of a middle Seen from the east it would be in the west seen from the south it would lie to the north Such a marker would not mark a definite middle and in the same way it is unclear what it might mean for the mind to be located in a middle nanda said The middle I speak of is in neither of those places For seeing to occur  as the WorldHonored One has said  the eyes and visible objects are necessary conditions The eyes record visual distinctions the objects that are seen have no awareness Between them eyeconsciousness is produced The mind is there The Buddha said If your mind were located between the eyefaculty and the objects it perceives would the minds essential nature be the same as the essential natures of the eyefaculty and of its objects or would it not If the minds essential nature were the same as the essential natures of the eyefaculty and of its objects it would be a confused combination of what is aware and what is not aware And even if the minds essential nature were not the same as the essential natures either of the eyefaculty or of its objects then the mind would be neither aware nor unaware How then could it be in the middle  In order to clarify his statement in this sixth supposition nanda says that by middle he means between the faculty and its perceived object nanda Proposes That the Mind Has No Specific Location nanda said to the Buddha WorldHonored One when along with MahāMaudgalyāyana Subhūti Pūrṇamaitrāyaṇīputra and āriputra  four of the great disciples  I have listened to the Buddha as he turned the Wheel of Dharma I have often heard him say that the mind that is aware and makes distinctions is not located inside or outside or in the middle it is not located in any one of those places Can what has no specific location be called my mind The aware perceiving mind is not located anywhere at all The Buddha said to nanda You say the mind that is aware and makes distinctions is not located in a specific place However the air the lands the waters and the creatures that fly over them or move on them or in them  all things in fact existing in the world  do have specific locations Then does the mind that you suppose has no specific location exist in some place or else does it exist in no place If it is located nowhere then it is an absurdity  like a turtle with fur or a hare with horns How can you speak of something that does not have a specific location Suppose however things could in fact exist without a definite location Therefore nonattachment implies that something exists and has characteristics and therefore location   The Conditioned Mind and the True Mind Then nanda stood up in the midst of the great assembly He uncovered his right shoulder placed his right knee on the ground put his palms together respectfully and said to the Buddha The Buddha has bestowed his lovingkindness on me as his youngest cousin but now that I have entered the monastic life I have continued to presume upon his kindness and as a result all I have done is to become learned and so I am not yet free of outflows According to the customs of India uncovering the right shoulder is a gesture of respect especially in the Buddhist tradition It represents the purification of the karma of the body Since I could not resist the Kapila spell I was lured into a house of courtesans all because I did not know how to find the realm of true reality I only hope that the WorldHonored One out of pity and great kindness will instruct us in the path of calming the mind will guide people who have no trust in the Dharma and will counteract the wrong tendencies of the uncivilized When he had finished speaking nanda bowed to the ground and with the rest of the great assembly prepared himself with keen anticipation to listen reverently to the teaching At that time an array of lights as dazzling and as brilliant as a hundred thousand suns poured forth from the WorldHonored Ones face Six kinds of quaking shook the lands of the ThusCome Ones and an infinite number of worlds appeared throughout all ten directions all at the same time The Buddhas aweinspiring spiritual power caused all these worlds to merge into a single world and in that world all the great Bodhisattvas  Ch zhen ji  probable Skt bhūtakoṭi  Skt People who undertake a spiritual practice but who fail to realize the ultimate enlightenment  people such as the Hearers of the Teaching and the Solitary Sages as well as celestial beings and others such as demonkings and members of the demons retinues who follow wrong paths  all fail because they do not understand two fundamentals and are mistaken and confused in their practice nanda what are the two fundamentals The first is the mind that is the basis of death and rebirth and that has continued since time without beginning This mind is dependent on perceived objects and it is this mind that you and all beings make use of and that each of you consider to be your own nature The second fundamental is full awakening which also has no beginning it is the original and pure essence of nirvana It is the original understanding the real nature of consciousness They have lost track of this fundamental understanding though it is active in them all day long and because they remain unaware of it they make the mistake of entering the various destinies nanda because you now wish to know about the path of calming the mind and wish to be subject to death and rebirth no longer I will question you again Then the ThusCome One raised his goldenhued arm and bent his five fingers  each of them marked with lines in the shape of a wheel  and he asked nanda Did you see something nanda said I did  The Buddhas Dharmabody which is immanent in all things  THE CONDITIONED MIND AND THE TRUE MIND The Buddha said What did you see nanda said I saw the ThusCome One raise his arm and bend his fingers into a fist that sends forth light dazzling my mind and eyes Why did the Buddha ask about such a simple matter The Buddha said When you saw my fist emit light what did you see it with nanda said All of us in the great assembly saw it with our eyes The Buddha said to nanda You have answered that the ThusCome One bent his fingers into a fist that sent forth light dazzling your mind and eyes Your eyes can see my fist but what do you take to be your mind that was dazzled by it nanda said The ThusCome One has just now been asking me about my minds location and my mind is what I have been using to determine where it might be That is not your mind Startled nanda stood up placed his palms together and said to the Buddha If that is not my mind what is it The Buddha said to nanda It is merely your mental processes that assign false and illusory attributes to the world of perceived objects  That is the internal and external objects of awareness These processes delude you about your true nature and have caused you since time without beginning and in your present life to mistake a burglar for your own child  to lose touch with your own original everlasting mind  and thus you are bound to the cycle of death and rebirth nanda said to the Buddha WorldHonored One I am the Buddhas favorite cousin It was my mind that loved the Buddha and led me to enter the monastic life That mind of mine has been responsible not only for my serving the ThusCome One but also for my serving all Buddhas and all good and wise teachers throughout as many lands as there are sandgrains in the River Ganges It has always been that mind that has marshaled great courage to practice every difficult aspect of the Dharma If I were ever to slander the Dharma and forsake forever my good roots in it that mind of mine would be the cause even of that If this activity of comprehending is not the mind then I have no mind and I am the same as a clod of earth or a piece of wood because nothing exists apart from my minds awareness and its knowledge Why does the ThusCome One say that this is not my mind Now I am genuinely alarmed and frightened neither I nor anyone else here in the great assembly is free of doubt From the Lions Seat he reached out and circled his hand on the crown of nandas head saying to him The ThusCome One has often explained that all phenomena that come into being are nothing more than manifestations of the mind All things that are subject to the principle of cause and effect  from the largest world to the smallest mote of dust  come into being because of the mind If we examine the fundamental nature of each thing in the world nanda down to even the smallest wisps of grass we will see that all have reality Even space has a name and attributes Given that how could the clear wondrous pure mind  the mind that truly understands and is the basic nature of all mental states  itself lack reality But if as you insist that which makes distinctions and is aware of them which knows and understands them is indeed the mind then that mind would necessarily have its own essential nature independent of its involvement with objects  with visible objects sounds odors flavors and objects of touch Yet now as you listen to my Dharma it is due to sounds that you can distinguish my meaning Even if you were to withdraw into a state of quietude in which all seeing hearing awareness of tastes and tactile awareness ceased you still would be making distinctions among the shadowy objects of cognition in your mind  THE NATURE AND LOCATION OF THE MIND In that kind of state you would still be making distinctions among the objects of your mental awareness Perceived objects are not permanent and when that mind ceased to exist such that it had no more reality than a turtle with fur or a hare with horns then your Dharmabody would cease to exist along with it Then who would be left to practice and to perfect patience with the state of mind in which no mental objects arise At that point nanda and the others in the great assembly were utterly dumbfounded The Buddha said to nanda The reason why so many practitioners in the world do not succeed in putting an end to outflows and becoming Arhats  though they may have passed through all nine of the successive stages of samādhi  is that they are attached to distorted mental processes that come into being and then cease to be and they mistake these  Ch jiu zhu xin  Mller lists them as follows That is why even though you have become quite learned you have not become a sage When nanda had heard that he again wept sorrowfully He then bowed to the ground knelt on both knees placed his palms together and said to the Buddha Ever since I followed the Buddha and resolved to enter the monastic life I have relied on the Buddhas aweinspiring spirit I have often thought There is no reason for me to toil at spiritual practice because I just expected that the ThusCome One would graciously transfer some of hissamādhi to me I never realized that in fact he simply could not stand in for me in body or in mind Thus I abandoned my original resolve and though my body has indeed entered the monastic life my mind has not entered the Path WorldHonored One we all are bound by two obstructions and as a consequence we are unaware of the mind that is everlasting and still I only hope the ThusCome One will take pity on us who are destitute and homeless will disclose the wondrous mind that truly understands and will open our eyes to the Path purpose of grasping its nature by analysis drifts to other objects a reaction occurs and the mind instantly returns to its work  The mind ceases to grasp the nature of things by analysis  THE NATURE AND LOCATION OF THE MIND Then the ThusCome One poured forth resplendent light from the symbol of purity on his chest The brilliant light radiant with hundreds of thousands of colors shone all throughout the ten directions simultaneously to illuminate Buddhalands as many as motes of dust and it shone upon the crowns of the heads of the ThusCome Ones in every one of those radiant Buddhalands Then the light returned to shine upon the great assembly  upon nanda and all the others Earlier in the Sutra the Buddha emitted light from his face  a blazing light as brilliant as a hundred thousand suns Thereupon the Buddha said to nanda I now will raise for all of you a great Dharmabanner so that all beings in all ten directions can gain access to what is wondrous subtle and hidden  the pure and luminous mind that understands  and so that they can open their clearseeing eyes  Skt II The Nature of Visual Awareness   It Is the Mind That Sees nanda a moment ago you said you saw my fist send forth light What caused my fist to send forth light How did I make the fist And what were you seeing it with nanda replied The Buddhas body is the color of crimsontinted gold from the River Jambu His body is like a mountain of precious stones It sends forth light because it is born of purity With my own eyes I saw his hand when he held it up for us and made a fist by curling his wheelimprinted fingers The Buddha said to nanda Now the ThusCome One will demonstrate a truth for you Following the wise who use analogies as aids to understanding nanda let us use my fist as an analogy Without a hand I couldnt make a fist Without your eyes would you be able to see Are these two situations similar nanda replied They are WorldHonored One because without my eyes I couldnt see Therefore the ThusCome Ones making a fist can be compared to my using my eyes The Buddha said to nanda You say they are comparable however they are not A person with no hands will never make a fist But one whose eyes do not function will not be entirely unable to see If you asked a blind man on the street Do you see anything he would no doubt reply All that I see in front of me is darkness  nothing more Reflect upon what that might mean Although the blind man sees only darkness his visual awareness is itself intact nanda replied Its true that all a blind man sees before his eyes is darkness but can that really be what we call seeing The Buddha said to nanda Is there any difference between the darkness seen by the one who is blind and the darkness seen by sighted people when they are in a completely darkened room  The lines on a Buddhas fingertips his palms and the soles of his feet form the shape of wheels  THE NATURE OF VISUAL AWARENESS No WorldHonored One there is no difference between the darkness seen by sighted people in a completely dark room and the darkness seen by the blind Then suppose nanda that the blind person who has been seeing only darkness now sees before him a variety of objects because suddenly he has regained his sight Therefore when a sighted person who has been seeing only darkness in the darkened room now sees before him a variety of objects because someone has suddenly lit a lamp youd have to say by analogy that it is the lamp that sees Now if a lamp could see it would no longer be what we would call a lamp Moreover if it were the lamp that sees what would that have to do with that sighted person Thus you should know that in the analogy the lamplight simply reveals visible objects it is the eyes that see not the lamp In actuality the eyes themselves simply reveal visible objects it is the mind that sees not the eyes   Visual Awareness Does Not Move nanda and the others in the great assembly had not understood what they had heard and so were silent But they hoped that they would hear the ThusCome One continue to proclaim the teaching Putting their palms together they cleared their minds and waited for the Buddha to compassionately instruct them Why did they put their palms together Then the WorldHonored One stretched forth his arm and opened his shining cottonsoft finely webbed hand revealing the wheelshaped lines on his fingers To instruct nanda and the others in the great assembly he said After my awakening I went to the Deer Park where for jñātakauṇḍinyas sake and for the other four monks and also for all of you in the four assemblies I said that beings in their multitudes have not become Arhats nor have they become fully awake because they are confused by afflictions that are like visitors and like dust What in particular at that time caused the five of you to awaken and become sages Then jñātakauṇḍinya stood up and said respectfully to the Buddha Of all the elders here in this great assembly I was the one who was given the name Ajñāta meaning one who understands because I had come to realize what visitor and dust signify It was in this way that I became a sage After becoming fully awakened the Buddha went to the Deer Park where he taught these five ascetics they were awakened by his teaching and became his first disciples  THE NATURE OF VISUAL AWARENESS WorldHonored One suppose a visitor stops at an inn for a night or for a meal Once his stay is ended or the meal is finished he packs his bags and goes on his way Hes not at leisure to remain But if he were the innkeeper he would not leave By considering this example of the visitor the one who comes and goes and the innkeeper the one who remains I understood what the visitor signifies Then a beam of pure light from the rising sun may shine through a crack in a door to reveal some motes of dust obscuring the air The dust moves but the air is still Thus by consideration of this example  the dust which as it moves obscures the air and the air which itself remains still  I understood what the dust may signify Thereupon the ThusCome One before the assembly made a fist with his wheellined fingers and having made the fist he opened his hand again Once his hand was open he made the fist again and said to nanda What did you see just now nanda said I saw the ThusCome One before the assembly open and close his hand over his resplendent wheellined palm The Buddha said to nanda You saw me here before the assembly open and close my hand Was it my hand that opened and closed or did  VISUAL AWARENESS DOES NOT MOVE your visual awareness open and close nanda said It was the WorldHonored Ones resplendent hand that opened and closed before the assembly Although I saw his hand open and close my visual awareness neither opened nor closed The Buddha said What moved and what was still nanda said The Buddhas hand moved but my awareness is beyond even stillness how could it have moved The Buddha replied So it is Then from his wheellined palm the Buddha sent forth a ray of resplendent light that flew past nanda to his right The Buddha said to nanda Why did you turn your head just now nanda said I saw the ThusCome One send forth a wondrous ray of shining light which flew past me on my right then another ray flew past me on my left My head moved as I looked to the right and to the left nanda when you glanced at the Buddhas light and moved your head to the right and left was it in fact your head that moved or else was it your visual awareness that moved WorldHonored One it was my head that moved The nature of my visual awareness is beyond even stillness how then could it have moved The Buddha said So it is Stillness comes from movement Then the ThusCome One told everyone in the assembly All beings need to understand that whatever moves is like the dust and like a visitor does not remain Just now you saw that it was nandas head  THE NATURE OF VISUAL AWARENESS that moved while his visual awareness did not move It was my hand that opened and closed while his awareness did not open or close How can you take what moves to be your body and its environment since they come into being and perish in every successive thought   Visual Awareness Does Not Perish Then King Prasenajit stood up and said to the Buddha Before I was instructed by the Buddha I met Kātyāyana and Vairāṭiputra Both of them said that after this body dies we cease to exist and become nothing That very nothingness itself is what they called nirvana Now though I have met the Buddha I still have doubts that make me cautious How can I come to realize the true and fundamental mind that neither comes into being nor perishes All in this great assembly who have outflows wish to hear the answer The Buddha said to the king May I ask is your body as indestructible as vajra or is it subject to decay WorldHonored One this body of mine will keep on changing till in the end it will perish The Buddha said Your Majesty you have not perished yet How is it that you know you will perish WorldHonored One my body is impermanent and subject to decay although it has not perished yet But now upon reflection I can see that each one of my thoughts just fades away followed by a new thought which also does not last like fire turning into ash constantly dying away forever perishing By this I am convinced that my body too must perish The Buddha said So it is Your Majesty you are in your declining years How do you look now compared to when you were a boy WorldHonored One when I was a child my skin was fresh and smooth and I was full of vital energy when in my prime But now in my later years as old age presses upon me my body has withered and is weary My vital spirits are dulled my hair is white my skin is wrinkled Not much time remains for me The Buddha said Your Majesty your bodys appearance cannot have deteriorated suddenly The king replied WorldHonored One the change has in fact been so subtle that I have hardly been aware of it Thus when I was in my twenties I was still young but I already looked older than I did when I was ten My thirties marked a further decline from my twenties and now at two years past sixty I look back on my fifties as a time of strength and health WorldHonored One as I observe these subtle transformations I realize now that the changes wrought by this descent toward death are evident not only from decade to decade they can also be discerned in smaller increments Considering more closely one can see that changes happen year by year as well as by the decade In fact how could they happen merely year by year Such changes happen every month And how could they occur from month to month only These changes happen day by day And if one contemplates this deeply one can see that there is ceaseless change from moment to moment in each successive thought Thus I can know that my body will keep on changing till it perishes The Buddha said to the king Observing these changes  these neverceasing transformations  you know that you must perish But do you also know that when you perish something in you does not perish with you Putting his palms together King Prasenajit replied to the Buddha Indeed I do not know The Buddha said I now will reveal to you what it is that does not come into being and does not perish Your Majesty when you first saw the River Ganges how old were you  Skt  the nature of visual awareness The king replied I was three when my beloved mother took me to pay respects to the goddess Jīva When we went past a river I knew that it was the Ganges The Buddha said Your Majesty you said that when you were in your twenties you had already aged compared to when you were ten Year after year month after month day after day in each successive thought there have been changes till you have reached your sixties Consider though when you were three years old you saw the river ten years later when you were thirteen what was the river like The king replied It looked the same when I was thirteen as it did when I was three and even now when I am sixtytwo it is still the same The Buddha said Now you are mournful that your hair is white and your face is wrinkled Your face is certainly more wrinkled than it was when you were in your youth But when you look at the Ganges is your visual awareness any different from your visual awareness as it was when you saw the river in your boyhood The king replied No different WorldHonored One The Buddha said Your Majesty your face is wrinkled but the essential nature of your visual awareness itself has not wrinkled What does not wrinkle does not change What changes will perish But what does not change neither comes into being nor perishes Then how could it be affected by your being born and dying that when this body dies you cease to exist The king believed the words that he had heard and he understood that when we leave this body we go on to another He and all the others in the great assembly were elated at having gained a new understanding   The True Nature of Visual Awareness Is Not Lost nanda then stood up bowed to the Buddha knelt put his palms together and said to the Buddha WorldHonored One if our visual awareness and our awareness of sounds too indeed do not come into being and do not perish why then did the WorldHonored One say that we have lost track of our true nature and our actions are deluded  as if we were upsidedown and not rightsideup I hope the WorldHonored One out of kindness will clear away the dust of our delusions At that time bending his goldenhued arm so that his wheellined fingers pointed downward the ThusCome One said to nanda Here you see my hand as it forms a mudra Is it upsidedown or is it upright nanda said Ordinary people would take it to be upsidedown I myself do not know what may be called upright and what is upsidedown The Buddha said to nanda If ordinary people would take this to be upsidedown what then would people consider to be upright nanda said They would call it upright if the ThusCome One raised his arm so that his hand which is as soft as cotton was pointing upward in the air Then the Buddha raised his arm and said to nanda And if in the same way we compare the bodies of ordinary people to the pure Dharmabody of the ThusCome One we might describe the Dharmabody of the ThusCome One as endowed with right and allencompassing knowledge and ordinary peoples bodies as upsidedown Where exactly might the characteristic upsidedown be found At this point nanda and the others in the great assembly were dazed They stared unblinking at the Buddha They did not know where in their minds and bodies the characteristic upsidedown might be The Buddha out of kindness took pity on nanda and on everyone else assembled there He spoke to them in a voice that swept over them like the oceantide All you good people I have often said that all phenomena with physical form all phenomena of mind the conditions under which they arise as well as the phenomena that interact with the mind and all other conditioned phenomena are mere manifestations of true mind Your bodies and your minds appear within the wondrous light of the true essence of that wondrous mind How is it that you all have lost track of the wondrous nature of the fundamental marvelously perfect wondrously understanding and resplendent mind so that your understanding of it is confused Once we take this initial confusion to be the mind we are committed to the delusion that the mind is inside the physical body What you do not know is that the true wondrous luminously understanding mind contains the body and everything outside the body  mountains rivers sky the entire world You are like someone who fails to see a boundless ocean a hundred thousand miles across and is aware only of a single floating bubble Within your confusion you are confused further just as you were about my lowered arm The ThusCome One says you are to be pitied Most people think the mind is within the body  This very brief summary of how the world comes into being foreshadows a more detailed explanation given below in part    Visual Awareness Is Not Dependent upon Conditions Clasping his hands nanda wept mindful that the Buddha had compassionately rescued him and had bestowed upon him a profound teaching He said respectfully to the Buddha Having heard the Buddha speak these marvelous words I comprehend that my wondrously understanding mind is perfect at its source and that it is the everlasting ground of my mind I understand the Dharma that the Buddha has just spoken I see that I have been revering the Buddha with my conditioned mind But because I have only just now learned about my wondrously understanding mind I do not dare as yet to accept it as my minds fundamental ground May the Buddha in his allpervading voice compassionately give further instruction about this in order to uproot my doubts and bring me back to the supreme Path The Buddha said to nanda You and others like you still listen to the Dharma with conditioned minds and therefore you fail to understand its real nature Consider this example suppose someone is pointing to the moon to show it to another person That other person guided by the pointing finger should now look at the moon But if he looks instead at the finger taking it to be the moon not only does he fail to see the moon but he is mistaken too about the finger He has confused the finger with which someone is pointing to the moon with the moon which is being pointed to Moreover his mistake about the finger shows he has failed to distinguish light from dark in that he has confused what is dark  the finger  with what is light  the moon The person in the example doesnt recognize either the finger or the moon for what they are and so they seem lost although they are still there If you understand your mind to be what makes distinctions when you hear me speak about the Dharma then that mind of yours would necessarily exist on its own apart from my speaking which it is making distinctions about By analogy a traveler who stops at an inn may stay for a night he then goes on his way He does not live there all the time unlike the innkeeper who as the host does not go anywhere In the same way if what makes distinctions when you hear me speak were truly your mind then it would not go anywhere And the mind that makes distinctions about my voice also makes distinctions about my appearance What makes distinctions about visible objects cannot do so independently of the visible objects it distinguishes Your mind that makes distinctions does not exist independently of the objects that it distinguishes And when the making of distinctions ceases such that neither space nor objects are distinguished  the state that Maskari Gośālīputra and the others wrongly call the truth of the unmanifested nature  even then your mind does not have a distinctionmaking nature that exists independent of objects of mind Thus each of your mental states is dependent on something else They are not like the host of an inn nanda said If each of my mental states is dependent on something else then is the fundamental wondrously understanding mind of which the ThusCome One speaks also dependent on something else I only hope that the Buddha will take pity on us and explain  Skt puruṣa  THE NATURE OF VISUAL AWARENESS The Buddha said to nanda As you see me now the fundamental luminous essence of visual awareness is not the wondrous essential understanding mind nevertheless it can be compared to a second moon rather than to a reflection of the moon Listen attentively I will now show you what does not depend on anything This great lecture hall nanda opens to the east Thus when the sun rises the hall is flooded with light But the hall is in darkness in the middle of the night if the moon has not risen or if the sky is obscured by clouds or fog Further one can see out through cracks in the doors and shutters but the walls and roof block the view nanda you have all observed how aspects of these phenomena will change What are the conditions necessary to these changing phenomena nanda The sun is a necessary condition for sunlight since there can be no sunlight without the sun Therefore the sunlight is dependent upon the sun which is a necessary condition for its presence The moons absence is a necessary condition for the darkness in the hall The walls and roof are necessary conditions for the view being blocked Distinguishing the various objects is a necessary condition for observing how they are related to one another The absence of objects is a necessary condition for seeing only space Mists and clouds of dust are necessary conditions for obscuring or distorting our visual awareness of objects And every act of seeing the changing phenomena of this world belongs to one of these types Consider these eight types What would you say is the necessary condition for the presence of the understanding nature that is the essence of your visual awareness If the presence of light is a necessary condition for your visual awareness then when light is absent so that it is completely dark you would not be able to see the darkness which in fact you do see Your mind makes distinctions about light and darkness and the other phenomena but the essence of your visual awareness does not make these distinctions Clearly then the mind that experiences these conditioned phenomena is not what is fundamentally you But what is not these conditioned phenomena must be what is fundamentally you What stays with you and does not go anywhere else what is not dependent on anyone or anything else  if that is not you who is it Know then that your mind is fundamentally wondrous luminous and pure You have confused yourself and have lost track of what is fundamental Constantly drifting and drowning you have become submerged in the sea of death and rebirth That is why the ThusCome One says you are to be pitied  As the Buddha demonstrated in part  with the instance of the blind man in the street   Visual Awareness Is Not a Perceived Object nanda said Now I recognize that the nature of my visual awareness is that it does not depend on anything else But how can I come to know that it is my true nature The Buddha said to nanda I will continue to question you Aided by the Buddhas wondrous power you can now see clearly all the way to the heavens of the first dhyāna You do not yet have the purity of freedom from outflows but Aniruddha who is free of outflows sees the entirety of Jambudvīpa as plainly as one might see an amala fruit placed in the palm of ones hand Bodhisattvas at their various stages can see hundreds of thousands of worlds and more and there is not one of the infinite numbers of Pure Lands that the ThusCome Ones in the ten directions do not see Compared to the Buddha we truly fall short nanda you and I can now see the palaces where the Four Celestial Kings reside Between there and here we can see forms and shapes that move on land in the water and through the air in light and in shade All these are perceived objects that you can distinguish as solid and among them you should be able to distinguish what is you and what is not you I am now asking you to choose from all that lies within your visual awareness what is essentially you and what are perceived objects If you  VISUAL AWARENESS IS NOT A PERCEIVED OBJECT employ the power of your vision to its fullest extent nanda you will be able to see as far as the Sun Palace and Moon Palace Carefully observe everything as far as the seven circular ranges of golden mountains everything that you will see even the various sources of light will be an object it will not be you Again step by step observe the clouds in motion the birds in flight the wind blowing the dust rising the trees the mountains the rivers the plants the people and the animals All are objects of your perception None of them is you nanda all these perceived objects near and far have their own distinctive nature nevertheless all are seen within the purity of the essence of your visual awareness Each kind of object is distinguished as different from the others but there are no such distinctions in the wondrous understanding of the essence of your visual awareness This visual awareness is in fact the pure and wondrous understanding mind If visual awareness were a perceived object then would you not be able to see my visual awareness as an object You may argue that you do  THE NATURE OF VISUAL AWARENESS see my visual awareness at the moment when we are both looking at the same thing But when I am no longer looking at that thing then would you still see my visual awareness It isnt a thing and so you cant see it If it is not looking at something then it cannot be identified with the object it is no longer looking at   VISUAL AWARENESS IS NOT A PERCEIVED OBJECT Otherwise when you see an object the object would see you as well If visual awareness and its objects were intermixed like that you and I and everything else in the world would be immersed in chaos But nanda when you are aware of something it is you not I who are aware of it Why do you doubt that it is your true nature Why dont you accept it as genuine and instead ask me what is true  The Buddha extends his argument by pointing out that if our visual awareness were identified with the objects that it sees then those objects would themselves become aware   Visual Awareness Has Neither Shape Nor Extension nanda then said respectfully to the Buddha WorldHonored One I accept that my visual awareness with its capacity to understand cannot be other than mine The ThusCome One and I are looking now at the halls of the Four Celestial Kings which are adorned and resplendent with superb treasures our glance has lingered on the Sun Palace and Moon Palace and then our visual awareness has extended to fill the entire Sahā world However when we return our gaze to this pure hall and look upon this sanctuary only we do not see beyond the roof and the walls First it extended throughout a world now it is confined to this one room we are in Did our awareness contract to fit into the room or did the walls and ceiling divide our awareness up enclosing part of it and leaving the rest outside At this point I dont know which one of these alternatives is right I hope that the WorldHonored One will bestow his great kindness upon us and will explain this point to us A balloon is big when it is filled with air but when the air is released it becomes small The Buddha said to nanda Everything visible in the world  whether large or small whether inside this hall or outside of it whatever kind of thing it is  may be an object of our visual awareness Do not say your awareness itself expands and contracts  VISUAL AWARENESS HAS NEITHER SHAPE NOR EXTENSION Let us consider an example suppose you are looking at the space inside a square box Let me ask you is the space you see inside the box fixed there in a cubical shape or is it not If it is then if it were transferred into a round box it would not become round If on the other hand it is not fixed in a cubical shape then there cant have been a cube of space in the box in the first place You said that you dont know which one of your alternatives is right What you said about the nature of visual awareness can be compared to what I said about the space in the square box Do you want to say the space in the boxes is neither square nor round Simply remove the boxes and youll see that the remaining space indeed has neither shape You cant say that when the boxes are removed you would still be able to remove a cube or a sphere of space Besides suppose your visual awareness does contract when you enter a room as you suggest Then why when you look up at the sun does your awareness not expand till it reaches the suns surface Suppose again your visual awareness does divide when walls and ceilings are interposed then why if someone drills a hole through one of the walls will there be no evidence of a linkage created as your divided awareness expands through the hole to reconnect itself These ideas of yours cannot be right From time without beginning all beings have mistakenly identified themselves with what they are aware of Controlled by their experience of perceived objects they lose track of their fundamental minds In this state they perceive visual awareness as large or small Then all the lands in the ten directions are contained within the tip of a fine hair  By bodies and minds the Buddha here refers to the Dharmabody and the enlightened mind   Visual Awareness Is Both Separate and Not Separate from Objects nanda said respectfully to the Buddha WorldHonored One granted that my visual awareness is indeed my wonderful true nature then this wonderful nature must be what appears before me But if my visual awareness is in fact really my true nature what is the mind that I experience in my body The mind that I experience in my body is able to make distinctions whereas my visual awareness does not make distinctions even about my own body But if my visual awareness is really my mind and is what causes me to see then the essential nature of this visual awareness is what is truly me and so my body is not me Is not my objection though the same as the objection that the ThusCome One made previously namely that perceived objects cannot see me Bestow upon us your great kindness and explain this to us who have not yet awakened It can be said that nanda is confused but it can also be said that he is not confused The Buddha said to nanda What you have just said  that your visual awareness is in front of you  is not correct If it were actually in front of you you would see it In that case your visual awareness would have a location which you could point to easily As you and I are seated in Prince Jetris Grove we can see the Dharma hall with trees and streams around it and beyond them the River Ganges  nandas argument here is that if his visual awareness is in front of him it should be able to see him and it should also itself be a perceived object yet objects as objects lack sentience and therefore cannot see  VISUAL AWARENESS IS BOTH SEPARATE AND NOT SEPARATE FROM OBJECTS and both the sun and the moon above us Now you and I from here at the Lions Seat could point to all these things the shade cast by the trees the shining sun the walls that block our view the trees themselves the other plants the space through which we see these things some of them large some as small as strands of hair  all are distinct from one another but as long as they are visible you can point to them If your visual awareness were indeed in front of you then as you point to these things you would be able to indicate which one of them is your awareness if your awareness were identical with space how could space still be space If your awareness were all these objects how could they still be objects Can you reveal by means of a minute analysis of these many objects the source that is the essential pure wondrously understanding awareness Can you point it out to me in the same way that with clarity and certainty you can point out these objects nanda said Looking from this manystoried Dharma hall as far as the distant Ganges and as far as the sun and the moon I can point out all the things that my eyes observe and all of them are perceived objects None is my visual awareness WorldHonored One it is as the Buddha said Neither I nor any other Arhat who is at the first stage and still has outflows nor even a Bodhisattva could analyze the myriad objects and show us a visual awareness with a nature of its own that is distinct from all the objects The Buddha said So it is So it is The Buddha continued saying to nanda It is as you said Our visual awareness does not have a nature of its own that is distinct from the myriad things Thus your awareness is not something you can point out I will explain this to you again As you and I are seated here looking at Prince Jetris Grove let us look once more at the trees and garden and as far as the sun and moon It is clear that not one of all the many different sights that you can point to is your visual awareness But let us continue to explore this are any of these things separate from your visual awareness nanda said In fact I do not think that anything I see as I look around Prince Jetris Grove is separate from my awareness If the  THE NATURE OF VISUAL AWARENESS trees were separate from my awareness how could I be seeing them But if the trees were identical to my awareness how could they still be trees The same is true of every other perceived object and of space as well If space were separate from my awareness how could I be seeing it But if it were identical to my awareness how could it still be space Having reexamined this  having considered in detail the myriad sights around us I realize that not even the smallest of them is separate from my awareness The Buddha said So it is So it is The Buddhas words stunned everyone in the assembly who still needed instruction None of them had understood his meaning Having lost what they had been relying on they were distressed and fearful The ThusCome One took pity on them knowing that their spirits were anxious and troubled and he said in order to console nanda and the others in the great assembly Good people the king of highest Dharma has been telling you the truth He explains reality just as it is He does not deceive or lie What he has expounded for you is different from the four theories concerning what is everlasting propounded by Maskari Gośālīputra and the others Consider this carefully in earnestly seeking instruction be worthy of my sympathy Then Mañjuśrī Prince of Dharma taking pity on the four assemblies stood up amidst the gathering Having bowed at the Buddhas feet he put his palms together in respect and said to the Buddha WorldHonored One the great assembly has not understood the two disclosures that the ThusCome One has made first that the essence of our visual awareness and visible objects and space as well are identical and second that they are not identical WorldHonored One if our visual awareness were identical to the conditions before us  space and visible objects  then we should be able to point to our awareness just as we can point to visible objects and to space But if our awareness were separate from visible objects and from space we would not be able to observe them People in the assembly are alarmed because they do not understand the basis of this argument it is not that their roots in the Dharma from their previous lives are shallow  THE NATURE OF VISUAL AWARENESS The Buddha said to Mañjuśrī and to the rest of the great assembly To the ThusCome Ones of the ten directions and to the Great Bodhisattvas who dwell in samādhi visual awareness and visible objects and objects of mind as well are like elaborate mirages that appear in space They have no real existence of their own Fundamentally visual awareness and all its conditioned objects are the pure wondrously understanding enlightenment itself In enlightenment how could there be identity or a lack of it Mañjuśrī I now ask you you are Mañjuśrī is there a Mañjuśrī about whom one can say That is Mañjuśrī The true mind is not in the realm of opposites If there were there would be two Mañjuśrīs Nor is it the case that there is no such Mañjuśrī In fact neither the affirmation nor the denial of the statement That is Mañjuśrī is true The Buddha said The same is true of the wondrously understanding essence of our visual awareness and also of the objects we observe and of space All are the wondrously understanding supreme enlightenment  the pure perfect true mind Similarly in the analogy of the second moon which moon is the one about which one can say That is the moon and which one is not in fact the moon  VISUAL AWARENESS IS BOTH SEPARATE AND NOT SEPARATE FROM OBJECTS can neither affirm nor deny the statement That is the moon Therefore all your various interpretations of visual awareness and visible objects are nothing but delusion and in the midst of delusion one cannot avoid thinking That is and That is not Only from within the true essential wondrously understanding awakened mind can one escape the error of trying to point to what is and what is not   Visual Awareness Arises Neither on Its Own nor from Causes WorldHonored One nanda said respectfully to the Buddha It truly is as the DharmaKing has said Our enlightened nature can be involved with things throughout all ten directions and yet it remains clear and still It is eternally present It neither comes into being nor ceases to be But how does what the Buddha has said in this regard differ from the truth of the unmanifested nature as taught by the Brahmin Kapila or from the true self as taught by the ascetics who smear ashes on themselves or by others who are not on the right path Also on Mount Laṅkā the WorldHonored One explained this principle to the Bodhisattva Mahāmati and to others and he said then that those who are not on the right path are always speaking of things existing in and of themselves whereas the Buddha speaks of something else But as I see it now the enlightened nature exists in and of itself it neither comes into being nor ceases to be it far transcends all that is distorted and unreal ziran xing   VISUAL AWARENESS ARISES NEITHER ON ITS OWN NOR FROM CAUSES The Buddha said to nanda Just now by various means I have explained this to you in order that the truth would be made clear to you But you have not understood and you mistakenly suppose that the enlightened nature exists in and of itself nanda if the enlightened nature indeed exists in and of itself as you say then you should be able to discern what it essentially consists of Consider your wondrously understanding visual awareness what about it exists in and of itself Does it consist of light that exists in and of itself Does it consist of darkness that exists in and of itself Does it consist of space that exists in and of itself Does it consist of solid objects that exist in and of themselves If it consisted of light that existed in and of itself nanda you would not be able to see when it is dark If it consisted of space that existed in and of itself you would not be able to see solid objects In the same way if it consisted of darkness that existed in and of itself the essential nature of your visual awareness would cease to exist and so you would not be able to see when it is light nanda said It must be then that the wondrously understanding nature of this visual awareness does not exist in and of itself after all It now seems to me that it comes into being due to causes and conditions But I do not understand this clearly yet May I inquire of the ThusCome One how this idea fits with the Buddhas teachings about causes and conditions The Buddha said You are saying that the luminous nature of visual awareness comes into being from causes and conditions I ask you to consider then what is the primary cause of your being aware of what you see before you Is darkness the primary cause nanda if light were the cause of your being aware of what you see before you you could not see when it is dark If darkness were the cause you could not see when it is light Moreover nanda is light or darkness a condition of your being aware of what you see before you Are objects conditions Is space a condition If space were a condition of your being aware of what you see  THE NATURE OF VISUAL AWARENESS before you nanda then you could not see solid objects If solid objects were a condition of your being aware of what you see before you you would be unable to perceive space And what is true of space and solid objects as conditions is equally true of light and darkness as conditions Therefore you should understand that the existence of the essential wondrously understanding enlightened visual awareness is not dependent for its existence on causes and conditions nor does it exist in and of itself Nevertheless one cannot say that it does not exist in and of itself nor can one say that it is independent of causes and conditions In making all these distinctions why have you resorted to terms used in the reckless fabrications of worldly discourse You might as well try to seize a handful of space However much you weary yourself in the attempt space will forever elude your grasp   True Visual Awareness nanda said to the Buddha WorldHonored One if the wondrous enlightened nature is indeed not dependent on causes and conditions why then has the Buddha often taught the monks that our visual awareness requires four conditions to be present space light mind and the eyefaculty What did you mean then The Buddha said nanda what I have said about causes and conditions as they function in the world is not an ultimate truth I have another question for you nanda When ordinary people say I see or I do not see what do they mean by seeing and not seeing nanda said Relying on the light of the sun of the moon or of lamps ordinary people can see various objects That is what they mean by seeing Without at least one of these three sources of light they would not be able to see nanda if people cannot see when light is absent they would have no visual awareness of total darkness Further if their inability to see light when they are in total darkness indeed means they cannot see when it is dark then conversely their inability to see darkness when it is light must also mean that they cannot see when it is light since the cases are parallel and both involve instances of not seeing Light and darkness are mutually exclusive still regardless of which one is present your visual awareness does not lapse for an instant Therefore you should understand that in both cases there is seeing How can you say that there is not You should understand then that when people see light their awareness of it does not come into being because of the light  THE NATURE OF VISUAL AWARENESS of the darkness When people see space their awareness of it does not come into being because of the space and when people see solid objects their awareness of them does not come into being because of the solid objects Now that we have arrived at the conclusion that visual awareness does not come into being because of any of these four you should also understand that when you are able to use your true awareness to be aware of the essence of your visual awareness you will know that your true awareness is not the same as the essence of your awareness The essence of awareness is not the equal of true awareness How can you still be speaking of the attributes of causes and conditions and of things existing in and of themselves or even coming into being from inhering or combining You Hearers of the Teaching are deficient in knowledge your views are narrow and your attainment limited Because you have not yet been able to break through to true reality in its purity I will now instruct you further Consider well what I say Do not become weary and lose heart on the road to the wonder of full awakening To break through here means to understand   Distortions in Visual Awareness Based on Karma nanda said to the Buddha The WorldHonored One has elucidated the teaching concerning causes and conditions and concerning the existence of things in and of themselves but we have not yet understood the teaching about inhering and conjoining and not inhering or conjoining And now when we hear further that the essence of visual awareness of which the true awareness is aware is not the same as the true awareness another layer has been added to our confusion and distress It is my humble wish that with his great kindness the Buddha will open our Wisdomeye and reveal the enlightened mind in all its purity With these words he wept sorrowfully bowed and waited to receive the Sages instructions Then the WorldHonored One took pity on nanda and on the others in the great assembly He wished to make clear to them the wondrous path of practice that would lead them all to the samādhi of the Great Dhāraṇī  He said to nanda You have a keen memory but it serves only to increase your erudition You have not yet understood the practice of calming the mind from which subtle insight arises Listen carefully as I give instruction point by point for your sake and also for the sake of all in the future who have outflows so that they may attain full awakening All beings are bound to the cycle of saṃsāra nanda due to the false distinctions made by two kinds of distorted awareness Wherever these two kinds of awarenesses arise beings undergo the karma of the cycle What are these two kinds of distorted awareness The first is the distorted awareness based on the karma of individual beings the second is the distorted awareness based on the karma beings share The cycle of death and rebirth keeps on turning under the power of two kinds of distorted awareness which result when the conscious mind makes false distinctions Let us consider the example of a person with an eye disease At night when he looks at a lamp it seems to him that circular bands of light surround the lamp with the entire spectrum of colors What do you think Are the circles of colored light that appear around the lamp at night an aspect of the lamplight or an aspect of his own visual awareness If the circles of colored light were an aspect of the lamplight nanda wouldnt they be seen by other people besides the person with the eye disease instead of being visible only to him On the other hand if the circles of colored light were an aspect of the persons visual awareness wouldnt his awareness itself be colored If that were the case what kind of thing would this colored awareness be Individual karma is what makes you different from other people  THE NATURE OF VISUAL AWARENESS Further nanda if the circles of colored light were not an aspect of the lamplight then when the person with the diseased eyes glanced around him at a screen a curtain a table or a sleeping mat he would see the colored circles surrounding them as well And if the circles of colored light were not an aspect of his visual awareness he would not see the circles at all Why then does he in fact see them Therefore you should know that although the colors are in fact intrinsic to the lamplight the illusory circles of colored light arise from the disease in his eyes However although the circles of colored light and his awareness of them are due to the disease his awareness of the disease is not itself diseased But you also cannot say that they are not an aspect of the lamplight or of his visual awareness In the same way in the analogy of the two moons the second moon is neither the real moon nor a reflection of the real moon When pressure is applied to the eyeball one sees two moons Those who understand this will not argue that the second moon which results from the pressure on the eye is the real moon or that it is not the real moon or further that it is an aspect of visual awareness or is not an aspect of visual awareness Even less can you distinguish them as neither an aspect of the lamplight nor an aspect of visual awareness nanda in Jambudvīpas seas there are three thousand land masses In their midst lies a great continent and in that continent from east to west  DISTORTIONS IN VISUAL AWARENESS BASED ON KARMA there are two thousand three hundred large countries On the various islands in the ocean there may be two or three hundred countries or in some cases only one or two countries or as many as thirty forty or fifty Suppose nanda that among them is an island where there are two countries only and that the people of one of these countries share the experience of unfortunate circumstances It may be that the people of that country see many inauspicious phenomena They may see two suns or two moons or rings or halfrings of white or colored light around the sun or the moon They may see meteors or comets streaking down or across the sky or else patterns of inauspicious energies in a bowed shape or in the shape of ears above or beside the sun or bands of light reaching across the sky  many such inauspicious phenomena as these Only the people of that one country see these phenomena the people in the other country do not see them at all or even hear of them nanda I will now compare these situations in order to clarify them First let us consider the distorted visual awareness based on beings individual karma When the person with an eye disease sees the illusory circles of colored light around a lamp the circles seem to him to be external objects but in fact what the person sees is a consequence of the disease The disease places a distorting strain on his visual awareness it is not the colored light that places the strain However what is aware of the disease is not defective In the same way all that you can now see  the mountains the rivers the many lands and the various forms of life  are the result of a disease that has existed in your visual awareness since time without beginning The essence of visual awareness and what it is aware of cause what seem to be external phenomena to appear your visual awareness of me now and of yourself and of the ten classes of beings that can be seen in the world is a defective awareness The true nature of the essence of visual awareness is not defective and therefore it is not what is ordinarily referred to as visual awareness nanda consider the distortion in visual awareness experienced by the people of that one country in response to their shared karma The situations of the person with the eye disease and the people of that one country are similar in that the illusory circles of colored light are a consequence of the eye disease while the inauspicious phenomena seen by the people of that country are due to the miasmal energies that arise from their shared karma Both the individual karma and the shared karma have come into being because of distortions in awareness that have existed since time without beginning Nevertheless all the beings with outflows and all the lands in the ten directions including the Sahā world with its four great seas and with the three thousand landmasses of Jambudvīpa are fundamentally the enlightened wondrous luminous mind that understands and has no outflows The conditions necessary for them all to arise are the illusory diseased distortions in visual awareness in awareness of sounds and in all the other types of awareness When these conditions are present in  For a full explanation of this important point see part  below When you remain entirely untouched by conditions whether or not they are present in combination you bring to an end all the causes of coming into being and ceasing to be At that moment you will awaken to perfect enlightenment which is your true nature and which neither comes into being nor ceases to be But you do not understand yet that the original enlightened nature of your visual awareness also does not exist because of inhering or because of conjoining nor because of a lack of inhering or a lack of conjoining I will now ask you again nanda about the objects you perceive before you Your deluded thinking about the world tells you that what causes these objects to exist is either inhering or conjoining Therefore you wrongly suppose that what causes the enlightened mind to exist is either inhering or conjoining Suppose the wondrous pure nature of your visual awareness exists through inhering Does it then exist through inhering in light If it exists through inhering in light then when you see in the presence of light precisely where in the light does it inhere Visual awareness and light each have their own distinct qualities so if visual awareness were inherent in light what qualities would each of them have then Either they would have the ability to see in which case you would be seeing your own awareness or they would not have the ability to see in which case you would not  Inhering Skt  VISUAL AWARENESS EXISTS NEITHER THROUGH INHERING NOR IN CONJOINING be able to see light Again since your visual awareness is different from light it would cease to be itself if it were to inhere in light and light would likewise cease to be what we call light if it inhered in visual awareness each would lose its nature In short it cannot be right to say your visual awareness exists through inhering in light Nor can it be right to say your visual awareness exists through inhering in darkness in space or in objects Once again nanda does the wondrous pure nature of your visual awareness exist through conjoining with light Does it exist through conjoining with darkness Does it exist through conjoining with objects If your visual awareness existed in conjoining with light then in total darkness when no light is present you would not be aware of the darkness since your awareness would be conjoined with light rather than with darkness If even so you could see darkness without your awareness being conjoined to darkness it follows that you would not see light when your awareness was conjoined to light And if you could not see light when your awareness had been conjoined to it then since you could not see light how would you know when it was light or dark The same arguments could be made to show that your visual awareness does not exist through conjoining with darkness with space or with objects nanda said to the Buddha WorldHonored One I am now thinking that the wondrous fundamental enlightened nature of our visual awareness does not exist either through inhering in or through conjoining with the objects before us or with our processes of perceiving of them The Buddha said Now you are saying that your enlightened awareness does not exist either through inhering or through conjoining If the wondrous essential nature of your visual awareness does not inhere in or conjoin with anything then are you saying that it does not inhere in light That it does not inhere in darkness That it does not inhere in space That it does not inhere in solid objects If it did not inhere in light then a boundary would necessarily exist between your visual awareness and the light Look carefully now where is your awareness Where is the light And where is the boundary between them If nanda your visual awareness were nowhere within the confines of light it would follow that your awareness and the light had not come into contact and so you would not be able to see where the light is Then how could a boundary exist between them Moreover if the wondrous essential nature of your visual awareness did not become conjoined to anything then does it not become conjoined to light Does it not become conjoined to darkness Does it not become conjoined to space Does it not become conjoined to objects If your visual awareness did not become conjoined to light then light and your awareness would be entirely incompatible just as light and your awareness of sounds are incompatible They would never come into contact Further since you would not be able to see where the light is how could you know whether or not your awareness had become conjoined to it The same would be true of your visual awareness not becoming conjoined to darkness to space or to solid objects III The Matrix of the ThusCome One   The Five Aggregates Are the Matrix of the ThusCome One Ananda you have not yet understood that the objects we perceive are unreal and illusory They are subject to change appearing here and there and disappearing here and there Yet these illusions each with its conventional designation are in fact within the essential wondrous enlightenment The same is true of the five aggregates the six faculties the twelve sites and the eighteen constituent elements It is an illusion that they come into being when both their causes and their conditions are present and it is an illusion that they cease to be when either their causes or their conditions are absent You simply have not yet understood that fundamentally everything that comes and goes that comes into being and ceases to be is within the true nature of the Matrix of the ThusCome One which is the wondrous everlasting understanding  the unmoving allpervading wondrous suchness of reality The Aggregate of Form nanda how is it that the five aggregates are fundamentally the Matrix of the ThusCome One whose nature is the wondrous suchness of reality Consider this example nanda a clearsighted person looks up at a clear sky where nothing but empty space is to be seen Suppose that for no particular reason this person happens to stare without moving his eyes until they are stressed to the point that he sees in the empty air a disordered display of flowers along with various other images that are of the ConsciousnessOnly school You should know that the aggregate of form can be described in similar terms Now this disordered display of flowers nanda does not come into being from space nor does it come into being from the persons eyes Suppose nanda that the display of flowers did come from space But what has come into being from space would have to be subject to disappearing back into space and space would not be empty if things came into being out of it and disappeared back into it But if space were not empty there would not be room in it for those displays of flowers to appear out of it or to disappear back into it any more than there is room in your body nanda for another nanda On the other hand if this disordered display of flowers came from the persons eyes the display of flowers could disappear back into his eyes Now we may suppose that if this display of flowers has come from the eyes it must share in the visual awareness of the eyefaculty If it were visually aware then having come out from the eyes into the air it would be able to see the eyes from the air But if it does not share in the awareness of the eyefaculty then having obscured a portion of the otherwise empty air it will also obscure the vision of the eyefaculty as it returns to the eyefaculty Besides the persons vision cannot have been obscured since he is seeing the display of flowers And did we not say to begin with that this person was clearsighted as he looked up at the clear sky Therefore you should know that the aggregate of forms is an illusion It does not come into being from causes and conditions nor does it come into being on its own The Aggregate of SensePerception nanda consider the example of someone whose hands and feet are at rest and whose entire body is at ease At this moment he has forgotten about his body and he is feeling neither comfort nor discomfort Then for no particular reason he rubs the palms of his hands together in the empty space in front of him and he has the illusory experience of roughness or smoothness and of cold or heat You should know that the aggregate of senseperception can be described in similar terms  THE MATRIX OF THE THUSCOME ONE Now these illusory senseperceptions nanda do not emerge from space nor do they emerge from the palms of the persons hands That is to say nanda if space could cause tactile perceptions in the palms of his hands would it not equally be able to cause tactile perceptions elsewhere on the body If the tactile perceptions had emerged from the palms of his hands what need would there have been to rub the palms together in order to produce the perceptions Further if the tactile perceptions had emerged from the palms of his hands then the persons palms would have been aware of the perceptions emerging And when the person moved his hands apart the perceptions would have to sink back into his wrists and arms into the bones and marrow which would have to be aware of the path those perceptions took In such a case what the mind perceived as emerging and returning would have to be something that was capable of coming and going in the body If there were such a thing what need would there have been for the person to rub the palms of his hands together in order to experience these tactile perceptions Therefore you should know that the aggregate of senseperception is an illusion It does not come into being from causes and conditions nor does it come into being on its own The Aggregate of Cognition nanda consider the example of someone whose mouth waters at the mention of sour plums or who feels a sudden ache in the sole of his foot as he thinks of walking along the edge of a precipice You should know that the aggregate of cognition can be described in similar terms Now the circumstance of the mouth watering at the mention of the plums nanda was not caused by the actual plums that were mentioned nor was it caused by the persons mouth If the mouth watered because of the actual plums nanda that would mean that the plums were responsible for mentioning themselves On the other hand if the mouth were responsible for the watering would that mean that the mouth heard the plums being mentioned Were not ears needed for that If the ears were the cause then would that not mean that the ears could produce saliva The same points about the watering of the mouth at the mention of sour plums can be equally applied to the ache that is felt in the sole of ones foot when one thinks of walking along the edge of a precipice Therefore you should know that the aggregate of cognition is an illusion It does not come into being from causes and conditions nor does it come into being on its own The Aggregate of Mental Formations nanda consider the example of a stretch of rapids The waves follow one upon another and those that are behind never overtake those that are ahead You should know that the aggregate of mental formations can be described in similar terms Now the rapids are not brought about by space nanda nor are they brought about by the water itself They are not identical to the water but though they are not themselves the water they are at the same time not separate from the water Understand it this way nanda if the rapids were brought about by space then that would mean that space in its infinite reach throughout the ten directions would be a ceaseless deluge and the entire universe would inevitably drown If the rapids were brought about by the water then the nature of the rapids would not be the same as the nature of water On the other hand if the rapids and the water were identical then when the water became still it would cease to be water However the rapids and the water cannot be separate either since there can be no rapids without water Nor can the rapids be separate from space since outside of space nothing exists  THE MATRIX OF THE THUSCOME ONE In this way you should know that the aggregate of mental formations is an illusion It does not come into being from causes and conditions nor does it come into being on its own The Aggregate of Consciousness nanda consider the example of a person who takes up an empty pitcher and plugs up its two spouts so that it seems he has confined some space in the pitcher Believing that he is carrying this pitcherful of space he travels a thousand miles to another country with the intention of making a present of it You should know that the aggregate of consciousness can be described in similar terms The space that is in the pitcher nanda does not in fact come from the place where the person began his journey nor is it transported to the country he travels to It is like this nanda if the space had been transported from the first country by being confined in the pitcher there must have been a loss of space at the place where the pitcher had come from Moreover if the space had been brought to the second country then if the spouts were unplugged and the pitcher turned upsidedown the space within it would be seen to pour out In this way you should know that the aggregate of consciousness is an illusion It does not come into being from causes and conditions nor does it come into being on its own  Ch The EyeFaculty Moreover nanda how is it that fundamentally the six faculties are the Matrix of the ThusCome One whose nature is the wondrous suchness of reality The strain causes the distortion in perception For seeing to take place the illusory phenomena of light and darkness must first enter the eyefaculty this is what we call seeing Apart from light and darkness seeing has no ultimate basis Understand it this way nanda what we call seeing does not take place because of light or darkness nor because of the eyefaculty nor because of space If what we call seeing took place because of light it would cease in total darkness and you would not see the darkness If it took place because of darkness it would cease once light were present and so you would not see the light Further seeing cannot take place because of the eyefaculty because clearly there is a need for light or for darkness if seeing is to occur It follows that the eyefaculty has no independent existence Finally if seeing took place because of space then when we look straight ahead we would see the objects before us as usual but we would also be able to look back on our own eyes from space If space were doing the seeing what would seeing have to do with the eyefaculty  THE MATRIX OF THE THUSCOME ONE In this way you should know that the eyefaculty is illusory It does not come into being from causes and conditions nor does it come into being on its own The EarFaculty nanda consider the example of a person who forcefully stops up his ears with his fingers The strain exerted on the earfaculty may cause a sound to be heard inside his head What the earfaculty perceives when it is under strain and also the earfaculty itself come about through the strain placed on the awakened mind The strain causes the distortion in perception For hearing to take place the illusory phenomena of sound and silence must enter the earfaculty this is what we call hearing Understand it this way nanda what we call hearing does not take place because of sound or silence nor because of the earfaculty nor because of space If it took place because of silence it would cease once sounds were present and so we would not hear sounds If what we call hearing took place because of sound hearing would cease in total silence and we would not be aware of the silence It follows that the earfaculty has no independent existence Finally if hearing took place because of space then space would not be what we call space because it would have the ability to hear And if space could hear what would hearing have to do with the earfaculty In this way you should know that the earfaculty is illusory It does not come into being from causes and conditions nor does it come into being on its own The NoseFaculty nanda consider the example of a person who as he breathes in through his nose continues to inhale sharply until at length the strain exerted on his nosefaculty gives rise to an illusory sensation of cold As  The Sixth Patriarchs DharmaJewel Platform Sūtra with the commentary of Tripitaka Master Hua Buddhist Text Translation Society trans San Francisco The strain causes the distortion in perception For smelling to take place the illusory phenomena of openness or blockage in the nasal passages must be present in the nosefaculty then what we call smelling can occur Apart from openness and blockage smelling has no ultimate basis Understand it this way nanda what we call smelling does not take place because of openness or blockage nor because of the nosefaculty nor because of space If what we call smelling took place because the nasal passages are open it would cease when they are blocked and you would not be aware of the blockage If it took place because of the blockage it would cease once the nasal passages were open and so you would not be aware of odors whether they are pleasant unpleasant or neither pleasant nor unpleasant It follows that the nosefaculty has no independent existence Finally if smelling took place because of space then space would be able to smell the nose Besides if space were doing the smelling what would smelling have to do with the nosefaculty In this way you should know that the nosefaculty is illusory It does not come into being from causes and conditions nor does it come into being on its own The TongueFaculty nanda consider the example of a person who licks his lips repeatedly to the point that his tonguefaculty is subjected to strain If he is sick he will experience a bitter taste otherwise the taste will seem slightly sweet His experience of sweetness or bitterness demonstrates that the tonguefaculty is still active when no tastes are present What the tonguefaculty perceives when it is under strain as well as the tongue THE SIX FACULTIES faculty itself come about through strain placed on the awakened mind Apart from sweetness and bitterness and from the absence of flavor tasting has no apparent basis Understand it this way nanda what we call tasting does not take place because of sweetness or bitterness or the absence of flavor nor does it take place because of the tonguefaculty nor does it take place because of space If tasting took place because sweetness or bitterness is present how would you become aware of an absence of flavor If it took place because no flavor is present it would vanish in the presence of a sweet or bitter taste How then would you become aware of sweetness or bitterness Further tasting cannot take place because of the tonguefaculty because there is clearly a need for a flavor such as sweetness or bitterness or else the absence of flavor if tasting is to occur Finally if tasting took place because of space then space would have the ability to taste and space not your tongue would have awareness of flavors In this way you should know that the tonguefaculty is illusory It does not come into being from causes and conditions nor does it come into being on its own  THE MATRIX OF THE THUSCOME ONE E The BodyFaculty nanda consider the example of a person who joins his hands together when one hand is warm and the other cold If the cold hand is colder than the warm hand is warm it will make the warm hand become cold and if the warm hand is warmer than the cold hand is cold it will make the cold hand become warm With the exchange of warmth and cold from the prolonged contact between the two hands the person becomes aware of contact and subsequently separation What the bodyfaculty perceives when it is under strain as well as the bodyfaculty itself come about through strain placed on the awakened mind What we call tactile awareness occurs when the illusory phenomena of contact and separation are felt by the bodyfaculty This tactile awareness of contact and separation may be pleasant or unpleasant but without them tactile awareness has no ultimate basis Understand it this way nanda what we call tactile awareness does not take place because of contact and separation nor because of any pleasantness or unpleasantness of the sensation nor because of the bodyfaculty nor because of space If tactile awareness took place because of contact how would you become aware of separation when contact ceased It follows that tactile awareness has no independent existence Finally if tactile awareness took place because of space alone then space would be aware of tactile sensations then what would tactile awareness have to do with the bodyfaculty In this way you should know that the bodyfaculty is illusory It does not come into being from causes and conditions nor does it come into being on its own  THE SIX FACULTIES F The Cognitive Faculty nanda consider the example of a person who is tired and falls asleep Having slept enough he awakens and tries to remember his dreams He recalls some elements of his dreams but cannot remember others This succession of sleeping waking remembering and forgetting is an example of the distorted stages of coming into being abiding changing and perishing within the cognitive faculty What the cognitive faculty perceives when it is under strain as well as the cognitive faculty itself come forth from the strain placed on the awakened mind In their two aspects of coming into being and perishing unreal perceived objects accumulate in our cognitive awareness Understand it this way nanda what we call cognitive awareness does not take place because of waking and sleeping or because of the coming into being and perishing of mental objects nor does it take place because of the cognitive faculty nor does it take place because of space If cognitive awareness took place because of waking you would have no cognitive awareness when you were asleep and then how could you experience sleep By the same logic cognition cannot arise because cognitive objects arise since when those cognitive objects perish the cognitive faculty would perish also Nor can cognitive awareness take place because of the perishing of cognitive objects since when cognitive objects subsequently arose cognitive awareness would perish What then would be aware of the objects that arose  THE MATRIX OF THE THUSCOME ONE dormant yet apart from a state of sleep or waking cognitive awareness has no more existence than a mirage of flowers in space Finally if cognitive awareness took place because of space then space would be aware of cognitive objects In this way you should know that the cognitive faculty is an illusion It does not come into being from causes and conditions nor does it come into being on its own   The Twelve Sites Are the Matrix of the ThusCome One A The EyeFaculty and Visible Objects Moreover nanda how is it that fundamentally the twelve sites are the Matrix of the ThusCome One whose nature is the wondrous suchness of reality nanda look once again at the fountains the pools and the trees of the Prince Jetris Grove What do you think Does the presence of visible objects cause your eyefaculty to see Or to the contrary does the eyefaculty cause the visible objects to be present Ananda if the eyefaculty caused the presence of visible objects then when you looked at an empty sky in which no visible objects are present all the visible objects that you were not looking at would have to disappear If everything were to disappear such that nothing were present then how could we know what space is The corollary supposition  that space is present because your eyefaculty is there to see it  can be similarly rejected If your eyefaculty no longer existed nothing would be seen and in that case how could we know what visible objects are  or what space is Therefore you should know that the eyefaculty and visible objects and space as well have no real existence These two sites  the eyefaculty and visible objects  are illusions Fundamentally they are not dependent on causes or conditions and yet they do not come into being on their own The EarFaculty and Sounds Moreover nanda you have heard the beating of the drum in Prince Jetris Grove when a meal is ready The assembly gathers and then the bell is struck The drumbeats and the peals of the bell each follow one upon another in clear succession What do you think Do the sounds come to the earfaculty Or to the contrary does the earfaculty go out to the sounds nanda suppose the sounds come to the ear Then the situation could be compared to my going on my almsround in rāvastī so that I am no longer in Prince Jetris Grove Now if sounds came to your ear in order for you to hear them nanda then neither Mahākāśyapa nor Mahāmaudgalyāyana  not to speak of the rest of the twelvehundredfifty elder monks  would hear the bell calling them to the meal How would they know it was time to eat nanda suppose that the earfaculty goes out to a sound in order for you to hear it Then the situation can be compared to my returning to Prince Jetris Grove so that I am no longer in rāvastī If your earfaculty went out to the drum in order to hear it then you would not be able to hear the bell at the same time  nor would you be able to hear other sounds such as the noise made by elephants horses oxen and sheep On the other hand if no sounds reached the earfaculty you would not be able to hear either Therefore you should know that sounds and the earfaculty have no real existence These two sites  sounds and the earfaculty  are illusions Fundamentally they are not dependent on causes or conditions and yet they do not come into being on their own  THE TWELVE SITES C The NoseFaculty and Odors Moreover nanda you can smell the sandalwood incense burning in a censer A small pinch of this incense once lit can be smelled everywhere around rāvastī for a distance of a dozen miles What do you think Does the fragrance come into being from the sandalwood incense Does it come into being from your nosefaculty Or does it come into being from space nanda suppose that the fragrance comes into being from your nosefaculty If it comes into being because of the nose then the nose must emit fragrance But the nose is not made of sandalwood how then could it produce the fragrance of sandalwood Clearly the fragrance must enter the nose in order for you to smell it It makes no sense to say that you smell it when the fragrance comes out of the nose Suppose that the fragrance comes into being from space Since space is by nature everlasting and unchanging a fragrance that came into being from space would therefore be everpresent What need would there be then to burn the sandalwood in the censer Suppose that the fragrance comes from the wood Now the fragrant wood gives off smoke when it is burned For the nose to smell the smoke the smoke must come into contact with the nosefaculty Yet the fragrance has already spread a dozen miles in every direction long before the smoke itself has risen very far into the air Therefore you should know that sandalwood incense and the nosefaculty have no real existence These two sites  the nosefaculty and odors  are illusions Fundamentally they are not dependent on causes or conditions and yet they do not come into being on their own The TongueFaculty and Flavors nanda to obtain your two daily meals you and the others in the assembly take up your almsbowls In them you may receive curds cheese  Skt Do these flavors come into being from space from the tongue or from the food Suppose then that the flavor of the curds does come from the tongue Then if a lump of sugar were placed on the tongue the tongue would not be able to taste it unless it could change its nature If the tongue cannot change its nature so that it can taste a variety of flavors it cannot be capable of tasting If it could change that would mean you would have several tongues Suppose the flavors come from the food But the food has no consciousness how could it be aware of flavors If the food were aware of its own flavors then it would be as if someone else were eating How would you be able to taste it Suppose that the flavors come from space But suppose you were to take a mouthful of space would it have a flavor Let us say that it does  that it has a salty taste If it could place a salty taste on your tongue it would inevitably make your face salty as well Everyone in the world would be like fish in the sea Since you would perpetually be tasting salt you would never be aware of a bland taste and if you were never aware of a bland taste you would not be able to distinguish a salty taste either Indeed you would not be able to taste at all How then could you be said to have an awareness of flavors Therefore you should know that food and the tonguefaculty have no real existence These two sites  the tonguefaculty and flavors  are illusions Fundamentally they are not dependent on causes or conditions and yet they do not come into being on their own The BodyFaculty and Objects of Touch nanda every morning at daybreak you touch your head with your hand Is the awareness of the contact present in your hand or in your head If it is only your hand that is aware of the contact then your head will not be aware of it how can that amount to the sensa THE TWELVE SITES tion you experience And if it is just your head that is aware of the contact then your hand must not be aware of it how could that be what we mean by the sensation you experience If both your head and your hand had a separate awareness of the contact nanda you must have two bodies Conversely if your head and hand together experience a single awareness of contact then your head and your hand must be a single object If they were a single object how could there be contact between them The one that is aware cannot be the perceived object and the one that is the perceived object cannot be what is aware Nor can the contact be between you and space Therefore you should know that in fact your bodyfaculty and objects of touch have no real existence These two sites  the bodyfaculty and the objects of touch  are illusions Fundamentally they are not dependent on causes or conditions and yet they do not come into being on their own The Cognitive Faculty and Objects of Cognition nanda objects of cognition are always arising in your mind in three categories pleasant unpleasant and neither pleasant nor unpleasant  The translation here follows the commentary of the Ven  THE MATRIX OF THE THUSCOME ONE Now do these objects of cognition arise from your cognitive faculty or do they arise from some source other than your cognitive faculty nanda if these objects of cognition arose from your cognitive faculty they could not be objects of cognition and they would not then be what your cognitive faculty can interact with How then could they be a site for the arising of your mindconsciousness Suppose they arose from some source other than your cognitive faculty Would they be aware of themselves as objects of cognition or would they not But given that these objects of cognition are something you are aware of they must be present in your cognitive faculty and so they cannot after all be present in someone elses cognitive faculty Finally if these objects of cognition are not aware and arise from some other source than your mind then at what site might they be located given that they are neither visible objects nor sounds nor odors nor flavors nor such attributes as separation contact cold and warmth Nor are they space Since there is nothing in the world humans perceive beyond visible objects the other perceived objects and space and since objects of cognition are distinct from the cognitive faculty what place is left for objects of cognition to be located Therefore you should know that in fact your cognitive faculty and objects of cognition have no real existence These two sites of perception  the cognitive faculty and objects of cognition  are illusions Fundamentally they are not dependent on causes or conditions and yet they do not come into being on their own  Were they to arise from the cognitive faculty then they would share its capacity to be aware   The Eighteen Constituents Are the Matrix of the ThusCome One A The Coming into Being of the EyeConsciousness Moreover nanda how is it that fundamentally the eighteen constituents are the Matrix of the ThusCome One which is the wondrous suchness of reality nanda according to your understanding of it the eyefaculty and visible objects are the conditions for the coming into being of the eyeconsciousness But does this consciousness come into being from the eyes such that it is restricted by the boundaries of the eyefaculty Or does it come into being from visible objects such that it is restricted by the boundaries of visible objects Suppose nanda that the eyeconsciousness came into being from the eyefaculty Now without the presence of visible objects or of space the eyeconsciousness could not make distinctions and even if it existed in this situation what use would it be Your eyeconsciousness is neither blue yellow red nor white There is nothing to indicate where it is On what then would the constituent that is the eyeconsciousness be based Then in the presence of space where there are no visible objects your eyeconsciousness would cease to be How then could it be aware of space Again if your eyeconsciousness came into being from visible objects then when the objects changed your eyeconsciousness would change along with them If it came into being from visible objects and yet did not change along with them where would it exist Also it cannot come from visible objects because if it did given that it does not change it could not become aware of space Suppose then that the eyeconsciousness came into being from both the eyefaculty and visible objects But it cannot arise from a combination of the two because then it would be internally divided Therefore you should know that the eyefaculty and visible objects cannot be the conditions for the coming into being of the eyeconsciousness because none of these three constituents  eyefaculty visible objects and eyeconsciousness  has an independent existence Fundamentally they do not come into being from causes and conditions nor do they come into being on their own The Coming into Being of the EarConsciousness Moreover nanda according to your understanding of it the earfaculty and sounds are the conditions for the coming into being of the earconsciousness But does this consciousness come into being from the earfaculty such that it is restricted by the boundaries of the earfaculty Or does it come into being from sounds such that it is restricted by the boundaries of sound Suppose nanda that it came into being from the earfaculty But without the presence of either sound or silence the earfaculty would not be aware of anything If the earfaculty lacked awareness because there would be no objects for it to be aware of then what attributes could  THE EIGHTEEN CONSTITUENTS the consciousness have You may insist that it is the ears that hear But without the presence of sound or silence no hearing can take place Also the ear is covered with skin and the bodyfaculty is involved with objects of touch Could the earconsciousness come into being from that faculty Suppose the earconsciousness came into being from sounds If the earconsciousness owed its existence to sounds then it would have nothing to do with hearing But if no hearing is taking place how would you know where sounds are coming from Suppose nevertheless that the earconsciousness did arise from sound Since a sound must be heard if it is to be what we know as a sound the earconsciousness would also be heard as a sound And when it is not heard it would not exist Besides if it is heard then it would be the same thing as a sound it would be something that is heard But what would be able to hear it There can be no such place where these two can mix together since one is internal and the other is external Where else then could the earconsciousness come into being Therefore you should know that the earfaculty and sounds cannot be the conditions for the coming into being of the earconsciousness because none of these three constituents  earfaculty sounds and earconsciousness  has an independent existence Fundamentally they do not come into being from causes and conditions nor do they come into being on their own The Coming into Being of the NoseConsciousness Moreover nanda according to your understanding of it the nosefaculty and odors are the conditions for the coming into being of the noseconsciousness But does this consciousness come into being from the nosefaculty such that it is restricted by the boundaries of the nosefaculty Or does it come into being from odors such that it is restricted by the boundaries of odors  THE MATRIX OF THE THUSCOME ONE nanda suppose it came into being from the nose Now in your opinion what should we consider the nose to be Should we take it to be a part of the body that is shaped like a pair of talons Or should we take it to be the faculty that is aware of the natures of various odors Suppose we take the nose to be a part of the body shaped like a pair of talons But then the nose belongs to the bodyfaculty which is aware of objects of touch What belongs to the bodyfaculty is not the nosefaculty and the bodyfaculty perceives objects of touch Nothing would remain to be called nosefaculty How could the noseconsciousness be based on it nanda suppose that we take the nose to be the faculty that is aware of odors then once again in your opinion what is it that is aware It could not be the nosefaculty that is aware of odors Suppose it is space that is aware of odors If space were itself aware then it would not be a part of your body that would be aware In that case space given that it is aware would have to be you and your body would have no awareness Then you nanda would not be here now at all Suppose it is odors that are aware If awareness were really a function of odors how would you expect to be involved If your nose were what produced odors both pleasant and unpleasant then such odors would not come from sandalwood incense or from the foulsmelling airāvaṇa The airāvaṇa tree emits an extremely foul stench that can be smelled from a long way off Its stench is like that of a corpse that for several weeks has been decaying under the blazing sun The red flowers of the airāvaṇa tree are very beautiful but very poisonous and to eat them means immediate death If those odors dont come from those two things then clearly it must be your nose itself that has an odor  THE EIGHTEEN CONSTITUENTS it could not be pleasant Thus if it really were odors both pleasant and unpleasant that were aware then you would have to have two noses or else I would be questioning two people about the Path Which one would be you Since you after all have only one nose which cannot both stink and be fragrant then if odors were in fact aware stench would have to be fragrant and fragrance would have to stink Neither would have a nature of its own On what then would the noseconsciousness be based Suppose again that the noseconsciousness came into being from odors If that were the case then just as the eyefaculty can see everything but itself so the noseconsciousness if it came into being from odors could not be aware of odors Since it is aware of odors it cannot come into being from them and if after all it were not aware of odors it would not be the noseconsciousness Besides since odors have no awareness the constituent element of the noseconsciousness cannot come into being from them and if it did the consciousness could not become aware of odors Therefore the noseconsciousness cannot come into being from odors Finally since there can be no place that is intermediate between a faculty which is internal and its object which is external the noseconsciousness must ultimately be a distortion and an illusion Therefore you should know that the nosefaculty and odors cannot be the conditions for the coming into being of the noseconsciousness because none of these three constituents  nosefaculty odors and the noseconsciousness  has an independent existence Fundamentally they do not come into being from causes and conditions nor do they come into being on their own The Coming into Being of the TongueConsciousness Moreover nanda according to your understanding of it the tonguefaculty and flavors are the conditions for the coming into being of the tongueconsciousness But does this consciousness come into being from the tonguefaculty such that it is restricted by the boundaries of the tonguefaculty Or does it come into being from flavors such that it is restricted by the boundaries of flavors  THE MATRIX OF THE THUSCOME ONE nanda suppose it came into being from the tonguefaculty Then you would not be able to taste the flavors that we find in the world such as sugar cane sour plums coptis rhizome salt wild ginger ginger and cinnamon You would only be able to taste your own tonguefaculty Would it be sweet or bitter Since the tonguefaculty cannot taste itself what would the tongueconsciousness consist of If your tonguefaculty were not bitter bitter flavor could not come into being from it On what then would the tongueconsciousness be based Suppose the tongueconsciousness came into being from flavors Then the tongueconsciousness would itself have flavor and just as in the previous case of the nosefaculty the tongueconsciousness would not be able to taste its own flavor How then would it be aware of the presence or absence of any flavor Further flavors do not come into being from any one thing Since flavors come from many different things there would have to be many tongueconsciousnesses But given that there is after all just one tongueconsciousness then if that single tongueconsciousness indeed came into being from flavors it would have to itself be a combination of such flavors as salty bland sweet and hot Their various characteristics would have to change into a single flavor and you would not be able to distinguish one from another Since your tongueconsciousness could not make distinctions among them it could not be what we call a consciousness and so could not be the constituent that is the tongueconsciousness Nor could it come into being from space If flavors which are external and the tonguefaculty which is internal did combine then there would be no place of contact However the translation is uncertain  THE EIGHTEEN CONSTITUENTS Therefore you should know that the tonguefaculty and flavors cannot be the conditions for the coming into being of the tongueconsciousness because none of these three constituents  tonguefaculty flavors and tongueconsciousness  has an independent existence Fundamentally they do not come into being from causes and conditions nor do they come into being on their own The Coming into Being of the BodyConsciousness Moreover nanda according to your understanding of it the bodyfaculty and objects of touch are the conditions for the coming into being of the bodyconsciousness But does this consciousness come into being from the bodyfaculty such that it is restricted by the boundaries of the bodyfaculty Or does it come into being from objects of touch such that it is restricted by the boundaries of objects of touch Suppose it came into being from the bodyfaculty Then there could be no contact with objects of touch or separation from them and these are said to be two conditions for the bodyconsciousnesss awareness Suppose it came into being from objects of touch Then your body would not be involved Yet who can be without a body and still be aware of contact with and separation from objects of touch Insentient things cannot have tactile awareness and it is the bodyconsciousness that is aware of objects of touch Only with a bodyfaculty can there be awareness of contact with objects If the bodyconsciousness were joined to the bodyfaculty it would have the essential nature of the bodyfaculty yet if it were not joined to the bodyfaculty it would have the same nature as space Since the bodyconsciousness cannot come into being either from the faculty which is internal or its objects which are external how could it  THE MATRIX OF THE THUSCOME ONE exist between them Since it cannot exist between them and since the internal faculty and the external objects are all empty of an inherent nature what could the bodyconsciousness be based on Therefore you should know that the bodyfaculty and objects of touch cannot be the conditions for the coming into being of the bodyconsciousness because none of these three constituents  bodyfaculty objects of touch and bodyconsciousness  has an independent existence Fundamentally they do not come into being from causes and conditions nor do they come into being on their own The various principles explained above demonstrate that the bodyconsciousness cannot be found In the provisional teachings the bodyfaculty and contact with objects of touch are the conditions for the action of the bodyconsciousness The Coming into Being of the MindConsciousness Moreover nanda according to your understanding of it the cognitive faculty and its objects are the conditions for the coming into being of mindconsciousness But does this consciousness come into being from the cognitive faculty such that it is restricted by the boundaries of the cognitive faculty Or does it come into being from its objects such that it is restricted to the boundaries of its objects nanda suppose the mindconsciousness came into being from the cognitive faculty Now your cognitive faculty has to be considering something in order for it to be functioning If no objects of cognition are present the cognitive faculty does not arise If the cognitive faculty has not manifested how would the mindconsciousness function Further the natures of both your mindconsciousness and your cognitive faculty are such that they make distinctions Do they differ from one another or are they the same If the mindconsciousness were the same as the cognitive faculty it would be the cognitive faculty then how could the mindconsciousness come into being from the cognitive faculty If the mindconsciousness were different from the cognitive faculty it would not be conscious of anything If it were not conscious of anything how could it come into being from the cognitive faculty If it is conscious how can you differentiate it from the cognitive faculty Since neither a sameness nor a difference can be identified on what can the mindconsciousness be based Suppose finally that the mindconsciousness came into being from objects of cognition Now all your experiences of the external world are experiences of visible objects of sounds of odors of flavors or of objects of touch Each of these categories of objects has the attribute of complementing one of five faculties None of them complements the cognitive faculty  THE MATRIX OF THE THUSCOME ONE what the essential attributes of objects of cognition and the other perceived objects might be If you exclude the essential attributes of visible objects and if you exclude their absence  as well as excluding the essential attributes of sound and silence openness and blockage and separation and contact  beyond these what would be left for objects of cognition to be Visible objects the absence of visible objects and the other kinds of perceived objects and their absence are what arise and they are what perish while objects of cognition which we are now supposing to be the cause of the mindconsciousness cannot come into being independently without another perceived object being present Therefore if objects of cognition were what cause the mindconsciousness to come into being what essential attributes would it have Since objects of cognition have no independent attributes how could the mindconsciousness arise from them Therefore you should know that the cognitive faculty and objects of cognition cannot be the conditions that are necessary for the coming into being of the mindconsciousness because none of these three constituents  cognitive faculty objects of cognition and mindconsciousness  has an independent existence He has shown that the various phenomena that we see in the world are caused by the merging or aggregating of the four primary elements Why has the ThusCome One now rejected causes and conditions and selfgeneration as explanations Only pity us and instruct us and all beings how to know the ultimate truth of the Middle Way The WorldHonored One then said to nanda Since you have renounced the teachings of the Lesser Vehicle  of the Hearers of the Teaching and the Solitary Sages  and since you have resolved to strive diligently to realize the supreme awakening I will now instruct you in the ultimate truth You need no longer bind yourself up with words that are devoid of meaning and with distorted thinking about causes and conditions You are very learned but you are like someone who can discuss medicines yet cannot identify them when they are actually set before him The ThusCome One says that you are indeed to be pitied Listen carefully now For your sake and for the sake of all who in the future will undertake the Bodhisattvas journey I will explain in detail how you can come to thoroughly understand the ultimate truth nanda was silent and waited for the Buddhas enlightened instruction nanda according to what you have said the merging or aggregating of four primary elements brings about the various phenomena that are found in the world and that are subject to change Let us suppose nanda that the primary elements have separate essential natures that cannot aggregate or merge In that case their external attributes too could not aggregate or merge any more than space can aggregate or merge with perceived objects Then their aggregating and merging would not differ from the various changes that take place in the world and that cause things to arise and perish through an unending process of coming into being and ceasing to be The potential to become ice is already in the water and the potential to become water is already in the ice It may take as large a form as a continent and as small a form as a mote of dust In its most subtle aspect the primary element earth appears as particles that are so fine that they can hardly be distinguished from space itself If  According to the Abhidharmakośa da   the smallest particles of matter are called paramāṇu  A paramāṇu cannot be divided because if it were its earthelement nature would disappear and all that would  THE MATRIX OF THE THUSCOME ONE these minute particles were divided further into seven parts they would then be as small as perceived objects can be Now if these most minute particles could be divided until they became space nanda then space would be capable of bringing perceived objects into being You asked just now whether the various phenomena that we see in the world are caused by the merging or aggregating of the four elemental qualities Nor can it be true that these most minute particles are created by the particles themselves Further if these most minute particles could be divided to assume the nature of space then conversely how many such particles must be aggregated to bring space into being In fact when perceived objects are aggregated or merged they do not become space and when space accumulates it does not become a perceived object Besides although perceived objects can indeed be divided how can space be accumulated You simply do not know that in the Matrix of the ThusCome One the real nature of the primary element earth is identical to the real nature of emptiness The real nature of the primary element earth is fundamentally pure and extends throughout the DharmaRealm The extent to which beings are aware of that real nature depends on the capacity of their understanding The primary element earth appears to them in accord with their karma Ordinary beings in their ignorance mistakenly suppose that the primary element earth comes into being from causes and conditions or that it comes into being on its own These are distinctions and constructs made by the conscious mind They are mere words devoid of meaning Asian Humanities Press    THE SEVEN PRIMARY ELEMENTS B The Primary Element Fire nanda the nature of fire is such that it has no independent existence but is dependent on conditions Let us consider a family in the city They have not yet eaten dinner When they set about to cook their meal someone holds up a reflecting surface to the sun in order to start a fire nanda an example of an aggregation is our community here which includes you the twelve hundred and fifty monks and myself Although there is but one community we can discern that it consists of separate individuals each of whom was born into a certain class clan and family For example there is āriputra who is a Brahmin Uruvilvā who belongs to the Kāśyapa clan and you nanda who are of the Gautama family In the example of the family starting a fire to cook a meal nanda then suppose that the sun the reflecting surface and the tinder act together to create the fire Then when the reflecting surface is held up to the sun so that a fire may be lit does the fire emerge from the reflecting surface Does it emerge from the tinder Does it come from the sun Suppose that the fire came from the sun nanda such that the sun by itself would be able to set fire to some tinder that you were holding Then it should also be able to set fire to a grove of trees merely by shining on it Why doesnt the reflecting surface melt as you hold it up Far from melting it doesnt even become very hot If the fire came into being from the tinder what need would there be for sunlight to be reflected by the mirror Carefully consider this further Someone is holding up the reflecting surface the sunlight comes from the sky the tinder comes from an herb that has been grown in soil but where does the fire come from The sun and the reflecting surface are far apart and cannot come into contact Yet it cannot be that the fire comes into being on its own You still do not know that in the Matrix of the ThusCome One the real nature of the primary element fire is identical to the real nature of emptiness The real nature of the primary element fire is fundamentally pure and extends throughout the DharmaRealm The extent to which  THE MATRIX OF THE THUSCOME ONE beings are aware of this real nature depends on the capacity of their understanding You should know nanda that anywhere in the entire world throughout the DharmaRealm a reflecting surface can be held up to the sun to start a fire Since a fire can be started anywhere in the world how could it be limited to one particular place In fact the primary element fire becomes apparent to beings in accord with their karma The Primary Element Water nanda the nature of water is variable neither always flowing nor always still Consider the ascetic masters Kapila Cakra Padma and Hastā along with other great magicians in the city of rāvastī On bright nights with the full moon shining these magicians each hold up a bowl to the moon in order to collect water which contains the moons essence and this they mix with their hallucinatory herbs Magicians deal with illusion with what is not real Now does the water come out of the bowl Is it already present because it is inherent in space Or does it come from the moon  Skt See part  If moonlight coming from such a distance could cause water to emerge from the bowl then while crossing that distance it would cause water to emerge from the trees that it passed Then what need would there be for the bowl But since water does not emerge from the trees it is clear that the water does not in fact come from the moon Suppose the water came from the bowl Then the water would be flowing out of the bowl all the time What need would there be to wait for a bright full moon at midnight Suppose the water came from space Since space is boundless the water too should be boundless Then the heavens and the world of people would all be immersed in a deluge What then will have happened to the beings that move on land in water and in the air The moon moves through the sky The magician holds up the bowl to collect the water Where in fact does the water come from The moon and the bowl are far apart they cannot come into contact and they cannot merge Yet it cannot be that water comes into being on its own You do not yet know that in the Matrix of the ThusCome One the real nature of the primary element water is identical to the real nature of emptiness The real nature of the primary element water is fundamentally pure and extends throughout the DharmaRealm The extent to which beings are aware of that real nature depends on the capacity of their understanding One person holds up a bowl in one place and water comes forth there and anywhere throughout the DharmaRealm such a bowl can be held up so that water will come forth Since water can be found anywhere in the world how could it be limited to one particular place In fact the primary element water becomes apparent to beings in accord with their karma But these principles will not be easy to understand now if you are trying to fathom their meaning with your conscious mind The Primary Element Wind nanda the nature of wind is insubstantial It is neither always in motion nor always still When you take your place in the great assembly you always adjust your precept robe Suppose that as you do so the corner of your robe moves toward the person next to you As a result that person will feel a slight puff of wind against his face Does this puff of wind arise from the corner of your robe Does it arise from the space around it Or does it come into being from that persons face nanda suppose the puff of wind arises from the corner of your robe Then you would be wearing wind and your robe would billow out and fly off your body Yet as I now expound upon the Dharma in the midst of the assembly my robe hangs straight down Look at my robe where is the wind In fact there is nowhere in the robe for the wind to be hidden Then what need would there be for your robe to move in order for someone to feel that puff of wind Further space is always present if the wind arose from it then the wind would always have to be blowing Conversely if no wind were blowing then space would cease to exist But while we can observe an absence of wind what would the absence of space look like In truth  THE SEVEN PRIMARY ELEMENTS if space came into being and ceased to be it would not be what we call space Therefore wind cannot come into being from what we do call space Suppose then that the wind came into being from your neighbors face Then it would be you rather than your neighbor who would feel the puff of wind Why is it your neighbor who in fact feels the puff of wind when you adjust your robe Consider this matter with care It is you who adjust your robe It is your neighbor who feels the puff of wind on his face Space itself is still it is never observed to move From where then does the wind come when it blows against your neighbors face Wind and space have different natures and cannot aggregate or merge with each other And yet it cannot be that wind comes into being on its own independent of anything else You apparently do not know that in the Matrix of the ThusCome One the real nature of the primary element wind is identical to the real nature of emptiness The real nature of wind is fundamentally pure and extends throughout the DharmaRealm The extent to which beings are aware of that real nature depends on the capacity of their understanding nanda just as a puff of wind arises with a small movement of your robe so a puff of wind will arise anywhere throughout the DharmaRealm in any land when someone moves his robe Since wind can arise anywhere in the world how could it be limited to one particular place Ordinary beings in their ignorance mistakenly suppose that the primary element wind comes into being from causes and conditions or that it comes into being on its own The Primary Element Space nanda the nature of space is that it is invisible Consider for example how the Brahmins  for example the Bhāradvāja clan  and the Kṣatriyas Vaiśyas ūdras  Space is unconditioned  THE MATRIX OF THE THUSCOME ONE and Caṇdālas in the city of rāvastī dig wells to find water when they build a new dwelling since the city is far from the river When they dig out the soil to the depth of one foot space will be discernable in the well to the depth of one foot When they dig out the soil to the depth of ten feet space will be discernable in the well to the depth of ten feet Now does the space in the well come into being out of the soil Does it come into being because of the digging Or does it come into being on its own nanda suppose the space in the well came into being on its own without a cause Why then in the place where the well is to be dug is there no space before the soil is removed Why can one see only solid land which one cannot pass through Suppose the space in the well comes into existence from the soil Then when the soil is removed space should be seen to enter the well If no space enters in as the soil comes out how could the space in the well be said to come into being from the soil But if space does not come out of the soil to enter the well then the soil and the space must be bound together with no distinction between them Why then when the soil is removed doesnt the space come out with it Suppose the space in the well comes into existence because of the digging Then the digging should bring space out of the well along with the soil But if the space does not come into existence from the digging then only the soil would have been moved Why then does the space appear The soil comes out as the well is dug But what of the space How does it come into existence The soil that is removed is solid matter while the space is insubstantial so they cannot function together They cannot be aggregated or combined with each other And yet it cannot be that space comes into existence on its own without any cause  THE SEVEN PRIMARY ELEMENTS Given that the fundamental nature of space is allpervasive and does not move you should know that the real natures of earth water fire and wind  which together with space we may consider as five primary elements  are completely interfused with one another In their fundamental natures all are one with the Matrix of the ThusCome One neither coming into being nor ceasing to be When we discussed the first four primary elements nanda you did not understand that fundamentally they are the Matrix of the ThusCome One therefore you still need to ponder whether or not the primary element space can come out of a well that has been dug and whether or not space can enter into the well You have altogether failed to realize that the primary element space is inherent in the Matrix of the ThusCome One and is identical to the real nature of emptiness The real nature of the primary element space is fundamentally pure and extends throughout the DharmaRealm The extent to which beings are aware of that real nature depends on the capacity of their understanding Just as when one well is dug space appears in it nanda so space will appear in any well that is dug anywhere in the ten directions Since space is everywhere throughout the ten directions how could it be limited to one particular place In fact the primary element space becomes apparent to beings in accord with their karma In their ignorance beings in this world mistakenly suppose that space comes into existence from causes and conditions or that it comes into being on its own These are distinctions and constructs made by the conscious mind They are mere words devoid of meaning The Primary Element Awareness nanda you do not become visually aware unless space and visible objects are present For example you are now in Prince Jetris Grove where it is light in the morning and dark in the evening It is bright at midnight when a full moon has risen but dark when there is no moon At these times you can discern light and darkness because of your visual awareness Now is your visual awareness identical to light and darkness and to space Is it separate from them Is it neither identical to them nor separate from them But consider light and darkness each disappears in the presence of the other When it is dark it is not light and when it is light it is not dark Therefore if your visual awareness were identical to darkness it would disappear when it is light If instead it were identical to light it would cease to exist when it is dark Once it had ceased to exist how could it see either darkness or light And how could it be identical to light and darkness given that they are not present at the same time whereas visual awareness neither comes into being nor ceases to be Suppose that your visual awareness is not identical to light or to darkness Then in the absence of light darkness and space can you determine what attributes your visual awareness might have in and of itself In the absence of light darkness and space a visual awareness such as this would be no more possible that a turtle with fur or a rabbit with horns Therefore without these three  light darkness and space  how could your visual awareness come to exist Since light and darkness are opposites how could your visual awareness be identical to them On the other hand since your visual awareness cannot exist in and of itself and apart from these three how could it be different from them Further no division can be discerned between your visual awareness and space there is no boundary between them How is it that they are not identical Yet when you see light and then darkness the nature of your visual awareness does not change How is it that they are not different You should examine this question in even greater detail Examine it minutely consider it most carefully Light comes from the sun and it is dark on a moonless night We see through space but not through earth But what causes our visual awareness as we have just described it to come into being Its nature is to perceive while space is insentient so they cannot merge or become aggregated with one another  THE SEVEN PRIMARY ELEMENTS Given that the fundamental natures of visual awareness awareness of sounds and cognitive awareness are allpervasive and do not change you should know that the real natures of what we may consider to be six primary elements  our visual awareness infinite motionless space and earth water fire and wind which are in motion  are completely interfused with one another In their fundamental natures all are within the Matrix of the ThusCome One neither coming into being nor ceasing to be nanda your basic disposition has become so murky that you do not realize that fundamentally your visual awareness your awareness of sounds your tactile awareness and your cognitive awareness are the Matrix of the ThusCome One You should contemplate your visual awareness your awareness of sounds and odors your tactile awareness and your cognitive awareness do they come into being and cease to be Are they identical to each other or are they different Or else do they neither come into being nor cease to be Are they neither identical to each other nor different You still do not know that the real nature of your visual awareness is inherent in the Matrix of the ThusCome One and identical to your enlightened understanding and that the essence of enlightenment is your illuminating awareness Fundamentally pure it extends throughout the DharmaRealm The extent to which beings are aware of its real nature depends on the capacity of their understanding Just as the awareness of one sensefaculty the eye extends throughout the DharmaRealm so also do the wondrous resplendent powers of hearing smelling tasting tactile awareness and cognitive awareness extend throughout the DharmaRealm They fill up the entirety of space throughout the ten directions How could they be limited to one particular place In their ignorance ordinary beings mistakenly suppose that visual awareness comes into existence from causes and conditions or that it  All six consciousnesses are understood to be included in this and similar passages throughout The Primary Element Consciousness nanda the nature of consciousness is that it has no real basis Its coming into existence in response to the six faculties and their objects is an illusion Look around now at the sages assembled here As you glance from one to another your eyes see them as if in a mirror which does not make distinctions But your consciousness will identify each of the sages in turn as Mañjuśrī Pūrṇamaitrāyaṇīputra Maudgalyāyana Subhūti and āriputra Now does this distinctionmaking faculty this primary element consciousness arise from your eyefaculty Does it arise from perceived objects Does it arise from space Or does it arise abruptly without a cause nanda suppose your primary element consciousness arose from your eyefaculty Then in the absence of light darkness objects and space  if none of these four were present  your eyefaculty would not function If your eyefaculty were not functioning what would cause your consciousness element to arise Suppose your consciousness arose from perceived objects rather than from the eyefaculty In that case you would not be seeing either light or darkness and if you were not aware of light or darkness you would not be aware of objects and space either If you could not see any of these how could your consciousness element arise out of them Suppose your consciousness element arose from space rather than from perceived objects or from the eyefaculty But without the eyefaculty nothing visible can be perceived and so you would not be aware of light darkness perceived objects or space If no perceived objects were present before your eyefaculty then the conditions for seeing would be absent and there would be no place for seeing to occur However space is identical to nothingness And even if space were something it is not the same as an actual perceived object If space nevertheless caused your consciousness to arise how would you be able to make distinctions about anything Suppose your consciousness appears abruptly without any cause Why then doesnt the moon suddenly start shining in broad daylight You should examine this question even more closely and in more detail Seeing is a function of your eyefaculty Consciousness is active while the eyefaculty is still and so they cannot combine or be aggregated with each other Given that the primary element consciousness is not caused by any of these factors you should know that your distinctionmaking eyeconsciousness earconsciousness bodyconsciousness and mindconsciousness do not come from anywhere all are complete and pure and do not come into being from anything The real natures of what we may call the seven primary elements  these last two together with space earth water fire and wind  are completely interfused with one another In their fundamental natures all are within the Matrix of the ThusCome One and are one with the Matrix of the ThusCome One neither coming into being nor ceasing to be nanda your mind is coarse and shallow You have not realized that fundamentally your eyeconsciousness earconsciousness and your discerning distinctionmaking mindconsciousness are all inherent in the Matrix of the ThusCome One You should contemplate all of your six consciousnesses are they identical to each other or are they different  THE MATRIX OF THE THUSCOME ONE Do they exist or are they empty Are they neither identical to each other nor different Are they neither existent nor empty He is not paying close attention to what is going on You simply do not know that the primary element consciousness is inherent in the Matrix of the ThusCome One and is the enlightened understanding and that the illumination of enlightenment is the true consciousness It is the wondrous and pure enlightenment that extends throughout the DharmaRealm It contains all space throughout the ten directions In their ignorance ordinary beings mistakenly suppose that consciousness comes into existence from causes and conditions or that it comes into being on its own They are mere words devoid of real meaning   nandas Vow At that time nanda and the rest of the great assembly having received the subtle and wondrous instruction given by the Buddha the ThusCome One felt that their bodies and minds were emptied and hardly seemed to exist They were free of all concerns and impediments All in the assembly became aware that their minds pervaded the ten directions and that they could see everything throughout space in all ten directions as clearly as one might see an object such as a leaf in the palm of ones hand They saw that all things in all worlds are the wondrous fundamental enlightened luminous mind that understands and that this mind pure allpervading and perfect contains the entire universe They looked back upon their own bodies born of their parents and saw them to be like minute particles of dust drifting about everywhere in the air arising and perishing or like solitary bubbles floating on vast calm seas appearing and then vanishing without a trace They fully understood that the fundamental wondrous mind is everlasting and does not perish Their bodies and minds were emptied means that basically there wasnt anything at all Then nanda having understood what he had not understood before bowed to the Buddha and placing his palms together spoke these verses in the Buddhas praise The deep and wondrous honored one allknowing pure and still ūraṅgama the King of Mantras rarest in the world Extinguishes distorted thoughts from countless eons past  No need to wait forever to attain the Dharmabody I vow to reach enlightenment and as a DharmaKing Return to rescue beings countless as the Ganges sands This deep resolve I offer in the myriad Buddhalands By this may I repay the kindness shown me by the Buddha I ask the Buddha to be witness as I take this vow To enter first the murky realms of five turbidities If even just one being still has not become a Buddha Then I will wait before I seek the leisure of nirvana Greatest in valor and in power Great Compassionate One I pray youll now eradicate the subtlest of my doubts And lead me quickly to attain supreme enlightenment And sit within the places for awakening everywhere See part  IV The Coming into Being of the World of Illusion   Adding Understanding to Understanding Then Pūrṇamaitrāyaṇīputra stood up amidst the great assembly He uncovered his right shoulder knelt with his right knee on the ground respectfully placed his palms together and said to the Buddha WorldHonored One you who are foremost in virtue and in inspiring awe have just now eloquently proclaimed for the sake of all beings the ultimate truth taught by the ThusCome Ones The ThusCome One has often praised me as the one most skilled in expounding the Dharma but as I have been listening to the ThusCome Ones voice as he has been setting forth such subtle and wonderful Dharma I might as well be a deaf man trying to hear a mosquito from a distance of more than a hundred paces Such a man could not even see the mosquito let alone hear it Although the Buddhas clear explanations have largely dispelled my doubts I have not yet reached the point at which I might thoroughly understand this truth and so be free of doubt entirely WorldHonored One although nanda and those like him have become enlightened they have not yet put an end to their habits and outflows But I am among those in the assembly who are free of outflows And yet having just now heard the Buddha explain this Dharma I find that I am assailed by doubts WorldHonored One if in fact the aggregates the faculties the various perceived objects and the consciousnesses are all the Matrix of the ThusCome One which is itself fundamentally pure then how is it that suddenly there came into being the mountains the rivers and all else on this earth that exists subject to conditions And why are all these subject to a succession of changes ending and then beginning again The ThusCome One also said that everywhere throughout the DharmaRealm the primary elements  earth water fire and wind  are in their fundamental nature completely interfused with each other tranquil and everlasting  THE COMING INTO BEING OF THE WORLD OF ILLUSION earth extended everywhere throughout the DharmaRealm how could it coexist with water How may we understand that primary elements water and fire can both pervade empty space without overcoming each other in mutual annihilation WorldHonored One the nature of the primary element earth is that it is solid while the nature of the primary element space is that it is a transparent void How could they both exist everywhere throughout the DharmaRealm I only hope that out of great kindness the ThusCome One will explain this to all of us and so clear away the clouds of our confusion Having made his request Pūrṇa bowed to the ground and then waited respectfully and earnestly to hear the ThusCome Ones sublime and compassionate instruction Then the WorldHonored One said to Pūrṇa and to all the other Arhats in the assembly who were all free of outflows and needed no further instruction Today for the sake of everyone in the assembly the ThusCome One will explain the most supreme truth among all supreme truths so that all the Hearers of the Teaching in this assembly who have no further aspirations and all of you Arhats who have not yet experienced the two kinds of emptiness but have turned toward the Great Vehicle as well as others may enter the true araṇya  the still and quiet place the state of genuine practice that will lead you to become Buddhas Listen carefully as I explain Pūrṇa and all the others out of reverence for the sound of the Buddhas words of Dharma listened in silent respect The Buddha continued Pūrṇa you have asked me why the mountains the rivers and everything else on this great earth have come into being from the Matrix of the ThusCome One which is fundamentally pure Now have you not often heard the ThusCome One speak of the wondrous understanding which is intrinsic to our inherent enlightenment to our fundamental wondrous luminous understanding Pūrṇa replied Yes WorldHonored One I have often heard the Buddha expound upon this Inherent enlightenment refers to each persons truly enlightened nature The Buddha said When we talk about this understanding which characterizes enlightenment do we mean an understanding that is intrinsic to our inherent enlightened nature Such an enlightenment would indeed lack understanding if understanding were not added But an enlightenment that lacks understanding cannot be the true intrinsic enlightenment that is inherently pure and endowed  THE COMING INTO BEING OF THE WORLD OF ILLUSION with understanding because understanding is already inherent in enlightenment Once an understanding is added an object is established This is the source of your deluded thinking In this way subjectivity is created  That is beings considered uniform yet differentiated because all share sentience while taking various forms The turmoil of this mutual complementarity gives rise to mental strain and as the mental strain is prolonged grasping at objects of mind begins Motion becomes the world of perceived objects and stillness is distinguished as space In addition to space which is undifferentiated and the world which is differentiated are conditioned phenomena that are neither differentiated nor the same That disturbance becomes the disk of wind that is the essence of the primary element wind and this disk then supports the world of perceived objects This solidity is the disk of vajra which is the essence of the primary element earth This is how from the firm attachment to the light of the added understanding the disk of vajra which holds the world together comes into being From the friction between the disk of wind and the disk of vajra there arises the light of the disk of fire which is characterized by changeability Moisture arises from the shining of the disk of vajra and turns to vapor in the presence of fire Thus the disk of water comes into being and encompasses the worlds in the ten directions As fire flares up and water descends their interaction brings about solidity From the primary element water the oceans come into being while the continents and islands come into being from the primary element earth Thus fire sometimes emerges from the oceans and rivers and streams flow across the lands These distorted interactions together produce the seeds that become the causes for the perpetuation of the world of perceived objects Further Pūrṇa you should know that beings deluded understanding is due simply to the error of adding an understanding to inherent enlightenment When the light is seen clearly deluded thoughts arise  both hatred in response to incompatible points of view and love in response to compatible ways of thinking They ascend or fall entirely in accord with their karma These are the causes and conditions for the perpetuation of beings Pūrṇa beings bind themselves to each other with their thoughts of love love so strong that they cannot bear to be apart and thus there come into being all the worlds fathers mothers children and grandchildren in an uninterrupted succession of births The root of all this is emotional desire Because of excessive desire and emotional love all crave nourishment a craving which will not cease Because of greed and love they must have a body and life once they have body and life all have the desire to nourish them   ADDING UNDERSTANDING TO UNDERSTANDING whether born from eggs via metamorphosis in the presence of moisture or from a womb devour one another and are in turn devoured each according to the measure of its strength or weakness The root of all this is the desire to kill The slaughtered sheep is reborn as a human When the human who ate the sheep dies he in turn becomes a sheep This pattern holds among all ten kinds of beings as they devour one another in a continuing cycle of death and rebirth The evil karma of this mutual devouring accompanies each of them from life to life to the farthest reaches of the future Suppose you are in debt to someone for having taken his life he will want to take your life in repayment Due to such causes and conditions beings must pass through hundreds of thousands of eons in an everlasting succession of deaths and rebirths The roots of all this are killing stealing and emotional love Those three and nothing else are the causes and conditions for the perpetuation of retribution in accord with karma Pūrṇa these three distorted perpetuations ultimately derive from adding an understanding to inherent enlightenment From this added understanding a false understanding arises From that a deluded awareness brings into being the mountains the rivers and all the other  The third of the perpetuations Due to that illusory awareness we experience the world as constantly changing patterns which are perpetually coming into our awareness and then disappearing   The Buddhas Enlightenment Is Irreversible Pūrṇa then asked If our wondrous enlightenment is fundamentally wondrous awake and endowed with luminous understanding and if the mind of the ThusCome One neither increases nor diminishes how is it then that all beings and all conditioned phenomena  the mountains the rivers and everything else on earth  suddenly arise without a reason Also now that the ThusCome One has realized wondrous emptiness and understanding will the mountains the rivers and all other conditioned phenomena on this earth as well as the habits and outflows of beings ever arise for him again This section of text voices Pūrṇas doubt The Buddha said to Pūrṇa Consider the analogy of someone who loses his way in a village and becomes confused about which way is north and which way is south Pūrṇa replied He is lost neither because of confusion nor because of understanding Confusion has no basis in reality and so how can it be a cause of his being lost As for understanding how could that be a cause of being lost The Buddha said Suppose this confused person who has become lost in the village unexpectedly meets someone who knows which direction is which and who points out the way to him so that he understands He was lost in the village but now will he become lost again  THE COMING INTO BEING OF THE WORLD OF ILLUSION He will not WorldHonored One The same is true Pūrṇa of the ThusCome Ones throughout the ten directions Confusion has no basis in reality In its very nature it is ultimately empty There never was anything real about the confusion it only seems that there have been confusion and understanding Once one has awakened from ones confusion the confusion disappears and from that awakening no confusion can arise again Or again a person with an eyedisease may see a mirage of flowers in the air but once the disease is cured the flowers he saw in the air will disappear Suppose that person is foolish enough to look up at the place where the flowers disappeared and expect to see them reappear Would you consider such a person to be foolish or wise Pūrṇa replied There never were any flowers in the air Seeing the flowers disappear into the air was also a distortion To expect them to reappear would be foolish to the point of madness How could one possibly call such a crazed person merely foolish much less call him wise The Buddha replied Since you understand that why have you asked whether mountains the rivers and everything else in this world will arise again for the Buddhas who are the ThusCome Ones and who have realized wondrous emptiness and luminous understanding Again consider the example of a gold mine The ore contains gold mixed with impurities Once the gold has been refined it will not revert to ore Nor will wood that has burned to ash ever become wood again The same is true of the nirvana that is the full awakening realized by all Buddhas the ThusCome Ones   The Interfusing of the Primary Elements Pūrṇa you have also asked how it is that the primary elements  earth water fire and wind  are in their fundamental natures completely interfused with each other everywhere throughout the DharmaRealm You also asked why it is that the primary elements space and earth can both exist everywhere throughout the DharmaRealm while being incompatible with each other Consider Pūrṇa that the essential attribute of space is the absence of anything else still that does not prevent everything else from appearing within it How can that be Pūrṇa It darkens when clouds gather There is movement through it when the wind blows After a rain the sun reappears and the air is clear A turbid mist arises when water condenses out of the air Do these various conditioned phenomena appearing in different circumstances come into being because of these conditions or do they come into being from space Suppose Pūrṇa that these phenomena arise because of the circumstances just mentioned Then for example when the sun is shining does the brightness in the air come into being because the sun is shining If so then the sun should be everywhere in the ten directions Why do we see it as a distinct round object in the sky If on the other hand the brightness of the sky comes into being because of space then all of space would be shining of its own accord Why is it not resplendent with light at midnight or when there are clouds or fog It should be clear to you that the brightness in the sky is not due to the sun or to space although the brightness cannot be present without both the sun and space The same can be said of the true wondrous understanding which is enlightenment Earth water fire and wind  THE COMING INTO BEING OF THE WORLD OF ILLUSION each appear within enlightenment if one establishes each of them as categories All of them appear interfused together in enlightenment if one establishes the category all How can they all appear together Pūrṇa it is like the suns reflection in a body of water When two people who are observing the reflection move apart one to the east and one to the west they will each see the suns reflection moving along with them The reflection moves east with the person moving east and west with the person moving west in itself the reflection has no fixed location Do not quibble by asking how a single reflection can move in two separate directions And do not ask how the two reflections appeared previously as one Such questions concern mere illusions and nothing about reality can be established from them But within the Matrix of the ThusCome One space and the world of perceived objects are everywhere throughout the DharmaRealm Movement associated with wind the stillness associated with space the brightness associated with the sun and the darkness associated with clouds are all present within the Matrix of the ThusCome One Beings however suffocated by their confusion turn their backs on enlightenment and embrace this world of perceived objects Amidst the stress of beings entanglement with perceived objects the world of conditioned phenomena appears Within it therefore the one is infinitely many and the infinitely many are one The great appears within the small just as the small appears within the great I sit unmoving in this still place for awakening and my Dharmabody extends everywhere and encompasses the infinity of space in all ten directions On the tip of a fine hair magnificent Buddhalands appear Thus the Matrix of the ThusCome One  the fundamental wondrous perfect mind  is not the distinctionmaking mind nor is it space nor is it earth nor water nor wind nor fire It is not the eyefaculty nor the earfaculty nor the nosefaculty nor the tonguefaculty nor the bodyfaculty nor the cognitive faculty Neither is it visible objects nor sounds nor odors nor flavors nor objects of touch nor objects of cognition It is not the eyeconsciousness nor the mindconsciousness nor any of the other consciousnesses It is neither the fundamental ignorance that is the adding of an understanding to our inherent enlightenment nor the ending of that ignorance nor is it old age and death nor the ending of old age and death Neither is it the fundamentally unsatisfying nature of  These are the first and the last two of the twelve links in the chain of dependent coarising Skt  THE COMING INTO BEING OF THE WORLD OF ILLUSION existence nor is it the accumulation of the causes of dissatisfaction nor the ending of dissatisfaction nor the path to the ending of dissatisfaction It is neither wisdom nor the attaining of wisdom It is none of the six perfections  neither giving nor following precepts nor vigor nor patience nor mindfulness nor wisdom Nor is it anything else  not the realization of the enlightenment of the Buddha who is the ThusCome One the Arhat the One of Right and Universal Wisdom It is not the permanence the bliss the true self or the purity of the great nirvana dāna śīla vīrya kṣānti dhyāna and prajñā The word pāramītā has the sense of that which brings one across the sea of suffering to the shores of nirvana  Arhat is here a titular name for the Buddha as is One of Right and Universal Wisdom Skt Yet it is the distinctionmaking mind it is space it is earth it is water it is wind it is fire It is the eyefaculty the earfaculty the nosefaculty the tonguefaculty the bodyfaculty and the cognitive faculty It is visible objects it is sounds it is odors it is flavors it is objects of touch and it is objects of cognition It is the eyeconsciousness the earconsciousness and all the other consciousnesses It is that fundamental ignorance which is the adding of an understanding to our inherent enlightenment and it is the ending of that ignorance it is old age and death and the ending of old age and death It is also the fundamentally unsatisfying nature of existence the accumulation of the causes of dissatisfaction the ending of dissatisfaction and the path to the ending of dissatisfaction It is everything including the ThusCome One who is the Arhat and the One of Right and Universal Wisdom It is the permanence bliss true self and purity of the great nirvana It is every one of these be they mundane or worldtranscending To be all of these is what the Matrix of the ThusCome One is The Matrix of the ThusCome One is identical with worldly and worldtranscending phenomena and yet is not identical with them It both is and is not identical to them and neither is nor is not identical to them  THE COMING INTO BEING OF THE WORLD OF ILLUSION How then with their conscious minds could beings who are bound to worlds in the three realms of existence  or even worldtranscending Hearers of the Teaching and the Solitary Sages  possibly fathom the supreme awakening of the ThusCome Ones How could they gain the Buddhas ability to know and to see merely by using the worlds words Marvelous sounds can be brought forth from lutes harps and mandolins only when there are skilled fingers to play them In the same way all beings including you are fully endowed with the resplendent enlightened true mind When I arrange my fingers to form the oceanmudra the light of the oceanmudra samādhi shines forth But the moment a thought arises in your mind you must endure the stress of involvement with perceived objects Instead you are fond of the Lesser Vehicle and are content with a lesser goal  That is the distinctionmaking mind of the sixth consciousness   Delusion Has No Basis The Parable of Yajñadatta Pūrṇa said The ThusCome One and I are alike in that we are both fully endowed with the precious awakened perfect luminous true wondrous pure mind that understands Nevertheless for a time without beginning I was plagued with the deluded acts of my mind and for a long time I was bound to the cycle of death and rebirth Although I have since become a sage my enlightenment is not fully perfected whereas the WorldHonored One has put an end to all delusion so that only what is wondrous true and everlasting remains I venture to ask the ThusCome One why all beings suffer from delusion Why do they keep covered their wondrous luminous understanding so that they continue to be submerged in sasāra The Buddha said to Pūrṇa You have put your coarser doubts to rest but your more subtle doubts have not yet been ended I will now question you about this matter by referring to a mundane event Have you not heard about Yajñadatta the man from rāvastī who saw a face with perfectly clear features in the mirror one morning and became enraptured with it Then he became upset because he supposed he had lost his own face It struck him that he must have turned into a headless ghost For no good reason he ran madly out of his house What do you think What caused this man to run madly about for no good reason Pūrṇa replied He was clearly insane     THE COMING INTO BEING OF THE WORLD OF ILLUSION The Buddha said The luminous understanding of wondrous enlightenment is perfect that fundamental perfect luminous understanding is wondrous How could there be in it any basis for what is clearly a delusion And if there were a basis for this delusion how could it be what we call deluded Because they do not realize that confusion is based only on confusion their confusion persists They need merely to realize that confusion has no ultimate basis and the basis of their deluded thoughts will disappear There is no need for them to wish that the cause of their confusion would disappear because no cause existed in the first place Thus someone who has become fully enlightened is like one who relates the events of a dream from which he has just awakened His mind is now sharp and clear what reason could he have then to wish to try to return to his dream to obtain some object that he had dreamt of You encounter confusion and it seems to really exist but actually it is an illusion Confusion lacks any real existence In the same way there was no reason for Yajñadattas experience that day in the city Were his madness to suddenly cease it would not be because he had recovered his head from anywhere outside of himself How could his head have actually been missing even while he was still in his madness Pūrṇa the same is true of the essential nature of delusion Where could its basis lie Consider for example a person who does not know that a wishfulfilling pearl is sewn into his coat Destitute and homeless wandering from place to place as he begs for his food he is indeed poor but his wishfulfilling pearl is still with him Then it so happens that someone wise points out his pearl to him and now it can fulfill his every wish He becomes very rich and he realizes that his magical pearl can only have come from within himself  When nanda speaks next he restates what he takes to be the Buddhas position here and he identifies these three conditions as killing stealing and sexual desire The three causes are not defined in the text anger desire and delusion the three poisons of the mind are probably meant Then nanda came forward from his place in the great assembly to bow at the Buddhas feet He stood and said to the Buddha WorldHonored One you have just now been saying that once we put to rest the karmas of killing stealing and sexual desire so that these three conditions no longer arise their three causes will not become active again  DELUSION HAS NO BASIS THE PARABLE OF YAJADATTA Then the madness in our minds that is like Yajñadattas madness will cease of its own accord and that ceasing itself is full awakening which no one else can bestow upon us Isnt all this clearly an example of the working of causes and conditions Why then does the ThusCome One now reject the doctrine of causes and conditions WorldHonored One it was through hearing about causes and conditions that I became enlightened as did others of us younger Hearers of the Teaching who still need instruction Here also in this assembly now are MahāMaudgalyāyana āriputra Subhūti and others who once followed Brahmin elders They too heard the teaching about causes and conditions and as a result they made the resolve to enter the monastic life They put an end to their outflows and became enlightened Now you say that one does not after all realize enlightenment through causes and conditions If that is so the ultimate truth must be what Maskari Gośālīputra and those others in Rājagṛha teach  that enlightenment happens on its own I only hope that now the Buddha will compassionately clear up the confusion which has been suffocating us The Buddha said to nanda Let us compare what you have said to the case of Yajñadatta in rāvastī If the causes and conditions for his madness were to disappear his sanity would naturally reappear on its own nanda his head was just as it always was It was already fundamentally part of him Otherwise he would not have been who he was How then could causes and conditions be involved in his running madly about out of fear that his face had disappeared But if his madness were indeed due to causes and conditions wouldnt causes and conditions have also led to his head actually disappearing Yet his head has always been present His madness and terror arose from delusion No actual change  See part  note  And if his madness were fundamentally part of him  if madness and terror were the way he was in the first place  then why would his madness not have been already evident But if his madness was not fundamentally part of him  if he was not deluded about his head all along  why did he run madly about Had Yajñadatta awakened and realized that his head was fundamentally part of him he would have understood that his running about was madness That is why I said that once the three causes and three conditions are eliminated the enlightened mind is revealed In truth the effortless path to enlightenment is the ending of both arising and perishing Suppose further that it is possible that the enlightened mind could come into being on its own Then it should be clear that it would come into being only with the perishing of the mind that comes into being and ceases to be But that is still a coming into being and ceasing to be Do not think that something which does not arise and perish must therefore be said to have come into being on its own For example a mixture is said to be created when components with different attributes are combined In fact what is fundamental is not fundamental what is mixed is not in fact a mixture Neither what is mixed nor what is fundamental exists Yet the nonexistence of the mixed and the fundamental must also be negated Only then do we have a teaching that may be called Dharma that is more than mere speculation  DELUSION HAS NO BASIS THE PARABLE OF YAJADATTA For you awakening and nirvana are still so distant that you will have to spend eons in difficult practice before you will reach them Your ability to memorize all twelve types of discourse spoken by the Buddha and proclaimed by the ThusCome Ones in all ten directions  with their pure and wondrous truths innumerable as the River Ganges sands  has merely helped you to indulge in idle speculation Certainly you have the ability to speak about causes and conditions and about things coming into being on their own with such understanding that people call you foremost in erudition yet despite your many eons of accumulated learning you were not able escape your difficulty with the young Mātaṅga woman Therefore nanda the many eons you have spent committing to memory the ThusCome Ones esoteric inconceivable wondrous and majestic Dharma are not equal to a single day spent cultivating karma that is free of outflows and is far removed from the two worldly torments of hate and love The young Mātaṅga woman was a courtesan and yet her love and desire were dispelled by the spiritual power of the mantra now she is a nun named Prakṛti She and Rāhulas mother Yaśodharā have both become aware of their previous lives and they know that among the causes of their actions during many lifetimes their craving for emotional love was the cause of their suffering Now they have escaped their  The twelve are prose passages reiterative verses instructional verses teachings concerning causation narratives accounts of the Buddhas previous lives accounts of manifestations of spiritual power analogies questions and answers concerning doctrine teachings spoken without request broadenings of the teaching and predictions of enlightenment  Skt V Instructions for Practice   Five Layers of Turbidity Once again nanda wept as he bowed at the Buddhas feet Then he knelt and with his palms joined he said respectfully to the Buddha The Supreme Compassionate Pure and Noble King has skillfully opened our minds In response to our various situations and circumstances he has been able to urge us on and to pull us benighted ones out of the sea of suffering in which we have been drowning WorldHonored One now that I have heard the Buddha explain this Dharma I know that the Matrix of the ThusCome One which is the wondrous enlightened mind that understands extends throughout all ten directions I know that it encompasses and supports the lands of the ThusCome Ones in all ten directions  those pure and splendid lands of the Wondrous Enlightened Kings However the ThusCome One has also admonished me for merely listening to the Dharma without applying it to my practice Now therefore I am like a wanderer who unexpectedly meets a celestial king The king bestows upon the wanderer a magnificent house The house is now his yet in order to go in he will still need to find a door I only hope that the ThusCome One will not withhold his compassion from all of us in this assembly who are covered in darkness so that we may renounce the Lesser Vehicle May he show us the road that leads from our original resolve to the ThusCome Ones bodiless nirvana May he enable those of us who still need instruction to subdue our ageold habit of dependence on the objects of the senses to master the dhāraṇī and to gain the wisdom and vision of the Buddhas Having made this request nanda bowed to the ground and all in the assembly singlemindedly awaited the Buddhas compassionate instruction Then the WorldHonored One took pity on all the Hearers of the Teaching and on the Solitary Sages in the assembly who did not yet abide  Skt anupadhiśeṣa nirvāṇa Ch  The ūraṅgama Mantra  instructions for practice effortlessly in the fully awakened mind He took pity also on the beings who would be born after the Buddhas bodiless nirvana during the time of the Dharmas ending He revealed the wondrous path of practice in accord with the Supreme Vehicle so that all would resolve their minds upon becoming fully awake What are these two definitive principles The first of the two nanda is that all of you who wish to renounce the Lesser Vehicle of the Hearers of the Teaching and to practice in accord with the Vehicle of the Bodhisattvas so that you can gain the wisdom and vision of the Buddhas must examine the resolve that is the basis of your practice that leads to  five layers of turbidity enlightenment Is this resolve identical to the awakening that will be the result of your practice or is it not If the mind that comes into being and ceases is the basis of your practice nanda then you will not be able to ride the Buddhas Vehicle to where there is nothing that comes into being or ceases to be For this reason you should shine the light of your understanding on the phenomena of the material world Since all phenomena are subject to change and decay how could any of them serve as a basis for the practice of Dharma Contemplate the phenomena of the world nanda which one of them does not decay But you will never hear of space decaying Space is unconditioned and so it has never been and can never be subject to dissolution In your own body what appears as solid is composed of the primary element earth what is moist contains the primary element water what has warmth belongs to the primary element fire and movement constitutes the primary element wind Because these four primary elements are bound together your pure perfect wondrous enlightened mind that understands is divided into the functions of seeing listening touching and cognition Turbidity in five layers comes about as a result What is turbidity nanda Let us consider an example Water in its original state is pure and clear while soil ashes and sand in their original states are solid and opaque These defining attributes of water and of soil ashes and sand are such that they are mutually incompatible Suppose that someone were to pick up some soil and throw it into clear water The soil now loses its solidity and the water loses its purity As you look into space throughout all ten directions nanda no separation can be made between space and your visual awareness of it With this entanglement based on delusion the turbidity of time comes into being This is the first layer of turbidity Your body is composed of the four primary elements Your visual awareness your hearing your tactile awareness and your mental awareness become strictly defined while water fire wind and earth participate in bringing about the attributes of the faculties that have awareness Thus awareness and the primary elements become entangled with each other With this entanglement based on delusion the turbidity of perception comes into being  five layers of turbidity identity Objects you perceive and your mindconsciousness become entangled with each other With this entanglement based on delusion the mind becomes turbid with afflictions These afflictions are the third layer of turbidity Further by night and by day beings ceaselessly come into being and perish They always desire to continue to experience the world indefinitely through their faculties of perception Their karma leads them to continually move from one land to another Their thoughts and their karma become entangled with each other and with this entanglement based on delusion there is the fourth layer the turbidity of individual beings The consciousnesses and their objects are no longer in their correct relationship They become entangled with each other and with this entanglement based on delusion there is the fifth layer the turbidity of lifespans nanda now you wish to transform your visual aural tactile and mental awareness together with the other kinds of awareness into the permanence bliss true self and purity of the ThusCome One To accomplish this you must pull out the root of death and rebirth and rely on that pure and perfect nature that neither comes into being nor ceases to be Use the purity of your true nature to make disappear the distinction between your original state of enlightenment and the illusory state of what comes into being and ceases to be The original enlightened understanding which neither comes into being nor ceases to be must be the basis of your practice Then you will attain the awakening that will be the result of your practice The process may be compared to the settling of turbid water If you keep it undisturbed in a container so that it is completely still and quiet  This is the first of the two definitive principles mentioned just above  instructions for practice the sand and silt in it will settle naturally and the water will become clear This may be compared to the initial stage of subduing the afflictions that arise from transitory perceptions of objects If the mud is completely removed from the water then you will have rid yourself of your fundamental ignorance forever   Choosing One Faculty in Order to Liberate All Six The second principle is that if you are resolved to become fully awakened you must courageously dedicate yourself to practice in accord with the Bodhisattva Vehicle You must decisively let go of everything that has conditioned attributes Carefully examine the source of your afflictions which since time without beginning have created your karma and nurtured its growth Who is it that creates this karma and undergoes retribution If during your quest for full awakening nanda you do not examine and contemplate the sources of affliction you will not be able to understand the illusory and distorted nature of the perceiving faculties and their objects At what point did you become so disoriented If you do not know that how can you expect to subdue your afflictions and aspire to becoming a Buddha nanda consider some worldly person who wishes to untie a knot If he cannot see the knot how will he know how to untie it You have never heard of space being broken into parts Space has no shape or form Therefore it can neither be divided nor put together again But now your eyes ears nose tongue body and mind are like conspirators who have introduced thieves into your house to plunder your valuables In this way since time without beginning beings and the world of time and space have been tied to each other because of illusion and that is why beings cannot transcend this world People think that the six faculties are helpful but actually it is just these six destructive things that steal the Dharmajewels of our true nature People consider their eyes ears nose tongue body and mind to be their best friends What do I mean nanda by beings and the world of time and space Time denotes flux and change space denotes location and direction You already know that the directions are north south east west northeast southeast northwest southwest above and below while time is divided into past present and future Thus locations are tenfold and the flow of time is threefold making ten directions and three periods of time Because beings are entangled in illusion they constantly move about in time and space which become interconnected Although space can be defined as extending in ten directions and can be clearly understood as such people in general only take account of north south east and west They do not consider above and below to be specific directions and they see the four intermediate directions as merely relative to the others while the four cardinal points are understood to be fixed Therefore we can say that space is fourfold and time threefold and that the three times and four directions multiplied together make a total of twelve Again if we multiply these numbers in three stages first by each other to make twelve next by ten and then again by ten we reach a total of twelve hundred In front of you there is light but behind you there is darkness Adding in your partial vision at your left and right your capacity to see is effective by only two thirds The overall efficacy of the eyefaculty then is incomplete in that it functions in three directions but not in the fourth Know then that the efficacy of the eyefaculty may be expressed as eight hundred Consider the ability of the earfaculty to hear in all ten directions without exception When there is silence our hearing is unbounded Know then that the efficacy of the earfaculty may be expressed as twelve hundred Consider the ability of the nosefaculty to smell The breath moves through the nose in and out But in the space between inhaling and exhaling the breath is lacking Upon examination we can say that the nosefaculty is lacking one of three aspects Know then that the efficacy of the nosefaculty may be expressed as eight hundred Consider the ability of the tonguefaculty to proclaim wisely both worldly and worldtranscending wisdom Languages differ from place to place but meanings know no boundary Know then that the efficacy of the tonguefaculty may be expressed as twelve hundred Consider the ability of the bodyfaculty to be aware of contact It has awareness upon contact and lacks awareness once there is separation Separation is a single quality while contact is twofold Upon examination then we may say that the bodyfaculty is lacking in one of three aspects Know then that the efficacy of the bodyfaculty may be expressed as eight hundred Consider the ability of the cognitive faculty to silently include within its scope all worldly and worldtranscending phenomena in all ten directions and all three periods of time It excludes neither the thoughts of sages nor the distorted thoughts of ordinary beings it knows no boundary Know then that the efficacy of the cognitive faculty may be expressed as twelve hundred nanda you now wish to go upstream against the current of the river of desire which leads to death and rebirth You wish to go against the current that flows through the faculties until you reach the source where there is neither coming into being nor ceasing to be You should investigate how the six faculties function If you can discern which of your faculties can lead you to break through to enlightenment then you will be able to go upstream against the current that carries the karma in which due to your delusion you have been immersed since time without beginning One day of practice that relies on a fully effective faculty is equivalent to an eon of practice that relies on a faculty that is not fully effective I have already  choosing one faculty in order to liberate all six given you a full explanation of the fundamental purity and perfect clarity of the six faculties and I have now given numerical equivalents for the efficacy of each one It is up to you to choose carefully which one to concentrate on The ThusCome Ones in all ten directions chose one of the eighteen constituent elements of perception for their practice that led to their gaining the perfect supreme complete awakening For them none of the eighteen constituents was superior or inferior But because you are at a lower level and have not yet fully developed that wisdom which is independent of conditions I have explained all this to you in detail so that you will be able to choose one faculty as a gateway to deep practice If you take that path until you have left behind all distortion within that one faculty then all the other faculties will be purified as well nanda said respectfully to the Buddha WorldHonored One how can I choose one gateway that will allow me to reverse my outflows and purify all six of my faculties of perception at the same time The Buddha said to nanda You have already reached the level of one who has entered the stream of the sages and you have abandoned the deluded views held by beings in the three realms of existence But you still do not understand the illusory habits which you have accumulated in life after life since time without beginning Now you should consider whether the six faculties are one or six If they are one nanda why cant the ears see and why cant the eyes hear Why cant the head walk Why cant the feet speak If the six faculties are indeed six which one of them is now receiving my instruction in this subtle wondrous gateway to the Dharma as I explain it to this assembly nanda replied I am hearing it with my ears The Buddha said If it is just your ears that hear it do they then have  Skt And yet you ask about the teaching with your mouth and as you receive it you show your respect with your body Therefore  as to the idea that the faculties must be one if they are not six and that they must be six if they are not one  we cannot say that fundamentally they are both one and six nor can we say that they are neither one nor six In your disoriented state in which you have been sinking and undergoing change since time without beginning you have conceived the idea that there is one and six within the fundamental perfect clarity As a sage at the first level you have purified the six but you have not done away with the one Indeed how could the space be said to be either one or not one You should understand that the same is true of the six faculties of perception The essence of seeing is generated out of the wondrous perfection of the pure mind because it adheres to the appearance of the two attributes of light and darkness That essence of seeing then reveals the essence of visible objects and the two then become entangled with one another thus creating the essence of the eyefaculty The essence of the eyefaculty is composed of the four primary elements in their pure state and that is why it may be called the facultys essence The physical eye takes the shape of a grape and is composed of the four primary elements in their coarse state The eyefaculty recklessly races outward in pursuit of visible objects  choosing one faculty in order to liberate all six of the pure mind because it adheres to the two opposing attributes of sound and silence That essence of hearing then gathers into itself the essence of sound and the two then become entangled with one another thus creating the essence of the earfaculty The essence of the earfaculty is composed of the four primary elements in their pure state and that is why it may be called the facultys essence The physical ear takes the shape of a curled new leaf and is composed of the four primary elements in their coarse state The earfaculty recklessly races outward in pursuit of sounds The essence of smelling is generated out of the wondrous perfection of the pure mind because it adheres to the two contrasting attributes of openness and blockage The essence of smelling takes in the essence of odor and the two then become entangled with one another thus creating the essence of the nosefaculty The essence of the nosefaculty is composed of the four primary elements in their pure state and that is why it may be called the facultys essence The physical nose takes the shape of a pair of talons and is composed of the four primary elements in their coarse state The nosefaculty recklessly races outward in pursuit of odors The essence of tasting is generated out of the wondrous perfection of the pure mind because it adheres to the two interacting attributes of flavor and lack of flavor The essence of tasting mixes itself with the essence of flavor thus creating the essence of the tonguefaculty The essence of the tonguefaculty is composed of the four primary elements in their pure state and that is why it may be called the facultys essence The physical tongue takes the shape of a crescent moon and is composed of the four primary elements in their coarse state The tonguefaculty recklessly races outward in pursuit of flavors The essence of the sense of touch is generated out of the wondrous perfection of the pure mind because it adheres to the two interacting attributes of contact and separation The essence of tactile awareness seizes upon the essence of what is touched thus creating the essence of the bodyfaculty The essence of the bodyfaculty is composed of the four primary elements in their pure state and that is why it may be called  instructions for practice the facultys essence The physical body with its torso which takes the shape of a skincovered drum is composed of the four primary elements in their coarse form The bodyfaculty recklessly races outward in pursuit of tangible objects The essence of cognition is generated out of the wondrous perfection of the pure mind because it adheres to the two mutually perpetuating attributes of coming into being and perishing The essence of mental awareness grasps the essence of objects of cognition thus creating the essence of the cognitive faculty The essence of the cognitive faculty is composed of the four primary elements in their pure state and that is why it may be called the facultys essence The cognitive faculty which is as it were seen in a dark room responds to the four primary elements in their coarse form The mindfaculty recklessly flows outward in pursuit of mental objects If you were deprived of both the coming into being and perishing of the objects of cognition would your capacity for cognition still exist or would it not All that you need to do is not allow your attention to be diverted by the twelve conditioned attributes of sound and silence contact and separation flavor and the absence of flavor openness and blockage coming into being and perishing and light and darkness Next extricate one faculty by detaching it from its objects and redirect that faculty inward  choosing one faculty in order to liberate all six so that it can return to what is original and true Then it will radiate the light of the original understanding But you dont have to comply you dont have to be under their influence You can go against the current and decline to follow the twelve conditioned attributes of light and darkness sound and silence openness and blockage flavors and blandness contact and separation and coming into being and ceasing to be If your six faculties are freed from the objects that they perceive so that the light of your understanding is not diverted into one or another of the faculties then the light of your understanding will manifest through all the faculties so that all six of them will function interchangeably nanda you know do you not that here in this assembly Aniruddha is blind and yet can see that the dragon Upananda is deaf and yet can hear that the goddess of the River Ganges has no sense of smell and yet can discern fragrances that Gavāṃpatis malformed tongue cannot taste and yet he is aware of flavors and that the spirit ūnyatā is incorporeal but just now has a sense of touch  you can see him here temporarily as he is illumined by the light of the ThusCome One And like all who abide in the samādhi of cessation and who have attained the stillness of the Hearers of the Teaching Mahākāśyapa here in this assembly long ago caused his cognitive faculty to cease and yet without relying on the thinking mind his understanding is clear and perfect Once all your faculties are completely disengaged nanda a pure  Skt nirodhasamāpatti Ch mie jin ding  that is cessation of the sixth consciousness   instructions for practice brilliance will shine forth from within them Then all coarse perceived objects  indeed all phenomena subject to change in the material world  will be transformed just as ice is transformed when it melts in hot water nanda consider someone who seeing only with his eyes quickly closes his eyes so that total darkness surrounds him His six faculties will be enveloped in the darkness such that his eyes will not be able to distinguish the head from the feet on someone elses body But he will be able to tell the head and the foot apart if he traces their shape with his hands He will be able to identify them as accurately as he would have done by using his eyes In the same way once your faculties and their objects have melted away how could your awareness and understanding not become perfect and wondrous   The Example of the Bells Sound nanda said respectfully to the Buddha WorldHonored One as the Buddha has said when ones practice is based on the resolve to seek what is everlasting ones mind should be correlated to the mental state of the enlightenment that will be the result of ones practice This result WorldHonored One may be called Full Awakening Nirvana the Suchness of Reality the Buddhanature the Pure Consciousness the Emptiness of the Matrix of the ThusCome One and the Wisdom of the Great Perfect Mirror Those are seven different names for what is pure and perfect everlasting and indestructible that essential nature which is like the most durable vajra If ultimately seeing hearing and the other senseconsciousnesses do not exist on their own apart from light and darkness sound and silence openness and blockage and so forth then in the same way the mindconsciousness must cease to exist when it is apart from its own objects How then can these consciousnesses which will ultimately perish be the basis for practice as one strives for the ThusCome Ones everlasting realization as it is characterized by those seven names WorldHonored One suppose that in the final analysis no seeing can take place when neither light nor darkness are present In the same way no thoughtprocesses can take place if no objects are being presented to the faculty of cognition Then no matter how much I look here and look there going about in circles in an exhaustive search I can find nothing that fundamentally is my mind or my minds objects What the ThusCome One has just said contradicts his previous words about what is clear pure perfect and everlasting It seems to be mere speculation How can these words spoken by the ThusCome One be true  Skt  instructions for practice I only hope the Buddha out of his great kindness will set me free from the doubts that I am clinging to The Buddha said to nanda You are very learned but you have not yet put an end to your outflows You know the reasons for delusion but when you encounter delusion you fail to recognize it It is to be feared that though you are sincere you still do not quite trust the teaching I will have to make use of another everyday situation to dispel your doubts The Buddha then instructed Rāhula to strike the bell once and he asked nanda Do you hear nanda and the others in the assembly answered We hear When the bell had ceased ringing the Buddha asked again Now do you hear nanda and the others in the assembly answered We do not Then Rāhula struck the bell once more and the Buddha asked once again Now do you hear nanda and the others again replied We hear The Buddha asked nanda How is it that you heard and then did not hear nanda and the others said respectfully to the Buddha We heard the bell when it was struck but when at length the sounding of the bell had died away and its reverberations had faded we no longer were hearing The Buddha then instructed Rāhula to strike the bell yet again and he asked nanda Is there a sound now nanda and the others in the assembly answered Yes there is a sound In a little while the sound faded and the Buddha asked And now is there a sound nanda and the others replied There is no sound After a moment Rāhula again struck the bell and the Buddha asked again And is there a sound now nanda and the others said There is The Buddha asked nanda How is it that there was a sound and then no sound  the example of the bells sound nanda and the others in the assembly answered respectfully When the bell was struck there was a sound but when at length the sounding of the bell had died away and the reverberations had faded there was no longer any sound The Buddha said to nanda and the others in the assembly Why have you given such muddled answers nanda and the others thereupon asked the Buddha Why do you say that our answers were muddled The Buddha replied When I asked you whether you heard you said that you had heard When I asked if there was a sound you said that there was a sound Since you did not clearly distinguish between hearing and sound in your answer how could I not say that your answer was muddled nanda once the sounding of the bell and its reverberations had faded you said that you no longer heard If it were true that you had stopped hearing your essential capacity for hearing would have ceased to exist It would be like a dead tree that is unable to grow again in that you would have been unable to hear the bell if it were struck again You knew when the bells sound which is a perceived object was present and when it was absent But how could it be that your essential capacity for hearing was present and then absent If your essential capacity for hearing were in truth no longer present what then would be aware that the sound had ceased Therefore nanda although the sounds you hear come into being and cease to be neither the presence nor the subsequent absence of sound can cause your essential capacity for hearing to come into being and then cease to be You are still deluded In your confusion you take hearing and the presence of sound to be the same thing You consider something everlasting to be something that will come to an end In the final analysis it cannot be said that hearing in its essential nature is dependent on the presence of sound or silence or dependent on whether the ears are obstructed or unobstructed While he is sleeping someone in his household starts beating clothes or pounding rice The dreamer hears the sounds of the beating or the pounding and mistakes them for something else perhaps the striking of a drum or the ringing of a bell In his dream he wonders why the striking of the bell or drum sounds like clothes being beaten or like rice being pounded He wakes up suddenly and he immediately recognizes the sound of the pounding nanda how was it that this dreamer could have been conscious of sound or silence How was it that his ears were unobstructed and functioning Although his body was asleep the enlightened nature of his hearing did not sleep Even when the body wastes away its energy dissipates and its life force moves on how could that essential capacity to hear dissipate along with them  the example of the bells sound Nevertheless since beings have allowed their attention to be drawn to sights and sounds and have allowed themselves to be carried along in their streams of thought as it has been since time without beginning they have not yet awakened and do not yet understand the purity the wondrousness and the permanence of their own essential nature Instead of attending to what is everlasting they attend to what comes into being and perishes and as a result in life after life they are mired in impurity and are bound to the cycle of death and rebirth But if they turn away from what comes into being and perishes and hold fast to what is true and everlasting then the light of the everlasting will appear and as a result the faculties their objects and the senseconsciousnesses will fade away and disappear By entirely disengaging yourself from two impurities  defiled mental processes and defiled emotional attachment to those processes  your Dharmaeye will become clear and bright How then could you fail to go on to realize a supreme understanding and awakening Defiled mental processes refers to the observed division of the eighth consciousness while defiled emotional attachment refers to the observing division Attachment to these processes leads to emotion and with emotion comes defilement Separate yourself from them  instructions for practice nanda said respectfully to the Buddha WorldHonored One the ThusCome One has now explained the second of the unalterable principles But let us consider an example from ordinary life I believe that otherwise he will not be able to untie it Since time without beginning we have been born into ignorance and have perished in ignorance Although we are learned and have strong roots in the Dharma and although we have entered the monastic life and call ourselves monks it is as if we were subject to a fever that recurs every other day I only hope that the greatly compassionate one will be moved to deeply pity us who are drowning in the sea of afflictions How are the knots of our bodies and minds tied and where do we begin to untie them so that we and the suffering beings of the future may be freed from the cycle of death and rebirth and fall no longer into the three realms of conditioned existence Having spoken these words he bowed to the ground as did all the others in the assembly He shed tears as he eagerly awaited the sublime instructions given by the Buddha the WorldHonored One Then the WorldHonored One took pity on nanda and on all the others in the assembly who still needed instruction wishing that for the sake of the future they might transcend the conditioned world and become guides for the time yet to come As he circled his hand over the crown of nandas head his hand shone with light that was the color of the purpletinted gold of the River Jambu Then throughout all ten directions every world in which Buddhas were dwelling quaked in six ways Each one of the numberless ThusCome Ones of those worlds emitted resplendent light from the crown of his head Bit by bit you can cause them to awaken Then nanda and all the others in the great assembly heard the numberless ThusCome Ones from throughout the ten directions speak in one voice though with different tongues saying Well done nanda You want to understand the ignorance that you were born with The source of the knot  what causes you to be bound to the cycle of death and rebirth  is your six faculties of perception nothing more Also since you wish to understand the supreme enlightenment you should understand that it is through those same six faculties that you can quickly gain bliss liberation and stillness wondrous and everlasting At the same time they all heard the Thus Come Ones speak to nanda in unison Though nanda heard these words of Dharma he did not understand them He bowed his head and said respectfully to the Buddha How can it be that nothing more than the six faculties binds us to the cycle of death and rebirth while at the same time they cause us to gain wondrous and everlasting bliss The Buddha said to nanda The faculties and their objects come from the same source What binds and what unbinds are one and the same The consciousnesses are by nature illusory like flowers seen in the  the example of the bells sound sky In response to objects nanda there is perception and in response to the faculties there are objects Neither the objects nor perceptions of them have an essential nature they are dependent on each other like intertwining reeds Know therefore that the establishment of perceived objects such that they exist separately within your awareness is the foundation of ignorance When objects are not perceived as separate from awareness that itself is nirvana which is the true purity free of outflows Why would you allow anything else to be added to it Then the WorldHonored One wishing to restate these principles spoke these verses In our true nature all conditioned things are seen as empty That which arises from conditions is illusory That which is unconditioned is not born nor does it perish It too has no reality like flowers in the sky Both that which is called true and that which is called false are false How can there be therefore observer and what is observed In the perceiver and perceived theres nothing that is real They are like vines that only stand by twisting round each other Entanglement and liberation share a common basis The Path of Sages and of common folk is one path only The vines have no existence yet they do not lack existence The darkness of confusion is our basic ignorance The light of understanding brings about our liberation A knot must be untied according to a certain sequence And when the six have been untied the one will vanish too Choose one perceiving faculty and realize your breakthrough Enter the current  instructions for practice From subtle ādāna the storehouseconsciousness The energy of habits can burst forth into a torrent Lest you confuse the true with whats untrue I rarely speak of this But when your mind grasps hold of your own mind whats not illusion Then becomes illusory And if you dont grasp hold Then what is called illusion and whats not illusion too Will not arise How could what is illusion be established This Dharma may be called the wondrous lotusflower The royal indestructible magnificent awakening The Buddha ākyamuni tells nanda to choose one of his faculties and break through to enlightenment When they had heard this supreme compassionate instruction which the Buddha the ThusCome One had spoken in this combination of instructional and reiterative verses with their luminous and wondrous truths lucid and incisive nanda and the others in the great assembly all rejoiced and their minds eye opened to an understanding that was entirely new to them   The Analogy of the Six Knots nanda put his palms together bowed to the ground and said respectfully to the Buddha I have heard the Buddha out of his unbounded compassion speak these true words of Dharma concerning the purity wondrousness and everlastingness of our real nature But I still do not fully understand the sequence for releasing the knots such that when the six are untied the one will vanish I only hope that the Buddha will show us great kindness and that taking pity once again on this assembly and on beings of the future he will bestow upon us words of Dharma that will cleanse us of impurities The ThusCome One straightened his inner garment and arranged his robe Still sitting in the Lions Seat he reached out onto the table in front of him which was inlaid with seven kinds of precious things He picked up an elegant presentation scarf which had been given to him by a god from the Heaven of SelfRestraint Before the assembly he tied a knot in the scarf and showing it to nanda he said What is this nanda and the others respectfully answered It is a knot The Thus Come One thereupon tied another knot in his elegantly patterned scarf and again asked nanda And what is this nanda and the others in the assembly again respectfully answered It is another knot The Buddha tied a sequence of similar knots in his elegantly patterned scarf until six knots had been tied on top of one other Each time as he held up the knot he had just tied he asked nanda And what is this  Skt  Skt See part a  the analogy of the six knots Each time nanda and the others in the great assembly replied in the same manner It is another knot The scarf represents the nature of the Matrix of the ThusCome One the six knots represent the six faculties of perception The Buddha then said to nanda The first time that I tied a knot in this elegantly patterned scarf you said that it was a knot To begin with this precious scarf was in fact merely a scarf Why did you answer a second and a third time It is another knot nanda said respectfully to the Buddha Basically WorldHonored One this precious elegantly patterned and beautifully woven scarf is a single thing but it seems to me that when the ThusCome One tied it once he made what we would call a knot If he had tied it a hundred times we would say there were a hundred knots Why then does the ThusCome One acknowledge the first knot but not the second or the third The Buddha said to nanda You understand that this precious scarf is a single strip of cloth My tying it six times might be said to have made six knots but examine the question more carefully The implication of your answers is that although the essential nature of the scarf is unchanged the knots have nevertheless changed it What do you think When I first tied a knot in the scarf you said it was the first knot I ask you would you call the sixth knot I tied the first knot The Buddha demonstrates that the nature of the Matrix of the ThusCome One is fundamentally one No indeed WorldHonored One Since there are six knots we certainly cannot say that the sixth knot is the first knot With all my lives devoted entirely to learning and debate what would lead me to confuse the sixth knot with the first The Buddha said You are right The six knots are not identical Let us examine how they were made They were all created out of the one scarf  instructions for practice still it would not do to confuse their order The Buddha said to nanda Suppose you were displeased by the six knots in your scarf and would prefer it to be a single length of cloth How would you go about untying the knots nanda said As long as these knots are in the scarf there will naturally be disagreement about which one of them is which But if the ThusCome One were now to untie them all and no further knots were tied then there would be no question as to which was which since there would be no first knot left much less a sixth The Buddha said When the six are untied the one will vanish is the same idea Since time without beginning due to your deranged confusion about the nature of your mind your awareness has become distort What follows here is a summary of teachings presented in part   the analogy of the six knots ed and these distortions have not ceased It is as in the example of your eyes staring until they become so stressed that they see flowers in the sky Amidst the clarity of enlightened understanding deranged confusion arises for no good reason The mountains the rivers and everything else in this world  as well as the processes of dying and being reborn and of entering into nirvana  are mere derangements caused by stress mere distortions mere flowers in the sky Deranged confusion refers to the three subtle aspects of delusion coming into being evolving and appearance These are produced by one unenlightened thought at this point the first knot is tied Your awareness becoming distorted refers to mundane knowledge which is the first of the coarse aspects of delusion nanda asked How is untying the knots like releasing the stress The ThusCome One thereupon picked up the knotted scarf and having tugged the scarf to its left end he asked nanda Is this the way to untie it nanda replied No WorldHonored One Then having tugged at the other end of the scarf the Buddha again asked nanda Is that the way to untie it nanda again replied No WorldHonored One The Buddha said to nanda I have now tugged on both ends of the scarf but I was not able to untie the knots that way How would you untie them nanda said respectfully to the Buddha WorldHonored One you must pull on the scarf from within each knot  instructions for practice The Buddha said to nanda Yes you are right If you wish to untie the knot you pull on the scarf from within each of the knots nanda I have explained that the Dharmas for becoming a Buddha arise through causes and conditions but these Dharmas are not the coarse attributes that arise from inhering in perceived objects or conjoining to them The ThusCome One explains worldly and worldtranscending phenomena and he knows the fundamental causes and the conditions by which these phenomena arise  to the point that he knows how many drops of rain are falling in a world that lies beyond as many other worlds as there are sandgrains in the River Ganges and near at hand he understands the fundamental reasons for every sort of phenomenon why pines are straight why brambles bend why geese are white why crows are black Therefore nanda carefully choose one faculty of perception from among the six If you untie the knot of that faculty its objects will disappear by themselves All delusion will melt away  the analogy of the six knots nanda I now ask you can we untie the six knots in this cotton scarf all at the same time No WorldHonored One These knots were tied in sequence in the first place so now they must be untied in sequence Though the six knots are all in the same scarf they were not tied all at the same time Therefore in freeing them they cannot be untied all at the same time The Buddha said The same may be said of freeing the knots of the six faculties In the first stage of freeing a faculty one understands that the self is empty Once that emptiness is fully understood one can become free of attachment to phenomena Once one is free from attachment to phenomena then both self and phenomena have been emptied and will no longer arise This is the patience that the Bodhisattva develops by means of samādhi  the patience with the state in which no mental objects come into being  Skt kārpāsa VI TwentyFive Sages   TwentyFive Sages Speak of Enlightenment Having received this instruction from the Buddha nanda and the others in the great assembly gained such wisdom and such a thorough and complete understanding that they now had no doubts about what the Buddha had said nanda placed his palms together and bowed to the ground before the Buddha and then said Today our bodies and minds have been filled with light and we are delighted that our understanding is unimpeded However although we have now understood the meaning of when the six are untied the one will vanish we do not yet know which one of the sensefaculties can lead us to break through to enlightenment WorldHonored One I have drifted from age to age homeless and alone How could I have known  how could I have imagined  that I would meet the Buddha as a member of his family I am like an infant who has suddenly been reunited with its beloved mother I have met the Buddha and have had the opportunity to become fully enlightened and I have been given a hidden teaching But if my basic mode of understanding nevertheless remains the same then I might as well never have heard the Buddhas teaching at all I only hope that he will be greatly compassionate towards us and will out of kindness bestow upon us a secret and aweinspiring Dharma that will be the ThusCome Ones ultimate instruction Having spoken these words he bowed to the ground and then returned to his place in the assembly He withdrew into the hidden recesses of his mind hoping that he would receive from the Buddha a secret and private transmission nanda is asking the Buddha to bestow upon him the secret teaching that is the ūraṅgama Samādhi Then the WorldHonored One said to the assembly of great Bodhisattvas and great Arhats who were free of outflows I now ask all of you Bodhisattvas and Arhats having made a resolve to become enlightened which one of the eighteen constituent elements did you make use of in order to break through to enlightenment By what expedient did you enter samādhi  jñātakauṇḍinya and the other four monks then stood up and bowed at the Buddhas feet jñātakauṇḍnya said respectfully to the Buddha When we were in the Deer Park and the Pheasant Garden we saw the ThusCome One soon after he had become a Buddha and upon hearing him speak we understood the Four Noble Truths The Buddha questioned us monks and I was the first to truly understand So it was that I became an Arhat by contemplating sound His testimony which is that his enlightenment came through hearing the Buddhas instructions praises the efficacy of sound as a focus of contemplation  His name was Kauṇḍinya Upaniṣad stood up bowed at the Buddhas feet and said to him respectfully I also saw the ThusCome One soon after he had become a Buddha I learned to contemplate the attribute of impurity and I developed a strong aversion to it I came to understand that the nature of visible objects is that they arise from impurity So it was that I became an Arhat by contemplating visible objects The Buddha has asked us how we broke through to enlightenment I believe that the contemplation of visible objects is the best method  The virgin youth Sublimity of Fragrance then stood up bowed at the Buddhas feet and said to him respectfully I heard the ThusCome One teach how to contemplate attentively all attributes subject to conditions I then took my leave of the Buddha and retreated to a pure and peaceful dwelling I observed that when monks lit sandalwood incense its fragrance silently entered my nostrils In my contemplation I realized that the source of the fragrance was neither wood nor space nor smoke nor fire it came from no place and went to no place As a result of this contemplation my distinctionmaking consciousness disappeared and I gained freedom from outflows So it was that I became an Arhat through contemplating the sublimity within fragrance The Buddha has asked us how we broke through to enlightenment I believe that rectifying the mind by means of fragrance is the best method  King of Healing and Master of Healing two princes in the Dharma then stood up in the assembly together with five hundred gods from the Heavens of Brahma King of Healing and Master of Healing said respectfully to the Buddha For countless eons we have served the world as skillful physicians We have tasted one hundred and eight thousand kinds of medicinal substances  herbs woods metals and minerals  that are to be found in the Sāha world We know how each of them tastes  whether bitter sour salty bland sweet or hot  and we know their inherent characteristics the various ways they may be combined and the changes that they effect  whether they are cooling or warming toxic or benign While reverently serving the Buddha we came to understand that the nature of flavors is that they are neither empty nor existent We understood that flavors do not arise from the body nor from the mind nor are they independent of the body and mind Thus by discerning the differences among flavors we became enlightened The Buddha the ThusCome One verified our understanding and he named us two brothers the Bodhisattva King of Healing and the Bodhisattva Master of Healing Now in this assembly we are princes in the Dharma So it was that through flavors we realized enlightenment and understood and we ascended to the Bodhisattva level The Buddha has asked us how we broke through to enlightenment We believe the contemplation of flavors to be the best method  These two sages who count as one in the enumeration of twentyfive testify to the efficacy of flavors Bhadrapāla said respectfully to the Buddha In the past when we heard the Buddhas AweInspiring Royal Voice speak about the Dharma we followed him into the monastic life When it was time to bathe I followed the custom and entered the bathhouse Suddenly upon contact with the water I understood that the water was neither washing away the dirt nor washing my body I have never forgotten that event from that lifetime until this one and now I have followed the Buddha ākymuni into the monastic life and need no further instruction The Buddha has named me Bhadrapāla The wondrousness of tangible objects has been revealed to me and I am now a child of the Buddha The Buddha has asked us how we broke through to enlightenment When the Buddha Sun Moon and Lamplight appeared in this world during a previous eon I had the opportunity to follow him to hear the Dharma and to study and practice it After that Buddha entered nirvana I made offerings to his relics and I lit lamps in order to perpetuate his radiance I gilded an image of that Buddha so that it shone with a purplegolden radiance From that time onwards in life after life my body has always been perfect and flawless and has shone with a purplegolden light śarīra Ch The WorldHonored One has declared me foremost in the practice of beneficial asceticism The wondrousness of objects of cognition was revealed to me and I put an end to all outflows The Buddha has asked us how we broke through to enlightenment Considering what I have attained I believe that the contemplation of the objects of cognition is the best method We should remember an important point  Skt The twelve ascetic practices approved by the Buddha as beneficial are wearing ragged robes possessing only three robes making the almsround for ones food making the almsround sequentially eating only one meal a day eating a fixed and moderate amount of food not drinking juices after noon dwelling in a quiet place dwelling beneath a tree dwelling out in the open dwelling in a graveyard and never lying down The Buddha has asked us how we broke through to enlightenment I believe that to turn the faculty of seeing around and trace it back to its source is the best method  Kṣudrapanthaka stood up bowed at the Buddhas feet and said to him respectfully When I first encountered the Buddha heard the Dharma and entered the monastic life I tried for a hundred days to memorize a single line of one of the ThusCome Ones verses But when I had learned the second part of the line I could no longer remember the first part and when I had learned the first part of the line again I could no longer remember the second part When one enters the monastic life the first thing one is given to learn is a short verse to be recited every morning as follows Do no evil deed with body speech or mind Give no trouble to any being in the world I contemplated my breath in the most minute detail until I could discern in every instant its arising continuing diminishing and ceasing All of a sudden my mind was freed from every impediment such that my outflows were ended So it was that I became an Arhat I took my place at the Buddhas feet and he verified that I needed no further instruction The Buddha has asked us how we broke through to enlightenment I believe that contemplating the emptiness of the breath is the best method Kṣudrapanthaka recounts how the Buddha taught him to regulate the breath Within I let go of my mind and body and without I took my leave of this world I left the three realms of existence far behind I was like a bird escaping from its cage I departed from all impurity and put an end to my defilements and my Dharmaeye became clear So it was that I became an Arhat The ThusCome One himself verified that I need no further instruction The Buddha has asked us how we broke through to enlightenment I believe that redirecting the awareness of flavor away from the flavors and back to itself is the best method  Pilindavatsa stood up bowed at the Buddhas feet and said to him respectfully After I had first committed myself to following the Buddha on the Path I heard the ThusCome One say many times that nothing in this world can bring true joy One day as I was reflecting upon this teaching during my almsround in the city I failed to notice a poisonous thorn lying in the road I stepped on it and pain suffused my entire body I held fast to this thought and before long my body and mind became suddenly empty During the next twentyone days my outflows gradually ceased So it was that I became an Arhat The Buddha himself verified that I need no further instruction The Buddha has asked us how we broke through to enlightenment  twentyfive sages speak of enlightenment in my mothers womb I have been aware of the stillness of emptiness I have understood that everything throughout the ten directions is empty and I have also led other beings to understand that all is empty The ThusCome One revealed to me that the essential nature of our awareness is true emptiness and that the essential nature of emptiness is perfect understanding So it was that I became an Arhat and I immediately entered the sea of the magnificent luminous emptiness of the ThusCome Ones The Buddha has asked us how we broke through to enlightenment I understood that all is empty and also that what understands emptiness and the emptiness that is understood are empty as well that is the best method  āriputra stood up bowed at the Buddhas feet and said to him respectfully Ever since a time during the eons of the remote past my eyeconsciousness has been pure Thus for as many lifetimes as there are sandgrains in the River Ganges I have been able in a single glance to understand without impediment the various changing phenomena both worldly and worldtranscending I once met the Kāśyapa brothers walking together along a road The Buddha has asked us how we broke through to enlightenment I myself was able to verify that my eyeconsciousness had become radiant with light and when that light reached its ultimate intensity it illuminated the wisdom and vision of the Buddhas Thats one account And who is your teacher It was then that Aśvajit spoke the verse quoted above  twentyfive sages speak of enlightenment  The Bodhisattva Universal Goodness stood up bowed at the Buddhas feet and said to him respectfully I have been a prince in the Dharma in the assemblies of as many ThusCome Ones as there are sandgrains in the River Ganges Throughout all ten directions the ThusCome Ones teach their disciples who have an innate propensity for the path of the Bodhisattva to undertake the practice of universal goodness  the practice for which I am named WorldHonored One with my earconsciousness I am aware of the thoughts and viewpoints of every individual being including the beings in worlds that are beyond still other worlds as many as the sandgrains in the River Ganges Whenever any of these beings even considers undertaking the practices of Universal Goodness I generate hundreds of thousands of distinct bodies and mounted on my sixtusked elephant I go separately to the places where these beings are Even if a being is heavily impeded and is not able to see me I circle my hand on the crown of that beings head to lend support and give comfort in order to help him succeed in his practice The Buddha has asked us how we broke through to enlightenment Puxian  Sundarananda stood up bowed at the Buddhas feet and said to him respectfully When I first entered the monastic life to follow the Buddha on the Path I kept the precepts perfectly but in trying to enter samādhi my mind was always too scattered and too easily distracted so that I could not put an end to my outflows The WorldHonored One taught MahāKauṣṭhila and me to focus our attention on the whiteness visible at the tip of the nose After three weeks of focusing my attention in this way my breath looked like smoke as it entered and left my nostrils My body and mind shone with an inner light that illuminated the entire world Everything became as clear and as pure as crystal The Buddha has asked us how we broke through to enlightenment This is the best method  Then Pūrṇamaitrāyaṇīputra stood up bowed at the Buddhas feet and said to him respectfully Ever since a time during the eons of the remote past I have been able to speak with unimpeded eloquence When I have explained suffering and emptiness I have penetrated deeply into ultimate reality Indeed I have been able to give subtle and wondrous instruction to the assembly in the hidden gateways to the Dharma taught by as many ThusCome Ones as there are sandgrains in the River Ganges Knowing that I was endowed with great eloquence the WorldHonored One instructed me to use the sound of my voice to propagate the Dharma I followed the Buddha as his assistant in turning the Wheel and so it was that by means of the Lions Roar I became an Arhat The WorldHonored One verified that my skill in speaking the Dharma was without peer The Buddha has asked us how we broke through to enlightenment With the sound of Dharma I overcame adversaries and subdued demons and I put an end to my outflows This then is the best method  Upāli then stood up bowed at the Buddhas feet and said to him respectfully I was the one who accompanied the Buddha when he escaped the city and left his household I was there to watch the ThusCome One as he diligently practiced austerities for six years I myself saw the ThusCome One subdue demons bring under his influence the followers of wrong paths and free himself from the outflows of worldly greed and  That is the five aggregates The Buddha has asked us how we broke through to enlightenment I learned to govern my conduct until my body was at ease in being governed and next I gradually learned to govern my mind until my thoughts accorded naturally with what is right Great Maudgalyāyana then stood up bowed at the Buddhas feet and said to him respectfully Once when I was on the road seeking alms I met the three Kāṣyapa brothers  Uruvilvā Gayā and Nadī  and they proclaimed the ThusCome Ones explanation of the profound principles of causation Immediately I resolved to become enlightened and my mind was entirely free of impediment The ThusCome One kindly accepted me and then the precept robe suddenly appeared on my body while my hair and beard all at once fell from me Not only the WorldHonored One but ThusCome Ones throughout the ten directions praise me for the perfect clarity purity ease and fearlessness with which I exercise my spiritual powers The Buddha has asked how we broke through to enlightenment I used the method of returning the mindconsciousness to its pure source so that the light of my mind shone forth and revealed the turbid flux within That flux gradually subsided until it became brilliantly clear Huotou  At that time there was in the world a Buddha named King of Emptiness who said that a blazing fire grows in people with too much sexual desire He taught me to observe the flow of hot and cold energies along the bones all through my body A spiritual light became focused within me and transformed my excessive desire into the fire of wisdom Since then all the Buddhas I have served have given me the name FireHead So it was that I became an Arhat on the strength of the Blazing Fire Samādhi I made a great vow that whenever someone is about to become a Buddha I will serve as a spiritual warrior and will come to subdue that persons demons and adversaries The Buddha has asked us how we broke through to enlightenment I closely observed the places of warmth in my body until they became unobstructed and there could be free movement through them A magnificent light blazed forth in my mind and lit the way to supreme enlightenment They must stand  See part  below  twentyfive sages speak of enlightenment in the world It was my constant labor then to carry in sand or dirt to level roadways or to build bridges wherever highways or fords were so narrow or so dangerous as to obstruct cart traffic or to cause injury to horses Moreover during the time that countless Buddhas appeared in the world I applied myself with diligence to the laborious task of carrying goods for people I leveled the road that the Buddha Viśvabhū was to take and then waited there for him by the roadside That ThusCome One circled his hand on the crown of my head and told me You should level the ground of your mind Then the ground throughout the entire world will become level as well Immediately my mind opened and I saw that my body was in part composed of particles of the primary element earth and that these particles were not different from the particles of which the world is made I saw that the inherent nature of these particles was such that they could never actually come into contact with each other I then resolved to advance through the Bodhisattvas stages I listened to the ThusCome Ones proclaim this wondrous lotusflower which was the basis for my attaining the Buddhas wisdom and vision My understanding was verified and I now serve as a leader in this assembly  The thousandth and last of the Buddhas of the previous eon  the twentyfive sages The Buddha has asked how we broke through to enlightenment By attentive contemplation I realized that the particles of the primary element earth of which my body is composed are no different from the particles of the primary element earth of which the world is partly composed Fundamentally they are all the Matrix of the ThusCome One their manifestation as particles is an illusion This then is the best method  The Pure Youth Moonlight stood up bowed at the Buddhas feet and said to him respectfully I can remember when a Buddha named Water and Sky was in the world as many eons ago as there are sandgrains in the River Ganges He taught Bodhisattvas to enter samādhi through the contemplative practice of insight into the fundamental nature of water My contemplation was that all the fluids in my body share the same fundamental nature When you see the water again open the door immediately wade into the water pick up the piece of tile and go out again The boy listened respectfully to my instructions and after I had again entered samādhi he saw the piece of tile in the water exactly as before He opened the door removed the tile and went out I emerged from samādhi and my body was again free of pain During the time that I was making my contemplations I met countless Buddhas The Buddha asked how we broke through to enlightenment I understood that water as it flows and circulates in its fundamental nature is everywhere the same and so I understood how to be patient when no mental objects arise I can remember when a Buddha named Infinite Voice was in the world as many eons ago as there are sandgrains in the River Ganges He taught Bodhisattvas that the wondrous understanding which is our original enlightenment may be attained by making this contemplation the world and beings bodies are unreal phenomena that are made to move by the power of the primary element wind Accordingly I contemplated how the world is established I contemplated how time moves through it I contemplated how my body moves and then is still and how thoughts move in my mind None of them is different from the others I came to understand that it is the nature of all movement to arise from nowhere and to go nowhere The countless numbers of deluded beings throughout the ten directions are equally unreal In the billion worlds that make up this great system of worlds beings are indeed like a swarm of mosquitoes trapped in a jar droning in their confusion buzzing madly in their confinement After meeting the Buddha Infinite Voice I was able to be patient when no mental objects arose My mind opened and in the east I saw the Land of the Unmoving Buddha  twentyfive sages speak of enlightenment There I became a DharmaPrince in the service of Buddhas throughout the ten directions My body and mind gave forth light that shone through all things without obstruction The Buddha has asked us how we broke through to enlightenment I awakened to my enlightened mind through the contemplative insight that the primary element wind has no essential attributes of its own I entered samādhi and together with Buddhas throughout the ten directions I transmitted the teaching of the wondrous One Mind This is the best method As soon as we allow thoughts to arise in our minds we have created wind within our minds The Bodhisattva Matrix of Space stood up bowed at the Buddhas feet and said to him respectfully When the ThusCome One and I were with the Buddha Light of Samādhi my body became infinite Then four great and precious pearls that I held in my hands illuminated countless Buddhalands throughout the ten directions and I saw that all these lands were as empty as space Then my mind was like a great flawless mirror in which there shone ten kinds of subtle wondrous magnificent lights that illuminated all ten directions to the ends of space The Buddha has asked us how we broke through to enlightenment I contemplated the boundlessness of space and entered samādhi This is the best method  The Bodhisattva Maitreya stood up bowed at the Buddhas feet and said to him respectfully I can recall the time when a Buddha named Brilliance of Sun Moon and Lamp was in the world it was as many eons ago as there are motes of dust I entered the monastic life as a disciple of that Buddha At that time I was deeply preoccupied with a wish to be well known That WorldHonored One then taught me to enter samādhi by focusing on a contemplation that all things exist only in consciousness While in this samādhi I have throughout many eons served as many Buddhas as there are sandgrains in the River Ganges My yearning for fame vanished without a trace Eventually during the time when the Buddha Blazing Lamp was in the world I brought to an unsurpassed wondrous perfection this samādhi of consciousnessonly I then understood that all the lands of the Buddhas throughout all space  both lands which are partly pure and partly impure and lands which are entirely pure  exist only within consciousness WorldHonored One because I understood in this way that all things exist only in consciousness I understood that it is from the true nature of consciousness that all Buddhas come forth I focused on a practice of contemplating that everything in the ten direc According to Buddhist tradition the Bodhisattva Maitreya is the founder of the ConsciousnessOnly school This then is the best method  Then the DharmaPrince Great Strength stood up with fiftytwo Bodhisattva companions They bowed at the Buddhas feet and the Bodhisattva Great in Strength said respectfully to the Buddha I can recall the time when a Buddha named Infinite Light was in the world as many eons ago as there are sandgrains in the River Ganges During that eon twelve ThusCome Ones appeared in succession and the last of these the Buddha Light Surpassing the Sun and Moon taught me the samādhi of mindfulness of the Buddha  Consider someone who is always thinking of another person This second person though has completely forgotten about the first person Even if these two people were to meet they might as well not have met and even if they were to catch sight of one another they might as well not have seen each other But consider two other people who always have each other in mind so much so that they will be in lifetime after lifetime as inseparable as a man and his shadow But if the child is mindful of the mother just as she is of him the two will be inseparable in lifetime after lifetime In the same way beings who are always mindful of the Buddha always thinking of the Buddha are certain to see the Buddha now or in the future They will never be far from Buddhas and their minds will awaken by themselves without any special effort Such people may be said to be adorned with fragrance and light just as people who have been in the presence of incense will naturally smell sweet The basis of my practice was mindfulness of the Buddha I became patient with the state of mind in which no mental objects arise Now when people of this world are mindful of the Buddha I act as their guide to lead them to the Pure Land In order to enter samādhi I chose no other method than to gather in the six faculties while continuously maintaining a pure mindfulness of the Buddha This is the best method   The Bodhisattva Who Hears the Cries of the World  Then the Bodhisattva Who Hears the Cries of the World stood up bowed at the Buddhas feet and said to him respectfully WorldHonored One I can recall the time when a Buddha named He Who Hears the Cries of the World was in this world as many eons ago as there are sandgrains in the River Ganges Before this Buddha I made the resolution to become fully awakened and he instructed me to enter samādhi through a practice of hearing and contemplating In a past eon the Buddha Who Hears the Cries of the World taught the present Bodhisattva Who Hears the Cries of the World the practice of hearing and contemplating Based on the wisdom of hearing the wisdom of contemplating and the wisdom of practice he was able to enter samādhi You reverse your hearing to listen to your own true nature Instead of listening to external sounds you focus inwardly on your body and mind you cease to seek outside yourself and you turn around the light of your attention so that it will shine within yourself All of a sudden I transcended the worlds of ordinary beings and I also transcended the worlds of beings who have transcended the ordinary worlds Everything in the ten directions was fully illuminated and I gained two remarkable powers First my mind ascended to unite with the fundamental wondrous enlightened mind of all Buddhas in all ten directions and my power of compassion became the same as theirs Second my mind descended to unite with all beings of the six destinies in all ten directions such that I felt their sorrows and their prayerful yearnings as my own WorldHonored One because I had made offerings to the ThusCome One Who Hears the Cries of the World I received from that ThusCome One a hidden transmission of a vajralike samādhi such that my power of compassion became the same as the Buddhas I was then able to go to all lands and appear in thirtytwo forms that respond to what beings require  World Honored One suppose there are Bodhisattvas who have entered samādhi and have advanced in their practice such that they are free from outflows If they wish to attain a more sublime and wondrous understanding I will appear to them as a Solitary Sage who has reached enlightenment on his own and I will instruct them in the Dharma that will lead them to liberation If they wish to attain a more sublime and wondrous understanding I will appear to them as a Solitary Sage who has become enlightened through the contemplation of the conditioned world and I will instruct them in the Dharma that will lead them to liberation Suppose there are sages who still need instruction but whose minds dwell in emptiness in accordance with the teaching of the Four Noble Truths as they practice on the Path that leads to nirvana If they wish to attain a more sublime understanding I will appear to them as a Hearer of the Teaching and l will instruct them in the Dharma that will lead them to liberation Suppose further that there are beings who clearly understand the desires of the mind do not engage in the activities of desire and wish to have bodies that are pure I will appear to them as a Brahma  One of the two kinds of pratyekabuddha  See part  note   The other of the two kinds

they are capable of cognition or are not capable of cognition  I will appear to them as they are and will instruct them in the Dharma that will lead them to fulfillment of their wish These are the thirtytwo pure and wondrous forms in which I appear in all lands in order to respond to what beings require I accomplish this in samādhi which I enter by redirecting my faculty of hearing inward to merge with the enlightened nature of hearing within until the wondrous power of my selfmastery becomes effortless WorldHonored One through the effortless wondrous power of my vajrasolid samādhi which I enter by redirecting my faculty of hearing inward to merge with the enlightened nature of hearing I feel as if they were my own the sorrows and yearnings of all beings in the six destinies in all ten directions and in the three periods of time Therefore by using both body and mind I can cause all beings to develop such perfect merit that they will have nothing to fear in fourteen kinds of dangerous situations  Celestial fighters See part  Second I was able to turn my awareness around and restore it and therefore should beings be caught in a conflagration I can make sure that they are not burned Third since I was able to turn my awareness around and restore it I can make sure that beings who are adrift in a flood will not be drowned Fourth because I have put an end to deluded acts of mind and so have no thoughts of harming or killing I can make sure that any being who enters the realms of ghosts will not be harmed by them Fifth when I had succeeded in merging my faculty of hearing with the enlightened nature of hearing my six faculties dissolved into each other to become one with my faculty of hearing Therefore if beings are about to be attacked I can cause the attackers blades to shatter so that these beings will suffer no hurt any more than water will be hurt by a knife that is plunged into it or any more than light will be affected by a puff of wind Sixth my hearing was infused with an essential brilliance that illuminated the entire DharmaRealm and dispelled the darkness of all hidden places Therefore I can ensure that beings will be invisible to any yakṣas rākṣasas kumbhāṇḍas piśācas pūtanas or other such ghosts that might approach them Line  in the ūraṇgama Mantra yao cha jie la he refers to the yakṣas They can only find you if you give off yin energy Seventh sound itself completely dissolved as I reversed the direction of my hearing and became free of distorted perceptions of senseobjects Therefore if a being is confined by a cangue I can make that cangue disappear Eighth when sound was extinguished once and for all and my hearing was perfected my kindness gained an allpervading power Therefore should beings be traveling on dangerous roads I can make sure that they will not be robbed by highwaymen Therefore I can cause beings who have a great deal of desire to break free of their desire Tenth once sounds were so purified that they ceased being objects of perception then the earfaculty and its objects became completely interfused so that there was nothing that perceived and nothing that was perceived Eleventh once perceived objects had disappeared from my mind as I turned the light of my understanding inward my body and mind and the  Ven  the twentyfive sages entire DharmaRealm were as bright and translucent as crystal Therefore I can bring freedom from stupidity to beings whose natures have been so darkened by their dullness that they have had no intention of ever becoming enlightened Twelfth once perceived objects became interfused and returned to the enlightened nature of hearing I could travel to distant lands without leaving the place for awakening and all at the same time without any disruption I could travel among the worlds There I can make offerings to an infinite number of Buddhas throughout all ten directions and serve each of these Buddhas as a DharmaPrince For that reason should childless beings anywhere in the ten directions wish for sons I can cause them to have sons who will be virtuous blessed and wise Thirteenth once my six faculties perfected an interconnected functioning and became united in their capacity to clearly perceive everything in all the worlds throughout the ten directions my mind became like a great flawless mirror that reflected the emptiness of the Matrix of the ThusCome One I reverently served an infinite number of ThusCome Ones and thoroughly mastered esoteric aspects of the Dharma Therefore should childless beings anywhere in the ten directions wish for daughters I can cause them to have daughters who are upright blessed virtuous compliant wholesome in appearance and liked and respected by all Fourteenth sixtytwo times as many DharmaPrinces as there are sandgrains in the River Ganges appear in each of the worlds of this system of a billion worlds with its hundreds of billions of suns and moons to practice the Dharma and to act as exemplars in order to teach beings how to transform themselves With skill and wisdom these DharmaPrinces respond in various ways to what various beings require I have broken through to the fundamental source of my earfaculty thus revealing the ear as a gateway to the wondrous My body and mind in a subtle and won For these beings the text gives the Chinese characters e dian jia  presumably a shortening of e dian di jia  Skt WorldHonored One because by means of my spiritual practice I have completely broken through to enlightenment the power of my name alone is equal to the power of all those many other names In this way I cause beings to develop such merit that they will have nothing to fear in fourteen kinds of dangerous situations Further WorldHonored One because I have broken through to enlightenment and have reached the final destination of the Supreme Path I have also mastered four immeasurably efficacious and wondrous powers First once I had realized the wondrousness within the wonder at the heart of my hearing and once my hearing had disappeared into the essence of my mind my hearing became indistinguishable from seeing smelling tasting tactile awareness and cognition All six were completely interfused into a single pure and magnificent awareness Therefore I can assume many different and wondrous forms and can proclaim numberless esoteric and efficacious mantras I may appear with two arms four arms six arms eight arms ten arms twelve arms or with fourteen sixteen eighteen twenty or twentyfour arms or with as many as one hundred and eight arms or with a thousand arms or ten thousand arms and more even as many as eightyfour thousand arms with each hand forming a mudra My hands may have two eyes three eyes four eyes nine eyes as many as one hundred and eight eyes or a thousand eyes or ten thousand eyes and more even as many as eightyfour thousand pure and magnificent eyes In these forms by displaying kindness by inspiring awe and by  the twentyfive sages manifesting samādhi and wisdom I can rescue and shelter beings allowing them to attain great mastery and ease Second due to my practice of listening and contemplating I broke free of the six kinds of senseobject such that I was no more obstructed by them than a sound is obstructed by a low wall Therefore I have the wondrous power to appear in various forms each of them reciting various mantras Because these forms and these mantras have the power to deliver beings from danger I am known in countless lands throughout the ten directions as one who causes beings to have nothing to fear Third by means of the fundamental wondrous practice that led me to break through to enlightenment I reached the pure source of the earfaculty and therefore in whatever worlds I travel to I can cause beings to disregard their bodies and their valuable possessions in their quest for my compassionate aid Fourth I have realized the ultimate which is the Buddhamind Therefore in all lands I can make offerings of precious valuables not only to the ThusCome Ones throughout all ten directions but also to beings in the six destinies throughout the DharmaRealm As a result those who seek a spouse shall obtain a spouse those who seek a child shall have a child those who wish for samādhi shall gain samādhi those who wish for a long life shall live long and those who seek the Great Nirvana shall attain it The Buddha has asked us how we broke through to enlightenment By the means that I have described I entered through the gateway of the earfaculty and perfected the inner illumination of samādhi My mind that had once been dependent on perceived objects developed selfmastery and ease Because I hear throughout all ten directions with perfect clarity  the bodhisattva who hears the cries of the world my name He Who Hears the Cries of the World is known in all the worlds throughout the ten directions Then the WorldHonored One seated on his Lions Seat sent forth a magnificent light from his hands his feet and his forehead The light traveled far to pour down upon the crowns of the heads of as many ThusCome Ones and DharmaPrince Bodhisattvas as there are motes of dust throughout the ten directions And all those ThusCome Ones from as many places as there are motes of dust sent forth from their hands their feet and their foreheads magnificent beams of light that poured down upon the crown of the Buddha ākyamunis head and poured down as well upon the great Bodhisattvas and Arhats in the assembly As the sound of Dharma reverberated from groves and ponds those beams of light interlaced with each other like the strands of a magnificent net  something no one in the assembly had ever seen before All gained the ability to enter the vajrasolid samādhi Then lotusflowers  some blue some yellow some red some white each adorned with a hundred gems  floated down together from the heavens and space throughout the ten directions took on the colors of the seven precious things The mountains the rivers and everything else in this Sāha world all vanished at the same time Throughout the ten directions Buddhalands as many as motes of dust were seen to merge into a single world while there rang forth everywhere the sounds of chant and song   The Bodhisattva Mañjuśrīs Recommendation Then the ThusCome One said to the DharmaPrince Mañjuśrī Consider now what has been said by these twentyfive sages  these great Bodhisattvas and these Arhats who need no further instruction  about the methods they used in order to take their first step toward awakening But now it is nanda whom I wish to teach how to become enlightened Which then of these twentyfive methods of practice is most suitable for beings at nandas level And which one after my nirvana will lead beings of this world to practice in accord with the Vehicle of the Bodhisattvas and to follow the path to supreme enlightenment Which of these methods will lead them most easily to success Having respectfully received the Buddhas instruction Mañjuśrī stood up bowed at the Buddhas feet and infused with the Buddhas majestic spirit responded to his request by speaking these verses Clear is the oceanic nature of enlightenment Flawlessly clear it is and wondrous at its origin But from within that fundamental mind that understands Objects appear and with creation of these objects then The fundamental understanding vanishes Then from confusion and delusion empty space appears And all the worlds come into being clinging to that space Due to delusion clarity will turn to solid land Due to false awareness beings then come forth as well And thus does space arise within the great enlightenment Appearing like a solitary bubble on the sea  In the Chinese there are  fivecharacter unrhymed lines without stanza divisions  the bodhisattva mañjuśrīs recommendation And thus do beings with outflows and the worlds uncountable Arise within that empty space and when space disappears  And when that bubble bursts  could the three realms not vanish also Single is the fundamental nature we return to Many are the Dharmagateways that will bring us there Not one among these sages failed in gaining perfect insight Their methods  some of them directed outward and some inward  All will succeed some rapidly and some more slowly Once theyve made their resolution to attain samādhi Objects of sight entangled with cognition will become Defiled Essentially such objects lack transparency And how could objects that one cannot see through clearly Guide beings toward a breakthrough to enlightenment Language and speech require a mix of various sounds In order to form words and sentences expressing meanings But words and phrases cant express all meanings how could sounds Guide beings toward a breakthrough to enlightenment Odors must be in contact with the nose for us to smell them If nose and odors arent in touch no smelling can occur And since the act of smelling is inconstant how could odors Guide beings toward a breakthrough to enlightenment Experience of flavors is not part of our true nature For tasting to occur there must be contact with a flavor  jñātakauṇḍinya and sounds are the referent here Mañjuśrī now proceeds to consider each of the other objects of perception and each of the faculties of perception largely in the order they were presented by the sages Objects of touch are sensed upon their contact with the body Without that contact no perception of them can take place But contact will be intermittent how could tangibles Guide beings toward a breakthrough to enlightenment Those inner objects of the mind are what we call defilements Since these are objects each of them must have precise location Although the faculty of seeing does indeed see clearly Still it perceives what lies before it not what lies behind Of four directions it can see but two at once how could it Guide beings toward a breakthrough to enlightenment Breath enters in the nostrils then goes out again however Between each inbreath and each outbreath there must be a pause The breath is discontinuous how could the nose Guide beings toward a breakthrough to enlightenment The tongue with nothing placed on it can have no tasting function It senses flavors only when theyre present When dispersed Awareness of them ceases how then could the tongue Guide beings toward a breakthrough to enlightenment Theyre not the best for contemplation toward awakening Body and objects being finite do not always meet How could the body guide all beings to enlightenment  the bodhisattva mañjuśrīs recommendation The borders of cognition with the faculty of mind Arent clear enough for beings to tell which one of them is which Beginners cannot free themselves from thinking nor from thoughts How could this faculty guide beings toward enlightenment Observe that the eyeconsciousness involves a threefold joining It is dependent basically it has no attributes No independent essence of its own how could it then Guide beings toward a breakthrough to enlightenment Earconsciousness if its aware throughout the ten directions Is drawing power from great practice in past lives Beginners minds cannot advance into this practice how then Could it guide beings to a breakthrough to enlightenment The contemplation of the nose is an expedient That merely focuses the mind upon a single spot But such a focus is confined to just one place how could it Guide all beings toward a breakthrough to enlightenment Wielding the sounds of words to speak about the Dharma Wakens the speaker based on past accomplishment But words and sentences do not lack outflows thus could speech Guide beings toward a breakthrough to enlightenment Avoiding violation of the precepts regulates The body only such restraints do not apply to beings Who have no body How could what does not apply to all Guide beings toward a breakthrough to enlightenment Spiritual powers are based on practice in past lives such powers Are not related to cognitions making of distinctions  the twentyfive sages There has to be an object for cognition to occur How could cognition then guide beings to enlightenment Consider contemplating earth its solid and opaque One cant move through it Whats conditional must lack The nature of a sage Consider contemplating water contemplating thus Involves cognition which is neither true nor real Contemplation by itself wont reach the state thats thus Then how could water guide all beings toward enlightenment Consider contemplating fire disdaining ones desire Is not the same as ending it This contemplation then Is not a method suited to beginners How could fire Guide beings toward a breakthrough to enlightenment Consider contemplating wind movement and stillness Must be opposites and opposition cannot be A basis for awakening Thus how could wind Guide beings toward a breakthrough to enlightenment Consider contemplating space space lacks awareness Beginning from primordial darkness How then could space Guide beings toward a breakthrough to enlightenment this consciousness Is intermittent Its existence in the mind as well Is only an illusion  the bodhisattva mañjuśrīs recommendation No practice is entirely continuous So even mindfulness perforce arises and must halt How could awareness guide all beings to enlightenment I now respectfully say this to the WorldHonored One  The One who came to be a Buddha in this Sahā world In order to transmit to us the true essential teaching Meant for this place  I say that purity is found through hearing All those who wish to gain samādhis mastery Will surely find that hearing is the way to enter For leaving suffering behind and gaining liberation How excellent the method that the One Who Hears the Cries of the World has just proclaimed Throughout the ages many as the River Ganges sands He enters countless Buddhalands He has the ease of mastery And he bestows his fearlessness on beings in danger Most wondrous is the voice of the One Who Hears the Cries Its sound is pure and like the oceantide Throughout the worlds He rescues worldly beings brings them peace and if they wish He helps them leave the world and reach nirvana everlasting I now can recommend respectfully the practice Taught by the One Who Hears the Cries of the World A being whose mind is tranquil hears the sound Of drumbeats coming from all ten directions And yet hell hear each of the drums distinctly And so our hearing faculty must be the perfect one The one thats genuine and true The eyes cant see through objects that are solid The tongue and nose are likewise limited But sounds are heard close by and from afar And even walls may fail in blocking them No other facultys the equal of our hearing Both true and genuine it is the one for breaking through Were capable of hearing sounds and silence both They may be present to the ear or not Though people say that when no sound is present Our hearing must be absent too in fact Our hearing does not lapse It does not cease With silence neither is it born of sound Our hearing then is genuine and true It is the everlasting one And when cognition ceases in a dream That does not mean that hearing is suspended The ears awareness goes beyond mere thought And now for beings of this Sahā world I have explained the method based on hearing Confused about the nature of our hearing Beings by permitting their attention To go out pursuing sounds have bound themselves To birth and deaths unending cycle nandas erudition just could not prevent His falling prey to an improper scheme By heeding sounds how could he not have fallen But had his striving been against the current Would he not have then avoided error  the bodhisattva mañjuśrīs recommendation nanda listen closely Aided by the aweinspiring Power of the Buddha I have now explained to you This regal genuine and marvelous samādhi Though you may hear of all the secret Dharmagateways That Buddhas numberless as motes of dust may teach Just learning them is useless if you first do not Get rid of all your outflows which are based upon desire Youve heard and practiced all these Buddhas BuddhaDharmas Why havent you been hearing your own hearing People say that hearing comes about because of sounds Not on its own If thats what you call hearing though Then when you turn your hearing round and set it free from sounds What name are you to give to that which is set free Return just one of the perceiving faculties Back to its source and all six faculties will then be free For what we hear is mere illusion like the objects of our vision  Like what is seen by one whose eyes are covered by a film The Threefold Realm is like those flowers in an empty sky But turn the hearing inward and the faculties are cured Their objects vanish and awareness is completely pure In perfect purity the brilliance of awareness shines Unhindered and in still illumination of all space In contemplating worldly things as the events of dreams The young Mātaṅga woman was a figure in a dream Just who was really there with power to entice you Consider this analogy from ordinary life A puppetmaster can present illusions  men and women  The eyedisease is given as an example in part   the twentyfive sages Made to move by pulling on a string but if he chooses Not to pull upon the string the scene returns to stillness And all is shown to be illusion Just so are our six faculties Originally A pure and single understanding they divide And once divided each of them makes contact with its objects But then if one of them is redirected inward All six as a result will cease to function separately And their defiling objects vanish instantly Thus our understanding is perfected In a wondrous purity Those who still have remnants of their basic ignorance Need more instruction Those whose understanding is perfected Their illumination ultimate  these are the ThusCome Ones Great Assembly nanda Halt the puppet show Of your distorted hearing Merely turn your hearing round To listen to your genuine true nature Which is the destination of the Path that is supreme It is the way that the innumerable Buddhas followed Straight to nirvanas gate All ThusCome Ones of eons past Succeeded by this method Through this method Bodhisattvas Too right now are gaining perfect understanding Among the people of the future those who undertake A spiritual practice should rely upon this teaching I myself became enlightened by this very method He Who Hears the Cries is not the only one The Buddha the WorldHonored One made a request That I consider methods that will rescue beings Who in the Dharmas endingtime resolve their minds Upon attainment of transcendence and nirvana  the bodhisattva mañjuśrīs recommendation The best of all the methods is the practice Taught by the One Who Hears the Cries of the World The sages who attained enlightenment by other means Were aided by the Buddhas aweinspiring spiritual power And each was specially taught how to abandon all affliction Some of these paths are shallow some go deep these teachings vary It is the teaching most appropriate For nanda and for the beings drowning In the Dharmas endingtime They only need This practice of the faculty of hearing For them to break through to enlightenment For it surpasses all the other methods Then nanda and all the others in the great assembly having received such profound instruction gained a clear understanding of their faculties and the corresponding consciousnesses As they contemplated the Buddhas full awakening and great nirvana nanda and the others were like someone who has traveled far from home on matters of business although the traveler has not yet been able to return he knows the road that will lead him home The entire assembly of beings ten times as many as the sandgrains of the River Ganges  gods dragons and other celestial beings sages of the Lesser Vehicle who still needed instruction and others who only recently had made the resolve to become Bodhisattvas  all now discovered their inherent true mind so that they would forever be free of affliction All opened their pure Dharmaeye The nun named Nature upon hearing these verses became an Arhat These numberless beings all made the resolution to seek the unsurpassed correct and perfect enlightenment  This is the young woman of the Mātaṅga clan whose mantra set in motion the events of the Sutra as related in the prologue VII Four Clear and Definitive Instructions on Purity   On Sexual Desire nanda straightened his robes and in the midst of the assembly placed his palms together and bowed At once joyful and sorrowful he now understood perfectly the path his mind had taken Wishing to benefit the beings of the future he bowed his head and said respectfully Greatly Compassionate WorldHonored One now I understand this Dharma for becoming a Buddha I can practice this method unhindered by the slightest doubt I have often heard the ThusCome One say that Bodhisattvas resolve to help others make the crossing before completing the crossing themselves while the Buddhas having already completed the crossing act in the world by guiding others to enlightenment I myself have not completed the crossing but I vow to bring across all beings who live in the future in the time of the Dharmas ending Should any beings of that time wish to guard and focus their minds so that they can enter samādhi how may I guide them towards establishing a place for awakening where their practice will be secured against demonic disturbances and where they will not retreat from their resolve to become enlightened Then the WorldHonored One praised nanda before the great assembly saying Excellent Excellent You have asked how a place for awakening may be established in order to rescue and protect beings who are sinking and drowning during the time of the Dharmas ending Listen carefully and I will tell you nanda and all the others in the assembly replied that they would respectfully accept and follow the instructions The Buddha said to nanda When I have explained the vinaya you have often heard me speak of the three essential elements of spiritual practice precepts which require us to guard and focus the mind  That is across the sea of afflictions to the shore of nirvana  four clear and definitive instructions on purity samādhi which arises from following precepts and wisdom which appears out of samādhi These are the three practices that end outflows nanda why do I say that to follow the precepts is to guard and focus the mind In all worlds beings in the six destinies whose minds are free of sexual desire will not be bound to an unending cycle of deaths and rebirths No matter how much you may practice in order to transcend the stress of entanglement with perceived objects you will never transcend that stress until you have freed yourself from sexual desire Even very intelligent people who can enter samādhi while practicing meditation in stillness will be certain to fall into the realm of demons upon their rebirth if they have not renounced sexual activity The best among them will become kings among demons those at intermediate levels will be members of demon hordes female demons will be at the lowest levels These demons will attract groups of disciples and will tell them that they have realized unsurpassed enlightenment After my nirvana in the time of the Dharmas ending many such demonic hordes will sweep like wildfire across the world and will openly parade their lustfulness while pretending to be good and wise teachers These demons will cause beings to fall into the pit of sexual desire and wrong views concerning desire and they will stray off the road to perfect enlightenment Therefore when you teach people to practice samādhi first teach them to rid their minds of sexual desire That is the first of four clear and definitive instructions on purity that have been given by the ThusCome One and by all the Buddhas of the past WorldHonored Ones Therefore nanda one who practices entering samādhi while practicing meditation in stillness without renouncing sexual activity is like one who cooks sand in the hope that it will turn into rice A hundred thousand eons might pass and it would still be nothing but hot sand since it wasnt rice to begin with It was merely sand In seeking the wondrous enlightenment of the Buddha while you still have sexual desire you may gain some understanding of that wondrous enlightenment but that understanding will be rooted in sexual desire If the basis of your understanding is sexual desire you will continually be reborn among the three lowly destinies bound to the cycle of death and rebirth with no hope of escape Then how will you find your way to practice and realization of the ThusCome Ones nirvana You must purge yourself of the most subtle promptings of sexual desire both physical and mental to the point that you have purged even the act of purging Then there will be hope that you may realize the full awakening of the Buddhas What I have said is what Buddhas teach Māra the Evil One teaches otherwise  Skt Pāpāyān Ch boxun  evil one an epithet of Māra king of the demonic legions who inhabit the sixth heaven of the realm of desire   On Killing Also nanda in all worlds beings in the six destinies whose minds are free of all desire to kill will not be bound to an unending cycle of deaths and rebirths No matter how much you may practice samādhi in order to transcend the stress of entanglement with perceived objects you will never transcend that stress until you have freed yourself from thoughts of killing Even very intelligent people who can enter samādhi while practicing meditation in stillness are certain to fall into the realm of ghosts and spirits upon their rebirth if they have not renounced all killing The best among them will become ghosts of great power those at intermediate levels will become flying yakṣas or leaders of ghostly hordes those at the lowest levels will be rākṣasas that travel along the ground These ghosts and spirits will attract groups of disciples and will tell them that they have realized the supreme enlightenment After my nirvana in the time of the Dharmas ending these ghosts and spirits will spread like wildfire across the worlds as they make the claim that eating meat will not obstruct the path to enlightenment I have compassion also for those who wish to live purely but who live among humid marshlands or in hot deserts where grains and vegetables cannot be grown Out of great kindness and by means of my spiritual power I change the meat they eat so that it is without sentience It is merely called meat and merely tastes like meat But after my nirvana  four clear and definitive instructions on purity how will people who eat the flesh of beings deserve to be called disciples of ākyamuni You should understand that these people who eat flesh may gain some modicum of mental awakening while practicing samādhi but they are all great rākṣasas who in the end must fall into the sea of death and rebirth They are not disciples of the Buddha Such people kill and devour each other feeding on each other in an endless cycle How could they possibly get out of the three realms When you teach people in the world to practice samādhi teach them to renounce all killing That is the second of the clear and definitive instructions on purity that have been given by the ThusCome One and by all the Buddhas of the past WorldHonored Ones Therefore nanda one who enters samādhi while practicing meditation in stillness without renouncing all killing is like one who hopes that nobody will hear him shout if he stops up his own ears He is trying to conceal what is perfectly evident Bodhisattvas and pure monks walking on country paths will not even tread on living grasses much less uproot them How then can it be compassionate to gorge on other beings blood and flesh Monks who will not wear silks from the East whether coarse or fine who will not wear shoes or boots of leather nor furs nor birds down from our own country and who will not consume milk curds or ghee have truly freed themselves from the world To wear parts of a beings body is to involve ones karma with that being just as people have become bound to this earth by eating vegetables and grains I can affirm that a person who neither eats the flesh of other beings nor wears any part of the bodies of other beings nor even thinks of eating or wearing these things is a person who will gain liberation What I have said is what Buddhas teach Māra the Evil One teaches otherwise   On Stealing Also nanda in all worlds beings in the six destinies whose minds are free of all desire to steal will not be bound to an unending cycle of deaths and rebirths No matter how much you may practice samādhi in order to transcend the stress of experiencing perceived objects you will never transcend that stress until you have freed yourself from thoughts of stealing Even very intelligent people who can enter samādhi while practicing meditation in stillness will be certain to fall into an evil realm upon their rebirth if they have not renounced stealing The best among them will become energydevouring naturespirits those at intermediate levels will be succubae or incubi and those at the lowest levels will be unwholesome people possessed by such spirits These unwholesome beings will attract groups of disciples and will tell them that they have realized the supreme enlightenment After my nirvana in the time of the Dharmas ending many such strange and unwholesome spirits will sweep like wildfire across the world By cunning and deceit they will establish their claim to be good and wise teachers who have reached the level of a sage Their boasting will delude the ignorant and will instill fear that will rob people of their good judgment Wherever they go these unwholesome spirits will destroy families and reduce households to penury I teach the monks to make their almsrounds in whatever place they find themselves so that they may let go of craving and become enlightened The monks do not cook for themselves and leading the rest of their lives this way they wander from place to place in the three realms so that at the end of their lives they will not have to return How then can thieves wear a monks robe for the sake of personal gain meanwhile engaging in all manner of acts which they falsely claim are in accord with the Buddhas Dharma They slander those who have entered the monastic life saying that fully ordained monks are merely following the path of the Lesser Vehicle In this way they confuse countless beings and lead them astray and they will all fall into the Unrelenting Hell I affirm that after my nirvana a monk whose resolve in the practice of samādhi is unshakable can in a single moment repay his debts from all his previous lives since time without beginning by burning lampoil on his body before an image of the Buddha or else by burning off a part of one of his fingers or else by burning a piece of incense on his body Then  It is worth noting here that the Buddha recommends these asceticisms only for monks whose resolve in the practice of samādhi is unshakable  in other words only for fully ordained monastics who are well advanced in their spiritual practice  on stealing Therefore when you teach people in the world to practice samādhi teach them to renounce stealing That is the third of the clear and definitive instructions on purity that have been given by the ThusCome One and by all the Buddhas of the past WorldHonored Ones nanda one who enters samādhi while practicing meditation in stillness but who does not renounce stealing is like one who tries to fill a leaking cup with water He may keep on trying for countless eons but he will never fill it up Let a monk own nothing except his robes and his almsbowl let him give to hungry beings the alms he does not need let him greet the assembly by bowing with joined palms let him take scoldings and beatings as praise let him truly renounce his mind and body by sharing his flesh bones and blood with other beings and let him never confuse beginners by misconstruing the ThusCome Ones teachings which are not definitive I can affirm that such a monk truly practices samādhi When someone scolds you you should act as if he is speaking some language you dont understand If someone hits you just pretend you bumped into a wall Suppose you were careless and walked into a wall and were left with a big lump on your head What I have said is what Buddhas teach Māra the Evil One teaches otherwise  Ch   On Making False Claims nanda beings in the worlds six destinies may be entirely free in body and in mind of killing stealing and sexual desire but their samādhi will not be pure if they make false claims If they do they will be possessed by demons of craving or by demons of delusion and they will lose sight of their potential for becoming a Buddha They will say that they have achieved what they have not achieved and that they have become what they have not become Wishing that worldly people might hold them in the highest honor they will say that they have reached the stage of entering the stream or that they must be reborn once only or that they need not be reborn or that they are Arhats or Solitary Sages or that they are Bodhisattvas at one of the Ten Grounds or at one of the stages previous to the Ten Grounds In this way in their craving for offerings they encourage people to bow to them and to repent before them Even if you are a Bodhisattva or a Buddha you cannot say that you are You must keep silent about it down to your last breath These people fall into these three terrible hells It is my command that after my nirvana in the time of the Dharmas ending the Bodhisattvas and the Arhats will appear before beings in whatever bodily form may be appropriate for rescuing them from the cycle of death and rebirth The Bodhisattvas and Arhats may appear as elder monks or nuns or as whiterobed laity or as kings as high officials as pure youths or maidens or even as courtesans widows libertines thieves slaughterers or traffickers in stolen goods Working side by side with these people in order to lead them to enter samādhi the Bodhisattvas and Arhats praise the Buddhas Vehicle They can only reveal themselves at the end of their lives and then only in private Anyone who in any other way claims to be a Bodhisattva or an Arhat is deluding people with an egregious lie Therefore when you teach people in the world to practice samādhi teach them to refrain from making false claims This is the fourth of the clear and definitive instructions on purity that have been given by the ThusCome One and by all the Buddhas of the past WorldHonored Ones nanda one who does not refrain from making false claims is like someone who molds a piece of excrement into the shape of a piece of sandalwood incense in the hope that it will then be fragrant That cannot be I have taught the bhikṣus that the straightforward mind is the place for awakening and that there must be nothing whatever false in their cultivation of a stern and proper manner in all four comportments Why then would they make a public claim about their attainment saying they had reached the level of a sage One who makes such false claims is like a pauper who claims to be king Such a one is deliberately seeking his death One who seeks the enlightenment of the Buddhas in this way is like one who tries to bite his own navel Who could expect to succeed Monks whose minds are as straight as lutestrings and who are entirely genuine and truthful will never encounter demons when they enter samādhi I can affirm that such people are certain to realize the unsurpassed wisdom and enlightenment of the Bodhisattvas What I have said is what Buddhas teach Māra the Evil One teaches otherwise  Walking standing sitting and lying down  That is a Buddha VIII The ūraṅgama Mantra   Establishing a Place for Awakening Ananda you have asked about guarding and focusing the mind and I have now told you about the wondrous method that will lead practitioners to enter samādhi If you seek to become a Bodhisattva you must first follow the four instructions on purity so that your comportment may be as pure as the glistening frost Then very naturally you will no more be able to commit the three errors of the mind and the four errors of speech than a tree is able to leaf out in freezing weather How could anything demonic happen to someone who faithfully follows the four instructions on purity nanda Then the three evils of the mind  greed anger and delusion  will have no cause to come forth and the four errors of speech  coarse language hurtful speech lies and duplicity  will not occur As for people who cannot get rid of their stubborn habits teach them to recite singlemindedly the mantra of supreme efficacy which is called MahāSitātapatra  the Great White Canopy This is the mantra spo That is the ūraṅgama Mantra  the śūrangama mantra ken by the Buddha whom I make appear from my unconditioned mind  the Buddha who is seated invisible to ordinary sight amidst a blaze of light on a precious lotusflower at the crown of my head What is most important is to recite the mantra singlemindedly Dont have two minds about it dont recite the mantra and doubt its usefulness at the same time Now she is an Arhat though she had been a mere courtesan someone who had never intended to undertake spiritual cultivation But by the hidden aid of the mantras power she quickly became one who needs no further instruction You Hearers of the Teaching in this assembly who seek to board the greatest of vehicles in your resolute quest to become Buddhas should reach your goal with no more effort than the wind needs to scatter a handful of dust into the air Further they must receive precepts from a member of the Sangha who is truly pure otherwise they will not succeed in following those precepts After the practitioners have received precepts they should put on new clothes or newly washed clothes and then in a quiet place burn incense and recite one hundred and eight times the efficacious mantra spoken by the Buddha who is made to appear from the mind of the ThusCome One Then they may establish the place for awakening and safeguard its boundaries These spiritual practitioners should ask the peerless ThusCome Ones throughout the ten directions  each without departing from his own land  to pour down a light of great compassion on the head of each practitioner Then nanda in the time of the Dharmas ending pure monks nuns and whiterobed laity and other almsgivers in whose minds all sexual desire and all craving have been extinguished and who  At the third stage  That is make formal vows to follow moral precepts in a ceremony of transmission presided over by a senior monk  the śūrangama mantra follow the Buddhas pure precepts should enter a place for awakening and there make the vows of a Bodhisattva If they can bathe before reentering their place of awakening and if they can continue their practice throughout the six periods of the day and the six periods of the night without sleep for twentyone days I myself will appear before them to bless each one of them by circling my hand over the crown of his head and I will help each one become enlightened nanda said respectfully to the Buddha WorldHonored One I have received the ThusCome Ones supremely compassionate instruction and my mind has already awakened I myself know how to practice so that I can realize the enlightenment of one who needs no further instruction But suppose spiritual practitioners should wish to establish a place for awakening in the time of the Dharmas ending How may they safeguard its boundaries in accord with the Buddhas rules concerning purity The Buddha said to nanda People in the time of the Dharmas ending who wish to establish a place for awakening should begin by finding a strong white ox living in the Himalayas It should be an ox that feeds upon rich and fragrant grasses and drinks only the pure waters of the mountain snows The dung of such an ox will be of an exceptional purity Those who wish to establish a place for awakening may mix this pure oxdung with sandalwood incense and spread the mixture upon the ground The dung of an ox that does not live in the Himalayas will be foulsmelling and too unclean to be applied to the ground of a place for awakening They should dig up the loam from a depth of about five and a half feet and then mix it with sandalwood incense aloeswood incense storax frankincense saffron teak resin birthwort basil spikenard and cloves They should grind these ten fragrant substances into a powder sift them together with the loam and spread the mixture as a paste on the ground of the place for awakening The place should be octagonal and sixtyfive feet across A lotus made of gold silver copper or wood should be placed in the center of the place for awakening and a bowl filled with dew collected during the eighth lunar month should be placed in the center of the flower An abundance of flower petals should be made to float upon the water in the bowl Eight round mirrors should be arranged around the flower and bowl so that the mirrors face outward in each of the eight directions At mealtime and at midnight the practitioners should prepare a pint of honey and mix it three times with clarified butter They should place a small burner in front of the place for awakening prepare a decoction of storax bathe charcoal with the decoction and then ignite the charcoal letting it blaze forth The butter and honey should be tossed upon the flames As long as it lasts the fragrant smoke will be an offering to the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas Outside the four walls of the room in which the place for awakening is located the practitioners should hang banners and arrangements of flowers Further they should adorn the walls inside the room with images of the ThusCome Ones and the Bodhisattvas of the ten directions Centered on the wall facing south images of the Buddha Vairocana the Buddha ākyamuni the Bodhisattva Maitreya the Buddha Akṣobhya and the Buddha Amitābha should be displayed His followers are the vajradhara who brandish the vajraimplement   establishing a place for awakening of the door images should be placed of Lord akra King Brahma FireHead the Blue Durgā Kuṇḍalīrāja Bhṛkuṭi and the Four Celestial Kings together with Vināyaka The bizarre appearances of these Dharmaprotectors are intended to instill awe in people so that they will behave themselves At the door of the place for awakening then these images are placed on both sides for protection During the first seven days the practitioners should bow with the utmost sincerity to the ThusCome Ones the great Bodhisattvas and the Arhats of the ten directions During the six periods of the day and the six periods of the night the practitioners should recite the mantra continuously while circumambulating the place for awakening singlemindedly repeating the mantra one hundred and eight times During the next seven days the practitioners should focus their minds on the Bodhisattvas vows  FireHead Skt Uccḥuṣma is the eighteenth of the twentyfive sages who speak in part  above During the last seven days the practitioners should singlemindedly recite the Buddhas Mantra of the White Canopy continuously throughout the twelve periods of the day and night On the final day the ThusCome Ones from all ten directions will appear at the same time They and their light will be reflected in the mirrors as each of them circles his right hand on the crown of the head of each of the practitioners If people can practice samādhi in an excellent place for awakening like this in the age of the Dharmas ending their bodies and minds will become as pure and bright as crystal But nanda if the preceptmaster from whom a monk received precepts was not pure or if any of the other monks in his group is not pure then the practice in the place of awakening is unlikely to be successful After the three weeks the practitioners should remain sitting upright and peacefully for a hundred days If their roots in the Dharma are deep and strong they will not rise from their seats during that time and they will become Arhats at the first stage Even if they do not reach the level of a sage in body and mind they will be certain that in the future they will become Buddhas  establishing a place for awakening One sits in meditation but not like some people who sit still for two hours and consider it a superb feat You asked how to establish a place for awakening This is how it should be done   The ūraṅgama Mantra nanda bowed at the Buddhas feet and said to him respectfully Ever since I entered the monastic life I have presumed upon the Buddhas affection I have sought merely to be learned and as a result I have not yet gained freedom from conditioned phenomena I was ensnared by the evil BrahmaHeaven spell and could not escape though my mind remained aware Fortunately Mañjuśrī arrived to rescue me with the efficacious mantra spoken by the Buddha at the crown of the ThusCome Ones head But I benefited from its hidden power without actually hearing it myself I sincerely hope that the Buddha will proclaim the mantra again out of his great kindness and out of his compassion for all the practitioners in this great assembly as well as for beings of the future who will be bound to the cycle of death and rebirth so that the esoteric sounds of the mantra may set their bodies and minds free Everyone in the great assembly thereupon bowed to the Buddha They waited to hear the sections and subsections of the esoteric mantra   The Venerable Master Hua Hsan gave a detailed series of lectures explaining the meaning and use of each of the  lines of the mantra  the śūrangama mantra Then from the prominence at the crown of the WorldHonored Ones head there welled forth a magnificent light radiant as hundreds of precious gems and a magnificent thousandpetal lotus welled forth from within that light The ThusCome One made appear a Buddha who was seated at the center of the magnificent flower and from the crown of that Buddhas head ten beams of light shone forth as if from hundreds of precious gems Everywhere throughout space there appeared from within those beams of light ten times as many vajrawarriors as there are sandgrains in the River Ganges Some of them held aloft a mountain while others brandished a vajraimplement  na mo sa dan tuo  su qie duo ye  e la he di  san miao san pu tuo xie  na mo sa dan tuo  fo tuo ju zhi shai ni

have gained supreme right and universal wisdom Wielding this mantra of the mind the ThusCome Ones of the ten directions subdue all demons and show the right way to all who are on a wrong path Conveyed by the power of this mantra of the mind the ThusCome Ones of the ten directions each seated upon a magnificent lotusflower appear in response to the needs of beings in numberless lands Holding fast to this mantra of the mind the ThusCome Ones of the ten directions appear in numberless lands to turn the great Wheel of the Dharma They bestow predictions even upon beings who have not yet become enlightened Relying on this mantra of the mind the ThusCome Ones of the ten directions also rescue beings everywhere from suffering in its various forms the sufferings endured in the hells the sufferings endured by hungry ghosts the sufferings endured by animals the sufferings endured by the blind the deaf and the mute the sufferings caused by the presence of people one detests the sufferings caused by the absence of people one loves the sufferings caused by the failure to get what one wants and the sufferings caused by the fire of the five aggregates The ThusCome Ones of the ten directions can rescue beings from sudden misfortunes whether  That is predictions that at such and such a time and place these beings will become Buddhas  the śūrangama mantra great or small whether caused by thieves armies kings imprisonment wind fire flood hunger thirst or penury The ThusCome Ones can dispel all these misfortunes by reciting this mantra In harmony with this mantra of the mind the ThusCome Ones of the ten directions in the four aspects of their comportment have previously served good and wise teachers and have made appropriate offerings to them They have been chosen as great DharmaPrinces among the disciples of as many ThusCome Ones as there are sandgrains in the River Ganges By putting into practice this mantra of the mind the ThusCome Ones of the ten directions gather together the beings with whom they have strong affinities and ensure that any of these beings who are adherents of the Lesser Vehicle will not be alarmed upon hearing the esoteric teachings concerning the Matrix of the ThusCome One Through reciting this mantra of the mind the ThusCome Ones of the ten directions realize supreme enlightenment and enter the perfect nirvana as they sit beneath a bodhi tree By transmitting this mantra of the mind the ThusCome Ones of the ten directions pass on the work of the Buddhas Dharma to others so that after their nirvana the Dharma can endure and so that all can remain pure by following the precepts strictly and flawlessly Were I to continue speaking of the virtues of this Mantra of the White Canopy which is proclaimed from within the blaze of light at the crown of the Buddhas head I could continue to explain it from morning to night without interruption and without repeating myself and yet still not finish even if I were to keep on speaking for as many eons as there are sandgrains in the River Ganges This mantra may also be called The Mantra that is Spoken from above the Crown of the ThusCome Ones Head All of you who still need instruction and have not yet escaped from the cycle of death and rebirth but have vowed with great sincerity to become Arhats must be certain to practice this mantra if you wish to remain free of demonic influences while you are seated in your place of awakening nanda the people of any country in any world can write out this  the powers of the mantra mantra on birchbark palmleaves papyrus or white cotton cloth  whatever material is native to their region  and each of them can keep the written mantra in a fragrant pouch You should know that even if these people are dullwitted and cannot recite or memorize the mantra they can still wear the pouch or keep it in their dwellings If they do this then throughout their lives no poison will ever be able to harm them nanda I will now tell you more about how this mantra can protect beings of the world and rescue them from danger how it can deliver them from every fear and help them attain transcendent wisdom You should know that after my nirvana in the time of the Dharmas ending people who can recite this mantra or teach others to recite it will be in no danger of being burned or of being drowned or of being harmed by mild or strong poisons Further when they are absorbed in samādhi no evil spell will have the power to ensnare them whether the spell be cast by gods dragons ghosts or spirits including terrestrial or celestial spirits demonic ghosts and nightmare ghosts Any substance made venomous by spell curse or sorcerers hex any poisonous herb any potion made toxic by the admixture of metals such as gold or silver any noxious vapor derived from plants trees insects or snakes indeed any of the countless kinds of poisonous substances  all these will turn into ambrosia upon entering the mouths of people who recite this mantra No evil spirit dwelling in a celestial body nor any other ghost or spirit that harbors malice toward people will have the power to work its evil on them They will always be guarded and protected by Vināyaka and by other oncehostile ghostkings who have been tamed by deep kindness Their numbers are eightyfour thousand ten billion trillion times the number of sandgrains in the River Ganges Each of them is accompanied by a vast retinue of vajrabrandishing followers These Bodhisattvas in the lineage of the BodhisattvaKing VajraTreasury will always be present to protect beings who recite this mantra and who are resolved to become enlightened Indeed they will even protect beings whose minds are scattered and disorderly and lack samādhi but who can nevertheless recite the mantra from memory In ways that are hidden all these Bodhisattvas in the lineage of the BodhisattvaKing VajraTreasury will focus their minds upon hastening these beings toward developing spiritual awareness These beings will then suddenly recall everything that happened to them during eightyfour thousand times as many eons as there are sandgrains in the River Ganges They will understand these past events thoroughly and with complete certainty From that time onward until their last rebirth they will never be born in inauspicious places where there are yakṣas rākṣasas pūtanas katapūtanas kumbhāndas piśācas pretas and other ghosts some of whom are visible and some of whom are not and some of whom are intelligent and some of whom are not Good people who in eon after eon read this mantra recite it from memory write it out wear it on their bodies or keep it in a safe place making various offerings to it will not be reborn into poverty or into lowly circumstances or in an unpleasant place If they themselves have  For more on ghosts see the commentary at part  p  and the Sutra text part  Pretas Ch  the powers of the mantra not earned any karmic rewards the ThusCome Ones of the ten directions will transfer their own merit to them Therefore for an inexpressibly great number of uncountable eons as many as the sandgrains in the River Ganges they will be born in the same generation in which a Buddha has been born Their merit will be immeasurably great and they will be as close to the Buddhas as the seeds of the akṣa are to each other They will become permeated with the fragrance of spiritual practice Further the mantra can enable people who have broken their precepts to regain their purity It can enable people who have not received precepts to become precepted It can enable people who have not been vigorous to become vigorous It can enable people who are lacking in wisdom to become wise It can enable people who are impure to quickly become pure It can enable people who do not follow the precepts concerning a pure diet to succeed in following those precepts nanda suppose good people who recite this mantra violated precepts before the mantra has been given to them Then when they begin to recite the mantra that karma from their preceptbreaking offenses whether grave or slight will be immediately erased Someone who has violated the precepts can return to purity by reciting the ūraṅgama Mantra but this does not mean a mere casual recitation These people may have taken intoxicants or they may have eaten plants of the onion family or other impure foods but the Buddhas Bodhisattvas vajrabrandishing warriors gods immortals ghosts and spirits will not consider that a transgression These people may wear old and tattered clothes or clothes that have not been washed but they will still be pure whatever they do and wherever they are Even if they do not set up a place for awakening or do not enter a place for awakening or do not follow the practice regimen still if they recite this mantra their merit will be the same as if they had entered the place for awakening and had followed the practice regimen They may even have committed the five unnatural crimes which are deserving of the Unrelenting Hell or they may be monks who have committed the four major offenses deserving of expulsion or nuns who have committed the eight major offenses deserving of expulsion yet their grave karma will be wiped away without a trace remaining like a sand dune that has been scattered in a gale nanda there may be beings who either in their present life or in their previous lives have never repented of the serious and minor offenses they have committed during countless innumerable eons in the past But if they can read recite from memory or write out the mantra or wear it on their person or keep it where they are dwelling either in their homes or where they are staying temporarily then their accumulated karma will melt away as snow is melted by boiling liquid Before  That is the procedure for reciting the mantra over a period of twentyone days as set forth above  the powers of the mantra long they will gain patience with the state of mind in which no mental objects arise Moreover if women who do not have children and who wish to conceive can recite the mantra sincerely and from memory or if they wear this Mantra of the White Canopy they will bear sons and daughters who are blessed with virtue and wisdom The mantra should be worn above the heart not below it as a matter of respect If you are not respectful toward the mantra its efficacy will be depleted with regard to you If people who recite the mantra from memory wish for a long life they will live a long life What they wish to accomplish they will quickly accomplish In the same way they will also have health good fortune beauty and strength At the end of their lives they will be reborn into whatever country in the ten directions they wish They will certainly not be reborn among uncivilized people or at a lower level of society By no means will they be born into any form that is less than human nanda suppose that in a village a district a province or in an entire country there is famine or plague or perhaps in that place there is war or the marauding of bandits or the strife of rebellion or other calamities Then the spiritual mantra should be written out and placed on the four city gates or in caityas or on banners The citizens of the country should be instructed to come to welcome the mantra with honor to venerate it respectfully and to sincerely make offerings to it The citizens should also be instructed to wear the mantra on their bodies and place it in their homes nanda in any country and in any place where this mantra exists among the people the celestial dragons are pleased the weather is clement the harvests are abundant and all the people are happy and at peace Further the mantra can prevent disasters indicated by the positions of inauspicious celestial bodies People will not suffer untimely deaths nor will they be bound fettered or shackled Day or night they will sleep peacefully free from evil dreams An area of eightyfour miles around such a place will be safeguarded so that no calamitous influence will ever be able to enter These are the reasons why the ThusCome One has proclaimed this mantra In the future it will protect all who have just begun their spiritual practice so that they can enter samādhi and have peace and great tranquility in body and mind Furthermore they will not be harmed or vexed by any demon ghost or spirit nor by any enmity vulnerability to disaster or karmic debt incurred in previous lives since time without beginning Supposing that besides you and others in the assembly who still need instruction spiritual practitioners in the future establish a place of awakening and keep the precepts in accord with the instructions supposing that they have received precepts from preceptmasters who have maintained purity as members of the Sangha and supposing that they harbor  Skt  the powers of the mantra no doubts as they uphold this essential mantra then if these good people do not gain a spiritual awakening while in this present body given them by their parents the ThusCome Ones of the ten directions have not told the truth   Vows of Protection When these words had been spoken countless hundreds of thousands of vajrabrandishing warriors placed their palms together and bowed before the Buddha all at the same time and they said to him respectfully In accord with what the Buddha has said we will devote ourselves to protecting all those who undertake this practice on their path to enlightenment Then the King of the Brahma Heaven the Lord akra and the Four Celestial Kings bowed together before the Buddha and they said to him respectfully If indeed there be good people who undertake a spiritual practice in accord with this Dharma we will devote all our effort to protect these people so that their wishes will be fulfilled during their present lives Then Vināyaka and countless ghostkings and ghostgenerals including great yakṣagenerals and kings of rākṣasas pūtanas kumbhāṇḍas and piśācas also placed their palms together bowed before the Buddha and said to him respectfully We too vow to protect these people and to lead them to quickly fulfill their resolve to become enlightened Further innumerable sunlords moonlords rainlords cloudlords thunderlords lightninglords and other such lords together with monitoring gods of the year and the retinues of the lords of the heavenly bodies all bowed to the Buddha from their places in the midst of the assembly They said to him respectfully We too will protect all these people in their spiritual practice so that they will be free of fear and will be secure and at peace in the places for awakening that they have established Moreover countless mountainspirits and seaspirits and myriads of other spirits that move on land through water and in the air together with the windkings of the air and the gods on the four planes of form These are gods whose duty it is to monitor beings behavior   vows of protection lessness paid obeisance to the ThusCome One at the same time They said to him respectfully We too will protect these people in their spiritual practice so that they can become enlightened without ever being troubled by demonic influences Then Bodhisattvas in the lineage of the BodhisattvaKing VajraTreasury numbering eightfour thousand million billion times the number of sandgrains in the River Ganges stood up in the midst of the great assembly bowed before the Buddha and said to him respectfully WorldHonored One like these others we all became enlightened long ago but we have chosen not to enter nirvana Instead we continue in our meritorious work of constant attendance upon those whose practice is centered on this mantra and during the time of the Dharmas ending we will protect all who correctly practice this samādhi WorldHonored One these beings who cultivate their minds by correctly practicing this samādhi may be seated in their place of awakening or they may be walking upon the roads or their minds may not be focused while they are relaxing in their villages but in any case we and our followers will constantly attend upon them and stand guard over them Even if the demonking who presides over the Heaven of Pleasure Derived from What Others Create should seek to have his way with these beings he will be utterly unable to do so Lesser ghosts and spirits will be able to approach no closer than seventy miles from these good people  unless these ghosts and spirits are also resolved to become enlightened and are joyfully practicing meditation in stillness WorldHonored One with our gemencrusted vajraimplements we will smash to bits the skulls of evil demons if ever they or members of their retinues should seek to intrude upon these good people in order to disrupt their practice  Correct practice here refers to keeping the precepts and properly reciting the mantra  If you recite the ūraṅgama Mantra then all the demons throughout the world are forced to behave to some extent IX Levels of Being   The Coming into Being of the World of Illusion nanda stood up bowed at the Buddhas feet and said to him respectfully I and those like me have been so unwise and dullwitted as to prefer the mere pursuit of learning to the attempt to put an end to our outflows But now that the Buddha has kindly given us this instruction our practice has been corrected We are thoroughly delighted with the great benefit we have gained WorldHonored One suppose someone has cultivated the Buddhas samādhi in this way but has not yet reached nirvana What is meant by the stage of arid wisdom What are the fortyfour stages through which the mind must pass in order to reach the goal of spiritual practice At what stage of mastery does one reach the Ten Grounds What does it mean to be a Bodhisattva at the stage of Equivalent Enlightenment Having spoken these words nanda bowed to the ground and everyone in the great assembly gazed up unblinking with respectful admiration as they waited to hear the sound of the Buddhas compassionate voice The WorldHonored One then praised nanda saying Excellent Excellent On behalf of all in this great assembly and on behalf of all beings who practice samādhi in the time of the Dharmas ending as they seek to advance in accord with the Great Vehicle you and others have asked me to point out the supreme right path of selfcultivation that will lead them from their mundane state to the great nirvana You should listen carefully to what I say to you  Arid because ones desires have dried up and one has not yet experienced the moisture of Dharma  levels of being nanda and the others in the great assembly placed their palms together and let their minds become empty as they waited in silence to receive the teaching They cast out their extraneous thoughts the deluded thinking of their conscious minds their mad minds and wild natures The Buddha said You should know nanda that the wondrous enlightened nature is endowed with perfect understanding It is apart from all names and attributes and in it at the fundamental level there are no worlds and no beings It is because of delusion that there is coming into being and because there is coming into being there is ceasing to be Coming into being and ceasing to be are delusions When delusion ceases reality appears It is also called the great nirvana of the ThusCome Ones nanda you now wish to practice the true samādhi and to realize the great nirvana of the ThusCome Ones You should begin by understanding the causes for two distorted phenomena that is beings and the worlds in which beings exist When these two phenomena do not come into being the true samādhi of the ThusCome One appears What is the distorted phenomenon that we call beings nanda The enlightened nature of the true mind that understands is such that its understanding is perfect and complete Based in the nature of the Matrix of the ThusCome One beings give rise to ignorance Neither what comes into being nor what it comes into being from are based on anything nor are they a basis for anything Beings and the worlds they dwell in have no foundation and yet despite their having no foundation beings and the worlds come into being The three subtle aspects of delusion are said to arise from ignorance but ignorance has no independent existence It cannot actually be the basis for anything Through their mutual interaction there comes into being what does not really come into being as well as what does not really abide what is not really the mind and what are not really phenomena From the force of their coming into being an understanding is created and its influence leads to activity subject to karma Similar karma mutually attracts and because of the karma of this mutual attraction there is a coming into being and then a ceasing to be This is the reason for the distorted phenomenon of beings nanda what is the distorted phenomenon of worlds Because of the existence of the mind and of what the mind observes there arises the unreal phenomenon of beings divided into individual bodies and from this boundaries are established There is no abiding nor any place of abiding there is only a constant and unending flux The three periods of time and the four directions of the worlds intersect and combine and in this way beings are transformed into any one of twelve classes Thus in this world because there is movement there are sounds and because there are sounds there are visible objects Because there are visible objects there are odors Because there are odors there are objects of touch Beings are bound to the cycle of death and rebirth and according to their various distorted attributes they may be born into this world from an egg or from a womb or in the presence of moisture or via metamorphosis Some beings are born with bodies that they may or may not make visible while others may be born without physical form Some beings are born capable of cognition but lacking a physical body others are born with their cognitive function inactive Some beings have physical forms that are not selfsufficient and others sometimes lack and sometimes do not lack physical form That mental activity combines with vital energies to create eightyfour thousand kinds of disordered predilections for flying or for being submerged These become the fish birds turtles and snakes In their multitudes they have spread throughout the world Further beings are bound to the cycle of death and rebirth in this world as a result of impure mingling which arises from distorted desires Those desires combine with procreative substances to create eightyfour thousand kinds of disordered predilections for standing upright or on four legs Those inclinations combine with warmth to create eightyfour thousand kinds of distorted predilections for fluttering motion The result is the fetal stage of beings who will be born in the presence of moisture These are the dullwitted beings who creep or swim In their multitudes they have spread throughout the world  twelve classes of beings  Further beings are bound to the cycle of death and rebirth in this world as a result of transformations which arise from the distorted desire to assume another form This desire to assume another form upon contact with another beings physical nature combines to create eightyfour thousand kinds of distorted predilections for exchanging the old for the new The result is the fetal stages of beings that are born by metamorphosis These are the creatures that fly or crawl In their multitudes they have spread throughout the world This hindrance combining with an attachment to display produces eightyfour thousand kinds of distorted predilections for glittering and shining That doubt combines with darkness to create eightyfour thousand kinds of distorted predilections to avoid visible form Those shadowy images combine with memories to produce eightyfour thousand kinds of predilections for attachment to seclusion and obscurity The result is the development of beings who are capable of cognition but lack a physical body These are spirits ghosts and phantoms In their multitudes they have spread throughout the world In the beginning these beings come about because of shadowy images that unite with memory to become eightyfour thousand kinds of deluded thoughts that are hidden away and no one is aware of them These false identities combine with impure influences to produce eightyfour thousand kinds of predilection for symbiosis The result is the development of beings whose physical forms are not selfsufficient These include various kinds of beings such as sea anemones which rely on shrimp in order to see In their multitudes they have spread throughout the world This deception combines with what is different to produce eightyfour thousand kinds of predilections for making substitutions Nevertheless the principle of the passage is intact that there are instances in which the natural cognitive tendency to cherish parents and offspring is suspended This killing combines with monstrousness to produce eightyfour thousand kinds of thoughts of devouring ones parents The result is the development of beings which sometimes lack and sometimes do not lack a cognitive capacity These are such beings as owls whose young are hatched on the ground and mirrorsmashing birds that lay their eggs in a toxic fruit These offspring then feed upon their parents In their multitudes they have spread throughout the world These are the twelve classes of beings   Three Gradual Steps A Avoiding the Plants of the Onion Group nanda all twelve of these classes of beings are affected by all twelve of these distortions Like the disordered and elaborate images that appear when pressure is exerted upon the eye these distortions completely obscure the wondrous perfect pure true and understanding mind with deluded and disordered mental activity Now however you wish to practice and to master the samādhi of the Buddhas You should take three gradual steps in order to eradicate the fundamental factors that are the source of this disordered mental activity Taking these steps will be like cleaning a pot that has held poisonous honey by scouring it with hot water mixed with the ashes of burnt incense The first is the practice that eliminates contributing factors The second is the practice of truly ending any violation of the fundamental rules of behavior The third is the practice of vigorously turning away from intentional engagement with perceived objects What are the contributing factors nanda the twelve classes of beings of this world cannot sustain themselves without some kind of nourishment which may be taken in one of four ways by mouth by touch by thought or by consciousness That is why the Buddha says that all beings take nourishment in order to sustain themselves Ghosts spirits and some gods eat by touching  levels of being All beings must take nourishing food to live nanda and if they consume a toxic substance they may die If eaten cooked it increases desire eaten raw it can cause people to lose their temper This is one reason why people who follow the Path should not eat meat Gods and ascetic masters of the ten directions keep their distance from anyone who eats these plants because the plants cause people to stink including even people who can expound upon the twelve types of discourse spoken by the Buddha Hungry ghosts meanwhile will come to lick and kiss the lips of people who have eaten these plants Such people will always be accompanied by ghosts and their blessings will lessen day by day When people who eat the plants of the onion group practice samādhi the Bodhisattvas gods ascetic masters and wholesome spirits of the ten directions will not come to protect them Demonkings of great power however will seize the opportunity to appear before these people in the form of a Buddha and will pretend to speak Dharma to them These demons will denounce the precepts and will praise sexual desire anger and delusion Such people at the end of their lives will inevitably join the retinues of demonkings Recently a book was published in India praising the tantric practices claiming that enlightenment can be reached through sexual practices nanda beings who wish to enter samādhi must strictly observe the pure precepts They must rid themselves of sexual desire once and for all They must not consume alcohol or meat  levels of being vital energies are not consumed for nourishment nanda if people who practice do not put an end to their sexual desire and do not refrain from taking life it will be impossible for them to transcend the three realms  three gradual steps People of this world who are accomplished in following the precepts will be free forever of the mutual karma that arises when one kills in this life and so is killed in turn in a subsequent life Further people of this world who do not steal from one another will never become indebted to one another they will incur no debts from the past You control your physical behavior and avoid the offenses deserving of expulsion  Then you follow the Bodhisattvas pure regulations the ten major and fortyeight minor Bodhisattva precepts in order to control your mental activity This is the path that people who practice must walk When such pure people practice samādhi they will very naturally be able to see the worlds of the ten directions while remaining in their bodies born of their parents and without needing the celestial eye They will see the Buddhas and hear the Dharma and they will respectfully receive the sages instructions in person They will gain great spiritual powers they will be able to roam playfully throughout the ten directions and they will have clear knowledge of past lives They will never encounter danger or difficulty That is the second step they should take in their practice in order to make progress on the Path Avoiding Intentional Engagement with Perceived Objects What is meant by intentional engagement with perceived objects nanda  levels of being faculties become one and cease to function in six separate ways Then the lands throughout the ten directions will be as pure and as transparent as a bright moon appearing within a crystal In their bodies and minds they will experience bliss wondrous perfection and their essential equality with all beings and all things They will know peace and great tranquility In their midst all the ThusCome Ones will appear  mysterious perfect pure and wondrous These people will soon develop patience with the state of mind in which no mental objects arise Because they take these steps in their practice they will as a result of their practice abide peacefully in the succession of stages on the path to become sages That is the third step one should take in ones practice in order to make progress on the Path   The FiftySeven Stages of the Bodhisattvas Path A Arid Wisdom nanda when in good people emotional love and desire have dried up and their sensefaculties are no longer paired with senseobjects their remaining habitual tendencies no longer arise Their attachments are emptied out and their minds are clear What is left is pure wisdom whose brilliant and perfect nature shines throughout the worlds of the ten directions This pure wisdom exists because their desires have dried up and so this stage is called Arid Wisdom Although their habits of desire have now dried up they have not yet entered the stream of the ThusCome Ones Dharma From this true and wondrous perfection yet another true and wondrous perfection appears and they experience a wondrous and unshakable confidence All their deluded acts of mind are ended and the Middle Way remains as the only truth This stage of stabilizing the mind is called Confidence These people by means of Arid Wisdom which is the initial vajramind  reach the state where a wondrous perfection reveals itself and opens out in abundance  That is the stage of Arid Wisdom  levels of being  This true confidence brings about complete clarity so that all is fully understood and the aggregates the sites and the constituent elements can no longer be a hindrance These people are now able to see before them all the habits they cherished during their successive lives throughout countless eons in the past they can even tell what habits they should expect to have in the future These good people then can remember all their habits forgetting none By means of this essential clarity these people advance into a true state of purity This stage of stabilizing the mind is called Advancement by Means of Essential Clarity  As this essential clarity becomes more and more present to them their minds function by means of wisdom alone This stage of stabilizing the mind is called The Mind Residing in Functioning with Wisdom  As they become steadfast in this wisdom and its light their minds extend everywhere in clarity and stillness  a stillness that is wondrously constant and unchanging This stage of stabilizing the mind is called Abiding in Samādhi  As this samādhi becomes more luminous their wisdom grows and with this wisdom they enter yet more deeply into samādhi so that they only advance they never retreat This stage of stabilizing the mind is called Resolve  As they advance in this state of mind they are ever more tranquil They cherish this state and do not let go of it and they become connected with the energy of the ThusCome Ones of the ten directions This stage of stabilizing the mind is called Protecting the Dharma  As they successfully protect their enlightened understanding they use its wondrous power to become able to redirect the light of the Buddhas compassion inward to the Buddhas tranquil abode It is as if light were being reflected between two mirrors and as if wondrous images of light were appearing in the mirrors in an infinite regress They abide in the unconditioned and will no longer lose ground This stage of stabilizing the mind is called Steadfastness in Precepts With this secret interplay of light they obtain the Buddhas steadfastness and unsurpassed wondrous purity There is a hidden connection between the light of the practitioners mind and the light of the Buddhas minds Your minds light reaches the Buddhas and their light reaches you Having mastered this steadfastness in precepts they are able to roam playfully throughout the ten directions going wherever they wish This stage of stabilizing the mind is called Accomplishing What One Wishes C Ten Abodes  nanda these good people have entered these ten states of mind with true skillinmeans and their minds essence is radiant The functions of these ten states of mind are now completely integrated This stage is called The Abode of the Resolved Mind  From within that state of mind light shines forth like pure gold appearing from within a flawless crystal and these good people rely upon that wondrous state of mind just described to discipline themselves  For a more detailed explanation of the Ten Abodes see The Flower Adornment Sūtra The Ten Dwellings with the commentary of Tripitaka Master Hua trans Buddhist Text Translation Society Talmage California This stage is called The Abode of Leveled Ground  On this level ground of the mind their wisdom is integrated so that they attain a luminous understanding Their travels throughout the ten directions are now without hindrance or obstruction This stage is called The Abode of Practice on the Path  They walk the Buddhas Path and share in the Buddhas energy and so  just as beings who seek new parents while in the passage between death and rebirth connect with their new parents without the parents being aware of it  so these good people as if at the moment of conception enter into the ThusCome Ones family This stage is called The Abode of Noble Birth The intermediate consciousness is what is reborn  the fiftyseven stages of the bodhisattvas path  They have now entered the ThusCome Ones family so they inherit the attributes of the Awakened Ones just as every human feature is already fully evident in the unborn child This stage is called The Abode of Full Development of Expedient Attributes  Their outward appearance is like a Buddhas outward appearance and their minds share the attributes of the Buddhas mind This stage is called The Abode of the Right State of Mind  Mentally and physically resembling the Buddha they grow day by day This stage is called The Abode of Irreversible Development  Their ability to have their bodies appear in ten forms  each form endowed with spiritually efficacious attributes  comes to fullness at the same time This stage is called The Abode of Childlike Purity  Once they are fully formed they come forth from the womb as the Buddhas children This stage is called The Abode of the DharmaPrince  Having grown to adulthood they are like a crown prince who has come of age To him the king entrusts the affairs of state and he is anointed as the Kśatriya lords royal heir This stage is called The Abode of Anointment D Ten Practices  nanda these good people having become children of the Buddha are fully endowed with the immeasurable and wondrous virtues of the ThusCome Ones They respond to the needs of all beings throughout the ten directions They are at the stage called The Practice of Happiness The first of the Bodhisattvas perfections is the practice of giving of which there are three kinds They become skillful in doing good deeds for all beings This stage is called The Practice of Beneficial Deeds This practice corresponds to perfection in following precepts In the process of awakening themselves and awakening others they become skillful in not opposing and not resisting Unto the farthest reaches of the future they undergo rebirth freely and equally among the various kinds of beings in the three periods of time throughout the ten directions This stage is called The Practice of Inexhaustibility Undergoing rebirth among the various kinds of beings  For them the various ways of practice merge into a single practice and in these practices they are beyond error Within what is identical many different attributes appear and these good people perceive the identity that exists among all these different attributes This stage is called The Practice of Skill with Regard to What Manifests What is identical is the general principle What is different are the specific instances Zhenjiao   levels of being  In the same way these good people perceive that all the worlds in the ten directions appear in each and every mote of dust throughout space in the ten directions without any mutual interference This stage is called The Practice of Nonattachment Not only does difference appear within identity and identity within difference but within the few the many can appear and within the many the few are evident Within the small the great can appear within the great the small are evident This is the seventh perfection skillinmeans They look upon each of these states of mind as the foremost among the perfections When these good people perceive that all is perfectly interfused in this way they are able to conform perfectly to the rules and regulations of all the Buddhas throughout all ten directions Each and every one of these practices in its fundamental nature is pure and without outflows such that all are a single unconditioned truth Ten Dedications  nanda now that these good people have gained full spiritual powers and have gained proficiency in doing the work of the Buddhas they are entirely pure and true and they are far from all hindrance and misfortune They will now be able to rescue beings and yet they have relin the fiftyseven stages of the bodhisattvas path quished all attachment to their rescuing of beings In rescuing them they turn from the mental state that is apart from conditions towards the path that leads to nirvana This is the stage called Dedicating the Rescue of Beings while Remaining Unattached The myriad practices they cultivate are mere flowers in the air This is a mistaken point of view They abandon what should be abandoned and leave behind what should be left behind Their inherent enlightenment deep and clear is equivalent to the enlightenment of the Buddhas This stage is called Dedicating Ones Identity with All Buddhas  Dedicating in the sense of wishing that the positive results of ones practice will be enjoyed by other beings  levels of being  When the essential truth is fully revealed these good people stand on the same ground as the Buddhas This stage is called Dedicating Ones Ability to Reach All Places  Having entered worlds and having become identical with the ThusCome Ones they now experience both of these as merged together without a hindrance By means of these pure intentions they radiate light and they do not stray from the path to nirvana This stage is called Dedicating Ones Roots of Goodness That Are Grounded in the Same Reality as the Buddhas  Since their roots of goodness have now been grounded in reality they each make this contemplation All beings in the ten directions have the same fundamental nature that I have and now that my nature is fully realized I know that no being is excluded from it This stage is called Dedicating the Contemplation of Ones Identity with All Beings Buddhas and Bodhisattvas see themselves and all beings as having the same nature This stage is called Dedicating the Suchness of Reality within All Phenomena  the fiftyseven stages of the bodhisattvas path  When they have truly reached the suchness of reality they meet no obstacles anywhere throughout the ten directions This stage is called Dedicating on Behalf of Liberation from All Bonds  When they have fully realized the virtue of their true nature all limits to the DharmaRealm are eradicated This stage is called Dedicating the Boundlessness of the DharmaRealm F Four Additional Practices nanda when in each of these fortyone stages these good people have completely purified their minds they next master four wondrous and perfect additional practices First they are on the brink of being able to model their minds on the Buddhas enlightenment They are like a piece of wood smoldering when it is drilled This is called The Stage of Heating Up The analogy is of wood which is drilled to obtain fire this stage of the Bodhisattva is compared to the point just before the wood ignites Next in that their minds are about to complete the journey that the Buddhas have made they are as if on the point of no longer being bound by the earth They are like a person standing on a mountain summit with his body in the air and hardly any solid ground beneath his feet This is called The Stage of Standing at the Peak  Their minds and the minds of the Buddhas had been separate but now they have become one They gain true understanding of the Middle Way This is called The Stage of Patience  When all delineations have melted away these good people no longer distinguish between confusion and enlightenment and the Middle Way Theres no name for this state but we have to call it something so we force the issue and call it the Stage of Preeminence in the World It is foremost in the world because there is no second Ten Grounds  nanda these good people have fully understood the Great Enlightenment and their awakening is much the same as the ThusCome Ones They have fathomed the state of the Buddhas mind This stage is called The Ground of Happiness  The different natures become identical and that identity itself disappears At the point of ultimate purity bright light appears This stage is called The Ground of Shining Light  At the point of ultimate luminosity there is full awakening This stage is called The Ground of Wisdom Blazing Forth  For a full explanation of the Ten Grounds see The Flower Adornment Sūtra This stage is called The Ground of Being Hard to Surpass  The pure nature of the unconditioned suchness of reality now becomes clearly manifest This stage is called The Ground of Manifestation  They reach the very boundaries of the suchness of reality Everything is the true mind the suchness of reality This stage is called The Ground of No Movement  They now skillfully reveal the functioning of the suchness of reality Since such functioning must be connected with wisdom it is called Using Wisdom Skillfully   The wondrous cloud of compassion covers the sea of nirvana with its shade This stage is called The Ground of the DharmaCloud H Two Final Stages When ThusCome Ones reverse their direction and the Bodhisattvas advance towards them along the path of practice they meet at the  The meaning here is that the Buddhas come back along the Bodhisattva Path in order to teach beings while the Bodhisattvas are advancing towards the state of the Buddhas   levels of being threshold of the Buddhas enlightenment This stage is called the Equivalent Enlightenment Thus nanda they have progressed from the stage of Arid Wisdom to the stage of Equivalent Enlightenment Their ground of awakening is the wisdom that results from the drying up of ignorance within the Vajramind The enlightenment of the Buddhas and the enlightenment of the Bodhisattvas merge at this point At each of these stages with their Vajramind they have used ten profound analogies to make the contemplation that all is an illusion They have stopped the flow of deluded thoughts in their minds and by means of the ThusCome Ones contemplative insight they have advanced step by step as they bring their pure practice to fulfillment The ten profound analogies are as follows  All karma is like an illusion Because they have taken the three gradual steps nanda these people are fully capable of reaching each of the fiftyfive stages along the true path to full awakening saṃbhogakāya Ch   Naming the Discourse Then the Bodhisattva Mañjuśrī Prince of Dharma stood up in the assembly and bowed at the Buddhas feet He said to the Buddha respectfully What shall this discourse be called How shall we and other beings hold it in respect and rely on it in our practice The Buddha said to Mañjuśrī This discourse may be called The Sutra of the Supreme and Magnificent DharmaImprint of the Mantra of the White Canopy Which Is Spoken above the Crown of the Great Buddhas Head and Which Is the Serene and Pure Oceanic Eye of the ThusCome Ones of the Ten Directions It may also be called The Sutra Concerning the Rescue of the Buddhas Cousin nanda the Teachings for Liberating Him the Awakening of the Nun Named Nature in this Assembly and Her Entry into the Sea of AllKnowing It may also be called The Hidden Basis of the ThusCome Ones Practices and the Basis of their Verification of Ultimate Truth It may also be called The Sutra of the Wondrous Royal LotusFlower of the Expanded Teachings and of the DhāraṇīMantra That Is the Mother of All Buddhas Throughout the Ten Directions It may also be called The Sutra of the Consecrating Mantra Phrases and the Myriad ūraṅgama Practices of the Bodhisattvas In this way you may you hold it in respect and rely on it in your practice The Wondrous Royal LotusFlower is the ūraṅgama Sutra the DhārāniMantra is the ūraṅgama Mantra The Myriad ūragama Practices of the Bodhisattvas is another reference to the ūragama Mantra  naming the discourse O deep and wondrous Honored One allknowing pure and still ūraṅgama the King of Mantras rarest in the world Extinguishing distorted thoughts from countless eons past  No need to wait forever to attain the Dharmabody  When the Buddha had spoken these words nanda and the others in the assembly  having heard the ThusCome Ones instruction concerning the meaning of the hidden Dharmaimprint of the Mantra of the White Canopy and the profoundly significant titles for this discourse  immediately understood the practices of meditation in stillness that lead to advancement through the stages of sagehood They progressed in their mastery of the wondrous truth Their minds became empty of all deliberation They broke free of the six kinds of subtle affliction that in the three realms affect the practitioners mind You skillfully help beings break free of subtle and deeply buried delusions Today you have brought me delight in body and mind It has been of great benefit to me Many beings are stubborn and obstinate WorldHonored One granted that at the fundamental level this true pure mind with its wondrous understanding fully pervades all things Granted that all things from the entire planet with its forests and plains to the most minute forms of wriggling life have as their foundation and source the suchness of reality which is identical to the true essence of the Buddhahood realized by all ThusCome Ones Given all that why are there still the destinies of hells ghosts animals asuras humans and gods since the essential nature of all Buddhas is the true reality WorldHonored One do these destinies exist of their own accord or do they come into being based on the deluded habits of living beings WorldHonored One there was the case of the Bhikṣuṇī Precious LotusFragrance who had been following the Bodhisattva Precepts but then indulged her lust in secret and afterward made the false claim that sexual acts involve no retribution because they do not involve killing or stealing Immediately after she said this her reproductive organs burst into flame and the fire spread through all her joints as she fell into the Unrelenting Hell  the hells Although the bhikṣuṇī LotusFragrance had accepted the Bodhisattva Precepts she not only broke her vow of celibacy  she also praised sexual desire by claiming that sexual acts have no karmic retribution There were also King Virūḍhaka and Bhikṣu Sunakṣatra King Virūḍhaka exterminated the Gautama clan and Sunakṣatra persisted in making false statements about the emptiness of phenomena These two also fell alive into the Unrelenting Hell Do hells have a fixed location We younger disciples are uninformed about this matter and we only hope that the Buddha out of his great kindness will explain it so that beings who are following the precepts will hear precisely what the teaching is will joyfully and reverently accept it and will take care to avoid error in order to maintain purity B The Roles of Emotion and Thought The Buddha said to nanda An excellent question It will keep people from adopting wrong views about this matter Listen carefully now I will explain this matter to you The fundamental nature of all beings is truly pure nanda but because of their wrong views they develop deluded habitpatterns which are of two kinds those that are internal and those that are directed outward When they are influenced by emotional desire nanda and their feelings accumulate steadily they generate fluids associated with emotion Thus when beings think of delicious foods their mouths water When they think of others who are no longer alive whom they may have cherished or may have hated their eyes fill with tears When they are seeking wealth they experience intense craving and when they encounter someone whose body is sleek and glowing lust takes hold of their thoughts Emotions differ nanda but all are alike in that they are associated with secretions which may be exuded or may remain within the body When they yearn for something higher beings have uplifting thoughts and when these thoughts accumulate steadily they can generate a superior energy Thus those who follow the precepts feel that their bodies are serene and beings who hold mantras in their minds develop an heroic and fearless air about them If they aspire to birth in the heavens they will dream of  the hells floating or flying If they are mindful of the Buddhalands sacred visions will appear to them privately nanda these aspirations differ but all are alike in that they lead beings to soar upward by conferring either lightness or upward motion nanda all beings in all worlds are caught up in an endless succession of births and deaths While beings are alive they follow their natural inclinations and upon their deaths they follow the various currents of their karma At the moment of death while some warmth remains in their bodies all the good and all the evil that they have done during their lifetimes suddenly appear before them Their inclinations are to shun death and to embrace life  two habitual emotions that complement each other and are felt at the same time They may become flying ascetic masters or ghostkings of great power or flying yakṣas or rākṣasas that travel along the ground Such beings roam  That is all thought and no emotion  See part  below  the hells unhindered in the Heaven of Four Celestial Kings They will be born in the human realm The brighter their thoughts the greater their intelligence will be the darker their emotions the duller their wits will be If their emotions are of greater weight they will become furbearing beasts and if their emotions are of lesser weight they will become winged creatures If emotion is seventy percent of their mental activity and pure thoughts are thirty percent they will fall beneath the disk of water and will be reborn as hungry ghosts along the rim of the disk of fire They will be buffeted by the raging fire and they will be constantly burned by the blaze and scalded by the steam For hundreds of eons they will have nothing to eat or to drink The karma of hungry ghosts is such that when they see water it turns into a raging fire If emotion is ninety percent of their mental activity and pure thoughts are ten percent they will fall through the disk of fire and will be reborn between the disk of fire and the disk of wind If their emotions are less  See part  and note   levels of being weighty they will enter a hell where suffering is intermittent If their emotions are of greater weight they will enter either the Unrelenting Hell When they are ruled entirely by emotion they sink into the Unrelenting Hell If in this submerged state of mind they have spoken ill of the Mahāyāna teachings or of the Buddhas precepts if they have recklessly propounded false doctrines which they present as being in accord with Dharma if they have greedily sought the offerings of the faithful under false pretenses if they have shamelessly accepted undeserved reverence from others or if they have committed the five unnatural crimes or the ten major offenses then they will be reborn in the Unrelenting Hell in one world after another throughout the ten directions Beings undergo these retributions exactly in accord with the evil karma that they create But though they have brought their retributions upon themselves they will share the same fate in the same place with other beings who have created the same karma So dont outsmart yourself Its better to follow the precepts Ten Causes and Six Retributions nanda these retributions are the consequences of individual beings intentional acts For this karma there are ten causes based on beings habits and beings undergo in turn six kinds of retribution  the hells  What are these ten causes nanda The first cause is the habit of sexual desire which when joined to physical contact leads to intercourse When the friction of contact is sufficiently prolonged there is an inner feeling of a great raging fire erupting from within It is like the warmth that arises when the hands are rubbed together When the latent habitual energies of sexual desire erupt into the fires of habitual sexual activity the consequence in the hells will be the experience of the iron bed and the copper pillar Therefore when the ThusCome Ones of the ten directions see evidence of sexual desire and the activity that results from it they call these things the fires that arise from craving Bodhisattvas view sexual desire as something to be avoided as one would avoid a fiery pit  The second cause is the habit of craving which when one is attracted to something leads to plotting and planning When the attraction and the grasping are incessant there is an inner feeling of freezing cold and solid ice It is like the experience of the air being cold when one inhales sharply through the mouth When latent habitual energies of craving are compounded with habitual acts of craving the consequence in the hells will be the experience of freezing which causes babbling chattering and whimpering and which cracks ice into shapes of blue and red and white lotuses and other such  The text says simply Ch  This very compact discussion of ten causes for birth in the hells follows a repeating rhetorical pattern Therefore when the ThusCome Ones of the ten directions see evidence of excessive greed they call them the water of craving Bodhisattvas view craving as something to be avoided as one would avoid a sea of pestilent poisons The third cause is the habit of arrogance which when compounded with haughty feelings of selfsuperiority leads to competitiveness When that arrogance continues unchecked there is an inner feeling of a rushing torrent of leaping waves of water It is like the mouth watering when a person tries to taste his own tongue When the latent habitual energies of arrogance are expanded to include habitual arrogant acts the consequence in the hells will be the experience of rivers of blood rivers of ashes burning sands or seas of poison or the experience of molten copper being poured over ones body or of being forced to swallow the copper Therefore when the ThusCome Ones of the ten directions see instances of arrogance and arrogant acts they call them taking a drink of stupidity Bodhisattvas see arrogance as something to be avoided as one would wish to avoid drowning at sea The fourth cause is the habit of hatred which when joined to a predilection for defiance leads to confrontations When ones entanglement in habits of defiance is unrelenting there is an inner feeling of the heart becoming so hot that it burns and its fiery energy becomes like metal Then this person will feel as if he is being exposed to mountains of knives of iron clubs of swords standing like forests or arrayed like spokes of a wheel and of axes spears and saws It is like a harbored grievance intensifying until it explodes into an urge to kill When the latent habitual energies of hatred recklessly incite habitual acts of hatred the consequence in the hells will be the experience of being castrated dismembered beheaded abraded pierced flogged clubbed and so forth Therefore when the ThusCome Ones of the ten directions see instances of hatred and hateful acts they call them sharp swords Bodhisattvas view hatred as something to be avoided as one would wish to avoid being executed The fifth cause is the habit of enticing others which when joined to a fondness for conniving leads beings to the practice of entrapment When the latent habitual energies of enticing others become prolonged leading to acts of entrapment the consequence in the hells will be the experience of handcuffs and fetters along with cangues and chains attached to cangues whips and canes clubs and cudgels and so forth Therefore when the ThusCome Ones of the ten directions see enticement and entrapment they call them cunning thieves Bodhisattvas view defrauding others as something worthy of fear as one would fear a pack of jackals The sixth cause is the habit of falsehood which when joined to deviousness leads to insinuations and insults When these insinuations rise to the level of treachery such a person will feel as if he is being covered with dust and dirt and with excrement and urine and all manner of filth It is like the dust that when stirred up by the wind obscures peoples vision When the latent habitual energies of lying are added to acts of deceit the consequence in the hells will be the experience of sinking and drowning first being hurled upward then flying through the air then falling floating and finally perishing Therefore when the ThusCome Ones of the ten directions see instances of falsehood and insinuation they call them robbery and murder Bodhisattvas view lying as something to avoid as one would avoid stepping on a venomous snake The seventh cause is the habit of festering resentment which when joined to a propensity to nurse hatreds leads to acts of vengeance Such a person will come to feel as if he is being stoned or being imprisoned in cells or in cages mounted on carts or being confined in urns or in sacks that are then beaten It is like the evil designs harbored and nurtured by venomous and secretive people When the latent habitual energies of making false accusations merge with acts of making such accusations the consequence in the hells will be such experiences as being hurled seized stabbed and stoned Therefore  levels of being when the ThusCome Ones of the ten directions see instances of resentment and vengeance they call them unscrupulous and harmful ghosts Bodhisattvas view making false accusations as equivalent to drinking liquor laced with a fatal poison The eighth cause is the habit of holding wrong views which when joined to a temperament that automatically rejects the opinions of others leads to such mistaken understandings as the wrong view that the self is real wrong views concerning prohibitions and wrong views concerning karma Such a person will come to feel as if he has been brought before officials of the royal court to determine what views he has held When the latent habitual energies of holding wrong views are joined to acts that result from holding wrong views the consequence in the hells will be the experience of being interrogated while subjected to devious tricks and to highpressure questioning so that all is eventually brought out into the open The youths who keep track of good and evil deeds consult the evidence to counter the offenders arguments and excuses Therefore when the ThusCome Ones of the ten directions see instances of wrong views they call them pittraps Bodhisattvas consider attachment to wrong and biased views as equivalent to standing on the edge of a ditch full of pestilent water The ninth cause is the habit of blaming which when joined to a predilection for defamation leads to making false accusations Such a person comes to feel that he is being crushed between mountains or between boulders or that he is being broken on stone wheels or being ripped by plows or being ground up by millstones These are like the injuries visited on good people by a slanderous villain When the latent habitual energies of blaming lead to habitual unjust acts the consequence in the hells will be the experience of being pressed pummeled bagged squeezed and strained then weighed and measured and so forth Therefore when the ThusCome Ones of the ten directions see false accusations being made they call them vicious tigers Bodhisattvas view unjust acts as equivalent to claps of thunder The tenth cause is the habit of disputatiousness which when joined to a predilection for obfuscation and concealment leads to vociferous court proceedings Such a person will feel that in the end everything will be revealed as if reflected in a mirror by the light of a candle  just as no shadows can hide people when they are in full sunlight When the latent habitual energies of disputatiousness are joined to engagement in disputes the consequence in the hells will be the truth about ones acts being confirmed by evil companions as if ones karma were illumined in a mirror Therefore when the ThusCome Ones of the ten directions see instances of obfuscation and concealment they call them shadowy villains Bodhisattvas view obfuscation to be as burdensome as the task of carrying a high mountain on ones head while walking in the ocean All beings create karma through their six consciousnesses and they experience  levels of being retribution through their six faculties How is it that the various retributions are experienced through the six faculties First there are the retributions that are the negative consequence of intentional acts of seeing This karma of seeing affects the other five consciousnesses as well When a being is about to die he may first see fire raging throughout the worlds of the ten directions Upon his death his spiritual awareness will ascend and then fall riding downward on a wisp of smoke directly into the Unrelenting Hell Then one of two things may happen If there is light for the being to see by he may perceive all manner of ferocious creatures which cause him to experience the extremes of fear Or there may only be darkness and all will be silent nothing can be seen The being then feels a boundless terror Next that raging fire that he saw may overload his earconsciousness so that he is overwhelmed by the sounds of liquids and molten copper boiling in cauldrons  the hells so that he is overwhelmed by the smells of black smoke and purplish fumes His tongueconsciousness may also be overloaded so that he is overwhelmed by the scorching taste of a gruel of hot iron pellets His bodyconsciousness may be overloaded so that he is overwhelmed by the sensation of hot ashes and blazing embers burning his body His mindconsciousness may be overloaded so that he experiences the processes of cognition as overwhelming spurts of flame and showers of sparks flickering and bursting in the air Second are the retributions that are the negative consequence of intentional acts of hearing First when a being is about to die he may hear the roar of gigantic waves as they inundate earth and sky Upon his death the beings spiritual awareness will sink downward riding the waves directly into the Unrelenting Hell Then one of two things may happen If the being can hear he may perceive a crashing din that causes him to become dull and deranged Or the being may be unable to hear and the utter absence of sound causes him to sink into mental darkness That roar of the gigantic waves that he heard may now overload his earconsciousness so that he hears voices accusing and interrogating him Next his eyeconsciousness may be overloaded also so that he is overwhelmed by a vision of thunderclouds composed of noxious vapors His noseconsciousness may also be overloaded so that he is overwhelmed by the stench of marshwater infested with venomous bugs that swarm over his body as the water drenches him His tongue levels of being consciousness may be overloaded so that he is overwhelmed by the tastes of pus blood and all kinds of filth His bodyconsciousness may be overloaded so that he is overwhelmed by the feeling that his body is covered with the feces and urine of beasts and ghosts His mindconsciousness may be overloaded so that he experiences the processes of cognition as overwhelming lightningstrikes and pounding hail Third are the retributions that are the negative consequence of intentional acts of smelling First when a being is about to die he may perceive toxic vapors thickly filling the air far and near Upon his death his spiritual awareness will try to rise above the vapors but instead he will fall into the Unrelenting Hell Then one of two things may happen If the beings nasal passages are open he will inhale so much of the noxious vapors that his mind becomes deranged Or if his nasal passages are blocked he will suffocate lose consciousness and fall to the ground The vapors that he smelled may overload his noseconsciousness and he will feel that he is being subjected to interrogations concerning his character and past behavior Next the vapors may overload his eyeconsciousness so that he is overwhelmed by visions of flames and torches The vapors may also overload his earconsciousness so that he is overwhelmed by the cries of beings drowning in cauldrons filled with boiling liquids The vapors may also overload his tongueconsciousness so that he is overwhelmed by the taste of rotten fish and rancid stews The vapors may overload his bodyconsciousness so that he is overwhelmed by an experience of being split open and of putrefying into a great mountain of flesh with a hundred thousand open wounds like so many open eyes and these wounds are fed upon by countless maggots His mindconsciousness may also become overloaded so that he experiences the processes of cognition as ashes and fumes and as sand and gravel flying though the air to pound and shatter his body Fourth are the retributions that are the negative consequence of intentional acts of tasting First when a being is about to die he may perceive a net of redhot iron that covers the whole world  the hells with intense heat Upon his death the beings spiritual awareness will fall into the net and be suspended there hanging upside down until he falls into the Unrelenting Hell Then one or two things may happen He may breathe a vapor in through his mouth and this vapor may cause his tongue and his whole body to freeze solid and crack Or if he tries to spit the vapor out he will be engulfed by a raging fire which burns him to the marrow of his bones As his tongueconsciousness undergoes these experiences he will feel that he is being forced to make confessions and to suffer punishments Next his eyeconsciousness may have the experience of overwhelming visions of being burned by hot metal and hot stones His earconsciousness may undergo an overwhelming experience of sounds seeming to stab him with sharp blades His noseconsciousness may undergo an overwhelming experience of his nose becomng a gigantic cage of iron that encompasses everything around him His bodyconsciousness may undergo an overwhelming experience of being pierced by arrows and darts His mindconsciousness may be overwhelmed by the experience of the contents of his mind seeming like flying bits of hot iron raining down on him from the sky Fifth are the retributions that are the negative consequence of intentional acts of touching First when a being is about to die he may perceive great mountains closing in on him on all sides so that he cannot escape Upon his death the beings spiritual awareness will perceive a great iron city teeming with firedogs and firesnakes and with tigers wolves and lions Oxheaded guards of the hells and horseheaded rākṣasas armed with spears drive the being through the city gates and into the Unrelenting Hell Then one of two things may happen Or if the beings body is no longer capable of sensation swords will pierce his body and slice up his heart and liver As his bodyconsciousness undergoes these experiences it will seem to him that he is being clubbed caned stabbed or pierced with arrows  levels of being Next his eyeconsciousness may have an overwhelming vision of being engulfed in flames His noseconsciousness may undergo the overwhelming experience of suffocation due to being confined to a sack or else by the experience of restricted breathing when he is tied up and beaten His tongueconsciousness may undergo the overwhelming experience of his tongue being plowed up or clamped and pulled out or chopped up or cut out His mindconsciousness may undergo the overwhelming experience of the contents of his mind falling or flying or frying or roasting Sixth are the retributions that are the negative consequence of intentional acts of cognition First when the being is about to die he may encounter a violent wind that lays waste to the lands Upon his death the beings spiritual awareness may be conscious of being swept high up into the air and then of plummeting down along the winds straight into the Unrelenting Hell Then one of two things may happen If the being lacks clear awareness his extreme confusion may lead to panic and he will run about ceaselessly Or if he is conscious and not confused he will be fully aware of his suffering as he feels that he is being endlessly fried and burned The excruciating pain will be beyond bearing These perversities in his mindconsciousness may now become so overwhelming that it will seem to him that he is being confined Next his eyeconsciousness may experience overwhelming visions of people interrogating him and confronting him with testimony His earconsciousness may undergo an overwhelming experience of what seems to him to be the din of great rocks clashing together or else of what seem to be storms of ice or of dust that cloud his hearing His noseconsciousness may undergo an overwhelming experience of what seems to him to be a great burning whether of a chariot or a ship or a prison His tongueconsciousness may undergo an overwhelming experience of sensations that are felt by the tongue when it is uttering great shouts cries groans of regret and sobs His bodyconsciousness may undergo an overwhelm the hells ing experience of being expanded or shrunk or of lying facedown while he undergoes ten thousand deaths and rebirths within a single day nanda these are the ten causes and six negative consequences of being reborn in the hells All these experiences are created by beings confusion and delusion Many different hells have just been described and all result from the ten habitual causes If a beings six consciousnesses all create evil karma at the same time he will enter the Unrelenting Hell where he will undergo an immeasurable amount of suffering for uncountable eons However if the negative consequences arise from intentional acts that were committed at separate times by the faculties engagement with their objects the being will enter one of the Eight Cold Hells If a being commits acts of killing stealing and sexual misconduct with body speech and mind  all three  then he will enter one of the Eighteen Hells However if a being has committed only two of the three major offenses  for example if he has killed and has stolen  then he will enter one of the ThirtySix Hells And if he has committed only one of the three major offenses with only one of the three creators of karma then he will enter one of the One Hundred and Eight Hells Therefore individual beings create their own karma by their own acts but if their karma is the same as other beings karma they will all fall into the same hells in this world Apart from those acts the hells have no independent existence   The Destiny of Ghosts Next nanda after these beings have passed through eons of fire to pay the debts they incurred for committing these offenses  such offenses as violating and vilifying the precepts and the rules for deportment violating the Bodhisattva Precepts slandering the Buddhas teachings about nirvana and all the other various offenses  then these beings will become ghosts These individuals denounce the idea of precepts and rules of deportment by saying things such as  People should be free to do as they please However there are many more kinds of ghosts The ones described here are merely representative If it was a craving for possessions that led a being to commit offenses then once the debt incurred for committing those offenses is paid the being will encounter some object assume its form and become a bizarre shapeshifting ghost If it was craving for the opposite sex that led a being to commit offenses then once the debt incurred for those offenses is paid the being will encounter a wind assume its attributes and become a droughtghost If it was a craving to mislead people that led a being to commit offenses then once that debt is paid the being will encounter an animal assume its form and become an animalpossessing ghost  Ch mei gui  a ghost that possesses animals as mentioned here It may also possess a person The Sanskrit name is not known  the destiny of ghosts If it was the cravings and emotions of hatred that led a being to commit offenses then once that debt is paid the being will encounter a venomous creature assume its form and become a hexpoison ghost If it was the cravings and emotions of longcherished enmity that led a being to commit offenses then once that debt is paid the being will encounter some enfeebled creature assume its attributes and become a plagueghost If it was the cravings and emotions of arrogance that led a being to commit offenses then once that debt is paid the being will encounter some source of vital energy assume its attributes and become a hungry ghost If it was a craving to indulge in slander that led a being to commit offenses then once that debt is paid the being will encounter some source of dark energy assume its attributes and become a nightmareghost If it was a craving to indulge in perverse uses of intelligence that led a being to commit offenses then once that is paid the being will encounter some source of intense vital energy assume its attributes and become a malicious shapeshifting ghost Although this person may consider himself to be extremely intelligent in fact he is totally confused in what he does If it was a craving for selfish advancement that led a being to commit offenses then once that debt is paid the being will encounter someone who has light and will assume the attributes appropriate for becoming an attendant ghost If it was a craving to form factions that led a being to commit offenses then once that debt is paid the being will encounter some human assume that persons attributes and become an oracleghost  Skt vyāḍa Ch wangliang  Once they have burned away their debts in the hells they ascend to be reborn as ghosts This too is a consequence of their own delusion If they were to become fully awakened then with their wondrous and perfect understanding they would know that fundamentally these retributions are not real at all   The Destiny of Animals nanda once a being has made full payment on that part of his karmic debt which he was due to pay as a ghost his mind will empty itself of the emotions and thoughts that brought him to the ghostly destiny Now he must come to this world to face the enmity of his original creditors and in person repay what he owes them Thus he is born in the body of an animal to repay his debts from his previous lives When the object disintegrates then the being having undergone its retribution as a ghost is reborn into this world usually as an owl When the wind dies down then the being having undergone its retribution as a ghost is reborn into this world usually among the various kinds of animals that are considered to be ill omens When the animal dies then the being having undergone its retribution as a ghost is reborn into this world usually as a kind of fox Suppose a being has been a hexpoison ghost and has assumed the attributes of a venomous creature When that venomous creature dies then the being having undergone its retribution as a ghost is reborn into this world usually as an animal that is venomous itself When that creature dies then the being having undergone its retribution as a ghost will be reborn into this  levels of being world usually as a kind of parasitic worm When that energy disperses then the being having undergone its retribution as a ghost is reborn into this world usually among the kinds of animals that are eaten by people When that energy disperses then the being having undergone its retribution as a ghost is reborn into this world usually among the animals that serve people or that are a source of peoples clothing When that energy is exhausted then the being having undergone its retribution as a ghost is reborn into this world usually as a migratory bird When that persons light is extinguished then the being having undergone its retribution as a ghost is reborn into this world usually among one of the many kinds of animals that are considered to be good omens When that human dies then the being having undergone its retribution as a ghost is reborn in the world usually among animals who serve people as companions or as messengers In this way nanda when the fires of their karma have caused their lives as ghosts to wither away these beings are reborn as animals in further repayment of the debts they incurred during their previous lives If they experience a full awakening then with their wondrous and perfect understanding they will know that fundamentally these retributions are not real at all You spoke earlier of Bhikṣuṇi LotusFragrance King Virūḍhaka and Bhikṣu Sunakṣatra They themselves created their evil karma It did not  In asking for instruction at the beginning of part  above  the destiny of animals descend upon them from the heavens nor did it emerge from the earth Yet all this consists merely of illusions and delusions that manifest within the fully awakened mind   The Destiny of Humans Moreover nanda suppose these beings having been born as animals to pay the debts they incurred in previous lives live longer as animals than their debts have required On that basis these beings can now return to their original status as humans and provided that their strength their blessings and their merit are sufficient they can retain their human bodies as compensation for their overpayment of their karmic debt But if their blessings are not sufficient they will fall back into the realm of animals in order to make a direct payment of any other debts they owe nanda beings should realize that they should settle their debts whether with money goods or labor so that their indebtedness can naturally come to an end But if during this process beings take each others lives or eat each others flesh then they may well continue through countless eons killing each other and eating each other as if they were turning ceaselessly on a wheel now on top now beneath The wheel may never stop unless they undertake the practice of calming the mind or unless a Buddha appears in the world Now you should understand that when beings who have been owls have paid their debts they will regain their human form and will be born among people who are pigheaded and stubborn When beings who have been animals that are considered to be ill omens have paid back their debts they will regain their human form and be reborn among people who are deformed When beings who have been foxes have paid back their debts they will regain their human form and will be reborn among people who are of lowly status and low intelligence When beings who have been venomous animals have paid back their debts they will regain their human form and will be reborn among people who are vicious When beings who have been parasitic worms have paid back their debts they will regain their human form and will be reborn among people who are menial workers When beings who have been animals of the kind that are eaten by people have paid back their debts they will regain their human form and will be reborn among people who are weakwilled and dependent When beings who have been animals of the kind that serve people or of the kind that are a source of peoples clothing have paid back their debts they will regain their human form and will be reborn among manual laborers When beings who have been migratory birds have paid back their debts they will regain their human form and will be reborn among people of refinement When beings who have been animals serving as good omens have paid back their debts they will regain their human form and will be reborn among people who are intelligent  levels of being When beings who have been domesticated animals have paid back their debts they will regain their human form and will be reborn among people who are accomplished nanda all these people have paid their debts from previous lives and have regained their human form Since time without beginning they had been creating the karma that results from deluded scheming and they had been taking turns killing and being killed If they do not encounter a ThusCome One or if they do not hear the true Dharma then in the midst of the stress of entanglement with perceived objects they will repeat this cycle of karma indefinitely as the Dharma explains These people are to be deeply pitied   The Destiny of the Ascetic Masters nanda there are also people who practice kinds of samādhi that do not follow the path that leads to true awakening Instead their practices are based on a mistaken intent to fortify the physical body They seclude themselves in mountain forests beyond the reach of people These are the ascetic masters of which there are ten kinds Some of these beings nanda in their effort to fortify themselves tirelessly devote themselves to a diet of medicinal potions When they have perfected this dietary practice they become ascetic masters who are earthbound Some of them in order to fortify themselves tirelessly devote themselves to a diet of medicinal herbs When they have perfected this practice they become ascetic masters who can fly When they have perfected their alchemical practice they become ascetic masters who are adept at roaming freely Some of them in order to fortify themselves tirelessly devote themselves whether they are moving or still to bringing their spirit and their vital energies to perfection The tendency was to interpret these practices in terms of Daoist practices which were well known in China  levels of being Some of them in order to fortify themselves tirelessly devote themselves to transforming their saliva When they have perfected their skill in these practices they become ascetic masters who adhere to a specific path Some of them in order to fortify themselves tirelessly devote themselves to mental control of their vital energies  the destiny of the ascetic masters this practice so that they can bring it to mind at will they become ascetic masters who practice by means of contemplative illumination When they have perfected this practice they become ascetic masters who are adept at a practice that is based on their inner essences When they have perfected their understanding of this practice they become ascetic masters who are without peer nanda all these are people who in training their minds do not follow a path that leads to a correct awakening Instead they seek to know the secrets of living a long life and they may live for thousands of years They retire deep into the mountains or onto an island in the ocean cutting themselves off from human contact However because of their deluded thinking they too are bound to the cycle of death and rebirth The Gods of the Six Heavens of Desire  nanda some people in this world do not seek what is everlasting and cannot yet renounce their love and affection for their spouses But if their minds do not turn to thoughts of sexual misconduct they will develop a certain purity and radiance After their lives have ended they will ascend to the vicinity of the sun and moon Such people become gods in the Heaven of the Four Kings Some others have only a small amount of desire for their spouses but they do not manage to live in complete purity After their lives have ended they will ascend beyond the sun and moon to dwell at the summit of Mount Sumeru While they are in the human realm their desire is quiescent more than it is active After their lives have ended they abide peacefully shining with their own radiance in a realm of space that is so far above the sun and the moon as to be beyond the reach of sunlight and moonlight Such people become gods in the Heaven of SelfRestraint Some others are always still except when they are unable to resist the stimulus of contact After their lives have ended they ascend to a refined place that is isolated from the lower heavens and from the human realm Here they are untouched even by the three great disasters that come at the end of an eon Such people become gods of the Heaven of Joyous Contentment  Some others have no desire themselves but will respond to the actions of their spouses For them the act itself has no more flavor than wax After their lives are ended they ascend still higher to a realm of creativity Such people become gods in the Heaven of Delight in Creating Yet others have no mundane thoughts Although their actions seem no different than the actions of ordinary people their minds transcend the acts that they engage in nanda these six kinds of gods have transcended the physical act of mating but their minds are not free of it The Gods of the Eighteen Heavens of Form The First Dhyāna  nanda some people in this world in refining their minds do not avail themselves of the practice of meditation in stillness and so they do not develop wisdom Nevertheless if they can refrain from sexual activity and if their minds are free at all times of any thought of sexual desire such that they are undefiled by sexual passion they will not remain in the realm of desire These people if they wish may be reborn as one of the companions of Brahma in the Heaven of Brahmas Retinue These people have cast out their habits of desire and with their minds free of desire they delight in following the precepts and the rules of deportment At all times they are able to practice the virtue of purity and so they become gods in the Heaven of the Ministers of Brahma When in body and mind these people have attained a wondrous perfection such that their flawless deportment inspires awe they will not only follow the prohibitory precepts in complete purity but will gain a clarity of understanding as well They become great Brahman kings in the Heaven of the Great Brahma and at all times they are able to govern their retinues of gods nanda the gods at these three levels are free of the burdens of suffering and affliction Although their samādhi is not the genuine samādhi  Dhyāna elsewhere has referred to the practice of meditation in stillness or to states of mind achieved through meditation here however dhyāna refers to the states of mind of the gods in the eighteen heavens in the realm of form  the destiny of the gods that results from correct practice their minds are nevertheless pure and their outflows are not active These are the gods of the heavens of the first dhyāna The Second Dhyāna  Next nanda above the gods of the Brahma Heavens are gods who govern them and who have perfected the practice of purity The minds of these higher gods are lucid and still From their deep tranquility light comes forth They abide in the Heaven of Lesser Light Next are gods who emit light and who  as they shine upon one another with an inexhaustible brilliance  illumine their realm throughout the ten directions turning it all to crystal They abide in the Heaven of AllPermeating Light They are able to emit and to respond to many kinds of pure light and they use this light to convey countless meanings The gods of these three heavens which are higher than the heavens of the first dhyāna are freed from the burdens of worry and anxiety Although their samādhi is not the genuine samādhi that results from correct practice their minds are nevertheless pure and their coarse outflows have been subdued They are the gods of the heavens of the second dhyāna When practitioners meditate and enter the second dhyāna their breath comes to a halt and just as in the first dhyāna their pulse stops The Gods of the Eighteen Heavens of Form The Third Dhyāna  nanda to the gods who have perfected light as a medium of communication the wondrous secrets of this medium are now revealed They refine their practice until they succeed in opening their minds to the bliss of stillness These are the gods of the Heaven of Lesser Purity Next they experience a state of purity and emptiness which expands until it becomes boundless Their bodies and minds are serene and are filled with tranquil bliss These are the gods of the Heaven of AllPermeating Purity After their bodies and minds have become completely pure the world itself is purified due to the virtue of their perfected purity This purified state becomes a superior place of refuge in which they can rest in the bliss of tranquility These are the gods of the Heaven of Universal Purity nanda in these three heavens which are above the heavens of the second dhyāna the gods experience perfect harmony and their bodies and minds are peaceful and secure They enjoy allpermeating bliss Their samādhi is not the genuine samādhi that results from correct practice but because their minds are peaceful and secure they are filled with bliss These are the gods of the Heavens of the third dhyāna Before you reach the third dhyāna your thoughts are still active The Fourth Dhyāna  Moreover nanda there are gods whose bodies and minds are no longer creating the causes for future suffering They realize that the bliss of the heavens is impermanent and must eventually decay and they thereupon renounce both suffering and bliss Because they have put an end to all coarse and burdensome mental attributes the essence of pure blessing is created These are the gods of the Heaven of the Creation of Blessings Once they have wholly renounced those mental states they gain a superior understanding and purity In their state of unlimited merit they experience a wondrous harmony that is everlasting These are the gods of the Heaven of Cherished Blessings On one path some gods of the Heaven of Cherished Blessings are able to shine with a pure and infinite radiance such that the light of their blessings and their merit is perfected They will be secure in the results of their practice and will become gods of the Heaven of Great Fruition On the other path are gods who while dwelling in the Heaven of Cherished Blessings reject both suffering and bliss and intensely and unrelentingly investigate the practice of renunciation When they have thoroughly understood that practice and have completely mastered it their bodies disintegrate and for five hundred eons their minds are utterly still like cold and compacted ashes But because they have based their practice on the mind that comes into being and ceases to be they are unable to discover the true nature that neither comes into being nor ceases to be Their cognitive processes cease but then revive during the last half of the final eon These are the gods of the Heaven of the Cessation of Cognition nanda the gods of these four heavens which are above the heavens of the third dhyāna can no longer be influenced by any worldly states of suffering or bliss However they do not base their practice on the unmoving and unconditioned mind and they still harbor intentions to attain something Yet their spiritual skill is pure and perfected These are the gods of the heavens of the fourth dhyāna The gods in these heavens have by this time completely eliminated the nine stages of habitual delusion Here both suffering and bliss have been forgotten These gods will never again live at any lesser celestial level They dwell together in a place of peace each of them at an equal level of renunciation These five higher heavens may be considered to be among the heavens of the fourth dhyāna but these heavens are the dwelling places of sages and so they are different from the other heavens of the fourth dhyāna First nanda are gods for whom both suffering and bliss have ended so that they no longer have to struggle with contrasting experiences These are the gods of the Heaven Beyond Heat  The nine kinds of habits refer to the first nine categories of the eightyone categories of cognitive delusion  the destiny of the gods  Next throughout the worlds in the ten directions their wondrous vision becomes so flawlessly clear that no perceived object can defile it These are the gods of the Heaven of Refined Vision Next their skill in envisioning becomes yet more refined like the skills of a master potter These are the gods of the Heaven of Clear Envisioning When their contemplation of the myriad subtleties of the nature of form and the nature of space reaches its ultimate point they enter a state of boundlessness and become gods of the Highest Heaven of Form nanda the gods of the lower heavens of the fourth dhāyna  and even their kings  cannot see the gods of these five higher heavens They only hear about them with admiration just as ordinary dullwitted people in the world cannot see Arhats dwelling in the wilderness or deep in the mountains where they keep up their practices in their sacred places for awakening nanda the gods of these eighteen heavens practice in solitude free of entanglements But they have not yet set down the burden of their bodies Thus all these heavens comprise the Realm of Form The Gods on the Four Planes of Formlessness Moreover nanda at the very summit of the Realm of Form the path again divides On one path are those who in their practice of renunciation develop to perfection the full light of their wisdom These gods will transcend all three realms and will become Arhats who will board the Vehicle of the Bodhisattvas They cause their bodies to vanish and to become like space Then they become gods on the Plane of Boundless Space Only their storehouseconsciousness and half of the subtle functions of the individuating consciousness remain When both form and space have come to an end for these gods and when their conscious minds have disappeared entirely then there is stillness throughout the ten directions Nothing remains and there is no place to go These are the gods on the Plane on Which One Has Nothing When their storehouseconsciousness is completely inactive these gods can make use of this cessation of activity to contemplate deeply so that within the endlessness of that consciousness the nature that lies at its ending nevertheless becomes known to them That consciousness now seems to exist and yet not to exist it seems to have disappeared and yet has not These gods now become Arhats of inferior ability who turn away from the Vehicle of the Bodhisattvas Other gods who have come from the Heaven of Cessation of Cognition and from other heavens that are not on the right path never return from their deep contemplation of their emptied consciousnesses Because they lack the knowledge they need they become lost in these heavens As gods who have outflows they eventually will fall back into the cycle of death and rebirth nanda the gods of these heavens are not enlightened Having enjoyed the rewards that were the results of their good karma they must again be bound to the cycle of death and rebirth But the kings of these heavens are Bodhisattvas They play this role while in samādhi and thereby they gradually progress in their practice towards the level of the Sages With regard to the gods on these four planes of formlessness nanda the activities of their bodies disappear and their mental activities cease so that they abide in samādhi They are no longer burdened by any form that is the result of karma These four heavens comprise the realm of formlessness None of the gods of these heavens fully comprehend the wondrous enlightened mind that understands Such accumulated delusions as theirs bring about the illusory existence of the three realms In the midst of these realms each individual in his delusion sinks into the seven destinies to join other beings whose karmas are similar  The fourth heaven of the fourth dhyāna  Skt pudgala   The Destiny of Asuras Moreover nanda in the Three Realms there are also the asuras who are of four kinds Asuras who take the path of ghosts devoting their strength to protecting the Dharma have the spiritual power to live in the air These asuras are born from eggs and are included in the destiny of ghosts Some asuras because their merit is insufficient fall from the heavens and are fated to dwell beneath the sun and the moon These asuras are born from wombs and are included in the destiny of people Some asuras are worldcommanding kings both powerful and fearless They contend for mastery with King Brahma with akra Lord of the Heavens and with the Four Celestial Kings These asuras are born by metamorphosis and are included in the destiny of gods Some asuras  a baser kind nanda  are born in deepwater caves in the middle of the ocean By day they emerge to fly about in the air and at night they return to their watery abodes These asuras are born in the presence of moisture and are included in the destiny of animals  That is on earth   The Seven Destinies Are the Result of Karma nanda such is a detailed explanation of the seven destinies  of beings in the hells and of ghosts animals humans ascetic masters gods and asuras In their confusion all are submerged in the attributes of the conditioned world Their deluded mental activity leads them into rebirth in accordance with their karma Within the wondrous perfect understanding that is the fundamental unconditioned mind these destinies are like mirages of flowers seen in the sky These various beings fail to recognize the fundamental mind nanda and so they are bound to the cycle of death and rebirth They pass through countless eons without ever attaining genuine purity all because they indulge in killing stealing and sexual misconduct If they break the precepts against these three they will be born into the destiny of the ghosts and the other inauspicious destinies If they avoid these offenses they will enter the destinies of the gods and the other auspicious places of rebirth Because these beings are constantly torn between their tendency to commit offenses and their tendency to refrain from committing offenses they continue to be bound to the cycle of death and rebirth That stillness is beyond the duality of existence and nonexistence and that negating of duality is also ended Since they have gone beyond the state in which there is killing stealing and sexual misconduct how could they possibly commit those offenses nanda each being who has not put an end to these three intentional acts creates his own individual karma Their intentional acts arise from delusion which itself has no cause No matter how exhaustively you search for a cause you will not find one You should advise practitioners that if they wish to realize full awakening through their spiritual practice they must no longer engage in these three deluded acts If they do not cease engaging in them then even if they should develop spiritual powers their skills will be limited to the circumstances of the conditioned world Your true nature that is capable of full awakening is not to blame People start out by telling a lie but later they say that they hadnt lied  which is another lie What has been spoken here is the right teaching Rising from the Lions Throne he placed his hand on the table before him which was wrought of the seven precious things But then moving his body which was the color of purplegolden mountains he sat down again and he said to nanda and to the rest of the great assembly You who still need instruction you Hearers of the Teaching and you Solitary Sages have now dedicated yourselves to attaining a great awakening  the supreme and wondrous enlightenment I have now taught you the right method for practice But you are still not aware of the subtle demonic events that can occur when you undertake the practices of calming the mind and contemplative insight If you do not purify your mind you will not be able to recognize demonic states as they arise Listen carefully while I explain this matter in detail Earlier nanda asked the Buddha how to practice he asked for teaching on behalf of the beings of the future nanda and the others in the assembly who still needed instruction stood up bowed to the ground joyfully and then quieted their minds in order to be ready to receive the Buddhas compassionate teaching The Buddha said to nanda and the rest of the great assembly You should know that although the twelve classes of beings in this world have outflows they are nevertheless fundamentally identical to the Buddhas of the ten directions in that they all are fundamentally endowed with the wondrous enlightened understanding  with the awakened perfect essential mind But their thinking is deluded and they have a confused view of the truth and so they stubbornly cling to emotional attachments As a result space appears and as they become more and more confused worlds come into being In the lands in the ten directions numerous as motes of dust beings who have outflows are created out of confusion obstinacy and deluded thinking You should know that space is created within the mind It is like a wisp of cloud in the vastness of the sky The worlds in the emptiness of space are even less significant If you discover true reality by returning to the source space throughout the ten directions will disappear How could all the lands not cease to be as well When you practice meditation in stillness and enter samādhi the essence of your mind merges with the minds of the Bodhisattvas of the ten directions and with the minds of all the great Arhats who have ended outflows You abide in a place of profound purity Then the kings of demons ghosts and spirits and the general population of gods see their palaces collapse inexplicably Their lands quake Terror strikes the creatures who move through water on land and in the air Ordinary people in the darkness of their confusion know nothing of these events All these demonic beings have five spiritual powers they lack only freedom from outflows because they are still attached to the stress of entanglement with perceived objects How could they be happy with seeing their palaces destroyed Celestial demons shapeshifting ghosts and succubusdemons will all come to disturb your samādhi But despite their furious rage they are subject to the stress of entanglement with perceived objects while you abide within wondrous enlightenment Therefore they can do you no harm any more than wind can blow light away or a knife cut water You are like water at the boil and they are like ice frozen solid as they come close to your warmth they will melt When you are absorbed in meditation fully awake and free of delusion how will the deeds of these demons be able to affect you These deviant hordes rely upon dark energy and your light will overcome their darkness If they come near you they will be destroyed How will they dare to linger and try to disrupt your samādhi If your skill hasnt reached that level then you wont encounter these demonic states even if you want to Though she tried to make you break the Buddhas rules all she was able to do was to cast a spell on you In the end you only broke one among all the eighty thousand rules of conduct Because your mind was pure you did not fall But if the demons of the aggregates had been able to destroy your precious Dharmabody you would have become like a member of the family of a government minister whose property has been confiscated Movement outside your mind will seem the same as stillness and the presence of thoughts in your mind will seem the same as the absence of thoughts When you abide in this state having entered samādhi you will be like someone who ordinarily can see clearly but who finds himself in a dark place His essential nature will be wonderfully pure but his mind does not yet emit light When his minds vision does become bright then ten directions will open out before him and the darkness will be dispelled Having come to the end of the aggregate of forms he will now transcend the turbidity of time His contemplations show him that the illusion of solid matter is the basis of this aggregate  However nanda in the midst of his mental darkness this persons intense scrutiny within his wondrous awareness may reveal that the four primary elements are not ultimately interwoven into the body This state is called the essential awareness being able to emerge into ones surroundings What the practitioner has gained is temporary It does not indicate that he has become a sage If he does think he is a sage he will be open to a host of deviant influences Further nanda in the midst of his mental darkness this persons intense scrutiny within his wondrous awareness may allow him to see inside his own body Suddenly he may find that he can pull intestinal worms out of his body without harming himself or the worms This state is called the essential awareness being able to reach deep into the physical body What the practitioner has gained is temporary It does not indicate that he has become a sage There is nothing unwholesome about his state unless he thinks that he is now a sage Further in the midst of his mental darkness this persons intense scrutiny may be directed both inward and outward Then his will and the vital energies of his individual spirit may merge or become dissociated or exchange roles His body will be unaffected Suddenly he may hear the sound of someone teaching the Dharma in the middle of the air or he will hear voices throughout the ten directions proclaiming identical esoteric teachings It does not indicate that he has become a sage There is nothing unwholesome about his state unless he thinks that he is now a sage Further in the midst of his mental darkness a brilliant light may appear within this persons mind and then shine forth to imbue everything throughout the ten directions with the purplegolden color of the River Jambu He may see creatures of every kind becoming ThusCome Ones At that moment he will see Vairocana Buddha seated upon a dais of celestial light and surrounded by a thousand Buddhas Each of these Buddhas while seated on a lotusflower will appear in a hundred million lands at once This state is called the mind and spirit becoming imbued with a spiritual awakening while the mind illuminates all worlds clearly and in detail There is nothing unwholesome about his state unless he thinks that he is now a sage If he does think he is a sage he will be open to a host of deviant influences Further in the midst of his mental darkness as this person continues these contemplations within his wondrous awareness he may be unable to bring them to a halt When he tries to subdue his mind so that these visions do not become overwhelming all of space throughout the ten directions may suddenly take on the colors of the seven precious things or perhaps the colors of a hundred precious gems Each of these colors will pervade all of space but without interfering with each other The practitioner will see the blues yellows reds and whites with perfect clarity This state is called restraining the mind so that its contemplations do not become excessive What the practitioner has gained is temporary It does not indicate that he has become a sage Further in the midst of his mental darkness this persons awareness may shine constantly with a brilliant light Then in the middle of the night and in darkened rooms he may be able to see as clearly as if it  The body of a Buddha that is equivalent to the DharmaRealm  ten demonic states associated with form were broad daylight Objects that would ordinarily be hidden may be clearly visible to him It does not indicate that he has become a sage There is nothing unwholesome about his state unless he thinks that he is now a sage If he does think he is a sage he will be open to a host of deviant influences It may seem to him that his limbs are made of grass or wood If he is burned he will feel nothing If he is stabbed he will feel that his body is like a piece of wood that is being carved This state is called rejecting the four primary elements so that senseobjects disappear and only awareness remains What the practitioner has gained is temporary It does not indicate that he has become a sage There is nothing unwholesome about his state unless he thinks that he is now a sage  fifty demonic states of mind suddenly may see the whole world throughout the ten directions being transformed into a Buddhaland This land will be filled with the seven precious things and will be suffused with light In his vision the sky will be filled with magnificent and beautiful multistoried palaces and with Buddhas  with as many ThusCome Ones as the sandgrains in the River Ganges Nothing will obstruct this persons vision of the hells below and of the palatial abodes of the gods above There is nothing unwholesome about his state unless he thinks that he is now a sage Further in the midst of his mental darkness this persons mind may explore distant places In the middle of the night he may suddenly see marketplaces or public wells or streets and lanes He may see relatives or friends and he will be able to listen to them conversing This state is called the mind having been restrained to an extreme flying outward to see much that has been blocked from view This state does not indicate that the practitioner has become a sage There is nothing unwholesome about his state unless he thinks that he is now a sage If he does think he is a sage he will be open to a host of deviant influences Further in the midst of his mental darkness as he pushes his mental explorations to their limit this person may have a vision of himself as a good and wise teacher He may be able to change his appearance from moment to moment quickly taking on different forms one after another This state is called a vision arising from a deviance in the mind leading to possession by a nightmareghost a mountain spirit or a celestial demon While he is possessed the practitioner may speak spontaneously of what he supposes to be the Dharma and he may claim to have discovered wondrous truths There is nothing unwholesome about this state unless he thinks that he is now a sage If he does think he is a sage he will be open to a host of deviant influences  ten demonic states associated with form These ten states nanda may manifest when these beings practice meditation in stillness and interact with the aggregate of form They may be dulled and confused by these experiences and they will no longer be capable of taking a proper measure of themselves When faced with these circumstances they will become further confused and in their failure to know themselves they will make the claim that they have reached the level of a sage This egregious falsehood will cause them to fall into the Unrelenting Hell After my nirvana you must explain my teachings and transmit them to beings of the time of the Dharmas ending so that all beings everywhere will understand what I have taught Do not allow the celestial demons to have their way Protect these practitioners and lend them support so that they can realize the supreme enlightenment   Ten Demonic States of Mind Associated with the Aggregate of SensePerception nanda as this good person practices samādhi and as his mind becomes still he no will longer experience the aggregate of form He may see the mind of the Buddhas appear to him as if in a mirror But he may not know how to make use of that mind He may undergo what seems to him to be a kind of paralysis If the paralysis subsides his mind will be able to leave his body and he will be able to look back and see his own face He will be able to stay or go as he pleases without further hindrance Having reached the end of the aggregate of senseperception he will now transcend the turbidity of perception He contemplates how this aggregate arises and he sees that its basis lies in illusion and deluded thinking  nanda in this situation this good person experiences an inner light of great brilliance If he has been restraining his mind too severely then wherever he sees beings illuminated by the light that shines forth from his mind he may immediately be overwhelmed by a boundless sorrow He will look upon even mosquitoes and worms as he would look upon a newborn child His mind will be filled with pity and he will frequently burst into tears without knowing why This state is called an excess of severity in ones practice If he understands this state he will  This paragraph describes a successful completion of an encounter with the aggregate of senseperception  ten demonic states associated with senseperception not suppose that he has become a sage and he will not become confused Eventually the state will disappear of its own accord But if he thinks that he has become a sage then a demonic sorrow will enter into the depths of his mind Whenever he sees someone he will feel such sadness that he will break into uncontrollable sobs Having lost his ability to enter correct samādhi he is certain to fall Further in this samādhi once this good person has seen the aggregate of form disintegrate he will see the aggregate of senseperception appear He may then have a vision of his own superiority for which he feels an overwhelming gratitude Immediately a boundless courage and intensity may arise within him so that he comes to believe that his resolve is equal to the resolve of all Buddhas He will announce that he can accomplish in a single moment of thought what others need three quadrillions of eons to accomplish This state is called an excessive and improper haste in trying to excel in ones spiritual practice If he understands this state he will not suppose that he has become a sage and he will not become confused But if he thinks that he has become a sage a demonic insanity will enter into the depths of his mind He will boast about himself to everyone he meets In his boundless arrogance he will acknowledge neither Buddhas nor ordinary people Having lost his ability to enter the correct samādhi he is certain to fall This state is called losing ones way by practicing without sufficient wisdom If he understands this state he will not suppose that he has become a sage This loneliness and boredom are certain to lead them into trouble  the same old trouble of thinking about members of the opposite sex  until they feel very anxious and restless Further in this samādhi once this good person has seen the aggregate of form disintegrate he will see the aggregate of senseperception appear He may have developed his wisdom more strongly than he has developed his samādhi and as a result he may lose himself in a fierce boldness He will cherish a belief in his own superiority and he will make the mistake of supposing that he has become Vairocana Buddha This state is called mental effort leading to a loss of steady discernment upon becoming immersed in a wrong understanding of ones state of mind If he understands this state he will not suppose that he has become a sage But if he thinks that he has become a sage then his contentment with an inferior accomplishment will become demonic and will seize hold of his mind Under its influence he will announce I have discovered the supreme and ultimate truth Having lost his ability to enter correct samādhi he is certain to fall Further in this samādhi once this good person has seen the aggregate of form disintegrate he will see the aggregate of senseperception appear This state is called losing sight of what method is suitable to ones practice If he understands this state he will not suppose that he has become a sage  fifty demonic states of mind But if he thinks that he has become a sage then his chronic despondency will become demonic and will take over his mind He may seize a sword and slash his own flesh happy to give up his life or driven by his chronic despondency he may flee into the mountain forests because he cannot bear the company of other people Having lost his ability to enter correct samādhi he is certain to fall Now that youve read this passage take care not to be unhappy all the time This state is called feeling what one takes to be serenity but lacking the wisdom to exercise selfcontrol If he understands this state he will not suppose that he has become a sage But if he thinks that he has become a sage then his fondness for joy will become demonic and will take hold of his mind He will laugh whenever he meets someone and he will sing and dance in the streets He will claim to have attained an unimpeded liberation Having lost his ability to enter correct samādhi he is certain to fall He may cherish the arrogant belief that he is already enlightened This state is called having the view that one is superior and lacking the wisdom to free oneself of this view If he understands this state he will not suppose that he has become a sage But if he continues to think that he has become a sage then a demonic pleasure in serenity will enter into the depths of his mind The good person will tell himself that he has done enough and he will no longer try to make progress In this he will be acting much like that ignorant monk He will lead people into delusion and error and as a result they will fall straight into the Unrelenting Hell Having lost his ability to enter correct samādhi he is certain to fall He will be convinced by this wrong idea so much so that he will come to the further conclusion that after death there is nothing at all If he understands this state he will not suppose that he has become a sage But if he thinks that he has become a sage then a demonic wrong view of emptiness will enter into the depths of his mind He will speak ill of keeping the precepts saying that precepts are the province of the Lesser Vehicle He will say that since Bodhisattvas have understood emptiness how could there be any keeping or breaking of precepts where Bodhisattvas are concerned Because he himself will feel free to violate the Buddhas regulations he will induce others to commit offenses But if he thinks that he has become a sage a demon of desire will enter the depths of his mind and possess him He will constantly speak of desire as the Bodhisattvas path He will teach his whiterobed followers that those who indulge in indiscriminate promiscuity will be the ones who will inherit his Dharma Because in the time of the Dharmas ending credulous people will be easily swayed by the power of ghosts and spirits he will be able to attract a following of one or two hundred or perhaps five or six hundred people or even a thousand or ten thousand people But when the demon that has possessed him becomes weary of possessing him it will abandon him These ten states nanda may manifest when these beings practice meditation in stillness and interact with the aggregate of senseperception They may be dulled and confused by these experiences and they will no longer be capable of taking a proper measure of themselves When faced  That is the wrong understanding arrived at in the previous  state of mind  That is his disciples among the laity This egregious falsehood will cause them to fall into the Unrelenting Hell After my nirvana you must explain my teachings and transmit them to beings of the time of the Dharmas ending so that all beings everywhere will understand what I have taught Do not allow the celestial demons to have their way Protect these practitioners and lend them support so that they can realize the supreme enlightenment   Ten Demonic States of Mind Associated with the Aggregate of Cognition nanda when a good person who has been practicing samādhi no longer experiences the aggregate of senseperception he will be able to leave his body as if he were a bird escaping from a cage although he will not have put an end to his outflows He retains his ordinary human body but he already has the potential to ascend through the sixty stages of a Bodhisattva He is now able to use his mind to create a spiritual body that can travel about freely just as he wishes He will be like a man who talks while sound asleep but who does not realize he is doing it His voice will be clear enough and his words will make sense enough to be understood by others who are awake Now if the movement of thought in his mind ceases such that all superfluous cognition dissipates then his awakened mind will cease to be defiled He will understand with complete clarity the deaths and rebirths of all the classes of beings without exception He has reached the end of the aggregate of cognition and will now be able to transcend the turbidity of affliction He will contemplate how this aggregate arises and he will see that its basis is the pervasive influence of deluded mental activity nanda in the wonder that ensues when this good person no longer experiences the aggregate of senseperception he will not give rise to any harmful anxiety As he perfects his concentration he will experience light and within his samādhi he may come to crave a more ample  The fiftyseven stages explained in part  above together with the three gradual steps described in part  Then a celestial demon seizing the opportunity it has been waiting for will descend upon some other person and possess him This other person will not realize that he has been possessed and so when he is speaking about the sutras he will claim that he himself has entered the supreme nirvana He will then seek out the good person who has avidly desired to develop his skill Then the possessed person will arrange a seat and begin to teach his methods Demons can discern what it is that you crave and they can use that to tempt you He will be able to instantly change his appearance causing his listeners to see him as a monk or as Lord akra or as a precepted laywoman or a nun He may cause his body to emit light while he is reclining in a darkened room He will disturb their minds profoundly As a result their sexual desires will overwhelm them and their lusts will lead them into illicit and clandestine liaisons in violation of the Buddhas moral guidelines If you encounter people who are manifesting spiritual powers as described in this passage dont get carried away by what you see no matter what it is Then he and his followers will run afoul of the law of the royal domain You should be aware of all this in advance so that you will not be reborn among these celestial demons If you do not recognize what is happening to you you will become confused and you will fall into the Unrelenting Hell As he perfects his concentration he will experience light and within his samādhi he may come to crave the  fifty demonic states of mind experience of roaming far and wide by letting his concentrated thought fly forth Then a celestial demon seizing the opportunity it has been waiting for will descend upon another person and possess him This other person will not realize that he has been possessed and so when he is speaking about the sutras he will claim that he himself has entered the supreme nirvana He will then seek out the good person who avidly wishes to roam far and wide Then the possessed person will arrange a seat and begin to teach his methods He himself will not change his appearance but he may cause the people who are listening to him to suddenly see themselves sitting on magnificent lotusflowers with their entire bodies transformed into masses of purplegolden light They all will feel that they have experienced something entirely new They will be fooled into thinking that the possessed person is a Bodhisattva and as their minds are weakened by lust they will enter into illicit and clandestine liaisons in violation of the Buddhas moral guidelines The possessed person will like to say that Buddhas are appearing in the world He will claim that in such and such a place such and such a Buddha has appeared as a particular person Or he will claim that such and such a person is some particular Bodhisattva who has come to teach people and transform them Then he and his followers will run afoul of the laws of the royal domain  ten demonic states associated with cognition You should be aware of this in advance so that you will not be reborn among these celestial demons Further in the wonder that ensues when this good person no longer experiences the aggregate of senseperception he will not give rise to any harmful anxiety As he perfects his concentration he will experience light and within his samādhi he may come to crave the experience of a sustained merging of minds Then a celestial demon seizing the opportunity it has been waiting for will descend upon another person and possess him This other person will not realize that he has been possessed and so when he is speaking about the sutras he will claim that he himself has entered the supreme nirvana He now will seek out that good person who craves a merging of minds Then the possessed person will arrange a seat and begin to teach his methods He himself will not change his appearance nor does he cause people who have come to hear him to change their appearance But even before they begin listening to him he will make them undergo a series of constantly changing mental experiences He may enable them to remember their past lives or to read other peoples minds or to see into the hells or to be aware of all the good and evil events that are occurring in the human realm Or he may enable them to speak spontaneously in verse or to recite sutras They all will rejoice in their belief that they have just experienced something entirely new and extraordinary They will all be fooled into thinking that the possessed person is a Bodhisattva He will make them feel inexhaustible cravings and they will enter into illicit and clandestine liaisons in violation of the Buddhas moral guidelines  That is to recite as if from memory sutras that they have not actually memorized  fifty demonic states of mind This possessed person will delight in saying that some Buddhas are greater and some lesser or that some Buddhas are senior and some junior or that some are genuine and some are false or that some are male and some are female Then he and his followers will run afoul of the laws of the royal domain You should be aware of this in advance so that you will not be reborn among these celestial demons Further in the wonder that ensues when this good person no longer experiences the aggregate of senseperception he will not give rise to any harmful anxiety As he perfects his concentration he will experience light and within his samādhi he may crave knowledge of ultimate origins He may wish to

He now will seek out the good person who craves knowledge of ultimate origins Then the possessed person will arrange a seat and begin to teach his methods This everlasting Dharmabody has been passed down from father to son in uninterrupted succession What you see at this moment is nothing else but the land of the Buddha The pure abode is nowhere else and no other body has the hallmark of golden light His listeners accepting his words on faith will abandon their former intentions They will offer up their lives to him in the belief that they have obtained something new and extraordinary They will be fooled into thinking that the possessed person is a Bodhisattva Striving slavishly to anticipate his wishes they will enter into illicit and clandestine liaisons in violation of the Buddhas moral guidelines The person who has been possessed will delight in saying that the eyes ears nose and tongue are the Pure Land and that the male and female genital organs are the real locus for full awakening to nirvana Ignorant people will believe such degrading words Then he and his followers will run afoul of the laws of the royal domain You should be aware of this in advance so that you will

the supreme nirvana He now will seek out that good person who craves psychic responses Then the possessed person will arrange a seat and begin to teach his methods This possessed person will be able to briefly appear to his listeners as a man who is a hundred years old or even a thousand years old Their minds will be infected with such devotion to him that they cannot bear to be parted from him They will act as his personal attendants and never weary of making four kinds of offerings to him Each wishes to sit at his feet and he makes them all believe that he was their teacher in previous lives their good and wise mentor Out of a singular infatuation for his teachings and in the belief that they have experienced something new and extraordinary his followers will cleave to him as if they have been adhered to him with glue Seduced by his teachings they will enter into illicit and clandestine liaisons in violation of the Buddhas moral guidelines The person who has been possessed will delight in saying that in the past during such and such a previous lifetime he had brought the teachings to a certain group of people who in their previous lives had been his wives or concubines or his older or younger brothers He will say Now we are together again so that I can come to your rescue We will all return to such and such a world and make offerings to the Buddha there Or he may speak of another place a heaven filled with brilliant light a place where a certain Buddha dwells and where all the ThusCome Ones find rest and repose People who have no wisdom will believe his mendacious ravings and they will forget their original intent to practice in accord with Dharma Then he and his followers will run afoul of the laws of the royal domain You should be aware of this in advance so that you will not be reborn among these celestial demons If you do not recognize what is happening to you you will become confused and you will fall into the Unrelenting Hell Further in the wonder that ensues when this good person no longer experiences the aggregate of senseperception he will not give rise to any harmful anxiety As he perfects his concentration he will experience light

is ordered to do so At this all who are present are filled with admiration for the person who has been possessed He will expose peoples private affairs such that they cannot escape ridicule and contempt Then he and his followers will run afoul of the laws of the royal domain You should be aware of this in advance so that you will not be reborn among these celestial demons If you do not recognize what is happening to you you will become confused and you will fall into the Unrelenting Hell Further in the wonder that ensues when this good person no longer experiences the aggregate of senseperception he will not give rise to any harmful anxiety As he perfects his concentration he will experience light and within his samādhi he may come to crave knowledge that he alone will possess With diligence and toil examining and probing he will avidly seek to know about previous lives Then a celestial demon seizing the opportunity it has been waiting for will descend upon another person and possess him This other person will not realize that he has been possessed and so when he is speaking about the sutras he will claim that he himself has entered the supreme nirvana He will now seek out that good person who craves exclusive knowledge Then the possessed person will arrange a seat and will begin to teach his methods Or the animal carries other jewels or letters and other documents or bamboo tablets or tallies or talismans or other peculiar objects Anyone who takes one of these objects from the animal will be possessed by the demon He may beguile his listeners into believing in him by saying that the place where they are is illuminated by a pearl that is buried underground and yet emits the light of the moon All who witness this feel that they have experienced something entirely new and extraordinary He will delight in speaking about treasures to be found in other places or in speaking about remote locations where sages from the ten directions dwell in seclusion Those who accompany him in his wanderings will encounter strange and remarkable people This is called being troubled by a ghost or spirit that has become a demon in its old age It may be a ghost or spirit of a mountain forest or of the earth or of a walled town or of a river or a mountain peak The possessed person may publicly advocate lustful behavior in violation of the Buddhas precepts while privately he and his attendants indulge themselves in the objects of the five desires Perhaps he may adhere strictly to a diet of wild plants and the bark of trees but he will not exert himself to practice samādhi When the demon has wearied of troubling and confusing the person it has possessed it will abandon him Then he and his followers will run afoul of the laws of the royal domain You should be aware of this in advance so that you will not be reborn among these celestial demons As he perfects his concentration he will experience light and within his samādhi he may come to crave spiritual powers including extraordinary bodily powers He will seek to know the source of these powers and capabilities Then a celestial demon seizing the opportunity it has been waiting for may descend upon another person and possess him This other person will not realize that he has been possessed and so when he is speaking about the sutras he will claim that he himself has entered the supreme nirvana He now will seek out that good person who avidly seeks to acquire spiritual powers and he will arrange a seat and begin to teach his methods This possessed person may take hold of some fire and holding the fire in his hands he may place a portion of it on top of the head of each of his listeners among the four assemblies The flames on top of the listeners heads may rise several feet but they will not be hot and no one will be burned Or the possessed person may walk on water as if he were walking on dry land or he may sit tranquil and unmoving in the middle of the air or without the slightest difficulty he may enter into a large jar or bag or he may pass through closed windows or through walls Only in the presence of weapons will he feel ill at ease He may cause people to see visions of Buddhalands but these visions will not be of anything real Rather they will be created by the demons power to delude people He will praise lustful acts and instead of condemning such coarse behavior he will use these indecencies to transmit his teachings This is called being troubled by a powerful goblin who has become a demon in its old age It may be a mountaingoblin either of the heavens or of the earth or it may be a goblin of the seas or of the winds or a rivergoblin or an earthgoblin or a forestdemon that over a period of eons has absorbed the vital essences of trees and grasses Any one of these may possess the person but when it has wearied of troubling and confusing him it will abandon him Then he and his followers will run afoul of the laws of the royal domain You should be aware of this in advance so that you will not be reborn among these celestial demons Further in the wonder that ensues when this good person no longer experiences the aggregate of senseperception he will not give rise to any harmful anxiety As he perfects his concentration he will experience light and within his samādhi he may come to crave a state of mental cessation Then a celestial demon seizing the opportunity it has been waiting for will descend upon another person and possess him This other person will not realize that he has been possessed and so when he is speaking about the sutras he will claim that he himself has entered the supreme nirvana He now will seek out that good person who craves mental vacuity Then the possessed person will arrange a seat and begin to teach his methods People who are the objects of his lusts will also have an experience of vacuous stillness They too will deny the existence of cause and effect This is called being troubled by a demon that began as a vital energy generated by eclipses of the sun or moon Such energy may have been incubated within a piece of gold or jade or in a medicinal fungus or herb or else in a onehorned beast a spiritraptor a tortoise or a crane Having passed undying through thousands of years this vital energy will develop its own sentient life and will be reborn into this world It will possess the person just mentioned and when it has wearied of troubling and confusing that person it will abandon him Then the possessed person together with his followers will run afoul of the laws of the royal domain You should be aware of this in advance so that you will not be reborn among these celestial demons Moreover in the wonder that ensues when this good person no longer experiences the aggregate of senseperception he will not give rise to any harmful anxiety As he perfects his concentration he will experience light and within his samādhi he may come to crave a long  ten demonic states associated with cognition life Then he will labor to understand the mental process involved in becoming immortal He will hope for immediate escape not only from the physical death and rebirth of the body but also from the coming into being and perishing of mental hindrances He wishes to abide forever in a subtle form Then a celestial demon seizing the opportunity it has been waiting for will descend upon another person and possess him This other person will never realize that he has been possessed and so when he is speaking about the sutras he will claim that he himself has entered the supreme nirvana He will seek out that good person who craves immortality and he will arrange a seat and begin to teach his methods He will say that he can bring things back from the places he has traveled to Or when he is in a dwelling he may tell someone to walk from the east wall to the west wall of a room  a distance of a few paces  and yet no matter how quickly that person walks he will not be able to cross the room He would not be able to do so even over a period of years For such reasons as these people will believe in the possessed person and make the mistake of thinking that he is a Buddha who has appeared before them I am the original Buddha and always have been I did not become a Buddha through some spiritual practice This is called being troubled by the king of the Heaven of Pleasure Derived from What Others Create This king will send down to earth a member of his retinue  perhaps a goddess from his own heaven or a young energyeating demoness from the Heaven of the Four Kings but not one who has made a resolve to practice in accord with the Dharma It will appear to him in the form of a beautiful woman and together they will engage in such a frenzy of lust that before a year has passed the practitioners physical vitality will be depleted You should be aware of this in advance so that you will not be reborn among these celestial demons If you do not recognize what is happening to you you will become confused and you will fall into the Unrelenting Hell  ten demonic states associated with cognition appear in a body that they have created for themselves but in either case they will make the claim that they have already attained the right and universal awakening of a Buddha They will praise sexual desire and will violate the Buddhas regulations These evil and demonic teachers that I have just described will transmit their teachings to their followers by engaging in sexual acts with them In these ways depraved demons will take control of practitioners minds and for the practitioners next nine lives or for as many as a hundred lives the practitioners will join the retinues of demons although they may have wished to be true to their former practices At the end of those lives they will inevitably become demons themselves When you reach the level at which no further instruction is needed you should still hold fast to your vow to be reborn during the time of the Dharmas ending Let your great compassion come forth Rescue beings whose minds are true and whose faith is deep Make sure that they are not possessed by demons and that their knowledge and viewpoints are correct The Buddha is rescuing you now from the cycle of death and rebirth By respectfully carrying out the instructions that the Buddha has given you you will requite the kindness that he has shown you These ten states nanda may manifest as these beings practice meditation in stillness while they are engaged in interaction with the aggregate of cognition They may become dulled and confused by this experience and they may no longer be able to take a proper measure of themselves When faced with these circumstances they may become further confused and in their failure to know themselves they will make the claim that they have reached the level of a sage This egregious falsehood will cause them to fall into the Unrelenting Hell After my nirvana you must explain my teachings and transmit them to beings of the time of the Dharmas ending so that all beings everywhere will understand what I have taught Do not allow the celestial demons to have their way He will view all the phenomena in the world  the mountains the rivers and everything else  as mere reflections that briefly appear in a clear mirror leaving nothing behind disappearing without a trace receiving and reflecting nothing more If he is able to see the subtle glimmering vibrations which are the origin of beings revert to the clarity that is their original nature then his habitual karma will become still just as clear waters become calm when waves are stilled He will have reached the end of the aggregate of mental formations He will be able to transcend the turbidity of individual beings nanda you should know that this good person has gained right knowledge and has calmed his mind such that he is firmly settled into the light generated by his correct mental state None of the ten kinds of celestial demons will have any chance to influence him At this point external demons can no longer use their tricks to disturb the practitioners samādhi However sometimes transformations take place in his own aggregate of mental formations causing him to have wrong ideas Other wrong views arise not in association with observations but simply from logical reasoning How might this be This person will have already completely eliminated the means for the arising of cognitive distortions Employing his eyefaculty with its eight hundred degrees of efficacy he will now be able to see all beings caught in the swirling flux of their karma during the previous eighty thousand eons as they meet their death in one place and are born again in another But he will not be able see beyond eighty thousand eons and therefore he will suppose that eighty thousand eons ago all beings in the worlds throughout the ten directions came into being of their own accord independently of any cause Because of this speculation he will lose all the ground that he has gained in his quest for right and universal wisdom In his confusion about the nature of full awakening he will fall and take a wrong path Or second this person may not discern any cause for the ending of life How might this be He has discerned that some humans are reborn as humans and he has been aware of birds being reborn as birds He may therefore conclude that black crows are inevitably reborn as black crows while swans are inevitably reborn as white swans He may conclude that people and gods are always reborn among beings who walk upright and that animals are always reborn as beasts that walk on four legs and also that washing is not what makes white swans white nor dyeing what makes crows black He will therefore conclude that for the last eighty thousand eons until the present moment no being has been reborn into a different class wu yin lun  the theory that causes do not exist or that causes cannot be found in effects In his confusion about the nature of full awakening he will fall and take a wrong path These two theories that deny causation constitute the first group of wrong paths In his practice of samādhi nanda this good persons mind has settled into the light generated by his correct mental state No demon will have any chance to influence him He may now focus on a thorough investigation of the constant and subtle movement at the origin of the lives of all the classes of beings He may begin to speculate about all that he has observed about the constancy of this movement and in so doing he may fall into the error of adopting one of four theories concerning universal everlastingness First as this person fully investigates the nature of his mind and what it experiences he may conclude that there is no cause either for the mind or for what it perceives  ten demonic states associated with mental formations deaths and rebirths that all beings throughout the ten directions have suffered during the previous twenty thousand eons He may observe that throughout that period of time as these beings have clung to the cycle of death and rebirth their minds and their minds experiences have not been lost Second as this person fully investigates the origins of the four primary elements it may seem to him that these primary elements never change His practices may enable him to discern the cycle of death and rebirth that all beings throughout the ten directions have undergone during the previous forty thousand eons He may observe that throughout this period of time there has been no alteration in the nature of the primary elements On that basis he may speculate that it is the nature of the primary elements to be everlasting Third as this person fully investigates the perceptual functions of the sixth consciousness the individuating consciousness and the storehouse consciousness it may seem to him that from their very origins it has always been the nature of these consciousnesses to be everlasting His practices may enable him to discern the cycle of death and rebirth undergone by all beings throughout the ten directions during the previous eighty thousand eons It may seem to him that throughout this period of time beings consciousnesses have maintained their original natures On that basis he may speculate that the inherent nature of these consciousnesses is everlasting Fourth as this person comes to the end of the aggregate of cognition it may seem to him that the source of coming into being and ceasing to be has stopped functioning In his confusion about the nature of full awakening he will fall and take a wrong path These four theories about what is everlasting constitute the second group of wrong paths Further when in his practice of samādhi this good persons mind is firmly settled in his correct mental state no demon will have any chance to influence him He may now focus on a thorough investigation of the constant and subtle movement at the origin of the lives of all the classes of beings First as he observes the above this good person may speculate that his minds wondrous understanding pervades all the worlds throughout the ten directions He may take his mind in its profound stillness to be the ultimate cosmic self and he may speculate that this unmoving cosmic self with its focused understanding pervades the ten directions He may suppose that within his cosmic mind all beings die and are reborn Therefore he may conclude that his mind which he takes to be the cosmic self is everlasting while the beings that upon their death are reborn within his mind are not everlasting Second instead of observing his mind this person may observe the worlds everywhere throughout the ten directions as many as the sandgrains in the River Ganges He may see worlds that are in the declining eon of their life cycle and he may conclude that these worlds must ulti That is the constant and subtle movement at the origin of life   Skt puruṣa Ch Third this person may instead focus his observations on the refined subtle and hidden aspects of his mind which may seem to him like the tiny motes of dust that float and swirl about throughout the ten directions their nature never changing He may speculate that this subtle aspect of his mind controls the death and rebirth of his body He may conclude that this subtle aspect of his mind is an indestructible and everlasting self whereas he as a person who repeatedly dies and is reborn from that permanent self must be impermanent Fourth as this person becomes aware of the ending of the aggregate of cognition and as he observes the wavelike flux of the aggregate of mental formations he may speculate that the constant flux of the aggregate of mental formations is everlasting Since at that point the aggregates of form senseperception and cognition have already ceased functioning he may conclude that these three aggregates are not everlasting In his confusion about the nature of full awakening he will fall and take a wrong path These four theories about what is everlasting and what is not everlasting constitute the third group of wrong paths Further when in his practice of samādhi this good persons mind is firmly settled in his correct mental state no demon will have any chance to influence him He may then fully investigate the origins of the lives of all the classes of beings First this person may speculate that the wavelike flux that is the source of life continues to function without cease He may conclude that both past time and future time are finite while the mind functioning in the present moment continues indefinitely and so is infinite Second in his samādhi this person may be able to see beings throughout eighty thousand eons of the past When he attempts to perceive earlier eons he does not see or hear anything there The expanse of time in  fifty demonic states of mind which he sees and hears nothing he supposes to be infinite while the expanse of time in which he perceives beings he supposes to be finite Third this person may speculate that his own awareness is infinite and that all other people appear within his awareness However he is not aware of other peoples awarenesses and therefore he may conclude that their awarenesses are merely finite not infinite as he supposes his is Fourth this person may thoroughly investigate the aggregate of mental formations in his wish to bring this aggregate to an end Based on what he has observed of the pathways of his mind he speculates that a portion of the mind of each and every individual being is subject to coming into being and ceasing to be while another portion is not subject to coming into being and ceasing to be Thus he concludes that everything in this world is half finite and half infinite Having made these suppositions about what is finite and what is infinite he will fall and take a wrong path These theories about what is finite and what is infinite constitute the fourth group of wrong paths Further when in his practice of samādhi this good persons mind is firmly settled in his correct mental state no demon will have any chance to influence him He may now focus on a thorough investigation of the constant and subtle movement at the origin of the lives of all the classes of beings Then he may begin to speculate about his own knowledge and viewpoints and in so doing he may fall into error by adopting one of four baseless and distorted theories involving conceptualizations of immortality First this person may observe the source of the fluctuations within the aggregate of mental formations If he perceives variation in the patterns of the flux he will call that variation change If he perceives continuity in the patterns he will call that continuity constancy He will say that what he sees is what has come into being and if he sees nothing he will say that whatever had been there has perished If there is continuity in the patterns of flux he will say that it is caused by augmentation and  Skt parikalpita Ch If someone seeking to learn his methods should come to ask him about his theories he will reply I both come into being and cease to be I exist and yet do not exist I both grow and diminish What he says is so confusing that no one can understand what he means When people come to him with questions he will answer with one word No He will say no more than the single word no Third this person may look intently into his mind and he may see all beings in their various places On this basis he will draw his conclusions When people come to him with questions he will answer with one word Yes He will say no more than the single word yes Fourth this person when looking into his mind may sometimes see beings in their various locations and at other times he may see no beings at all Because of this inconsistency in his experience he may become confused When people come to him with questions he will answer Both yes and no But if it is no then it isnt yes His confused sophistries will not stand up to scrutiny These four baseless theories concerning muddled ideas about immortality constitute the fifth group of wrong paths Further when in his practice of samādhi this good persons mind is firmly settled in his correct mental state no demon will have any chance to influence him He may now focus on a thorough investigation of the constant and subtle movement at the origin of the lives of all the classes of beings He may begin to speculate about the endless flux that  fifty demonic states of mind he has observed and in so doing he may make the mistake of committing himself to confused ideas about the attributes of forms that exist after death Perhaps he is strongly attached to his body and so he will say that his body which is composed of attributes of form is his true self Or perhaps his view is that all worlds are contained within himself and so he will say that his true self contains the totality of all forms Or perhaps he concludes that all perceived objects are dependent for their existence on his perceiving them and so he will say that all the attributes of form belong to his experience On the other hand he may conclude that the existence of his true self is dependent on the constant flux of mental formations and so he will say that he belongs to the attributes of form Cycling through these four speculations he may apply them to each one of the four aggregates so that there are sixteen propositions concerning the attributes of form He also proposes that afflictions will always be afflictions that full awakening will always be full awakening and that the two continue to exist together without ever coming into contact Because he has made these suppositions about the existence of attributes of form after death he will fall and take a wrong path He has become confused about the nature of full awakening This belief in wrongheaded theories concerning the existence after death of attributes of all five aggregates is the sixth of these wrong paths  Further when in his practice of samādhi this good persons mind is firmly settled in his correct mental state no demon will have any chance to influence him He may now focus on a thorough investigation of the constant and subtle movement at the origin of the lives of all the classes  Four because the aggregate of consciousness is not included Having seen that the aggregate of form has ceased to function within his samādhi it may seem to him that his own body exists without a cause Since he is aware that the aggregate of cognition has ceased to function within his samādhi he may suppose that his mind has no connection to anything Having observed that the aggregate of senseperception has ceased to function within his samādhi he may suppose that his cognitive faculty has no connection with objects that he perceives Since these three aggregates have all vanished  even though the fourth aggregate is still functioning  he may suppose that without senseperception or cognition he is the same as a blade of grass or a piece of wood He may conclude that the attributes of the aggregates do not continue after death Cycling through these speculations he will conclude that there are eight instances of their nonexistence Based on these instances he may speculate that nirvana and causation ultimately do not exist but are mere names that do not refer to anything real He may then begin to speculate that there is no existence beyond the aggregate of mental formations He may adopt any of seven wrongheaded theories concerning the cessation of individual existence after death  ten demonic states associated with mental formations He may speculate about where within the realm of desire the bodies of individual beings might perish or about where beyond the realm of desire the bodies of individual beings might perish or about where beyond the reach of suffering the bodies of individual beings might perish or about where within the bliss that is beyond joy the bodies of individual beings might perish or about where within the renunciation of cognition the bodies of individual beings might perish Cycling through these speculations he will fully investigate each of these seven locations and conclude that in each individual beings perish and that having perished they will not be reborn Because he has made these suppositions concerning the cessation of individual existence after death he will fall and take a wrong path He has become confused about the nature of full awakening This belief in wrongheaded theories concerning the cessation of individual existence after death within the realm of all five aggregates is the ninth of the wrong paths Further when in his practice of samādhi this good persons mind is firmly settled in his correct mental state no demon will have any chance to influence him He may in his contemplations observe a radiance that suffuses the heavens of the realm of desire Longing for this radiance he may specu The first two of these seven theories concern the perishing of beings in the human realm and in the six heavens of desire Or he may speculate it is in the heavens of the first dhyāna that he will be able to enter nirvana because in the first dhyāna beings have no anxiety Or he may speculate that it is in the heavens of the second dhyāna that he will be able to enter nirvana because in the second dhyāna beings do not suffer Or he may speculate that it is in the heavens of the third dhyāna that he will be able to enter nirvana because in the third dhyāna beings know the extremes of the bliss that is beyond joy Or he may speculate that it is within the heavens of the fourth dhyāna that he will be able to enter nirvana because in the fourth dhyāna both suffering and joy are transcended and as he supposes beings there are no longer bound to the cycle of death and rebirth He will make the mistake of supposing that these dhyāna heavens are unconditioned states although in fact the beings in them are still subject to outflows Since beings in these five locations are able to experience an inner serenity he will suppose that these are places where he will be able to abide in a supreme purity He has become confused about the nature of full awakening This belief in wrongheaded theories that in these five locations he could enter nirvana within the realm of the five aggregates is the tenth of these wrong paths While they are practicing meditation in stillness nanda these beings may adopt these ten wildly wrong interpretations of the dhyānas as a result of their interaction with the aggregate of mental formations They may become dulled and confused by this experience and they may no longer be able to take a proper measure of themselves When faced with these circumstances they may be even more confused and in their failure to know themselves they will make the claim that they have  ten demonic states associated with mental formations reached the level of a sage This egregious falsehood will cause them to fall into the Unrelenting Hell After my nirvana you must explain my teachings and transmit them to those who will live during the time of the Dharmas ending so that all beings everywhere will understand what I have taught Then they will not allow their own demonic views to lead them into egregious offenses Protect and support my Dharma so that wrong beliefs are dispelled Instruct practitioners so that they are thoroughly convinced of the true meaning of my teachings lest they stray from the supreme path and content themselves with insignificant attainments Become the pure ones who show others the Path   Ten Demonic States of Mind Associated with the Aggregate of Consciousness Anānda when a good person who has been practicing samādhi has reached the end of the aggregate of mental formations he may observe within the clear light in the deep recesses of his mind the vibrations which are the shared foundation of the nature of all beings in the world Then suddenly the tiny hidden knot that holds together the intricate net of karma of his individual being during his many lifetimes will burst open and he will lose his connection to the vibrating resonances of that karmic net He will now be on the verge of experiencing a great illumination in the sky of nirvana It is as if he is gazing at the pale light of dawn in the eastern sky just as the rooster has finished crowing He will attain a state of unified consciousness with the classes of beings but he does not comply when they call him to follow them into  ten demonic states associated with consciousness rebirth He has erased the distinctions among his six faculties and he has succeeded in enabling each of the six to perform the functions of all of the others For example his faculties of seeing and hearing will become connected to one another and will function both separately and together and with complete clarity The worlds throughout the ten directions and his own body and mind will be suffused with light like a crystal  fifty demonic states of mind  Further although this good person has completely eliminated the aggregate of mental formations  although he has already done away with the coming into being and perishing of mental formations  he has not yet completed the journey to the wonder of his essential nature which is nirvana In his understanding of the source of individual lives he will distinguish between the fine and the coarse and he will discern what is true and what is false based on the interplay of cause and effect He seeks an awakening in response to his efforts thereby turning his back on the path to the highest purity That is to say he perceives the unsatisfactoriness of life eliminates the accumulation of afflictions and realizes cessation as he practices in accord with the Path But once he comes to abide in cessation he stops there and goes no farther in his practice In this way he makes the mistake of becoming a Hearer of the Teaching who is restricted to a single lineage His companions will be ignorant members of the Sangha and supremely arrogant practitioners He is confused about the nature of the full awakening of the Buddhas and as a result the Buddhas right knowledge and correct views are no longer accessible to him This ninth theory is called perfecting the essence of the mind and so realizing the goal of cessation But instead of breaking through to enlightenment this person proceeds far in the opposite direction He turns his back on the city of nirvana and plants a seed that will result in his becoming restricted by emptiness  While the first eight of these theories have been associated with rebirths in an unenlightened state the ninth and tenth theories are associated with enlightenment as an Arhat  In these ways nanda these ten states are experienced while practicing meditation in stillness and they are caused by confusion that leads to derangement Because of their confusion these practitioners will believe that they have completely attained what they have not completely attained Each of these mental states is the result of the interaction of meditation practice and unwarranted speculation while within the realm of the aggregate of consciousness In these ten states of mind that appear during the practice of meditating in stillness the practitioner becomes confused and claims to have attained complete  That is the path of the Bodhisattvas Then they will not allow their own demonic views to lead them into egregious offenses Protect them give them comfort compassionately rescue them and free them of their perverse tendencies so that in mind and body they may enter the path to the wisdom and vision of the Buddhas Then from the beginning to the end of their journey they will not stray from the Path For as many past eons as there are sandgrains in the River Ganges ThusCome Ones as many as motes of dust have entered the gateway of  ten demonic states associated with consciousness this Dharma have opened their minds and have traveled along this supreme path Your mind will become like a resplendent moon enclosed within a pure crystal and then you will leap over all the stages of the Bodhisattvas Path  the Ten Stages of Stabilizing the Mind the Ten Abodes the Ten Practices the Ten Dedications the Four Additional Practices the vajralike Ten Grounds and Equivalent Enlightenment in which understanding is finally perfected You will enter into the wondrous and magnificent multitude of all the ThusCome Ones vast as the sea You will attain the perfection of full awakening in which there is nothing that is attained All the Buddhas WorldHonored Ones of the past while calmly abiding in samādhi and while practicing contemplative insight applied their contemplative insight to all these states In the time of the Dharmas ending some beings who like to practice samādhi may not have sufficient intelligence to practice meditation in stillness correctly or to explain the Dharma correctly You should be concerned lest they fall under the influence of the kind of wrong views that I  fifty demonic states of mind have been describing Devote yourselves to teaching these beings how to hold in their minds the dhāraṇīmantra spoken at the crown of the Buddhas head If they cannot learn to recite it from memory teach them to write it out and to place it in their meditation halls or else to wear it close to their bodies Then no demon will be able to disturb them You should hold in the greatest reverence all the teachings of the ThusCome Ones of the ten directions   The Five Aggregates Arise from Delusion Then nanda once again stood up amidst the great assembly and bowed reverently having fully retained in his memory the instructions he had heard the Buddha give He said respectfully to the Buddha The Buddha has said that the five categories of delusion which characterize the five aggregates are the basis of the deluded activity of the mind We have never before received from the ThusCome One such a detailed explanation Now when these five aggregates disappear do they do so all at once or do they disappear in sequence one after the other And if they do disappear in sequence what are the defining characteristics of each of the five aggregates I only hope that the ThusCome One out of his great kindness will explain this so that all of us in this great assembly can purify our minds and make our vision clear In this way we will be able to act as guides for beings in the future time of the Dharmas ending Dont get the wrong idea here When Ananda speaks out again in the assembly its certainly not the case that he is showing off Its not that he wants everyone to notice him The Buddha said to nanda In the subtle true wondrous understanding in the fundamental awakened perfect purity no death or rebirth remains nor any defilement not even space itself All these arise out of deluded mental activity From within the true essence which is the fundamental original awakened wondrous understanding delusion arises and brings about the world of perceived objects We might compare the situation to Yajñadattas confusion about the face he saw in the mirror His delusion did not arise from any cause Peoples deluded thinking leads them to conclude that what is subject to causes and conditions must have an independent existence The nature of space itself is that it too arises from illusion The notion that things come into being due to causes and conditions and the notion that they come into being on their own are mere speculations born of beings deluded minds nanda one who understands where delusion comes from will say that it comes about due to certain causes and conditions One who understands that there can be no place of origin for delusion will know that there is no place where causes and conditions can arise We hardly need to mention the people who know nothing of causes and conditions and who say that all phenomena come into being on their own Therefore based on what the ThusCome One has already shown you you should understand that the fundamental cause for the coming into being of the five aggregates is the deluded activity of the mind Your body came into being because of mental activity on the part of your parents but if there were no such activity in your mind as well you would not have been born It is through such mental activity that life is perpetuated I already mentioned to you that thinking about something sour can cause the mouth to water and that merely thinking about climbing up to the edge of a precipice can cause your feet to ache In fact there is no precipice under your feet nor is there anything sour in  See part  From this you should know that the body which you now have is an instance of the illusion of solid matter In this way even a senseperception caused by deluded mental activity can affect your physical body You now experience what is pleasing and beneficial and what is displeasing and harmful These two kinds of experience which affect you in rapid succession are an instance of the illusion of senseperception This is the second of the delusions of the mind In other words when the thought of a perceived object arises in the mind that thought evokes the bodys response which is to seek to obtain or to avoid that object This is true not only when you are awake and thinking but also when you are asleep and dreaming These are instances of the activity of cognition creating an illusory understanding This cooperative functioning of mind and body constitutes the third delusion of the mind Then there are the systematic changes in your body which never stop  such incessant and imperceptible changes as the lengthening of  That is the first aggregate that of form If these systematic changes are not part of you nanda then why does your body undergo them If in fact they are truly a part of you how is it that you are not aware of them The uninterrupted succession of thought after thought characterizes the aggregate of mental formations This subtle and hidden mental activity constitutes the fourth delusion of the mind Further if you were to attain a permanent state of refined mental clarity that is pure and unmoving you would no longer be able to experience seeing hearing tactile awareness and cognition If your mind were in fact to attain this refined level of reality it would no longer contain any traces of those habitual distorted mental activities How then is it that you may have entirely forgotten about some strange sight that you once saw years ago and yet the memory has not entirely disappeared because when you suddenly see something very like that same strange sight you recall perfectly the first time you saw it This place of refined clarity that you wrongly suppose to be pure and unmoving is in fact permeated with an endless succession of countless mental impressions Although you have temporarily forgotten about it the memory is stored in your eighth consciousness  You should know nanda that this subtle clarity is not the true mind It is rather like a rapidly flowing stream that seems at first glance to be calm and still Although you do not see it there is nevertheless a current Similarly if in your consciousness aggregate there were no source of deluded mental activity what else could be the repository of your deluded mental activities Until your six faculties merge and become interchangeable you will never be able to put an end to your deluded mental acts awareness In the same way these false mental impressions lying within what seems to be the clarity of the consciousness aggregate seem to exist and yet not to exist This extremely subtle and barely discernable activity constitutes the fifth kind of distortion of the mind The five aggregates nanda are simply the development of these five kinds of deluded mental activity Now you also wish to know what the defining attributes of each of the aggregates are and how coarse or refined they are Form and emptiness are the defining attributes of the aggregate of form Contact and separation are the defining attributes of the aggregate of senseperception Coming into being and perishing are the defining attributes of the aggregate of mental formations Entering into the state of deep clarity and being stored in that deep clarity are the defining attributes of the aggregate of consciousness These five aggregates arise in successive layers beginning with the coming into being of consciousness Their perishing begins with the ceasing to be of the aggregate of form You may suddenly reach an understanding of the principle of the aggregates and on that basis you may presume the aggregates will all vanish together But in fact they do not all vanish at once they must be ended in sequence I have already explained this to you with the example of untying my scarf What is it that you did not understand so that you ask me about it again You should thoroughly understand the source of deluded acts of mind and then you should transmit this teaching to future practitioners during the time of the Dharmas ending Lead them to recognize their delusion so that they come to abhor the fact that it arises within  fifty demonic states of mind themselves Let them know of nirvana so that they cease to long for further existence in the three realms   The Merit of Teaching the ūraṅgama Dharma Suppose nanda that someone gathered together as many of the seven precious things as would fill the realm of space to its farthest reaches in all ten directions Suppose that this person then offered all these precious things to as many Buddhas as there are motes of dust with his mind intent in every moment on reverently serving these Buddhas What do you think By making such an offering to the Buddhas would this person merit many blessings nanda replied The reaches of space are infinite and so these precious things would be beyond counting Yet someone once gave the Buddha a mere seven coins and as a result at the end of his life he was reborn and became a universal monarch How much greater must be the reward of blessings that would come to this other person who offers to the Buddhas as many of the seven precious things as would fill the Buddhas lands everywhere to the ends of space Even if one were to ponder this for countless eons one could not conceive of the extent of his reward The Buddha said to nanda The Buddhas the ThusCome Ones never speak falsely Imagine then the situation of some other person who has committed the four grave offenses and the ten offenses that merit expulsion He deserves to fall immediately into the Unrelenting Hell and then gradually to pass through the Unrelenting Hells of all the other worlds throughout the ten directions Now suppose this same person were to explain this Dharma even for just a moment to beings who in the time of the Dharmas ending had not learned about this teaching Then as a consequence of that one moment of explanation this persons offenses would vanish and the hells in which he had deserved to suffer would be transformed into lands of peace and delight By relying on this teaching that I have given you and by practicing just as I have instructed you you will go directly to full awakening without creating any more karma that would lead to entanglement in the demonic The Buddha had now finished speaking this Sutra Monks nuns preceptholding laymen and preceptholding laywomen as well as gods and asuras from all the worlds and also Bodhisattvas Arhats and Solitary Sages from other worlds together with sages ascetic masters pure young people and ghosts and spirits of great power who had made the initial resolve to attain full awakening  all who were there felt great joy Sūtra of the Garland of a Bodhisattvas Primary Karmas Translated from Sanskrit into Chinese in the Later Qin Dynasty by The ramaṇa Zhu Fonian from China Fascicle   Chapter  The Assembly Thus I have heard At one time the Buddha revisited the bodhimaṇḍa in the kingdom of Magadha where he had attained perfect enlightenment under the bodhi tree As he had done then He sat down there As He had emitted bright Buddha light then He emitted fortytwo beams of light As His adornment each beam was a garland of the radiance of His one million asakhyeya merits shining everywhere in the dharma realm as if through the open sky Delighting in the everabiding dharma nature with boundless spirit taking limitless great actions the Dharma King master of dharmas served as the parent of all sentient beings He sat on a lotusflowerborne lion throne naturally adorned with hundreds of thousands of jewels like the thrones on which all past Buddhas had sat His appearance as sublime as His virtue He achieved purity in body voice and mind and completed meritorious deeds His radiance penetrated the vajra store and endlessly illuminated the human world Unhindered by past present and future He transformed all delivering sentient beings equally His perfect enlightenment equaled that of all other Buddhas At that time the Bodhisattvas in this huge assembly were all  in the holy position of waiting to attain Buddhahood in their next life As their dharma bodies were boundless they demonstrated their transcendental powers everywhere  in the ten directions They guided and benefited sentient beings by opening the store of the Buddha Dharma and revealing to them their Buddha nature They instilled in them the essential teachings on nirvāṇa the wondrous fruit beyond causality and used their pastlife knowledge to transform them As their minds were boundless they understood everything internal and external from beginning to end Without differentiating between Buddha Lands with voices of great compassion they praised the unexcelled names of Buddhas With a full understanding of the six lifepaths taken by sentient beings wherever they taught they praised Buddhas remember our great aspirations and display to us fine and coarse Buddha Lands Wherever a Buddha visits He expounds the Dharma and transforms sentient beings To open our minds He uses His radiant spiritual power to reveal the garland of a Buddhas original karmas the ten levels of abiding the ten levels of action the ten levels of transference of merit the Ten Grounds the Stainless Ground and the Perfect Enlightenment Ground He teaches us how to end our delusion and doubts He reveals to us Buddha Lands Buddha bodies Buddha spirit Buddha power Buddha samādhi and His inconceivable manifestations Adorned with the three pure karmas  the Four Immeasurable Minds the Four Fearlessnesses the Eighteen Exclusive Dharmas and immeasurable merit He gives teachings on the unexcelled Dharma spreading it everywhere in all worlds in the ten directions An immeasurable distance east of here is a world called Fragrant Grove where its Buddha is called Beginning Progress and His foremost Bodhisattva is called Foremost Reverence An immeasurable distance south of here is a world called Joyful Grove where its Buddha is called Uninterrupted Joy and His foremost Bodhisattva is called Foremost Awareness An immeasurable distance west of here is a world

zenith is a world called Aspiration Grove where its Buddha is called Ultimate Progress and His foremost Bodhisattva is called Foremost Worthiness Thus the radiance of the Dharma pervades all worlds At that time ākyamuni Buddha praised the Bodhisattvas  in the ten directions The foremost Bodhisattva in each world together with innumerable great ones attended this huge assembly They bowed their heads down at the Buddhas feet and sat on lotus flower seats made with a thousand treasures Then the foremost Bodhisattva  called Foremost Reverence through the Buddhas spiritual power praised Him Come quickly to this assembly Observe that this Buddha Land where the Tathāgata resides is pure and that even His Dharma robe is pure His virtuous training for attaining the wondrous bodhi reveals the fortytwo doors of sages and holies  He expounds the Dharma in the sūtras and skillfully delivers countless people in worlds pure or impure He spreads the Dharma everywhere to transform all Moreover Buddhas  in other directions also expound the garland of a Buddhas original karmas The Dharma they expound is the same as the Dharma ākyamuni Buddha expounds Then Foremost Reverence Bodhisattva through the spiritual power of Buddhas  in the ten directions roared the lions roar and asked for the Vajra Garland Dharma Door in the great ocean of the immeasurable treasure store of all Buddhas and Bodhisattvas At that time ākyamuni Buddha under the bodhi tree observed the capacities and conditions of sentient beings  in the ten directions He emitted vast radiance illuminating this Buddha Land from the four heavens  down to this Dharma assembly attended by gods from the eighteen heavens  and the six heavens  including the four godkings of the first desire heaven Each small world has a Mount Sumeru orbited by the sun and the moon which shine on the four continents in the east is Pūrvavideha in the south is Jambudvīpa in the west is Aparagodānīya in the north is Uttarakuru Surrounding them are immense oceans and the iron mountain range and above them are twentyeight heavens All these constitute a small world which is surrounded by  koṭi small worlds in the ten directions the twentyeight heavens include the Four GodKings Heaven Trayastriśa Heaven Yāma Heaven Tuṣita Heaven Nirmāṇarati Heaven and Paranirmitavaśavartin Heaven  Brahma Multitude Heaven Brahma Minister Heaven Great Brahmā Heaven Limited Light Heaven Infinite Light Heaven Pure Radiance Heaven Limited Splendor Heaven Infinite Splendor Heaven Pervasive Splendor Heaven Cloudless Heaven Merit Arising Heaven Massive Fruition

and Neither with Nor without Perception Heaven  All these heavens have celestial ponds in which lotus flowers grow so they are called water heavens Sentient beings in the formless heavens are reborn there by miraculous formation From there down to the edge of the five wheels  which support a small world is called a Buddha Land also called a dharma realm of great endurance of suffering In each small world the Buddha expounds the garland of the primary karmas of sages and holies At that time to see the Buddha and the Bodhisattvas in this small world a huge multitude of gods congregated in the silent vajra bodhimaṇḍa under the bodhi tree Chapter  The Names of Sages and Holies At that time Foremost Reverence Bodhisattva through the Buddhas spiritual power supported by the multitudes who are like dragonkings and lionkings and by the godkings from the twentyeight heavens who have great capacities and take great actions asked the Buddha a small question Great Master how did You train on the holy path to become a Buddha Your body voice and mind are pure and indestructible like vajra free from fault Your Buddha nature is radiant and everabiding surpassing those of all Bodhisattvas You are born with an unsurpassed comely body perfect natural and pure You are revered by the godking akra and Brahma gods You remove darkness as does lamplight and illuminate heaven and earth as do the sun and the moon Like a ship captain you deliver gods and humans You have transcended the Three Realms of Existence and become the Honored Enlightened One What training should one undertake to complete this holy path What are the names of sages and holies  The Fortytwo Doors of Sages and Holies Then ākyamuni Buddha with His vajra voice told Foremost Reverence Bodhisattva BuddhaSon hearken hearken Ponder well my words and train in accordance with the Dharma I have already revealed to gods and humans the innumerable action vows of all Bodhisattvas As Buddhas of the past present and future in worlds in the ten directions openly pronounce the definitive meaning of the garland of a Buddhas original karmas so too I now pronounce this garland to this huge multitude of fourteen koṭi people You all should think of your high aspirations and your great lovingkindness and compassion for all sentient beings in worlds in the ten directions The Buddha said BuddhaSon to complete this path one should first rectify ones three karmas  study the teachings of the Three Jewels and believe in causality Finally having completed the path a Bodhisattva becomes a Buddha standing on  the Unsurpassed Ground  BuddhaSon these fortytwo doors encompass all virtuous training All Bodhisattvas enter these doors to become Buddhas All transcendental powers all causations and all spiritual attainments come through these doors BuddhaSon these doors pronounced by the lions roar of Buddhas  in the ten directions are the same neither more nor less You should vow to accept recite and explain their meanings and wish all sentient beings to follow my Dharma and become Buddhas as I have You should train in this way Cultivating the Ten Faithful Minds Then the Buddha told Foremost Reverence Bodhisattva BuddhaSon I now briefly explain a sages first training door called Abiding in Activation of Resolve Before reaching this level a Bodhisattva must cultivate the ten faithful minds  making pure vows After cultivating these ten minds for one two or three kalpas he can then enter the first level of abiding A Bodhisattva Sage at the First Level of Abiding At the first level of abiding he goes through the Illumination Door of One Hundred Dharmas which are the one hundred minds extended from the ten faithful minds because each of the ten has its own ten levels He also makes innumerable great action vows and great noaction vows He then becomes a Bodhisattva sage of the learning charactertype and widely carries out his vows Then the Buddha spoke in verse From this life until attainment of Buddhahood All vows are encompassed In my vows And I will fulfill them all Until I attain Buddhahood My vows are my roots As I give alms I wish all sentient beings To shed the mind of greed and to realize the emptiness of dharmas As I observe the precepts I wish all sentient beings To restrain their actions without fail and to achieve true liberation As I cultivate the six endurances I wish all sentient beings To acquire the mind of no dispute and to develop endurance of dharmas As I make energetic progress I wish all sentient beings To progress without pause and to achieve selfrealization As I practice meditation I wish all sentient beings To acquire the six transcendental powers and to attain peace beyond causality As I develop true wisdom I wish all sentient beings To enter the flow in the ocean of wisdom and to become Bodhisattvas As I carry out my appearancefree vows I wish all sentient beings To fulfill all their wishes and to flow into the ocean of Buddhas As I acquire skillful means from great wisdom I wish sentient beings To encounter no hindrance in the Dharma river and to realize the two truths As I acquire great spiritual power I wish all sentient beings To transform themselves and to acquire fearlessness As I acquire full wisdomknowledge I wish all sentient beings To gain vajra wisdom and to harvest the fruit in the bodhimaṇḍa As I ascend to the Stainless Ground I wish all sentient beings To sit under the bodhi tree and to teach and transform all others As I attain enlightenment I wish all sentient beings To understand the false continuation of dharmas and to end imagining their cessation As I illuminate and transform all I wish all sentient beings To realize that dharmas are formed through conditions and to end imagining their perpetuity As I fully understand the true reality of dharmas I wish all sentient beings To understand the relativity of dharmas and to end imagining that they have selves As I elicit my unconditional great compassion I wish all sentient beings To understand that dharmas arise through causes and conditions and to end accepting the wrong views As I attain nirvāṇa the foremost quietness I wish all sentient beings To realize that dharmas depend on conditions and to end accepting the evil precepts As I acquire the Ten Powers I wish all sentient beings To realize the two truths and to end their wrong views As I acquire the vajra power I wish all sentient beings To understand the Twelve Links of Dependent Arising and to end their doubts As I illuminate all dharmas everywhere I wish all sentient beings To recognize the impermanence of dharmas and to end the mind of stinginess As I acquire the five eyes and the Three Supreme Clarities I wish all sentient beings To develop the Three Clarities and to end the mind of delusion As I bring harmony to the world hindrance free I wish all sentient beings To uphold the Three Jewels and to end the mind of anger and dispute As I acquire radiant great wisdom I wish all sentient beings To realize the emptiness of dharmas and to destroy the store of ignorance As I acquire the thirtytwo physical marks I wish all sentient beings To acquire sublime appearances and to end their karmic requitals As I use my response bodies I wish all sentient beings To ride the great Dharma ship and to sail the ocean of the Buddha Dharma I have completely stated my vows on the cause ground and on the effect ground Which encompass all action vows These twentyfour vows encompass immeasurable actions I begin with faith and vows and will end with great wisdom Before all Buddhas I make these great vows Upon fulfillment of my vows I will further train in other actions After taking such meritorious actions for hundreds and thousands of kalpas I will then enter the inconceivable state and relinquish my vows Bodhisattvas who make these vows Will never fail to enter the ocean of sarvajña BuddhaSon a Bodhisattva sage at the first level of abiding who has made these great vows surpasses all ordinary beings cultivating the ten faithful minds Moreover He acquires immeasurable merit by practicing the ten pāramitās and the Three Samādhis emptiness no appearance and no action Having mastered observing the emptiness of everything he discards the view that a sentient being has an autonomous self as its master and discards other wrong views such as denying that ones true self is eternal blissful and pure He will break the bondage of the Three Realms of Existence as he gradually removes his ignorance  and subdues and ends his habitual karmas He will amass all good dharmas and practice  pāramitās His mind will retain all Dharma Doors and remember them thought after thought The Ten Major Precepts BuddhaSon there are ten major precepts and if violated none can be restored by repentance They are  no maligning the Three Jewels Violation of any of the ten major precepts is a parājika sin and the violated precept cannot be restored by repentance For ten kalpas every day the sinner will suffer  in  ways as he dies and revives  times Furthermore he will lose all his attainment at the first second third level of abiding up to the tenth ground Therefore one should not violate any of these precepts These ten precepts are the roots of all Buddha and Bodhisattva actions It is utterly wrong to say that Buddhas and Bodhisattvas can acquire their holy fruits without going through the Dharma Door of the ten precepts As the training of those at the next nine levels of abiding gradually expands so too does the training expand in inconceivable ways at the ten levels of action the ten levels of transference of merit the Ten Grounds and the Stainless Ground What I have briefly explained is like a drop of water in the ocean Chapter  Training of Sages and Holies At that time Foremost Reverence Bodhisattva asked the Buddha WorldHonored One how should a Bodhisattva learn the meanings of the names  and their mind training The Six CharacterTypes The Buddha answered BuddhaSon your question is the same as that asked of all Buddhas who sit in their bodhimaṇḍas in Buddha Lands in the ten directions Hearken hearken Ponder well the right observations and practice them in accordance with the Dharma BuddhaSon as all Buddhas expound the Three Samādhi Doors and the six radiant Bodhisattva charactertypes so too I expound them The six charactertypes are Bodhisattvas adorned with garlands of their merits each garland adorning a Bodhisattvas two kinds of dharma bodies A Bodhisattva wears the garland of his meritorious actions taken in a million asakhyeya kalpas It is utterly wrong to say that a Bodhisattva can progress to the next level without his garland of merits BuddhaSon the six charactertypes are the learning charactertype the nature charactertype the bodhi charactertype the holy charactertype the virtually perfect enlightenment nature and the perfect enlightenment nature They are also called the six firmnesses firmness in faith firmness in understanding of dharmas firmness in training firmness in virtue firmness in the highest understanding and firmness in enlightenment They are also called the six endurances endurance in faith endurance of dharmas endurance in training endurance in realization of the truth endurance in the stainless state and endurance in omniscience They are also called the six wisdoms wisdom from hearing  wisdom from pondering  wisdom from training  wisdom of the no appearance of dharmas wisdom of illuminating silence and wisdom of silent illumination They are also called the six samādhis samādhi of learning samādhi of nature samādhi of bodhi wisdom samādhi of differentiating wisdom samādhi of great wisdom and samādhi of highest wisdom They are also called the six observations observation of abiding in learning observation of actions observation of transference of merit observation of the Ten Grounds observation that dharmas have no appearance and observation with omniscience BuddhaSon all Buddhas and Bodhisattvas make these six illuminating observations in order to go through the definitive Dharma Door of true reality Names of Bodhisattvas Adorned with Garlands of Their Merits BuddhaSon you asked earlier about the names of Bodhisattvas BuddhaSon each garland of merits accumulated in one million asakhyeya kalpas adorns a Bodhisattvas two kinds of dharma bodies Bodhisattvas with these forty names are learners who enter the Dharma stream to steep themselves in its water BuddhaSon those adorned with a garland of extraordinary jewels are Bodhisattvas of virtually perfect enlightenment nature  Their name is Vajra Wisdom Banner Each of them abides in the Samādhi of Ultimate Silence Through the power of his great vows he lives for a hundred kalpas After attaining a thousand samādhis he enters the Vajra Samādhi and confirms the truth that the nature of all dharmas that appear upon convergences of causes and conditions is the same Then for one thousand kalpas he learns the deportment of a Buddha gazing about like an elephantking and walking like a lionking He acquires innumerable inconceivable spiritual powers as a means to guide and transform  Therefore the entire Buddha Dharma is present in his mind He enters the place walked by Buddhas sits in the bodhimaṇḍa of a Buddha and conquers the three māras Then after living for ten thousand kalpas he manifests as a Buddha and enters the great silent samādhi His enlightenment virtually equaling a Buddhas he transcends the distinction between the two truths existence and nonexistence mind and body and cause and effect He appears in the world as did ancient Buddhas manifests a body and mind assumes an appropriate name and teaches and transforms sentient beings Just as ancient Buddhas did he upholds the Middle Way In great bliss beyond causality he displays birth and death Though not actually a Buddha he displays a Buddhas spiritual power while abiding in his own state BuddhaSon those adorned with a garland of crystal jewels are of perfect enlightenment nature radiant and pure standing on the Omniscience Ground  Each of them  walks the Middle Way of all dharmas transcends the four māras and all appearances and is beyond existence and nonexistence His great enlightenment is the ultimate spiritual attainment His two everabiding bodies transform those with the right conditions BuddhaSon I have briefly pronounced the names of sages and holies You all should uphold these names and take actions to transform others Mind Training at the Ten Levels of Abiding BuddhaSon you asked earlier about ones mind training the mind abiding in  nectar poured on the head The corresponding mind training at each level is given below First he develops all roots of goodness and makes four vast vows to enable those who have not transcended suffering to transcend it enable those who have not understood that accumulation of afflictions is the cause of suffering to understand it enable those who have not set forth on the Eightfold Right Path to set forth on it and enable those who have not attained nirvāṇa to attain it Second he takes immeasurable good actions as he practices the Four Abidings of Mindfulness observing the emptiness of ones body sensory experiences afflictions and mental objects Then he shatters the four inverted views taking dharmas as having selves the illusion of and the false names of all dharmas such as the five aggregatesform sensory reception perception mental processing and consciousnessand the six domains  all dharmas are like the open sky with no distinction between self and others Third he learns the Buddha Dharma and observes that the ten thingsthe six domains and the four colors are in the appearance of true suchness Fourth he accepts the Dharma before all Buddhas and makes excellent observations Internally he observes his five aggregates in two ways extensive and simple externally he observes sentient beings in two ways extensive and simple also he observes the four domains in two ways extensive and simple Thus he observes that all dharmas are empty and  have no appearance Fifth he does pure dharmas and the eight practices remembered by the great ones  refrain from dispute In this way he accommodates all dharmas Sixth under the protection of all Buddhas he achieves the eight liberations  With wisdom developed from hearing  he achieves the first liberation by observing that internal and external appearances are false and cannot be captured With wisdom developed from pondering  he achieves the second liberation by observing that the five aggregates and all external dharmas cannot be captured With wisdom developed from training  he achieves the third liberation by observing that the five aggregates and the six sense objects in the form realm are empty As he successively attains the four formless samādhis then attains the Samādhi of Total Suspension of Sensory Reception and Perception he achieves the next five liberations by observing that the five aggregates  cannot be captured because all liberations are in the appearance of true suchness Seventh to spread the true Dharma he acquires the six elements of harmony and respect achieving accord with others in body karmas voice karmas mind karmas precepts almsgiving and views Upon realizing the ultimate emptiness of everything he abides in the state of no regress Eighth he believes and delights in the great dharma of three emptinesses  as both causes and effects are empty emptiness is also empty because all dharmas are like the open sky All four truths come under the one appearance  Then thought after thought he enters the Illusion Samādhi because he practices what he has learned BuddhaSon when I was in Trayastriśa Heaven  I pronounced to gods this training of sages at the ten levels of abiding All Bodhisattvas must enter this door to reach the ocean of sarvajña Mind Training at the Ten Levels of Action BuddhaSon a Bodhisattva sage at each of the ten levels of action cultivates the corresponding action mind true reality action mind The corresponding mind training at each level is given below In this way a Bodhisattva seeks to attain Buddha bodhi He has command of dharmas because his wisdom reveals that they have no birth Third to acquire fearlessness he cultivates the Five Roots wisdom Fourth to uphold the Three Jewels he ponders  the five aspects of the dharma body the knowledge and views of liberation enable one to see that all sentient beings have no bondage and that all dharmas are no different from the open sky Fifth to transform all sentient beings he follows the Eightfold Right Path and learns that  realizing the emptiness of dharma nature is called right samādhi and right wisdom Then he realizes that everything that arises upon convergence of causes and conditions has no birth equability This door leads him to realize the one appearance of dharmas Seventh to acquire the Four Kinds of Unimpeded WisdomKnowledge he cultivates the five roots of goodness and does the Four Preparatory Trainings Eighth to enter all Buddha Lands to transform sentient beings he acquires the four transforming abilities to reveal the true reality of dharmas to explain their meanings to use all forms of expression and to teach eloquently These abilities arise from wisdom and reveal that all dharmas in the highest truth have no birth Ninth to illuminate all dharmas in one thought he achieves understanding of the Twelve Links of Dependent Arising which link ones past present and future lives The two links ignorance and karmic actions in ones past life lead to ones present consciousness name and form six faculties contact with sense objects sensory reception love grasping and karmic force for being Each link is a false convergence of causes and conditions and its true nature cannot be captured Tenth to turn the great Dharma wheel with ease he acquires the three Bodhisattva jewels understanding the highest meaning of the Middle Way is called the enlightenment jewel understanding that all dharmas have no birth is called the dharma jewel repeatedly taking the six lifepaths together with sentient beings is called the Saṅgha jewel Using these jewels he drives all sentient beings into the Buddha ocean BuddhaSon when I was in Yāma Heaven  I pronounced to gods this training of sages at the ten levels of action I now have briefly explained to this multitude its essentials as pronounced by all Buddhas You all should accept and uphold them Mind Training at the Ten Levels of Transference of Merit BuddhaSon a Bodhisattva sage at each of the ten levels of transference of merit cultivates the corresponding transference mind the mind that transfers his merit to his entering the dharma realm The corresponding mind training at each level is given below First to learn the highest truth he upholds the two truths He observes that all dharma appearances are true suchness which cannot be captured lovingkindness compassion sympathetic joy and equability He shaves his head and dons the robe of the Three Jewels A Bodhisattva who has renounced family life is no different from the Three Jewels because he is foremost in purity Second to acquire the highest wisdomknowledge he masters the five transcendental powers of a god each a different usage of ones wisdom With the godeye he sees all dharmas including even tiny things in the past present and future With the godear he hears sounds in the ten directions With a gods telepathic wisdomknowledge he knows others minds With a gods pastlife wisdomknowledge he knows the past lives of himself and others on the six lifepaths With the wisdomknowledge of no birth he sees all dharmas Third to achieve utmost purity with the wisdomknowledge that all dharmas have no birth he holds indestructible pure faith in the Buddha the Dharma the Saṅgha and the precepts Fourth to acquire the power of a Buddha he penetrates the three appearances Dharmas that disappear are given the false name death Thus all dharmas are the same in their emptiness and in worldly truth are called empty appearances Emptiness is the one truth Fifth to gauge sentient beings capacities he observes the five aggregates that constitute a sentient being As a mind is an array of thoughts changing from moment to moment its appearance is empty Mental functions such as sensory reception perception mental processing and consciousness though neither assembled nor disassembled are processes in the one appearance of no appearance They are the six faculties and the six sense objects There is no observer inside or outside each of them or inbetween because each dharma has no self hence no others Seventh to acquire the hindrancefree wisdomknowledge he observes the eighteen spheres of a sentient being They are the six faculties the six sense objects and the six consciousnesses Each of them as all dharmas do arises upon convergence of causes and conditions Eighth to follow his innate wisdom he observes cause and effect Good and evil are called causes pleasure and pain are called effects A cause is the reason and its effect is the result Both cause and effect with neither birth nor death are empty Each arises upon convergence of causes and conditions Ninth to uphold the Buddha the Dharma and the Saṅgha he delves into the emptiness of duality Because causes and conditions converge something is said to exist Because causes and conditions diverge something is said not to exist Therefore both existence and nonexistence are empty Through prajñā  he is liberated from all dual appearances Tenth to transform all sentient beings through his innate wisdom with prajñā he observes that all dharmas are free from duality in accord with the highest truth in the Middle Way However his observations are called the likeness of the observations of the highest truth not the real observations of the highest truth in the Middle Way Nevertheless the wisdom developed from his observations enables him to ascend to a holy ground the first of the Ten Grounds in the Dharma stream He walks the Middle Way free from perception  of dual appearances BuddhaSon when I was in Tuṣita Heaven  I expounded this training of sages at the ten levels of transference of merit You all should accept them and train accordingly BuddhaSon the thirty minds  merge into ones faith in the One Vehicle However the cause for one to ride the One Vehicle is not achieved quickly To bring it about one must persistently subdue ones afflictions with a great mind for three asakhyeya kalpas Those Who Are Subject to Regress BuddhaSon in regard to a Bodhisattvas progress or regress both ordinary beings below the ten levels of abiding who activate the bodhi mind and sentient beings as numerous as the sands of the Ganges who learn to practice the Buddha Dharma with faith have roots of goodness subject to regress These good people must cultivate the ten faithful minds for one two or even ten kalpas before entering the first of the ten levels of abiding From the first to the sixth level of abiding they practice the six pāramitās At the sixth level of abiding as they practice prajñāpāramitā they will be enabled to make the right observations and will be protected by Buddhas holy Bodhisattvas and beneficent learned friends Then they will enter the seventh level of abiding whence they will never regress  BuddhaSon those at the sixth level of abiding practice prajñāpāramitā When they realize that a dharma is empty and that neither a dharma nor a person has a self as master they will definitely enter the seventh level However BuddhaSon if they fail to encounter beneficent learned friends for one two or even ten kalpas their bodhi mind will regress For example in my first assembly  among the multitude regressed For example the godson Pure Eye the king Dharma Wealth and āriputra wished to enter the seventh level of abiding However they encountered evil causes and conditions and regressed to the level of ordinary beings who though neither good nor evil are not called the learning charactertype If they had become nonBuddhists for one two ten or even one thousand kalpas they might have even held enormously evil views and done evil including the five rebellious acts Such things are called the sign of regress the positionaccepting mind The corresponding mind training on each ground is given below First on the Joyful Ground he abides in the highest truth in the Middle Way cultivates twenty joyful minds and makes ten endless vows He manifests a hundred bodies to teach sentient beings in Buddha Lands in the ten directions displays the five transcendental powers enters the Illusion Samādhi manifests as a Buddha and accumulates immeasurable merit Moreover he no longer receives karmic requitals as he did while an ordinary being in the Three Realms of Existence Knowing his Buddha mind he rides the One Vehicle to expound the Four Noble Truths suffering accumulation of afflictions cessation of suffering and the path His two kinds of dharma bodies undergo changeable birth and death He cultivates his mind by making the three right observations He enters the Illumination Door of One Hundred Dharmas which refer to the ten faithful minds each with ten levels totaling one hundred Through this Dharma Door he frees himself from the thirteen afflictions His mind in nirvāṇa naturally flows along the Dharma stream into the ocean of sarvajña  Second on the TaintFree Ground he acquires Dharma treasures in the ocean of the vajra store by doing the ten good karmas and teaching others to do them He praises the ten good karmas and their doers and manifests a thousand bodies to teach sentient beings in Buddha Lands in the ten directions because he is accomplished in observing that all dharmas have no appearance Third on the Radiant Ground he enters the Illusion Samādhi after doing twelve meditations  In the first dhyāna he experiences joy caused by five aspects of his mind with its sixth aspect the quiet mind as the core of meditation In the second dhyāna he experiences bliss caused by four aspects of his mind with its fifth aspect the quiet mind as the core of meditation In the third dhyāna he experiences subtle joy caused by five aspects of his mind with its sixth aspect the quiet mind as the core of meditation In the fourth dhyāna with neither pleasure nor pain he experiences peace caused by four aspects of his mind with its fifth aspect the quiet mind as the core of meditation Dhyāna is meditative concentration with many facets and samādhi is meditative absorption that does not scatter for kalpas Each of the four samādhis of the formless realm is caused by five aspects of his mind with its sixth aspect the quiet mind as the core of meditation From these samādhis arise the Four Immeasurable Minds  called the four immeasurable samādhis He then with ease enters countless samādhis This holy Bodhisattva manifests as an ordinary being and teaches and transforms sentient beings in  Buddha Lands Fourth on the Flaming Wisdom Ground he acquires the entire store of Dharma treasures by completing the Thirtyseven Elements of Bodhi This holy Bodhisattva of great action manifests a koṭi bodies to transform all sentient beings Fifth on the HardtoConquer Ground he acquires wisdomknowledge of the dharma realm by realizing sixteen truths existence nonexistence the highest truth in the Middle Way suffering accumulation of afflictions cessation of suffering the path appearances differentiations  makeup expounding the Dharma  events birth ending afflictions and karmic rebirths entering the path and acquiring the wisdomknowledge of Tathāgatas He even accomplishes in one thought the five studies on all dharmas Transformed by the Buddha Dharma he manifests innumerable bodies in all Buddha Lands Sixth on the Revealing Ground his wisdomknowledge arises from his understanding of conditions By observing the Twelve Links of Dependent Arising he understands that they arise from ten key factors bondage Having observed the twelve conditions in the conforming way  and the nonconforming way  he manifests innumerable bodies in all Buddha Lands to transform all sentient beings Seventh on the FarGoing Ground he acquires the hindrancefree wisdomknowledge that ends all his karmic requitals Using the wisdomknowledge of the three emptinesses he observes his two kinds of habits in the Three Realms of Existence and completely ends the requitals for his body and mind karmas He completes all meritorious deeds that require effort and acquires all the merits needed to ascend to higher grounds His mind in nirvāṇa with no action and beyond causality naturally flows along the Dharma stream into the ocean of sarvajña Eighth on the Motionless Ground he makes inconceivable observations without effort Armed with skillful means and the great wisdom that dharmas have no appearance he ends his physical habits and his ignorance  In one thought without effort he does a million kalpas work in countless Buddha Lands In one thought without effort he manifests as a Buddha and as sentient beings Ninth on the Good Wisdom Ground he acquires the ultimate wisdomknowledge of dharmas He has command of forty eloquences and has completed all meritorious actions His mental habits and his ignorance  have been removed In one thought he opens the store of the entire Buddha Dharma and the store of all spiritual powers In countless ThreeThousand Large Thousandfold Worlds he manifests as a Buddha and sentient beings in order to teach and transform innumerable sentient beings Having ended his two kinds of habits caused by his ignorance  he receives the great position to become a Buddha His spiritual power being immeasurable and indescribable he effortlessly manifests as a Buddha BuddhaSon all sages must enter this door  to train for enlightenment BuddhaSon I initially expounded in Parinirmitavaśavartin Heaven  the Ten Grounds to guide and transform gods I now have briefly explained this door for all of you to accept and practice Mind Training on the Eleventh Ground BuddhaSon the mind of a Bodhisattva at the fortyfirst level is called the mind entering the dharma realm On the Stainless Ground he goes from the Valiant Subjugation Samādhi into the Dharma Radiance Samādhi In this samādhi he practices ten dharmas ascending to the mountaintop the highest truth in the Middle Way Therefore it takes countless kalpas for a Bodhisattva to progress from abiding in activation of his resolve to becoming a stainless Bodhisattva on this ground during which time he cultivates the forty minds through Dharma Doors of immeasurable merit Starting with the Joyful Ground he takes  kalpas to fully reveal his two kinds of dharma bodies and to accumulate immeasurable merit Always taking Buddha actions he then enters the AppearanceEnding Samādhi and readies himself to possess  the knowledge of all knowledge BuddhaSon when I was in the third dhyāna heaven  I spoke a million koṭi stanzas to  gods explaining how a holy Bodhisattva waiting to demonstrate attainment of Buddhahood in his next life enters the Samādhi of Buddha Adornment I now have briefly explained the meaning of but one stanza to open sentient beings minds You all should accept and uphold it His knowledge of all knowledge illuminates the truth that dharmas have no birth and illuminates their  beginnings and endings Only a Buddha fully knows sentient beings roots  and the eventual ending  and He clearly sees all their afflictions and karmic requitals With His one mind illuminating the ultimate truth He knows not only all Buddha Lands but all Buddhas and all Bodhisattvas and their manifestations He alone abides in the inconceivable state outside the two truths BuddhaSon when I first expounded under this tree the oceanlike dharma realm  stainless Bodhisattvas  demonstrated attainment of Buddhahood I now have briefly explained to this huge multitude the way to achieve the Buddha fruit You all should accept it with the highest esteem SupraWorldly Requitals to Holy Bodhisattvas At that time Foremost Reverence Bodhisattva asked the Buddha WorldHonored One progressing from the first ground to the last ground a holy Bodhisattva because of his good requitals and spiritual powers reveals his two kinds of dharma bodies the dharmanature body and the response and manifested bodies What are their physical and mental features The Buddha answered BuddhaSon the supraworldly requital to a holy Bodhisattva progressing from the first ground to the Buddha Ground is revealment of his two kinds of dharma bodies The true wisdom arising from his realization of the highest truth of dharma nature is called the dharma body the essence of dharmas as a response to his roots of goodness The dharma body can manifest innumerable inconceivable response bodies as sentient beings Bodhisattvas and Buddhas and even as Buddha Lands BuddhaSon a land is where all sentient beings sages and holies live Each of them lives in a land as requital for his karma An ordinary being lives in his body composed of the five aggregates as his main requital land The mountains the forests and the great earth shared by many are their reliance requital land A holy Bodhisattva progressing from the first ground  to the eleventh ground  has two kinds of lands the land of true wisdom and the manifested lands pure or impure which are manifested throughout kalpas The lands where sentient beings live or where holies on the eleven grounds live are their requital lands not a pure land Only Buddhas reside in the foremost land of dharma nature in the Middle Way Therefore in the past in the universal radiance palace hall I widely expounded to all sentient beings the Dharma Door of the Pure Land BuddhaSon a holy Bodhisattva on the first ground with the dharma body of true wisdom which has no appearance in one thought accumulates a million asakhyeya merits His mind in nirvāṇa illuminates the two truths in the Dharma stream While a Bodhisattva on the first ground manifests    or even innumerable response bodies the dharma body or his mind in nirvāṇa sees no Buddha Dharma or good requitals to seek no ignorance or wrong views to end and no sentient beings to deliver Only in response to relative truth does he see Buddhahood to seek wrong views to end and sentient beings to deliver BuddhaSon as a Bodhisattva sage in any of the three groups of sages  trains to become a holy Bodhisattva  his mind in nirvāṇa naturally flows along the Dharma stream into the ocean of perfect enlightenment BuddhaSon the names of the three groups of sages and the names of the holies on the Ten Grounds are false names and have no appearance To deliver sentient beings according to their needs these names were made up in the Dharma of ancient Buddhas BuddhaSon you should accept and uphold the Dharma of all Buddhas equally He becomes a WheelTurning King equipped with a copper wheel and attended by a hundred worthy sons as his retinue He is reborn in one Buddha Land to uphold the Buddha Dharma and to teach sentient beings on two  continents He becomes a WheelTurning King equipped with a silver wheel and attended by five hundred worthy sons as his retinue He is reborn in two Buddha Lands to uphold the Buddha Dharma and to teach sentient beings on three continents in each land He becomes a WheelTurning King equipped with a gold wheel and attended by a thousand worthy sons as his retinue He visits Buddha Lands in the ten directions to teach all sentient beings on all four continents in each land He becomes one of the four godkings of the first desire heaven equipped with a wheel made of seven treasures and attended by  godsons as his retinue He manifests  bodies to deliver all sentient beings on the four continents in each of  Buddha Lands in the ten directions He becomes the godking of Trayastriśa Heaven  equipped with a wheel made of eight treasures and attended by  godsons as his retinue He becomes the godking of Yāma Heaven  equipped with a wheel made of nine treasures and attended by a countless retinue He becomes the godking of Tuṣita Heaven  equipped with a wheel made of ten treasures and attended by a countless retinue He becomes the godking of Nirmāṇarati Heaven  equipped with a wheel made of eleven treasures and attended by a countless retinue He becomes  Parinirmitavaśavartin Heaven  equipped with a wheel made of twelve treasures and attended by a countless retinue He becomes the Brahmaking of the first dhyāna heaven equipped with a wheel made of thirteen treasures and attended by a countless retinue He becomes the godking of Pure Radiance Heaven  equipped with a wheel made of great wishfulfilling treasures and attended by a countless retinue He becomes the godking of Pervasive Splendor Heaven  equipped with a wheel of white cloud treasures and attended by a countless retinue He becomes the godking of a pure abode heaven  equipped with a wheel of the jewel light of fearlessness and attended by a countless retinue A Bodhisattva on the eleventh ground is adorned with a garland of jewel light in ten million celestial colors He becomes the king of the Three Realms of Existence equipped with a wheel made of the jewel light of enlightenment His retinue comprises all Bodhisattvas He is the king of the dharma realm equipped with a wheel of thousands of merits His retinue comprises holy Bodhisattvas  waiting to demonstrate attainment of Buddhahood in their next life BuddhaSon the garlands and wheels just mentioned are the names of  requitals to all Bodhisattvas and Buddhas who constantly carry them as they deliver sentient beings Subduing Afflictions Evil Karmas and Resulting Requitals BuddhaSon a Bodhisattva sage in any of the three groups  subdues his afflictions coarse karmas and coarse requitals all of which drive his continued rebirth in the Three Realms of Existence Although habits have been removed their effects do not vanish When he achieves endurance in enlightenment he immediately ends his root ignorance of the dharma realm with none of it left Rebirth of an Ordinary Being BuddhaSon ignorance means lack of understanding that all dharmas are the one dharma realm Captivated by the dharma realm one does karmas and receives corresponding requitals in the Three Realms of Existence Therefore I say that from the store of ignorance arise the thirteen afflictions which include the seven  views and the six entrapping afflictions The seven views are  the view that one should raise doubts One sees everything through these seven views From these views arise the six entrapping afflictions greed anger delusion love desire and arrogance They are present and active all the time in the dharma realm  BuddhaSon these thirteen afflictions are the roots of all afflictions and ignorance is their root They bring different requitals in the Three Realms of Existence BuddhaSon driven by  views and entrapping afflictions one who is captivated by things to do with ones body and desires is reborn in the desire realm as requital one who is captivated by things to do with ones body and mind is reborn in the form realm as requital one who is captivated by meditative absorption is reborn in the formless realm as requital BuddhaSon though in the one dharma realm sentient beings receive requitals in the Three Realms of Existence Whether ordinary beings holy beings ones views or ones entrapping afflictions all saskṛta dharmas are inside the dharma realm Only a Buddha is outside the dharma realm However for the sake of ignorant sentient beings He returns to the dharma realm and indicates the countless differences in the requitals for their good and evil karmas They stop doing karmas that are bound to the Three Realms of Existence but do not stop using love to bring about their rebirths Bodhisattvas on the eleven grounds also eliminate their karmic requitals in the Three Realms of Existence Those on the first seven grounds have completely obliterated their karmas and corresponding requitals in the Three Realms of Existence Those on the eighth ground have completely ended such karmas and requitals Those on the eighth or higher grounds can display attainment of Buddhahood from birth in a royal palace to renouncing family life to attaining bodhi to turning the Dharma wheel and to entering parinirvāṇa They can also manifest all Buddha Lands They receive no karmic requitals in the Three Realms of Existence because they no longer have karmic seeds or love  though their habitual ignorance still remains Through the power of their great vows they are reborn through miraculous formation Therefore in the past I explained to gods the meanings of birth no birth karmic rebirth and rebirth by miraculous formation BuddhaSon a holy Bodhisattva does two kinds of karmas wisdom karmas and merit karmas Wisdom karmas mean the wisdomknowledge that dharmas have no birth and no appearance They are called wisdom karmas because his mind shines without subject and object in accord with dharma nature Merit karmas mean that he with knowledge arising from true wisdom accumulates a million asakhyeya merits free from afflictions Through the power of his vows he lives for billions of kalpas At that time the Buddha told Foremost Reverence Bodhisattva You asked earlier about the meanings of the ten levels of abiding the ten levels of action the ten levels of transference of merit the Ten Grounds the Stainless Ground and the Perfect Enlightenment Ground  I now explain their meanings BuddhaSon the Sūtra of the Garland in the Ocean of the Vajra Store explains the features of these sages and holies Features are based on the subject and Bodhisattvas are the subject Their features are described by their merits Before Entering the First Level of Abiding BuddhaSon before entering the first of the ten levels of abiding  one is an ordinary being who does not know any holy being who upholds the Three Jewels One has neither knowledge nor understanding of good and evil causes or their corresponding effects However one is fortunate enough to encounter a Buddha or a Bodhisattva has even one thought of belief in his teachings and then activates the bodhi mind Such a one before entering the first level of abiding is called a faithasappearance Bodhisattva also called a Bodhisattva in name or in false name To some degree he cultivates the ten faithful minds He cultivates another ten minds based on the ten good karmas the five precepts the eight precepts the ten precepts and the six pāramitās As he does the ten good karmas if he cultivates the ten faithful minds for one two or three kalpas he will be reborn in one of the six desire heavens as requital Though laden with all the afflictions he can be reborn as an iron wheel king  as a highgrade requital reborn as one of the lesser kings as a middlegrade requital or reborn as a ruler of men as a lowgrade requital Even if he does innumerable good karmas he is subject to regress Nevertheless if he encounters a beneficent learned friend from whom he learns the Buddha Dharma after one or two kalpas he will enter the first level of abiding If not his roots of goodness are subject to regress The Meanings of the Ten Levels of Abiding BuddhaSon the first level of abiding is called Abiding in Activation of Resolve because a Bodhisattva sage at this level progresses with his growing roots of goodness If for one or two kalpas under one two or three Buddhas he cultivates the ten faithful minds believes in the Three Jewels practices  pāramitās and goes through all Dharma Doors if he holds his faith neither embracing the eight inverted views or other wrong views nor committing any of the ten grave sins or the five rebellious sins and if he is not reborn in difficult places but always encounters the Buddha Dharma develops wisdom from hearing the Dharma and seeks skillful means then for the first time he enters and abides in the realm of emptiness Understanding that a sentient being is empty he learns the Dharma of ancient Buddhas Although merit arises from his mind ground without fabrication this level is called abiding not ground The second level of abiding is called Development of the Ground because he cultivates a pure mind of emptiness through  Dharma Doors The third level of abiding is called Abiding in Training because he does all training The fourth level of abiding is called Abiding in High Birth because he is born into the Buddha family and becomes the pure charactertype The fifth level of abiding is called Abiding in Skillful Means because he skillfully develops innumerable roots of goodness The sixth level of abiding is called Abiding in the True Mind because he achieves the sixth pāramitā emptiness no appearance and no wish The eighth level of abiding is called Abiding in Truthfulness of Youth because starting with the first level he neither embraces the inverted views nor harbors evils which can destroy the bodhi mind The ninth level of abiding is called Abiding in Dharma Princeship because he understands the Buddha Dharma and will become a Buddha  The tenth level of abiding is called Abiding in  Nectar Poured on the Head because having observed at the preceding nine levels the emptiness of dharmas he achieves the unsurpassed understanding that dharmas have no birth He also practices  pāramitās Therefore he is called a Buddhason of the ten levels of action The first level of action is called Joyful Action because he realizes that dharmas are empty a realization indestructible by the wrong doctrines of nonBuddhists The second level of action is called Beneficial Action because he benefits sentient beings by teaching them the everabiding Dharma The third level of action is called AngerFree Action because he achieves endurance of dharmas for he understands that one has no self with its belongings The fourth level of action is called Endless Action because he endlessly transforms sentient beings and accumulates merit The fifth level of action is called DelusionFree Action because he never loses right mindfulness even upon dying as his consciousness fades away The sixth level of action is called WellDisplayed Action because he is reborn in Buddha Lands life after life The seventh level of action is called Unfettered Action because he knows that not only self and no self are empty but also all dharmas are empty The eighth level of action is called Respectful Action because he respects and follows the Buddha Dharma of the past present and future The ninth level of action is called Good Dharma Action because he expounds the Dharma teaching others to do good dharmas by its guidance The tenth level action is called True Reality Action because he understands that the two truths  do not accord with true suchness which is beyond appearance and no appearance He observes the one appearance of all dharmas that arise upon convergences of causes and conditions As he practices a billion koṭi pāramitās one after another he observes the emptiness of dharmas with his mind in nirvāṇa As a cause leads to its effect likewise his illuminating observations at the ten levels of transference of merit lead to his illuminating observations on the holy grounds At the ten levels of transference of merit eliciting the Four Immeasurable Minds he neither abandons sentient beings nor is attached to them The first level of transference of merit is called Transference of Ones Merit to Ones Saving All Sentient Beings without Being Attached to Their Appearances because he takes the six lifepaths but is not captivated by his experiences which are constantly changing The second level of transference of merit is called Transference of Ones Merit to Ones Indestructible Mind because he observes that all dharmas are but ones perceptions of their uses and their names moving thought after thought The third level of transference of merit is called Transference of Ones Merit to Ones Becoming an Equal of All Buddhas because he observes that the Dharma of all Buddhas prevails simultaneously in the past present and future The fourth level of transference of merit is called Transference of Ones Merit to Ones Arriving Everywhere because through the power of his great vows he enters all Buddha Lands to make offerings to all Buddhas The fifth level of transference of merit is called Transference of Ones Merit to Ones Endless Store of Merits because he gives others the everabiding Three Jewels The sixth level of transference of merit is called Transference of Ones Merit to Ones Confirming the Equality of All Roots of Goodness because he does good deeds whether or not free from his afflictions The seventh level of transference of merit is called Transference of Ones Merit to Ones Regarding All Sentient Beings Equally because he sees the equality of good and evil and of father and mother each being a convergence of causes and conditions The eighth level of transference of merit is called Transference of Ones Merit to Ones Realizing True Suchness because he sees that the existence or nonexistence of all dharmas is but a convergence  of causes and conditions The ninth transference of merit is called Transference of Ones Merit to Ones Liberation from Bondage because he sees that based on the equality of the two truths all dharmasas convergences of causes and conditions in the past present and futureare equal in their no birth The tenth transference of merit is called Transference of Ones Merit to Ones Entering the Dharma Realm because he realizes that all dharmas have the one appearance of no appearance in the highest truth of the Middle Way BuddhaSon the meaning of a Bodhisattva sages mind at these thirty levels is immeasurable and boundless inconceivable to ordinary beings It is the road taken by all Buddhas and Bodhisattvas in worlds in the ten directions The Meanings of the Twelve Grounds BuddhaSon you asked earlier about the meaning of ground Like the ground the mind can hold a million asakhyeya merits Like the ground the mind can produce all causes and effects BuddhaSon a Bodhisattva sage having completed the tenth level of transference of merit sheds the ways of an ordinary being and is born into the Buddha family joining the holy multitude as a holy Bodhisattva indestructible by the four māras He then observes the no birth of dharmas in the highest truth in the Middle Way as he progresses from the first ground to the second ground to the third ground and even to the eleventh ground The first ground is called the Joyful Ground because with his mind in nirvāṇa he observes Dharma Doors in the Dharma stream He joyfully sees all dharmas in the one appearance of no appearance and sees his two kinds of dharma bodies as boundless no different from Buddha Lands The second ground is called the TaintFree Ground because he observes the emptiness of sentient beings without being attached to their appearances manifests a thousand Buddha Lands and demonstrates the six transcendental powers as if free from causality The third ground is called the Radiant Ground because he walks the path of ancient Buddhas and studies sūtras in the twelve categories as a radiant means to deliver sentient beings He observes the merits adorning Buddhas above and observes sentient beings below on the six lifepaths he gives them happiness with great lovingkindness by teaching them the Dharma relieves their suffering with great compassion celebrates their happiness with great sympathetic joy and regards them with great equability  The fifth ground is called the HardtoConquer Ground because with endurance in accord with the Dharma he subdues his afflictions as he sees that his ignorance and doubts in the Three Realms of Existence are empty He conquers worldly knowledge by acquiring the eight eloquences to discuss cause versus effect and Buddhist versus nonBuddhist ways and by mastering the five studies which include outer knowledge inner knowledge medical arts logic and incantations The sixth ground is called the Revealing Ground because with high endurance in accord with the Dharma he observes that all dharmas of the past present and future are convergences of causes and conditions The seventh ground is called the FarGoing Ground because he achieves low endurance in his realization of the no birth of dharmas as he observes that his afflictions which disappear as soon as they appear neither exist nor not exist and that his present body is his last in the Three Realms of Existence With each thought in nirvāṇa he accumulates the immeasurable merit needed to ascend to higher grounds With the wisdomknowledge that dharmas have no appearance he observes dharmas that go from existence into nonexistence as a manifestation of impermanence He sees Buddhas rub the crown of his head and give him teachings and expects to harvest the holy fruit as he does inconceivable training of his body and mind The ninth ground is called the Good Wisdom Ground because with wonderful radiance he achieves high endurance in his realization of the no birth of dharmas and manifests as Buddhas He walks the place walked by Buddhas sits on a lotusflower seat made of a thousand treasures and receives from Buddhas the prophecy of his attaining Buddhahood He learns from Buddhas how to deliver sentient beings ends his two kinds of habits and brings his great faith into full strength He realizes that all in the dharma realm are equal in true suchness and that the two truths have the one appearance With full knowledge of sentient beings capacities adorned with a garland of immeasurable merits he assumes all shapes and forms simultaneously His enlightenment virtually equals a Buddhas and his wisdom penetrates the duality of dharmas such as permanence and impermanence Though almost a Buddha he is still learning to be a Buddha However Bodhisattvas on lower grounds cannot know his state Buddhas call him a Bodhisattva but Bodhisattvas on lower grounds call him a Buddha Because this holy Bodhisattva using his great transcendental powers lives for a billion kalpas and manifests as a Buddha from His birth to His attaining bodhi to His turning the Dharma wheel and to His entering parinirvāṇa When he expounds the Eightfold Right Path he looks like a Buddha though he is not actually a Buddha Virtually a Buddha he displays the deportment of a Buddha Abiding in  samādhis he takes all Buddha actions He then enters the Vajra Samādhi and confirms that all dharmas are in the one appearance of no appearance abiding in nirvāṇa a state beyond causality The twelfth ground is called the Perfect Enlightenment Ground because He achieves high endurance in His attainment of nirvāṇa As a Buddha He has completed His work for selfbenefit and universally does good dharmas to benefit sentient beings Therefore His mind in perfect enlightenment is called the Buddha store which silently illuminates all dharmas while the minds of all Bodhisattvas  remain in illuminating silence BuddhaSon when I was in the fourth dhyāna heaven  I explained to eight koṭi Brahmakings that the Tathāgata who transcends body and mind silently illuminates all dharmas BuddhaSon I now have briefly explained this meaning to open the door for this huge multitude to take good dharma actions Chapter  The Mother of Buddhas At that time Foremost Reverence Bodhisattva asked the Buddha WorldHonored One how did Buddhas and Bodhisattvas develop their radiant wisdom What is the difference between illuminating silence and silent illumination Are the two truths the same or different Do they exist or not exist What is the nature of the highest truth The Buddha answered BuddhaSon wisdom that arises from realization of the relative truth the absolute truth and the highest truth in the Middle Way is the mother of all Buddhas and Bodhisattvas Even all Dharma Doors are the mother of all Buddhas and Bodhisattvas Because all Buddhas and Bodhisattvas are born through Dharma Doors Relative Truth and Absolute Truth BuddhaSon both relative truth and absolute truth always exist so they are not the same Whether or not a Buddha is in the world the two truths in the dharma realm do not change nor are they nothingness Whether or not a Buddha is in the world they appear in the dharma realm as two truths so they are not the same In accord with both truths Buddhas appear in the world for the sake of sentient beings Dharmas in true reality have no birth so they are the same Dharmas in true reality are not dharmas because they are empty Dharmas in true reality have no birth so they are the same Dharmas exist under false names based on their perceived appearances so they are not nothingness BuddhaSon the two truths are neither the same nor different neither unceasing nor ceasing neither coming nor going and have neither birth nor death Stated as two truths they reveal the holy wisdom in nonduality in the Middle Way And wisdom is the mother of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas BuddhaSon Buddhas in countless worlds in the ten directions all say so I now have briefly explained to this huge multitude the essential meanings of the two truths Immediate Enlightenment Then Foremost Reverence Bodhisattva asked the Buddha Buddhas and Bodhisattvas skillfully illuminate the dharma realm with their wisdom in the equality of dharmas Are they enlightened immediately or gradually You have not explained this BuddhaSon you already asked the past seven Buddhas these questions and you know the answers It is to enable this huge multitude of fourteen koṭi people to receive a definite answer that you ask me these questions BuddhaSon for the sake of this huge multitude of fourteen koṭi people I now expound the definitive meaning with my vajra voice BuddhaSon in a past Dharma assembly of mine one koṭi eight thousand stainless great ones  penetrated dharma nature and immediately realized the nonduality of dharmas that arise upon convergences of causes and conditions They left the Dharma assembly and went to worlds in the ten directions to reveal the great store of the garlands of Bodhisattvas The multitude  saw one koṭi eight thousand WorldHonored Ones called immediately enlightened Tathāgatas each seated on a lion throne made of a hundred treasures At the same time countless multitudes  listened to the immediately enlightened Tathāgatas Therefore there are only immediately enlightened Tathāgatas no gradually enlightened WorldHonored Ones As Buddhas of the past present and future say this so too I now say this Ignorance and Enlightenment BuddhaSon you say that ignorance and enlightenment are the same mind It is not true If ignorance and enlightenment were the same then there would not be bondage and liberation and ordinary beings and Buddhas would be the same as well Because the bondage of ones afflictions and liberation from the bondage would then be the same in ones mind and an afflictions arising and eradication would occur together BuddhaSon if bondage and liberation were the same the four domains would be one and the six flavors would be the same Yet the four domains are different from one another and the six flavors are different from one another In the same way bondage and liberation are different BuddhaSon when a holy Bodhisattva was still an ordinary being he had all the afflictions When he broke the bondage of his afflictions he first removed the coarse ones then the fine ones If enlightenment and ignorance were one thing then light and dark would not be two things BuddhaSon even ordinary beings minds can have goodness so how can a mind free from attachment to appearances still have ignorance BuddhaSon in the kingdom of Magadha only nonBuddhist masters such as believers of the aṇṭa  creation story claim that light and dark are the same in appearance and that good and evil are the same mind BuddhaSon my Dharma correctly states that there are bondage and liberation as well as ordinary beings and Buddhas The same doer does good and evil as he is reborn during a hundred kalpas but his good and evil  are not the same mind As ancient Buddhas often say that the appearancefree wisdom fire removes the darkness of ignorance it is utterly wrong to say that good and evil yield the same fruit While ones goodness leads to Buddhahood ones ignorance of the truth leads to repeated birth and death through causality Therefore good causes bring good effects evil causes bring evil effects Thus ones goodness frees one from repeated birth and death and leads one to Buddhahood BuddhaSon the goodness of ordinary beings and holy beings can be said to be affliction free because they act against their afflictions Even as Buddhas teach sentient beings to turn away from doing evil to do good they receive requitals through causes and conditions that are not free from their afflictions Those who do karmas out of ignorance receive corresponding requitals such as the three kinds of suffering continuous change in every processand the three kinds of experience pain pleasure and neither Pleasant and neutral experiences come from good causes Painful experiences come from evil causes The root of all suffering is ones ignorance of the truth Kalpas of Spiritual Training BuddhaSon you asked how many kalpas a Bodhisattvas training would take Suppose one takes a rock one li two lis ten lis or even forty lis in length width and height and a celestial garment that weighs three zhus By the time scale of the sun and the moon in the human world if one brushes the rock with the garment once every three years until the rock is worn down to nothing the duration is called a small kalpa Suppose one takes a rock eighty lis in length width and height and a threezhu celestial garment from a Brahma heaven If one brushes the rock with the garment once every three years until the rock is worn down to nothing by the time scale of the radiance of hundreds of jewels in a Brahma heaven as if it were the sun and the moon the duration is called a medium kalpa Suppose one takes a rock eight hundred lis in length width and height and a threezhu celestial garment from a pure abode heaven If one brushes the rock with the garment once every three years until the rock is worn down to nothing by the time scale of the mirrorlike radiance of thousands of jewels in a pure abode heaven as if it were the sun and the moon the duration is called a large kalpa BuddhaSon the time it takes to consume a oneli twoli or tenli rock is called a oneli kalpa twoli kalpa or tenli kalpa The time it takes to consume a fiftyli rock is called a fiftyli kalpa The time it takes to consume a hundredli rock is called a hundredli kalpa In the same way the duration of a thousandli kalpa or a tenthousandli kalpa is established BuddhaSon all sages and holies use such time scales to measure how long it takes them to go through Dharma Doors to attain Buddhahood It takes a hundred kalpas to become virtually equal to a Buddha Sentient beings that train for Buddhahood do not consider these time scales to be too long Those who do not train are not called Bodhisattvas BuddhaSon among the Dharma Doors the ten faithful minds are the roots of all actions Each of the ten faithful minds has ten levels totaling one hundred called the Illumination Door of One Hundred Dharmas Furthermore each of the ten minds includes one hundred minds totaling one thousand called the Illumination Door of One Thousand Dharmas Furthermore each of the ten minds includes one thousand minds totaling ten thousand called the Illumination Door of Ten Thousand Dharmas In this way the ten minds can multiply into an uncountable number of supreme dharmas called the Radiant Illumination Dharma Door which has a million asakhyeya merits All actions go through this Illumination Door Chapter  Cause and Effect At that time Foremost Radiance Bodhisattva asked the Buddha WorldHonored One You have fully explained the meanings of  sages and holies What are the causes and effects of their training The Causes the Ten Pāramitās The Buddha answered BuddhaSon the cause of Buddhas of the past present and future is achievement of the ten pāramitās They are the roots of a million asakhyeya merits that adorn Buddhas and Bodhisattvas These ten dharmas are the oceanlike store of vajra wisdom from which arise all actions with radiant merit To practice the second pāramitā observance of precepts he observes  the precepts for benefiting sentient beings To practice the third pāramitā endurance he endures  in his continued acceptance of the highest truth To practice the ninth pāramitā acquiring powers he acquires  powers to transform and manifest things The Four Drawingin Dharmas are  collaborative work The Four Kinds of Unimpeded WisdomKnowledge are wisdomknowledge of  eloquent teaching according to sentient beings capacities and preferences The Four Dharmas to Rely Upon are  ones wisdomknowledge not consciousness Moreover from a Bodhisattvas achievement of the ten pāramitās arise the Ten Powers the Four Fearlessnesses the six transcendental powers and the Three Clarities which bring a million koṭi asakhyeya merits With wisdom he successively masters the Four Noble Truths the two truths the Twelve Links of Dependent Arising and the eight worldly truths that cover all dharmas a dharma is used under a false name These are the eight truths of saskṛta dharmas the womb the egg moisture and miraculous formation  the four fetters All these eighteen karmas that are removed are not called goodness BuddhaSon the merits acquired from removing them by practicing the ten pāramitās are called the causes of a Buddha You should train to acquire such merits The Effects BuddhaSon you asked earlier about the effects of the training of the five groups of sages and holies on the Bodhisattva Way BuddhaSon they will harvest a great fruit the body of dharma nature However this body neither exists nor not exists and has neither appearances nor names It is neither large nor small neither physical nor mental neither celestial nor human It is beyond past present and future and beyond a Tathāgatas eternity bliss self and purity It is neither ones six consciousnesses nor ones six faculties BuddhaSon there are two kinds of dharma bodies the response and manifested bodies The latter follow the former like a shadow following its form Because the fruition body is eternal the response and manifested bodies are eternal as well BuddhaSon while Buddhas have attained the same bodhi and their two kinds of bodies are eternal the two bodies of Bodhisattvas are impermanent BuddhaSon an ordinary being also has two bodies the requital body and the support body Each sentient being has its own requital body and all share the support body  Both Bodhisattvas and ordinary beings have two bodies This is definitely true because all Tathāgatas say so BuddhaSon Buddhas have taken the same path and acquired the same fruit Buddha With these ten virtues a Buddha is called Bhagavān the WorldHonored One worthy of offerings from all sentient beings Having eradicated all His afflictions He has left the path of hindrances caused by afflictions He is equipped with the godbody godeye godear pastlife knowledge and telepathic knowledge all of which are free from afflictions He has the five eyes the Three Supreme Clarities the Three Illuminations and the dharma body with its five aspects Pure in His three karmas  He is the essential one of the Three Jewels Fully liberated from suffering by attaining nirvāṇa with profound wisdom He reveals the One Vehicle the vajra store the store of the dharma body and the store of pure Buddha nature as well as the three asaskṛta dharmas the one truth and the one path that leads to great bliss beyond causality BuddhaSon in the immeasurable store of merits is the holy fruit of the one path the inconceivable and indescribable fruit It is in the pure realm of the highest truth in the Middle Way boundless nameless and appearance free Neither a body nor not a body it is not acquired from anything Pure in its nonduality it manifests as one illumination  one encompassment  one body  one enlightenment  and one appearance  BuddhaSon this fruit is unique perfect and everabiding It has innumerable meanings which have countless virtues with countless names This fruit means cessation of suffering  realization of nirvāṇa and realization of a Tathāgatas eternity bliss self and purity which comes with all virtues such as the Eighteen Exclusive Dharmas These meanings are called fruits of the fruit The three words pertaining to this fruitmeanings virtues and namesare for teaching and transforming sentient beings If sages or ordinary beings understand their significance they have already received the position from Buddhas of the past present and future to become a Buddha someday BuddhaSon this fruit is unknowable and indescribable However I use names to explain it The one fruit is called the body and its meanings are called fruits of the fruit because they come out of this perfect fruit BuddhaSon I now have explained the causes and effects  which cannot be fully explained even in a billion kalpas You all should accept and uphold them Chapter  Accepting and Learning to Observe the Precepts At that time Foremost Reverence Bodhisattva made obeisance to all Buddhas At the request of the multitude he asked for the essential teachings given in the past seven assemblies because he believed in the Three Jewels and wished the Dharma to remain in the world for a long time For the continuation of the Dharma not for gaining worldly names or benefits he asked the Buddha WorldHonored One you have explained the causes and effects of sages and holies and their store of merits In this multitude of fourteen koṭi people who can without rising from their seats become Bodhisattvas and train for bodhi step by step from start to finish Then the topknot on the Buddhas head emitted Buddha light and Bodhisattva light which summoned Buddhas and Bodhisattvas from a hundred koṭi Buddha Lands in the ten directions After they had assembled He told Bodhisattvas Mañjuśrī Samantabhadra Dharma Wisdom Merit Grove Vajra Banner Vajra Store and Good Wealth Look upon Foremost Reverence Bodhisattva in the midst of this multitude who can ask about the three right observations on the pure path of Buddhas in the dharma realm called the Dharma Door of Illuminating Observations through which all Bodhisattvas go Each of you seven Bodhisattvas should lead a multitude of a million to go through this Dharma Door  BuddhaSon I will now repeat my teachings on the way of illuminating observations which is the path with six sections Listen and ponder in order to develop your wisdom When sentient beings first enter the ocean of the Three Jewels they must have faith as their roots When they abide in the Buddha family they must have the precepts as their roots Novice Bodhisattvas whether male or female believers those incomplete in their faculties eunuchs male or female prostitutes slaves or servants or even magically conjured persons can all accept the precepts if they want to Those who have renounced family life and wish to become Bodhisattvas must first accept the right precepts The precepts are the roots of the store of meritorious actions They are the roots of all actions taken to attain Buddhahood The precepts can remove enormous evils including the seven  views and the six entrapping afflictions They are the bright mirror of the true Dharma They are the three doors called  the precepts for benefiting sentient beings which arise from ones lovingkindness compassion sympathetic joy and equability  to give all sentient beings peace and happiness BuddhaSon there are three ways to receive the Bodhisattva precepts First one can accept them before Buddhas and holy Bodhisattvas Precepts received in this way are highgrade precepts Second after the passing away of a Buddha and holy Bodhisattvas if within  lis of ones place there is a Bodhisattva who has already received these precepts one can ask such a Dharma master to impart the precepts One should bow down at his feet and ask Great Venerable One please be my teacher and impart the precepts to me Precepts received in this way are called middlegrade precepts Third after the passing away of a Buddha  if no Dharma master is available within  lis of ones place one can join ones palms and kneel before the images of Buddhas and holy Bodhisattvas and accept the precepts by making a vow Three times one should declare I disciple A say to Buddhas  in the ten directions and to Bodhisattvas on the holy grounds that I vow to learn all Bodhisattva precepts Precepts received in this way are called lowgrade precepts BuddhaSon these three ways to receive the Bodhisattva precepts were pronounced by past Buddhas will be pronounced by future Buddhas and are pronounced by present Buddhas BuddhaSon these Buddha precepts were learned will be learned and are learned by Bodhisattvas of the past future and present It is utterly wrong to say that Buddhas or Bodhisattvas without entering the door of true precepts have attained supreme bodhi standing on the ground of equality like the open sky Imparting the Ten Major Precepts The Buddha told the Buddhasons I now explain the true precepts  When good men and good women accept these precepts three times they should make obeisance to all Buddhas in their past lives in the past without a beginning to all Buddhas in their future lives in the endless future and to all Buddhas of the present in their present lives Also three times they should make obeisance to the Dharma and the Saṅgha BuddhaSons they should reverently hold the four indestructible faiths and honor the Four Dharmas to Rely Upon Three times they should say From today through all future lives I take refuge in the Buddha take refuge in the Dharma take refuge in the Saṅgha and take refuge in the precepts Then teach them to repent of their sins in the past present and future For sins of the ten evil karmas they have committed in their past lives with their body voice and mind they should vow never to repeat them in the endless future For sins of the ten evil karmas they have committed in their present lives with their body voice and mind they should vow never to repeat them in the endless future For sins of the ten evil karmas they might commit in their future lives with their body voice and mind they should vow never to commit them in the endless future After repentance they will have purified their three karmas  which become like pure aquamarine  translucent throughout Then you can impart to them the ten endless precepts Ask them to hearken when you pronounce the precepts as I do now BuddhaSons until one has acquired a Buddhas body from this life to the endless future one should not purposely kill sentient beings Violation of this precept goes against what a Bodhisattva should do and will cause one to lose ones status of a sage or holy at any of the fortytwo levels Can you observe this precept The precept recipients should say that they can BuddhaSons until one has acquired a Buddhas body from this life to the endless future one should not purposely steal anything Violation of this precept goes against what a Bodhisattva should do and will cause one to lose ones status of a sage or holy at any of the fortytwo levels Can you observe this precept The precept recipients should say that they can BuddhaSons until one has acquired a Buddhas body from this life to the endless future one should not purposely have sex Violation of this precept goes against what a Bodhisattva should do and will cause one to lose ones status of a sage or holy at any of the fortytwo levels Can you observe this precept The precept recipients should say that they can BuddhaSons until one has acquired a Buddhas body from this life to the endless future one should not purposely lie Violation of this precept goes against what a Bodhisattva should do and will cause one to lose ones status of a sage or holy at any of the fortytwo levels Can you observe this precept The precept recipients should say that they can BuddhaSons until one has acquired a Buddhas body from this life to the endless future one should not sell alcohol Violation of this precept goes against what a Bodhisattva should do and will cause one to lose ones status of a sage or holy at any of the fortytwo levels Can you observe this precept The precept recipients should say that they can BuddhaSons until one has acquired a Buddhas body from this life to the endless future one should not purposely talk about the faults of a Bodhisattva monastic or lay Violation of this precept goes against what a Bodhisattva should do and will cause one to lose ones status of a sage or holy at any of the fortytwo levels Can you observe this precept The precept recipients should say that they can BuddhaSons until one has acquired a Buddhas body from this life to the endless future one should not be stingy Violation of this precept goes against what a Bodhisattva should do and will cause one to lose ones status of a sage or holy at any of the fortytwo levels Can you observe this precept The precept recipients should say that they can BuddhaSons until one has acquired a Buddhas body from this life to the endless future one should not anger  Violation of this precept goes against what a Bodhisattva should do and will cause one to lose ones status of a sage or holy at any of the fortytwo levels Can you observe this precept The precept recipients should say that they can BuddhaSons until one has acquired a Buddhas body from this life to the endless future one should not purposely praise oneself and criticize others Violation of this precept goes against what a Bodhisattva should do and will cause one to lose ones status of a sage or holy at any of the fortytwo levels Can you observe this precept The precept recipients should say that they can BuddhaSons until one has acquired a Buddhas body from this life to the endless future one should not purposely malign the Three Jewels Violation of this precept goes against what a Bodhisattva should do and will cause one to lose ones status of a sage or holy at any of the fortytwo levels Can you observe this precept The precept recipients should say that they can BuddhaSon after receiving these ten endless precepts each recipient transcends the four māras and the suffering in the Three Realms of Existence Life after life he will not lose these precepts because they follow him until he has attained Buddhahood BuddhaSon for all sentient beings of the past present and future if they do not accept these Bodhisattva precepts they are not called sentient beings or humans Being outside the ocean of the Three Jewels they are not called Bodhisattvas men or women or ghosts or spirits but called animals They are called nonBuddhists who hold the wrong views against human empathy Know that there are ways to receive the Bodhisattva precepts but no way to abandon them Even if they are violated one still retains them throughout the endless future All Sentient Beings Can Accept the Ten Major Precepts If someone wishes to receive the Bodhisattva precepts a Bodhisattva Dharma master should first recite and explain the precepts so that the recipient will open his mind with understanding and delight Then he should impart the precepts to him If a Dharma master teaches even one person to renounce family life and accept the Bodhisattva precepts his merit surpasses that acquired from building  pagodas  His merit will be immeasurable if he teaches two three or even  people Also husband and wife and the six branches of family can be each others teachers  Those who accept the Bodhisattva precepts join the Bodhisattvas in the realm of Buddhas and will transcend the suffering of repeated birth and death in the Three Realms of Existence Therefore you should accept these precepts Those who have precepts even though they violate them surpass those who have no precepts to violate While those who have accepted the Bodhisattva precepts are called Bodhisattvas those who have no precepts are called nonBuddhists He can also accept two three or four precepts If he accepts all ten precepts he is called a fullmeasure Bodhisattva Therefore a Bodhisattva observes the ten major precepts and  precepts for his actions If he has violated any of the ten major precepts the violated precept cannot be restored by repentance However  he can receive the precept again The  precepts for his actions are all minor precepts If he has violated any of them he can restore the violated precept by repenting to a qualified person The essence of these ten precepts for ordinary beings and holy beings is the mind If the mind ends the precepts end As the mind is endless so too are the precepts All sentient beings on the six lifepaths can accept the precepts if they understand their Bodhisattva masters words After receiving the precepts they will not lose them As all Buddhas of past present and future kalpas say this so too under this tree I now say this to this multitude of fourteen koṭi people BuddhaSon those who have not yet entered the first of the ten levels of abiding are called faithasappearance Bodhisattvas BuddhaSon if these Bodhisattvas who have newly accepted the ten endless precepts observe them for ten thousand kalpas they will enter the first level of abiding BuddhaSon you should first impart the Bodhisattva precepts to the multitudes then expound this garland sūtra to them so that they can hold the same views and take the same actions At that time a koṭi people in the multitude rose from their seats and accepted the Buddha precepts The Brahmaking Dhāśa together with innumerable godsons after fully observing these ten major precepts  entered the first level of abiding The SixEntrance Illumination Door  BuddhaSon as a Bodhisattva progresses from the first to the tenth level of abiding he goes through the Dharma Door of One Hundred Observations  ten kinds of transference of merit Practicing these one hundred observations he fully understands that the Three Realms of Existence and the false names of dharmas are empty He realizes that a person has no self and that his experiences and all causes  have no definite nature He then ends his thirteen afflictionsthe seven  views and the six entrapping afflictionsand enters the first of the ten levels of action BuddhaSon as he progresses from the first to the tenth level of action he goes through the Illumination Door of One Thousand Dharmas to enter into the Dharma level by level He realizes that a dharma has no self and a person has no self that experiences dharmas as they arise and perish He realizes that dharmas are like the open sky like illusions and like mirages and  have no appearance He sees that the false name of a dharma cannot be captured and that ones perception of a dharma can be called a false capture He understands the analogy of the burning of a lamp wick At first the wick has no flame then it gradually burns away As the alternating existence and nonexistence of the flickering flame are false names he knows that the present flame is not the initial flame and that the scorched wick is not the initial wick As the initial flame is gone the present flame is a false burning He acquires the view that dharmas are equal  He realizes that one captures a dharma neither in nor not in ones earlier mind and that one captures it neither in nor not in ones later mind As ones present mind is not ones earlier mind whatever arises in ones present mind is not what arose in ones earlier mind As ones present mind is not ones earlier mind whatever is captured in ones present mind is a false capture He then realizes his mind in the highest truth in the Middle Way With each thought in nirvāṇa he enters the Illumination Door of Ten Thousand Dharmas Having cultivated the ten faithful minds and completed the successive thirty levels of training he naturally walks the path of equality With the right view that nothing can be captured and that everything has the one appearance  he ascends to the first of the Ten Grounds BuddhaSon as he progresses from the first ground to the tenth ground with the right observations and radiant wisdom he goes through the Dharma Door that has a million asakhyeya merits Observing the one appearance of all dharmas simultaneously with his mind in nirvāṇa he naturally ascends to the Stainless Ground BuddhaSon on the Stainless Ground with radiant wisdom he knows all karmic causes and effects in the dharma realm He also knows that the consciousness of every sentient being began through conditions with the first thought If it agrees with the highest truth it is called goodness If it disagrees with the highest truth it is called afflictions From the initial thought goodness and afflictions are born as the groundabiding  pair With the dual mind of goodness and afflictions as the root all subsequent goodness and afflictions arise  Furthermore through causes and conditions one acts to elicit more goodness and afflictions Although ones mind is neither goodness nor afflictions it is called the mind of goodness and afflictions Then this groundabiding duality  born from the initial thought produces three kinds of groundabiding afflictions Afflictions pertaining to the desire realm are called the desirerealm abiding ground afflictions pertaining to the form realm are called the formrealm abiding ground afflictions pertaining to the mind are called the formlessrealm abiding ground All active afflictions arise from these four kinds of groundabiding afflictions and no affliction can arise without them Underlying these four is the groundabiding ignorance since time without a beginning With vajra wisdom a holy Bodhisattva on the Stainless Ground knows that the initial karmic thought  has an ending However he does not know whether any mental activities existed before this initial thought much less how the groundabiding duality produces the three kinds of groundabiding afflictions Only a Buddha knows their beginnings and endings With the overall wisdomknowledge  a stainless Bodhisattva knows himself and others abides in the highest truth and naturally ascends to the Perfect Enlightenment Ground His one dharma body has innumerable meanings and countless names His wondrous bodhi fruit is everabiding and pure like the open sky inconceivable indescribable unidentifiable and unclassifiable into any realm BuddhaSon I say that the Dharma Door with six entrances for Bodhisattvas has immeasurable merit All Bodhisattvas must enter this door In this assembly there are fourteen koṭi people Without leaving their seats they enter this SixEntrance Dharma Door BuddhaSon when I first attained bodhi under this tree I expounded the ten oceans of worlds and ninety koṭi people entered the SixEntrance Illumination Door Then I went to the universal radiance palace hall and expounded the ten Buddha Lands and a million people entered the SixEntrance Illumination Door Then I went to the godking akras palace hall  and expounded the ten levels of abiding and  million gods entered the SixEntrance Illumination Door Then I went to the flaming jewel palace hall  and expounded the ten levels of action and  million gods entered the SixEntrance Illumination Door Then I went to the Dharma light palace hall in the fourth desire heaven and expounded the ten levels of transference of merit and gods as numerous as the sands of ten Ganges Rivers entered the SixEntrance Illumination Door Then I went to the gemladen palace hall in the sixth desire heaven and expounded the Ten Grounds and gods as numerous as the sands of a million Ganges Rivers entered the SixEntrance Illumination Door Then I descended to Jetavana Grove and expounded the chapter Entering the Dharma Realm and people as numerous as the sands of twelve Ganges Rivers entered the SixEntrance Illumination Door I now have come to this eighth assembly and expounded the SixEntrance Illumination Door to Foremost Reverence Bodhisattva and countless multitudes  in the ten directions for all to accept and uphold it equally Chapter  The Dissolution of the Assembly At that time the Buddha told Foremost Reverence Bodhisattva and the fourteen koṭi people in the assembly You have heard the Dharma Door of observing the causes and effects of sages and holies at the fortytwo levels You all should activate the sabodhi mind Three times He told all the Buddhasons You should accept and uphold this Dharma Door and activate the bodhi mind Then  godsons in the multitude activated the mind at the first level of abiding and shed their status of ordinary beings They cultivated endurance in subduing their afflictions and began to make illuminating observations at the ten levels of abiding Also  male and female believers entered the Dharma Door of the ten levels of action Also  great Brahmakings acquired the ability to make illuminating observations on the first ground Also the eight asurakings with their eight legions changed their physical form cultivated the ten faithful minds and began to do the ten good karmas Also  Bodhisattvas on the tenth ground manifested as Buddhas The Multitudes Depart Then multitudes from countless Buddha Lands in the ten directions having heard the Buddhas pronouncement of the SixEntrance Illumination Doorthe ten levels of abiding the ten levels of action the ten levels of transference of merit the Ten Grounds the Stainless Ground and the Perfect Enlightenment Groundactivated the unsurpassed bodhi mind and returned to their own worlds Also gods from the form realm and the formless realm by their transcendental power returned to their own heavens and taught other gods the Dharma Door of a Bodhisattvas garland Also gods from the six desire heavens returned to their own heavens and widely pronounced to other gods the immeasurable essential training Then the multitude accepted and upheld this sūtra They read and recited it and understood its meanings Then they returned to their own worlds to expound a Bodhisattvas essential training which follows a Buddhas original karmas Then the Buddha told  holy Bodhisattvas the foremost disciples in Buddha Lands in the ten directions who include Mañjuśrī Wisdom Ocean Vajra Store and Bodhi Flower You should teach ignorant sentient beings in worlds in the ten directions to accept and uphold this sūtra read and recite it and understand its meanings For all sentient beings of the past present and future you should open the path of wisdom in emptiness which will lead them through the Illumination Door Then  great Bodhisattvas waiting to demonstrate attainment of Buddhahood in their next life rose from their seats and upheld the Buddhas words which would not perish for kalpas Also  Brahmakings rose from their seats and upheld the Buddhas words And innumerable goddessdaughters rose from their seats and upheld the Buddhas words Then Bodhisattvas in this world and from countless worlds in other directions entered the Illusion Samādhi and using their transcendental powers with unbounded joy jumped up into the open sky Having heard accepted and upheld this sūtra of the garland of merits they resolved to attain Buddhahood through the doors of sages and holies Then the Buddha displayed a million transcendental powers emitting immeasurable radiance and manifesting innumerable pure bodies He again entrusted to the huge multitude this garland sūtra from the ocean of the vajra store He said All of you should accept and uphold this sūtra It reveals the training methods in the minds of innumerable hundreds and thousands of past Buddhas You should accept and uphold it and make offerings to it Then the multitude rose from their seats and emitted thousands of beams of light illuminating this ThreeThousand Large Thousandfold World With the highest esteem they joyfully accepted and upheld this sūtra of the inconceivable garland of a Bodhisattva and made offerings to it They made obeisance to the Buddha and departed When godsons from the six desire heavens and  human kings saw the dissolution of the Dharma assembly they wept aloud their cries of sorrow filling the ThreeThousand Large Thousandfold world Then still crying they left the assembly Also eighty koṭi great Bodhisattvas upheld the Buddhas words with the Four Immeasurable Minds understanding that existence and nonexistence are equal and that  all dharmas are asaskṛta and have no appearance They entered the Samādhi of Endless Manifestations and departed joyfully And  beginner sages entered the meditation that has nine levels the four dhyānas of the form realm the four samādhis of the formless realm and the Samādhi of Total Suspension of Sensory Reception and Perception Important Steps before Expounding the Essential Training Then  Bodhisattvas rose from their seats Vajra Flower Bodhisattva asked the Buddha In future times when we expound this sūtra turning the Dharma wheel to teach Bodhisattvas what should we do to enable the listeners to accept it and train accordingly The Buddha answered BuddhaSon your question is timely BuddhaSon you should first impart the Bodhisattva precepts to the listeners then expound the essential training of a Bodhisattva through the SixEntrance Illumination Door BuddhaSon first have them take the Four Refugesrefuge in the Buddha refuge in the Dharma refuge in the Saṅgha and refuge in the preceptsenabling them to acquire the four indestructible faiths These ten major precepts prohibit parājikas because  they cannot be restored by repentance BuddhaSon you should then teach the precept recipients to make offerings to the Dharma master They should present such offerings as immeasurable celestial flowers and incense  bright lamps  celestial garments and necklaces  kinds of instrumental music food and drink houses and scriptural texts and whatever he needs They should treat him the way they respect a Buddha the way they serve their parents teachers monks or the godking akra the way Brahmins worship fire Three times every day they should make obeisance to the Dharma master they should be willing to lay down their lives for the sake of the Dharma To such seekers of the Dharma you can then expound a Bodhisattvas essential training called the Garland Dharma Door which is taught by a billion Buddhas Then the multitude of fourteen koṭi people lamented In future times there will be no Dharma no Three Jewels and no sages because evil times arise from evils It will be immeasurably hard to find Dharma expounders and Dharma listeners They rose from their seats and wept in sorrow Their cries moved the earth and agitated the ocean and the ThreeThousand Large Thousandfold World overturned The sun the moon and the twentyeight constellations disappeared Then the multitude respectfully withdrew the display of their spiritual powers Afterward they continued to accept and uphold this sūtra read and recite it and explain its meanings which lasted endlessly and they joyfully carried out its teachings Sūtra of Accepting the Ten Good Karmas as Precepts Translated from Sanskrit into Chinese in the Later Han Dynasty by An Unknown Person Chapter  The Ten Evil Karmas Thus I have heard At one time the Bhagavān was staying in the ashram in Jetavana Garden offered by the Elder Sudatta and his wife Viśakhā in the city kingdom of rāvastī together with  great bhikṣus At that time in lovingkind Brahma tones the WorldHonored One said to āriputra I now expound to you all how to prevent the ten evil karmas and their requitals Hearken Hearken Remember and uphold my words singlemindedly never forget or lose them The ten evil karmas are  delusion  Purifying Ones Body Voice and Mind āriputra you now should teach all sentient beings to purify their body karmas voice karmas and mind karmas They should prostrate themselves on the ground to take refuge in the preceptor and sincerely repent of their three evil karmas After repentance their body karmas voice karmas and mind karmas are purified Then three times they should say I Disciple A take refuge in the Buddha take refuge in the Dharma take refuge in the Saṅgha Also three times they should next say Completion of taking refuge in the Buddha completion of taking in the Dharma completion of taking refuge in the Saṅgha Then ask them Good men and good women can you uphold your refuge If they say that they can then ask them Have your body and mind sinned These sins include shedding the blood of a Buddha killing an Arhat disrupting the harmony of a Saṅgha and maligning the true Dharma of the Buddha If their answer is negative you should further ask Have you thought about committing any of the five rebellious sins or maligning the true Dharma Have you stolen from the Saṅgha things pertaining to the Buddha or the Dharma offerings to the holy ones personal things or communal things Have you ever defiled your mother or sisters or bhikṣuṇīs If their answer is negative you should teach them that they now are pure in body and mind and that they should ask Virtuous One please remember that I wish to receive the ten good karmas as precepts because I have repented of the ten evil karmas I pray only that the Virtuous One out of lovingkindness and compassion for me will permit me to receive them Accepting the Ten Good Karmas as

views one will renounce family life in order to acquire the Way to nirvāṇa If one is reborn in a heaven it will be a Brahma heaven One will encounter a Buddha appearing in the world and request Him to turn the Dharma wheel and one will eventually attain anuttarasamyaksabodhi The Requitals for Upholding the Ten Good Karmas and the Eight Precepts At that time the WorldHonored One in praise of this Dharma spoke in verse If one can carry out the ten good karmas And follow the teachings in the true Dharma One will always see Buddhas life after life With body and mind open to understanding One will forever discard the bondage of suffering And quickly attain the unsurpassed bodhi If one observes the eight precepts and Follows the Vinaya Without violation And upholds the true Dharma of Buddhas

the eight precepts Take care not to forget or lose them resulting in destruction of the Dharma seeds Widely pronounce them to all gods and humans āriputra said to the Buddha Indeed Indeed I will vigilantly accept and uphold them At that time āriputra and all others in the assembly having heard the Buddhas words rejoiced and reverently carried out the teachings Chapter  The Requitals for Good and Evil Karmas The Requitals for Not Killing Sentient Beings The Buddha told āriputra You now should know That all who are alive Love their bodies and lives Therefore one should give alms To all sentient beings with universal lovingkindness Regarding them all as ones own eyes This is called the precept against killing which is Pronounced by Buddhas of the past present and future Who have  the knowledge of all knowledge Similar to forgiving oneself One should neither kill nor harm others When one witnesses the act of killing One feels as if a knife is stabbing ones heart Regarding all sentient beings as no different from oneself By observing the precept against killing one will be reborn in heaven One will often encounter Buddhas and Bodhisattvas Therefore one should accept and

and turns the Dharma wheel In the Dharma of Maitreya Buddha one will renounce family life One will also see the rest of the  Buddhas of this Worthy Kalpa Vairocana Buddha will bestow upon one the prophecy of Attaining anuttarasamyaksabodhi This is called the supreme requital for not killing sentient beings Also called the root of the Brahma way of lovingkindness and compassion This  is pronounced by all Buddhas And upheld by all Buddhas As all love their own eyes So too they love their young The love for ones own life is endless Therefore one should never kill sentient beings This is called the supreme Brahma way of life One neither kills sentient beings nor thinks of killing them Nor does one eat flesh Regarding killers as thieves One knows that they will definitely fall into hell Flesh eaters have many illnesses Adorning themselves with termination of others lives Those who invoke the mind of great lovingkindness And reverently observe the precept against killing Will definitely attain bodhi All Sentient Beings Love Their Lives The Buddha told āriputra Know that the karma of killing sentient beings has grave consequences Once you and I visited the city of Pāṭaliputra and there we met Devapatī the daughter of an elder She gave birth to a boy who was comely beyond comparison just as the goddessdaughter Red Lotus Flower is unequaled This mother loved her son very much Holding the boy in her arms she came to the place where I was She said to me WorldHonored One My son is so lovely that he is like a celestial boy My love for him is a billion times my love for myself Then I told her Good woman know that ordinary beings love their own lives and that their selflove is like an ocean swallowing all streams never satiated What is your proof That woman answered WorldHonored One I love my son Even if a fire is burning my body I will never abandon my son To transform that woman the WorldHonored One using His spiritual power manifested four yakṣas who approached from the four directions each holding a mountain of fire When the fires were still far away the woman used her body and her clothes to shield her son When the fires drew near she raised her hands and used her son to shield her face from the fire The Buddha asked the woman You say that you love your son Why are you using your son to block the fire and save yourself Then the woman answered WorldHonored One to save myself I would not save this son The Buddha used His spiritual power to give coolness to both mother and son She then activated the unsurpassed bodhi mind The Buddha told that

What is the precept of no sex Giving up sex has the benefit of five virtues which are praised by Buddhas of the past present and future Those who give up sex deport themselves like a Buddha and like a Buddha their bodies are fragrant What are these five virtues First ones eye consciousness remains impervious to sex objects When one sees such an object it is like seeing a maggot in feces a knife entering ones heart or a fire burning ones eyes so love does not arise from ones mind As the fire of desire in ones eyes wantonly moves under the law of impermanence what love is there Second ones ear consciousness remains impervious to sex sounds that please ones ears Such sounds of delusion incite the forest of venomous snakes and produce the seeds of love These sounds are called the thief wind As it flows out of ones hearing faculty and deluded perception what love is there Sex is the tightest bondage with invisible shackles like the mud of the five desires that traps an old elephant All of you listen singlemindedly Myriad worthy actions are ruined by the filth of the sex act It sinks ones meditation And blocks the liberation path Good men and good women Who seek the liberation path in order to leave The prison of the Three Realms of Existence Which contains the fire pit the river of the five desires The cauldron of fire and the mountain of freezing ice And to be liberated from the fear of repeated birth and death Should uphold their minds as they would uphold Buddhas And observe the precept of no sex Those who seek rebirth in a long life heaven To live a long life of innumerable kalpas Or seek rebirth as a Brahma god Or as a WheelTurning King who owns the seven treasures Should uphold their minds as they would uphold Buddhas And observe the precept of no sex Those who aspire to see Buddhas To hear the Dharma to attain bodhi to achieve The six transcendental powers and to visit Worlds in the ten directions Should uphold their minds as they would uphold Buddhas And observe the precept of no sex The Ten Troubles Resulting from Sex I now explain the ten troubles resulting from sex What are these ten When they visit those in the Brahmin caste they act without any sense of shame or dishonor like a magician who performs only evil tricks and speaks of impure things When they visit śramaṇas they do not have the sense to take refuge in them As copper flowers change into huge burning iron nails the copper pillar changes into molten copper in a boiling cauldron As the iron bed bursts in flames the female images transform into dogs and the male images transform into knives They force the sinner to experience immeasurable suffering eating burning iron pellets and drinking molten copper For innumerable years in his lifespan of one kalpa he will yearn for death but will be unable to die Tenth those who are greedy for sex cannot see a Buddha Meanwhile King Yama will rebuke the sinner You enjoyed sex and now you experience this suffering Is this suffering a pleasure You should repay your debts to others for a billion kalpas but even so you cannot repay your debts in full After his life in hell has ended he will be reborn as a dove or will assume the body of a dragon or snake Because he has destroyed his Brahma way of life for hundreds and thousands of lives he will be unable to see a Buddha hear the Dharma and attain bodhi At that time the WorldHonored One spoke in verse With unceasing sex and desire Sentient beings are each reborn life after life Ignorance being the root They are slashed by the knife of old age and death And ravaged by the forest of venomous snakes Their bodies being skin sacs filled with blood and impurities Like maggots that delight in feces They are greedy for sex With the fire of their desire flaming from the nine orifices Love is like poisonous thorns Growing from inverted wrong views Love is produced by illusions The smoothness of the female body is Like a tree blooming wanton flowers Which are scattered by the delusion wind Then these wilted flowers become infested with worms Women are like painted vases Leaking drops of pus and blood Each full vase leaks Displaying its impurities The eyes that set upon the impure fluids are Like a lustful thieving dog By singlemindedly observing such impurity One should discard ones loves By drinking sweet nectar One will live in the great city of nirvāṇa The Buddha told nanda If there are those who restrain their body and mind not to have sex restrain their eyes not to see sex objects restrain their ears not to hear sex sounds restrain their nose not to smell sex scents and restrain their tongue not to say sex words it is called taking wisdom action on the Eightfold Right Path By not having sex ones body and mind are purified like a lotus flower untouched by dirt Through the purity of no sex one will achieve the way of Srotāpannas Sakṛdāgāmins Anāgāmins and Arhats the way of Pratyekabuddhas or the unsurpassed Bodhi Way The Requitals for the Good Voice Karmas The four evil voice karmas  are false speech divisive speech abusive speech and suggestive speech and  voice karma is speech that praises the wrong views  If a person quits false speech Proclaims the precept against lying And upholds his voice as he would uphold a Buddhas voice Always speaking truthful words He will be reborn in heaven The fragrance from his mouth permeating all heavens If he is reborn in the human world He will be adorned with fragrances Like water flowing from the mountain of fragrance Into the river of nirvāṇa If a person quits divisive speech And a doubledealing mind His tongue will be like a Buddhas tongue With lotus petals covering his face Light in five different colors Will issue from his tongue He will always pronounce the Dharma of a great man With utmost sincerity free from divisive speech If a person quits abusive speech He will be called a great man He will be the upright one among men And all will be delighted to see him Who is like the fragrance of sandalwood If a person quits suggestive speech His mouth will always emit wonderful fragrance Like the flower of utpala lotus He will encounter Buddhas wherever he is reborn If a persons voice karma is truly pure He will neither praise the wrong views Nor discuss the karma of holding the wrong views He will always renounce family life wherever he is reborn And will earn a right livelihood Buddhas abide in nirvāṇa Which is attained by speaking truthful words The Requitals for the Evil Voice Karmas The Buddha told āriputra The five misuses of ones voice lead to five enormously evil karmas What are these five First a liar slanders others He claims to hear something he has not heard to see something he has not seen and to have attained bodhi he has not attained Such an evil person though not sick is like a mangy dog At that time the WorldHonored One spoke in verse Amid gods and humans Suppose a blazing fire like burning iron pellets Burns away all humans It is not nearly as bad as this thief  What is a colossal thief There is only one kind  Suppose surges of fire Burn ones bones into molten copper Suppose one is devoured by a mountain of knives Boiled in a cauldron and dismembered by knives and saws Suppose ones body is torn into shreds to build a bonfire He will roam in Avīci Hell With wheels of knives as his feet And venomous iron snakes as his tongue The fire spewed from his mouth could set the Thousandfold World ablaze And his eyes will be like popping iron pellets The boiling cauldron will pour  in torrential rains Burning away his roots of goodness with their promised flowers For innumerable thousands of koṭis of kalpas The liar will definitely trudge the evil lifepaths From which he cannot escape Such an enormously evil person Has a body like a mountain of fire Which burns away all that is good Second a person using abusive speech even if holding fragrance in his mouth stinks like a corpse He delights in talking about wicked things What comes out his mouth is like thorns knives swords and lances and like feces urine maggots and pus While no fragrance among gods and men surpasses that of virtuous speech no stench in the Three Realms of Existence surpasses that of abusive speech Whatever spews from his abusive mouth is like a rain of iron pellets which burn down others houses This person will fall into an immense hell to drink molten iron as his body is burned by scorching iron If he is reborn in the human world he will be a sick dog or sick man afflicted with mange He speaks words that praise the five desires words devoid of understanding words of darkness and words that like thorns and thistles hook sentient beings The evil requital to this person is that after death he will fall into Thistle Forest Hell There  iron thorns will hook out his tongue and break it into  pieces Fifth a person praising the wrong views has a mouth like a blazing fire that burns away his roots of goodness He has no father or mother no Buddha Dharma or Saṅgha no Arhat or Pratyekabuddha no teacher comrade or beneficent learned friend His mind is like a hurricane that blows down all trees together with their roots of goodness This is a colossal thief who proclaims that there is no causality His voice is like massive water flooding the Three Realms of Existence His debauchery is rampant as he plays with his kind By committing any of the five rebellious sins he sends himself into the hell of uninterrupted suffering and destroys his wisdom In addition by violating any of the four grave prohibitions he condemns himself to uninterrupted suffering The blowing of evil winds  moves his vicious mouth and in the fire of Avīci Hell iron thorns grow on his tongue In this world this enormously evil person is composed of the five aggregates and the four domains earth water fire and wind In hell he will know that earth is iron mountains knife forests and sword trees He will be ravaged by  iron thorns and by innumerable iron insects and ironbeaked birds and will be run over by iron vehicles with iron nets and caltrops Where are they now The Buddha told āriputra Those who praise the wrong views with false speech abusive speech divisive speech and suggestive speech are colossal thieves not just to one person but to all gods and humans As an analogy thieves have the power to burn a city to the ground and slaughter all the people on the four continents What will the requital for their sins be āriputra replied to the Buddha WorldHonored One each thiefs sins are beyond measure like Mount Sumeru The Buddha told āriputra The requital to such a thief for his sins is not as severe as the requital to one who uses false speech abusive speech divisive speech and suggestive speech to praise the wrong views even for only a moment Buddhas witness the maligners of the Dharma and the hells in the ten directions being born and perishing together Therefore the wise restrain their body and voice Encouragement to Observe the Ten Good Precepts The Buddha told āriputra If there are those who accept and observe the ten good karmas as precepts and destroy the ten evil karmas they will be reborn in Brahma heavens as godkings or will be reborn in this world as WheelTurning Kings Transformed by the ten good karmas like water flowing into the ocean of nirvāṇa they will say farewell to the three evil lifepaths forever Those who violate the ten good precepts will fall into immense hells to suffer for innumerable lives āriputra you all should accept and observe the ten good precepts and the karma dharma and destroy the ten evil karmas At that time āriputra and the multitude having heard the Buddhas words rejoiced and reverently carried out the teachings Thus have I heard At one time the Buddha dwelt in the Jeta Grove r   of Anathapindika in Sravasti together with twelve hundred fifty great bhiksus five hundred bhiksunis one thousand upasakas and five hundred beggars At that time in the assembly an elders son named Sujata asked the Buddha Worldhonored One the six heretical teachers have often preached and taught sentient beings If in the morning one pays reverence to the six directions ones life span and wealth  will increase And why The eastern land belongs to Sakra who protects and helps those who worship him The southern land belongs to Yamaraja who protects and helps those who worship him The western land belongs to Varuna who protects and helps those who worship him The northern land belongs to Kubera who protects and helps those who worship him The lower land belongs to Agni who protects and helps those who worship him The upper land belongs to Vayu who also protects and helps those who worship him Worldhonored One are there also six directions in the BuddhaDharma similar to these The Buddha answered Good son there are also six directions in the BuddhaDharma namely the six perfections The east is the perfection of giving And why It represents the initial daybreak because it brings forth the light of wisdom The east belongs to the minds of sentient beings If sentient beings make offerings to the perfection of giving their life span and wealth will increase The south is the perfection of morality And why The perfection of morality represents the right side Anyone who makes offerings to it can also increase his life span and wealth The west is the Chapter I perfection of endurance And why The west is to the back which symbolizes that all bad dharmas are left behind Anyone who makes offerings to it can also increase his life span and wealth The north is the perfection of vigor And why The north symbol izes overcoming bad dharmas Anyone who makes offerings to it c can also increase his life span and wealth The lower direction is the perfection of meditation And why can properly observe the three evil realms Anyone who makes offerings to it can also increase his life span and wealth The upper direction is the perfection of wisdom And why The upper direc tion symbolizes the unsurpassed Because of its unsurpassability if one makes offerings to it one can increase ones life span and wealth Good son the six directions belong to the minds of sentient beings These are not the same as the teachings of the six heretical teachers Who can make offerings to these six directions Good son only bodhisattvas can make offerings to them Worldhonored One what is meant by a bodhisattva One who has attained enlightenment is called a bodhi sattva One who has the nature of enlightenment is called a bodhisattva the Buddha answered Worldhonored One if one who has attained enlighten ment is called a bodhisattva how can he be called a bodhisattva before he makes offerings to these six directions If one who has the nature of enlightenment is called a bodhisattva then who has the nature If one who has the nature can make offerings one who has no such nature cannot Therefore the Tathagata cannot say that the six directions belong to the minds of sentient beings Good son it is not because of the attainment of enlightenment that one is called a bodhisattva And why One who has attained enlightenment is a Buddha Before the attainment of enlighten ment one is a bodhisattva Likewise it is not because of the nature that one is called a bodhisattva Good son all sentient beings do not have the nature of enlightenment just as they do not have the nature of a human god lion tiger wolf dog On the Assembly and so forth It is due to the combination of the causes and conditions of various good karmas in the present life that one becomes a human or a god And it is through the combination of the causes and conditions of bad karmas that one is bom as an animal such as a lion The same is true with a bodhisattva It is through the combination of various good karmas and the arousal of the aspiration for enlightenment that one is called a bodhi sattva To say that all sentient beings possess a bodhisattva nature is not correct And why If one possesses this nature one does not have to cultivate good karma by making offerings to the six directions Good son if one has this nature one neither brings forth the initial resolve to seek enlightenment nor gives rise to the thought of withdrawing It is by the arousal of the aspiration for enlightenment caused by immeasurable good karma that one is said to have a bodhisattva nature Good son some sentient beings arouse the aspiration for enlightenment because they have followed the heretics but find that they do not like their perverted teachings Some sentient beings arouse the aspiration for enlightenment through internally good causes and conditions developed from dwelling in a quiet place Or sentient beings arouse the aspiration for enlightenment because they see the faults of cyclic existence Or sentient beings arouse the aspiration for enlightenment because they see unwhole someness and hear unwholesomeness Or sentient beings arouse the aspiration for enlightenment because they know very well and reproach themselves for their own greed desires hatred stupidity and stinginess Or sentient beings arouse the aspira tion for enlightenment because they have seen heretics skilled in the five kinds of supernatural power Or sentient beings arouse the aspiration for enlightenment because they wish to know if the world is limited or limitless Or sentient beings arouse the aspira tion for enlightenment because they have seen and heard of the inconceivability of the Tathagata Or sentient beings arouse the aspiration for enlightenment because they have pity and compas sion Or sentient beings arouse the aspiration for enlightenment because they have love for sentient beings Chapter I  a Good son there are three levels of aspiration for enlighten ment namely superior medium and inferior If sentient beings are said to have a definite nature how can there be three levels Inferior sentient beings may seek medium aspirations medium sentient beings may seek superior aspirations superior sentient beings may seek medium aspirations and medium sentient beings may seek inferior aspirations If sentient beings diligently culti vate measureless good deeds they can progress if they do not cultivate diligently they will backslide If they progressively prac tice the good this is not retrogressing If they do not progressively practice this is retrogressing Not retrogressing means to cul tivate the good at all times for sentient beings everywhere other wise it is retrogressing If so the bodhisattva will have thoughts of retreating and of fear One who cultivates good dharmas at all times for all sentient beings attains nonretrogression This is why I prophesied that Mahoraga would soon attain unsurpassed right perfect enlightenment Good son the three levels of enlightenment do not have a definite nature otherwise those who were determined to seek the fruition of a sravaka or a pratyekabuddha could not arouse the aspiration for enlightenment Good son just as the Sangha has no definite nature neither do these three levels  Anyone who claims to have a fixed nature is a heretic And why For example Isvaradeva denies both cause and effect Good son if anyone claims that the bodhisattva nature is like the nature of gold which definitely exists in the nugget and manifests the function of gold through skillful refining this is a Brahmanic saying And why The Brahman often claims that in the seed of nyagrodha there is the nyagrodha tree and that in the eye there are fire and pebbles Therefore the Brahman admits neither cause nor effect The cause is just the effect and the effect is just the cause The seed of nyagrodha is replete with nyagrodha treesthis is the Brahmanic theory of cause and effect However it is not correct And why Cause is subtle and effect is coarse If they say that there is definitely fire in the eye the eye will On the Assembly b certainly be burned How can the eye see if it is burned If the eye has pebbles in it the pebbles will certainly shade the eye If the eye is shaded how can it see Good son the Brahman says that whatever exists remains existing and whatever does not exist remains nonexistent Non existence does not come to exist and existence should not become extinct If the nature of gold is said to exist in the nugget gold cannot be said to be the nature and the nature cannot be said to be gold Good son through causal conditions there is unity And because of the unity of conditions what is originally nonexistent comes to exist The Brahman holds that nonexistence always remains nonexistent When gold is mixed with mercury gold is ruined claims that things never become ruined To say that sentient beings possess is heretical not Buddhist Good son just as through the unity of causal conditions of stone the function of gold comes into being so does the bodhisattva nature When sentient beings have the thought that can be called a wishing mind through the cause and condition of this wishful thought for good karma they arouse aspirations for enlighten ment This is what is meant by bodhisattva nature Good son just as sentient beings are originally devoid of enlightenment which is realized later so it is with the bodhi sattva nature which is originally nonexistent but comes into being later Therefore it cannot be said definitely to exist Good son anyone who seeks great wisdom is called a bodhisattva Because he wishes to know the truth of all dharmas and is greatly adorned because his mind is fortified and he saves many sentient beings and because he does not spare his own life he is called a bodhisattva who practices the Mahayana Good son there are two types of bodhisattvas retrogress ing and nonretrogressing One who has cultivated the deeds the thirtytwo excellent marks is a nonretrogress ing bodhisattva The ordained bodhisattva who keeps completely and purely the Chapter I eight cardinal precepts is called a nonretrogressing bodhisattva and the lay bodhisattva who keeps purely the six major precepts is also called nonretrogressing Good son the blessings and virtues that the heretic gains by severing desires are superior to those gained by all sentient beings in the desire realm A streamenterer is superior to all heretics with different views A oncereturner is superior to all streamenterers A nonretumer is superior to all oncereturners and an arhat is superior to all nonretumers A pratyekabuddha is superior to all arhats A lay person who arouses the aspiration for enlightenment is superior to all pratyekabuddhas It is not difficult for an ordained person to arouse the aspiration for enlightenment but it is inconceiv able for a lay person to arouse the aspiration for enlightenment And why Lay people are bound by more unfavorable conditions When a lay person arouses the aspiration for enlightenment the Four Heavenly Kings and also kings in the Akanistha and other heavens pleasantly and with great surprise exclaim Now we have a teacher of men and gods  Chapter II On Arousing the Aspiration for Enlightenment Sujata asked the Buddha How do sentient beings arouse the aspiration for enlightenment Good son one arouses the aspiration for enlightenment for two reasons Good son there are five deeds that arouse the aspiration for enlightenment drawing close to beneficial friends eliminat ing hateful thoughts following teachers instructions bring ing forth compassionate thoughts and diligently and vigorously practicing Again there are five deeds not seeing others faults although seeing others faults not becoming discouraged not becoming arrogant after performing good deeds not becoming jealous of others good deeds and seeing all sentient beings as ones only child Good son after having aroused the aspiration for enlighten ment intelligent people can destroy the result of bad karmas as Mount Sumeru Intelligent people arouse the aspiration for enlightenment for three reasons they have seen sentient beings in the five periods of the decay of an existing kalpa its deterioration the arising of views the prevalence of passions the increase of human misery and the diminution of the human life span in the unwholesome world they have seen that the Tathagata possesses inconceivable spiritual powers and they have heard the eight kinds of wonderful sounds of the Buddha Tathagata Again there are two reasons one clearly realizes that ones body suffers and one realizes that when sentient beings suffer it is as if one oneself were suffering Good son if a person can arouse the aspiration for enlightenment you should know that he is able to pay reverence to the six directions and to increase his span of life and wealth This is not like what the heretics teach Chapter III On Compassion Sujata asked Worldhonored One those six heretical teachers do not teach cause and effect The Tathagata teaches that there are two kinds of cause the producing cause and the revealing cause Is the initial aspiration for enlightenment which the Buddha teaches a producing or a revealing cause Good son as regards sentient beings I may proclaim one cause two causes three causes four causes five causes six or seven causes or up to twelve causes The one cause would refer to the producing cause Two causes would refer to the producing and revealing causes Three causes would refer to affiliation karma io  a and capacity Four causes would refer to the four elements Five causes would refer to the five links of future life Six causes would refer to the six causes explained in the sutras Seven causes are those as explained in the Lotus Sutra Eight causes are the eight links in the present life Nine causes are explained in the Ta cheng ching Ten causes are those explained for upasaka Mana Eleven causes are those explained in the Chihyin  Twelve causes would refer to the twelve links of causes and conditions Good son there are immeasurable and boundless causes of all defiled karma and there are also immeasurable and boundless causes for the undefiled dharmas Intelligent people arouse aspira tions for enlightenment in order to comprehend them Therefore the Tathagata is the one with all wisdom Good son sentient beings who arouse the aspiration for enlight enment are caused by producing causes or by revealing causes or by both Now you should know that the producing cause denotes Chapter III great compassion Because of compassion one can bring forth the aspiration  therefore the compassionate mind is a producing cause Worldhonored One how does one cultivate compassionate thought Good son an intelligent person deeply perceives that all sentient beings are sunk in the great afflictive sea of birth and death Again he arouses compassion because he sees that sentient beings do not have the ten powers the four fearlessnesses great compassion or the three mindfulnesses and he wonders how to help them perfect these virtues Again he arouses compassion because he sees sentient beings going astray from the proper path and having no guide Again he arouses compassion because he sees sentient beings who lie in the mud of the five desires but cannot get out and still indulge themselves Again he arouses compassion because he sees that sentient beings are always bound by their wealth wives and children and cannot renounce them Again he arouses compassion because he sees that sentient beings become arrogant about their appearance Again he arouses compas sion because he sees that although sentient beings fall into the realm of existence and undergo suffering they still take delight in it Again he arouses compassion because he sees that sentient beings transmigrate indefinitely in the five cycles of existence Again he arouses compassion because he sees that sentient beings fear birth old age and death and yet they create karma leading to birth old age and death Again he arouses compassion because he sees sentient beings undergoing suffering in body and mind and yet creating more karma Again he arouses compassion because he sees that sentient beings suffer departing from loved ones and yet do not cut off attachment to them Good son an intelligent person should contemplate that the happiness of samadhi in the heaven of neither thinking nor non thinking is like the suffering of the hells which is shared by all beings He can then arouse compassion Good son to contemplate like this before attaining the way is called compassion After attaining the way it is called great com passion And why Although one may contemplate like this before attaining the way the contemplation is limited and so are sentient beings After attaining the way the contemplations and sentient c beings are all boundless Therefore it is called great compassion Before attaining the way compassionate thought wavers there fore it is called compassion After attaining the way it does not waver therefore it is called great compassion Before attaining the way one cannot save and help all sentient beings therefore this is called compassion After attaining the way one can greatly save andhelp therefore it is called great compassion Before attaining the way one does not practice with wisdom therefore On Compassion it is called compassion After attaining the way one practices with wisdom and it is called great compassion Good son although an intelligent person when practicing compassion cannot eliminate the afflictions of sentient beings this person has already achieved immeasurable benefits Good son compassionate thought is the producing cause of the six perfections Good son there are two types of bodhisattvas And why Lay people have more unfavorable conditions Good son if lay people do not cultivate compassion they cannot attain the upasaka precepts After cultivating compas sion they will attain  Good son ordained people can perfect only five perfections but cannot perfect the perfection of giving And why Hence lay people should first cultivate compassion If they cultivate compassion they will perfect morality endurance vigor meditation and wisdom Cultivating compas sionate thoughts one can give what is difficult to give endure what is difficult to endure and do what is difficult to do Therefore compassion is the basis of all good dharmas Good son if a person can cultivate compassionate thought like this he can destroy bad karma as large as Mount Sumeru and will soon attain unsur passed perfect enlightenment He will gain rewards as great as Mount Sumeru even from a little good karma Chapter IV On Liberation Good son if a good son or daughter cultivates compassion he or she will attain all the essence of the Dharma and liberation Sujata asked Worldhonored One what is meant by essence Good son it denotes the body speech and mind The body speech and mind are attained through skillful means There are two kinds of skillful means hearing and thinking giving keeping precepts and hear ing much  Sujata asked Worldhonored One the Buddha has said that liberation is attained through three kinds of skillful means Are ioa these three skillful means a definite number No good son And why Although someone might give immeas urable wealth to innumerable beings through innumerable lives he still could not obtain the way to liberation But someone might just once give a handful of flour to a beggar and thereby perceive the way to liberation Someone might keep precepts at the places of innumerable Buddhas and still not attain the way to liberation Someone might keep the eight precepts for one day and night and thereby attain the way to liberation Someone might uphold read and recite the twelve divisions of the scriptures at the places of infinite Buddhas for infinite lives and still not attain the way to liberation But someone might be able to attain the way to libera tion by reading only a fourline verse And why Sentient beings minds are different Good son if one cannot singlemindedly per ceive the faults of samsara and the happiness of nirvana although he might practice giving keep precepts and hear much of the Dharma he will never attain the way to liberation If one loathes Chapter IV the faults of samsara and perceives deeply the virtue and happi ness of nirvana although he might give just a little keep a few precepts and hear a little he can attain the way to liberation Good son one who attains the way during the three periods of time or at the time of a Buddha or a pratyekabuddha or at the time of neither  or when the heavenly king of Akanistha speaks of liberation will attain libera tion upon hearing Good son when I first aroused the aspiration for enlighten ment in the past I did not come across any Buddhas or pratyeka buddhas When I heard Suddhavasudeva speak of liberation however I aroused the aspiration for enlightenment Good son such a dharma cannot be attained by those in the realm of desire And why Because they are lax Nor can it be attained by those in the form realm And why They do not have the three skill ful means Also it cannot be attained by those in the formless realm because they lack body and speech The essence of the Dharma lies in body speech and mind People living in Uttarakuru cannot attain it either And why They do not possess the three kinds of skillful means Three types of beings can attain the way to liberation namely sravakas pratyekabuddhas and bodhisattvas If sentient beings encounter beneficial friends they can turn the liberation of the sravaka to that of the pratyekabuddha and the liberation of the pratyekabuddha to that of the bodhisattva The bodhisattvas way to liberation cannot be reversed or destroyed Sujata asked Worldhonored One how can a Dharma preacher clearly distinguish between those who possess the way to libera b tion and those who do not possess it Good son two kinds of people attain it namely lay and ordained people who listen attentively to the Dharma and uphold the way after listening to it On Liberation Good son even if the heretic attains the samddhi of neither perception nor nonperception with a life span infinite kalpas long if he fails to attain the way to liberation he should be regarded as a being in hell If a person falls into the Avici hell and undergoes great suffering for infinite kalpas but attains the way to liberation he should be regarded as a being in nirvana Therefore good son I feel pity for Udraka Ramaputra but do not feel pity for Devadatta  Sariputra for example had sought enlightenment for sixty thou sand kalpas but retrogressed because he had not attained the way to liberation However his endowment is still superior to that of pratyekabuddhas Good son the Dharma has three levels namely superior medium and inferior Inferior refers to a sravaka medium to a pratyekabuddha and superior to a Buddha Some ordained people might seek the precepts of bhiksus and bhiksurus practice them as heard for measureless lives and still fail to attain them And why Because they have not attained the way to liberation There fore this can only be called cultivating precepts not keeping precepts Good son if the bodhisattva attains the way to liberation he will not create the karma that leads to rebirth in the desire form or formless realms He always wishes to be born in the place where he can benefit sentient beings If he knows that he has created the karma for rebirth in the heavens he will transfer it to take rebirth as a human Karma refers to giving morality and meditation Good son if the sravaka or pratyeka buddha attains the way to liberation he will become liberated in less than three lives The bodhisattva mahdsattva who has attained the way to liberation will never retrogress during meas ureless lives His nonretrogressive thought surpasses that of all sravakas and pratyekabuddhas Good son if one attains the way to liberation one attains immeasurable fruition even from a little practice of giving The same is true with a little practice of morality and hearing the Dharma If this person dwells in the three evil realms he does not Chapter IV have to suffer as other beings do If the bodhisattva attains the way to liberation he reaches the stage of regulating Why is it called c the stage of regulating Because all the afflictions are gradually weakened It may also be called going against the current Good son there are four types of people those who follow the current of samsara those who go against the current of samsara those who neither follow nor go against the current and those who reach the other shore Good son for the sravaka this dharma is called the ground of regulating For the bodhi sattva it is called both the ground of regulating and the ground of joy Why is it called the ground of joy Because one does not retrogress after hearing  A bodhisattva is one who can always awaken the minds of sentient beings Although such a bodhisattva understands nonBuddhist texts he does not follow them or teach them to others Such a bodhisattva cannot be called a human or a god He does not traverse the five realms of a human god and so forth This is called cultivating the way of nonobstruction Good son enlightenment has four seeds When an intelligent person cultivates enlightenment he should always practice these five deeds There are six ways to grow the seeds of enlightenment namely from the perfection of giving to the perfection of wisdom These six perfections increase through one thing that is not being lax If the bodhisattva is lazy he cannot increase these six practices If he is not he can On Liberation a Good son there are four practices for the bodhisattva seeking enlightenment being near beneficial friends having a strong and indestructible mind being able to do what is diffi cult and having compassion for sentient beings Another four practices are being happy when others gain benefit always taking delight in praising others virtues always being joyful when practicing the six recollections and diligently speaking about the faults of samsara Good son it is impossible to realize enlightenment without these eight practices Good son at the first time the bodhisattva arouses the unsur passed aspiration for enlightenment he becomes an unsurpassed field of blessings because he has surpassed all things and sentient beings in the world Good son someone might say that although there are innumerable Buddhas in innumerable worlds Buddhahood is very difficult to realize And why The worlds are bound less and so are sentient beings Sentient beings are boundless and so are Buddhas If Buddhahood were easy to realize one Buddha should be able to save all sentient beings If so worlds and sentient beings would have a limit Good son when one Buddha is born in the world he can liberate ninetynine nayutas of people and one nayuta of sravakas but not all sentient beings Hence in the sravaka sutras I say that Buddhas do not exist in the ten directions And why It is from fear that sentient beings might slight the Buddha path The holy path of all Buddhas is not in the domain of this world What the Tathagata says is not false The Tathagata the Worldhonored One is not jealous Good son innumerable sentient beings arouse aspirations for enlightenment but not all of them can ultimately practice the way of the bodhisattva Someone might ask If there are innumerable Buddhas in the present why is it that the sutras only say that there are innumerable Buddhas in the past and future but not in the present Good son I say that in one world there are Buddhas as many as the grains of sand in the Ganges in the past and future Chapter IV and only one Buddha in the present Good son one who com prehends the true meaning can attain Buddhahood Although innumerable sentient beings cultivate the way of the Buddha many of them retrogress If a person is able to achieve Buddha hood he is as as the udumbara flower and the spawn of the fish Good son there are two kinds of bodhisattvas It is not difficult for the ordained bodhisattva to attain the way to liberation but it is difficult for the lay bodhi sattva And why Because the lay bodhisattva is bound by more unfavorable conditions Chapter V On Three Kinds of Enlightenm ent Sujata asked Worldhonored One the Buddha has said that there are two kinds of bodhisattvas lay and ordained There are three kinds of enlightenment the enlightenment of the sravakas pratyekabuddhas and Buddhas If one who attains enlightenment is called a Buddha why is it that sravakas and pratyekabuddhas are not called Buddhas If one who realizes the Dharma nature is called a Buddha why is it that sravakas and pratyekabuddhas who also realize the Dharma nature are not called Buddhas If one who has all wisdom is a Buddha why is it that the sravakas and pratyekabuddhas who also have all wisdom are not Buddhas Because the sravaka realizes enlightenment from hearing he is not called a Buddha Those with the pratyekabuddha nature who attain partial enlightenment after reflecting are therefore called pratyekabuddhas The Tathagata does not have a teacher and does not rely on hearing and reflecting he is enlightened to everything by practice therefore he is called a Buddha Good son one who comprehends the Dharma nature is a Buddha There are two kinds of Dharma nature one of general characteristics and one of particular characteristics The sravaka comprehends only the general characteristics and therefore can not be called a Buddha The pratyekabuddha comprehends the general characteristics not from hearing  and therefore is called a pratyekabuddha rather than a Buddha The Chapter V Tathagata the Worldhonored One comprehends all general and particular characteristics does not depend on hearing and reflect ing and becomes enlightened solely through practice without the help of a teacher therefore he is called a Worldhonored One a Buddha Good son the Tathagata the Worldhonored One has per fected wisdom Although srdvakas and pratyekabuddhas compre hend the Four Noble Truths they have not perfected wisdom Therefore they are not Buddhas The Tathagata the Worldhonored One who has perfected wisdom is called a Buddha Good son three kinds of animals can cross over the Ganges namely the rabbit the horse and the fragrant elephant The rabbit does not have to touch the bottom of the river in order to swim over the horse may or may not touch the bottom and the elephant touches the bottom the water of the Ganges represents the twelve links of causes and conditions When the sravaka crosses over he is like the rabbit When thepratyekabuddha crosses over he is like the horse And when the Tathagata crosses over he is like the fragrant elephant Therefore the Tathagata is called a Buddha Although the sravaka and the pratyekabuddha sever their afflic tions they do not sever their habits  The Tathagata has pulled out the roots of all afflictions and habits and therefore is a Buddha Good son there are two kinds of doubts afflictive doubts and neutral doubts Those of the two vehicles cut off the afflictive doubts but not the neutral doubts The Tathagata elimi nates both kinds of doubts and therefore is called a Buddha Good son the sravaka becomes tired of hearing much and the pratyeka buddha becomes weary of reflecting but the Buddha never tires in regard to these two kinds of thought and is therefore called a Buddha Good son for example when clean food is kept in a clean container both outside and inside are clean Although the wis dom o f the sravaka and pratyekabuddha is pure the containers are not This is not so with the Tathagata in whom both wisdom and the container are pure and therefore he is called a Buddha On Three Kinds of Enlightenment Good son there are two kinds of purity purity of wisdom and purity of practice Although the sravaka and pratyekabuddha have purity of wisdom their practice is not pure Both the Tathagatas wisdom and his practice are pure and he is therefore called a Buddha Good son the practice of the sravaka and pratyekabuddha is limited but the practice of the Tathagata the Worldhonored One has no limit therefore he is called a Buddha Good son in one thought the Tathagata the Worldhonored One can destroy two obstructions the obstruction to wisdom and the obstruction to liberation Therefore he is called a Buddha The Tathagata is ioc replete with the causes and results of wisdom and he is therefore called a Buddha He does not conceal anything does not need protection and is unsurpassed in eloquence He knows all the afflictions of sentient beings the causes for the formation of afflic tions and the causes for their destruction The Tathagata cannot be tainted by the eight worldly dharmas and has great compassion to secure from suffering He has perfected the ten powers the four fearlessnesses the three mindfulnesses and great com passion Good son in the Trayastrimsa Heaven there is a large city named Sudarsana It is a hundred thousand miles in width and has millions of palaces and ten million six hundred sixtysix thousand six hundred sixtysix gods During the three summer months when Indra wants to take a pleasure trip to the Paricitra grove at Mount Yugamdhara a fragrant elephant with seven heads named Airavana will be known and appear as soon as Indra has the thought The gods in Sudarsana will accompany by riding on Airavanas heads The grove is fifty yojanas from the city The strength of this elephant surpasses that of all fragrant elephants Only the combined strength of eighteen thousand fra grant elephants such as this one can match the strength of one Chapter V finger of the Buddha Therefore the strength of the Buddhas body surpasses that of all sentient beings Just as the worlds are boundless so are sentient beings The mindpower o f the Tathagata is also boundless Hence only the Tathagata is called a Buddha Those of the two vehicles are not called Buddhas Therefore the Tathagata is called an unsurpassed teacher a great person a guiding fragrant elephant a lion and dragonking among men a great captain a great doctor a king of great oxen an oxking among men and a pure lotus He becomes enlightened all on his own without a teacher and is the eye for sentient bemgs He is a great giver a great sramana and Brahman one who keeps serene follows precepts diligently practices reaches the other shore and attains liberation Good son although srdvakas and pratyekabuddhas are par tially enlightened they do not have all these virtues Therefore one is called a Buddha Good son there are two kinds of bodhisattvas It is not difficult for the ordained bodhisattva to distinguish these three kinds o f enlightenment but it is difficult for the lay bodhisattva And why Because the lay bodhisattva is bound by more unfavorable conditions Chapter VI On Cultivating the Thirtytwo Marks Sujata asked Worldhonored One according to what the Buddha has taught when does the power of the bodhisattvas body become perfected The Buddha replied Good son it is at the time when one a initially cultivates the karma for the thirtytwo marks Good son at the time when one cultivates such karma one is called a bodhisattva He attains two samadhis the samadhi of enlightenment and the samadhi of cyclic existence There are two other kinds of samadhi the samadhi of knowing previous lives and the samadhi that arouses the cause for proper Dharma Good son during the time when the bodhisattva cultivates the thirtytwo marks up to the realization of unsurpassed perfect enlightenment he has heard much without get ting weary The bodhisattva mahasattva cultivates each and every mark and adorns it with one hundred kinds of blessings and virtues fifty from cultivating the mind and fifty from perfecting the mind These are the one hundred blessings and virtues Good son the blessings and virtues of all the worlds are not equal to those in one of the Buddhas hairpores All the blessings and virtues in one of the Buddhas hairpores are not equal to those of one secondary mark of the Buddha The blessings and virtues of all the eighty secondary marks are not equal to those of one primary mark of the Buddha The blessings and virtues of all marks are not equal to those of the mark of the tuft of white hair  which in turn is not equal to those of the invisible mark on the head  Chapter VI Good son the bodhisattva always greatly benefits sentient beings during innumerable kalpas and earnestly and diligently does all good deeds Therefore the Tathagata perfects innumerable virtues The thirtytwo marks are the rewarding result of great compassion Although a universal monarch also has these marks they are not as perfect It is actions of body speech and mind that result in these marks It is not in heaven nor in Uttarakuru but in the other three continents that one cultivates these marks It is in a male body not a female body that one attains these marks When a bodhisattva mahasattva practices these deeds for three asamkhya kalpas he will then attain unsurpassed perfect enlighten ment Good son formerly I fulfilled the first asamkhya kalpa at the place of Ratnasikhin Buddha the second asamkhya kalpa at the b place of Dipankara Buddha and the third asamkhya kalpa at the place of Kasyapa Buddha   Good son formerly at the place of Sakyamuni Buddha I aroused the initial aspiration for the unsurpassed perfect enlight enment After arousing the aspiration I made offerings to innu merable Buddhas as many as the grains of sand in the Ganges River planted roots of virtue cultivated the way kept precepts progressed vigorously and heard much Good son after the bodhi sattva mahasattva cultivates the deeds for the thirtytwo marks he clearly knows that he will definitely attain perfect enlighten ment just as he sees clearly the mango fruit in his hand Although the marks are fixed the time sequence of cultivating them is not necessarily so It is said that the Tathagata first obtained the mark of eyelashes that resemble those of a bullking And why When still a bodhisattva in innumerable lives he delightfully looked at sentient beings with kind eyes therefore he first gained the mark of eyelashes that resemble those of a bullking  Or it is said that the Tathagata first gained the mark of eight kinds of pure voices and then the other marks And why While still a bodhisattva for innumerable lives he always taught sen tient beings with gentle and true words therefore he first gained On Cultivating the Thirtytwo Marks the mark of the eight kinds of pure voices Or it is said that the Tathagata gained the invisible mark on the head and then game the other marks And why While still a bodhisattva for innumer able lives he made offerings to teachers prostrated to Buddhas and bodhisattvas and hence broke his arrogance Therefore he first gained the invisible mark on the head and then the other mar s Or it is said that the Tathagata first gained the mark of a tuft of white hair and then the others And why While still a bodhi sattva for innumerable lives he did not deceive sentient beings therefore he first attained the mark of a tuft of white hair between the eyebrows Good son except for the Buddha the Worldhonored One there is no one who can tell the deeds for gaining such marks Good son it is said that the Tathagata first obtained the mark of level feet and then the others And why While still a bodhi sattva for innumerable lives he practiced giving and kept pre cepts and his mind did not waver when practicing the way Therefore he first obtained the mark of level feet After gaining this mark he obtained the mark of images of wheels on the soles of his feet And why While still a bodhisattva for innumerable lives he made offerings to parents teachers an beneficial friends and he properly supported and protected all sentient beings therefore he attained the mark of images of wheels on the soles of his feet and fingers After this mark he then attained the mark of long slender fingers And why While still a bodhisattva for immeasurable lives with the most sincere thought he kept the first and fourth upasaka precepts therefore he attained the mark of long slender fingers and then the mark of long legs After attaining these marks he then attained the mark of full shoulders And why While still a bodhisattva he accepted the teachings and instructions of teachers parents and beneficia friends therefore he attained the mark of full shoulders After attaining this mark he then attained the mar o webbed hands and feet And why While still a bodhisattva he took in sentient beings with the four allembracing virtues there fore he attained the mark of webbed hands and feet Chapter VI After attaining this mark he then attained the mark of soft and tender hands and feet And why While still a bodhisattva for immeasurable lives he rubbed by hand and washed the bodies of is teachers and parents He cleansed them of dirt and applied fragrant oils therefore he attained the marks of soft and tender hands and feet After attaining this mark he attained the mark of body hair that stands upward And why While still a bodhisattva or immeasurable lives he always taught sentient beings and had them practice giving morality and all the other wholesome dharmas  therefore he attained the mark o f body hair that stands upward  c After attaining this mark he attained the mark of graceful legs resembling those of an antelope And why While still a bodhisattva for immeasurable lives he sincerely listened to and spoke of the Dharma so as to destroy the faults of samsaratherefore he attained the mark of graceful legs resembling those of an antelope After attaining this mark he then obtained the mark of a broad and round body like a nyagrodha tree And why While still a bodhisattva for immeasurable lives he always gave away medicine to all sentient beings therefore he attained the mark of a broad and round body like a nyagrodha tree After attaining this mark he attained the mark of hands reaching below the knees And why While still a bodhisattva he never cheated sages parents teachers or beneficial friends Therebre lie attained the mark o f hands reaching below the knees After attaining this mark he attained the mark of well con cealed sexual organs like the elephant and the horse And why le still a bodhisattva for immeasurable lives when he saw ose m fear he saved and protected them He had a sense of shame and remorse did not speak of others faults and covered others faults well therefore he attained the mark o f well con cealed sexual organs After attaining this mark he attained the mark o f a soft body with one hair m each hairpore And why While still a bodhi sattva for immeasurable lives he drew near the wise took delight On Cultivating the Thirtytwo Marks in hearing and discussing  and after hearing he practiced with delight He happily built roads and removed thorns therefore he attained the mark of soft skin with one hair in each follicle After attaining this mark he attained the mark of a goldenhued body And why While still a bodhisattva for immeasurable lives he always gave away houses bedding food and lamps to sentient beings therefore he attained the mark of a goldenhued body After attaining this mark he attained the mark of seven round protuberances on his body And why While still a bodhi sattva for immeasurable lives he did not give rise to hateful thoughts to what is detestable He happily gave sentient beings whatever they wished therefore he attained the mark of seven round protuberances on his body After attaining this mark he attained the mark of a round jaw And why While still a bodhisattva for immeasurable lives he was able to distinguish good from bad His speech was without error and he did not utter any injustices He always spoke of acceptable dharmas and did not falsely propagate unacceptable ones therefore he attained the mark of a full jaw After attaining this mark he then attained two marks And why While still a bodhisattva for immeasurable lives he himself did not speak deceitfully nor teach others to do so therefore he attained these two marks After attaining these marks he attained three marks forty teeth very white teeth and no gaps between the teeth And why While still a bodhisattva for immeasurable lives he taught the ten good dharmas to sentient beings whose minds were full of joy after accepting the dharmas and he always happily praised the virtues of others therefore he attained these three marks a After attaining these marks he attained the mark of four pure white canine teeth And why While still a bodhisattva for immeasurable lives he cultivated the good dharmas of compassion and joyful thought in the desire realm therefore he attained the mark of four pure white canine teeth Chapter VT After attaining this mark he attained the mark of possessing a  rrC S  s r tongue And why While still a hndh

sattva for immeasurable lives he saw dear o n e  d en  equal badness and compassion therefore he attained the mark of dark blue eyes resembling those of a bull    After attaining this mark he attained the mark of a tuft of white hair between the eyebrows And why While still a h h sattva for unmeasurable lives he proclaimed i T p r  D h a  tr S S S S i s a a s s s s s  lay and y S b Und by  unfavorableChapter VII On M aking Vows b Sujata asked Worldhonored One who can accomplish these thirtytwo marks The Buddha replied Good son the intelligent ones can Worldhonored One who is an intelligent one Good son an intelligent one is someone who can make unsur passed vows After the bodhisattva mahasattva arouses the aspira tion for enlightenment he is willing to share with sentient beings the good karma of body speech and mind for their eventual attainment of realization The bodhisattva mahasattva always keeps near Buddhas sravakas pratyekabuddhas and beneficial friends He makes offerings pays reverence and consults them about the profound Dharma which he keeps without mistake He makes this vow Now I keep near the Buddhas sravakas pratyekabuddhas and beneficial friends If sentient beings with vicious thoughts beat scold or injure my body I vow that I shall all the more increase compassionate thoughts and not give rise to malicious thoughts I vow that wherever I am reborn I shall not take rebirth as a woman as one without sexual organs or with both male and female sexual organs or as a slave Again I vow to cause my body to have the power of selfmastery so that I can serve others with it and I vow not to cause others to have the power of selfmastery merely in order to serve me I vow to cause the organs of my body to be perfect and to keep away from bad friends not to be born in a bad country or borderland but to be born into a noble family with outstanding physical appearance and great wealth whatever I say the listeners will like to accept it to keep away from obstructions to be without laziness and to leave behind all bad karma of body speech and mind to benefit sentient beings greatly not to care for my own body and life above the needs of others and not to create bad karma for my body and life not to seek for reward when b e g e ttin g sentient beings to take delight always in accepting the twelve divisions o f the scriptures and after accepting them to teach them to others to break sentient beings unwholesome views and bad karma to cure the serious illnesses in the bodies and minds of sentient beings skillfully When I see people separate due to discord to bring them together in harmony Seeing people m fear to save and protect them and after protecting them to speak various dharmas in order to subdue their minds Seeing people m hunger to feed them and keep them from thoughts o greed so that when they eat they feel as if eating grass and leaves to make offerings happily to teachers parents beneficial friends and the virtuous and to be equalminded with regards to both friends and foes always to practice the  mindfillnesses nonself and the twelve hnks of causes and conditions At places without the Three Treasures to stay m quietude and practice kindness and compassion so that sentient beings who see hear and contact me will keep away from afflictions Although a bodhisattva knows that except for enlightenment he must not seek other types of fruition yfet he seeks them anyway in order to benefit sentient beings c Good son if a bodhisattva can make these vows he is an elder with unsurpassed Dharma riches who has sought to be a Dharma king but has not attained it yet Good son if a bodhisattva mahdsattva perfects three deeds e is called an elder with Dharma riches his mind does not take pleasure in the scriptures of the heretics his mind is not attached to the pleasures of samsara and he always likes to On Making Vows make offerings to the Three Treasures the Buddha Dharma and Sangha Again there are another three deeds not having regrets when suffering for others perfecting subtle unsur passed wisdom and not arousing arrogance when perfecting good dharmas i  ia Good son if the bodhisattva can contemplate cause and effect the effect of the cause and the cause o f the effect he can in this way break causes and effects and obtain causes and effects If the bodhisattva can break and obtain causes and effects it is called the effect of the Dharma the king of all dharmas and the selfmastery of them Good son there are two kinds of bodhisattvas lay and ordained It is not difficult for the ordained bodhisattva to make these vows but it is difficult for the lay bodhisattva And why Because the lay bodhisattva is bound by more unfavorable Chapter V ili On the Meaning of Bodhisattva Sujata asked Worldhonored One the Buddha says that there are two kinds of bodhisattvas the bodhisattva in name only and the true bodhisattva What is meant by the bodhisattva in name only Good son a person who has aroused aspirations for enlighten ment is called a bodhisattva in name only if he acts in the following ways He likes to accept the heretics and read their scriptures and then he teaches them to sentient beings He does not like to practice compassion but takes pleasure in samsara and creates all karma for this end He has no faith in the Three Treasures and doubts them Caring for his own body and life he cannot bear insult His speech is coarse and he is hateful and lazy He belittles himself with this thought I cannot attain unsurpassed enlighten ment Burying himself in the afflictions he nourishes a fearful mind He draws close to bad friends is lazy and confused likes to stay ignorant and does not believe in the six perfections Neither does he cultivate blessings nor contemplate birth and death He likes to follow the malicious speech of others Such a person is called a bodhisattva in name only Good son again a sentient being may arouse the aspiration for enlightenment and wish to attain unsurpassed perfect enlight enment but after learning that it will take immeasurable kalpas of ascetic practice to do so he has regrets Although he might practice the way his mind is not sincere He lacks remorse and Chapter V ili compassion He follows the heretics to sacrifice sheep for the worship of gods Although he may have a little faith his mind is not firm For the sake of the five pleasures he will create various evils Relying on his own physical appearance lot and wealth he becomes extremely arrogant What he does is erroneous and unbeneficial Although e practices meditation he does it to prolong his own life Such a person is a bodhisattva in name only A true bodhisattva listens to the profound teachings and likes to be near beneficial friends He likes to make offerings to his iib teachers parents and beneficial friends and to listen to the twelve divisions of the scriptures of the Tathagata For the sake of the Dharma he does not spare his body his life his wife his children or his wealth His mind is firmly compassionate toward all sen tient beings He does not take himself lightly e gives generously without reservation and always likes to sharpen the knife of wisdom Although he has learned the scriptures of the heretics it is to break and surpass their deviant views He knows skillful means to subdue sentient beings and does not become earful in the assembly Often he teaches sentient beings that enlightenment is easy to obtain so that his listeners will not be discouraged He practices diligently and thinks lightly of afflic tions so that he will not be overwhelmed by them He is not indolent and always practices endurance For the sake of the fruition of nirvana he keeps precepts and practices vigorously He is willing to solicit help for and serve sentient beings to make them eel comfortable and happy and does not regret suffering for their sake Seeing others retreat from enlightenment he has compas sion for them He can save sentient beings from various afflictions and sees all the faults and unwholesomeness of samsara He is able to perfect the six unsurpassed perfections and whatever he does surpasses other sentient beings His faith is firm and while e practices kindness and compassion he does not seek reward for On the Meaning of Bodhisattva it With regard to both friends and foes his mind has equanimity He gives equally even when he gives away his own body and life Knowing the character of impermanence he does not spare his body and life Through the four allembracing virtues he embraces sentient beings Comprehending conventional truth he follows their words and when suffering for them his mind is as unmoved as Mount Sumeru Although he sees sentient beings do wrong he never forgets those who do even the smallest good He does not doubt the Three Treasures and likes to make offerings If he has a little wealth he gives first to the poor then to the fields of blessing He does things first for the poor and then for the rich He likes to praise the good in others and skillfully instructs them regarding nirvana He wants others to learn all kinds of skills and seeing those who learn better than himself he is delighted He does not think to benefit himself but always thinks of benefitting others He performs virtuous acts of body speech and mind not for his own sake but for others Such a person is called a true bodhisattva Good son there are two types of bodhisattvas It is not difficult for the ordained bodhisattva to become a true bodhisattva but it is difficult for the lay bodhi sattva And why Because the lay bodhisattva is bound by more unfavorable conditions Chapter IX On the Firm Determination o f a True Bodhisattva Sujata asked Worldhonored One how does a true bodhisattva know that he himself is a true bodhisattva Good son when a bodhisattva mahasattva practices ascetic practices he first disciplines his mind I remember good son when in the past I practiced the bodhisattva way I followed the heretics and sincerely engaged in ascetic practices There was no thought of retrogression in my mind For immeasurable lives I smeared my body with ashes and ate a grain of sesame bean rice and wheat each day I slept on thorns used wood earth and stones as a bed and took the excrement and urine of cattle as medicine During the hot summers I burned my body with five kinds of heat and during the cold winters I applied ice or I ate grass roots stalks and leaves fruit dirt and even the wind Good son formerly I gave away my body and life for four reasons to break the afflictions of sentient beings to cause them to enjoy peace and happiness to eliminate my own attachments to the body and to repay the kindness of my parents who bore and raised me If a bodhisattva does not spare his body and life he definitely knows that he is a true one Good son in the past for the sake of the proper Dharma I cut out my flesh to make three thousand six hundred lamps At that time I was still full of afflictions and thus felt pain throughout my body For the sake of saving sentient beings I fortified my mind so Chapter IX that I would not retreat At that time I perfected three deeds to be ultimately without retrogression to be a true bodhisattva and to be inconceivable These are the inconceivabilities of a bodhisattva Again in the past for the sake of the proper Dharma I underwent pain for a kalpa from thousands of sores all over my body At that time I was still full of afflictions and thus felt pain but in order to save sentient beings I fortified my mind so that I would not retreat This is what is meant by the inconceivability of a bodhisattva Again in the past I gave up my body for the sake of one pigeon At that time I was still full of afflictions and thus felt pain but in order to save sentient beings I fortified my mind so that I would not retreat This is what is meant by the incon ceivability of a bodhisattva Good son all bad friends and afflictive karma are nothing but companions that adorn the bodhisattva path And why Common people lack wisdom and right thoughts therefore they take afflic tions as foes But the bodhisattva has wisdom and right thoughts and therefore takes afflictions as well as bad friends and karma as a religious companions Good son after severing the afflictions one will no longer take rebirth on a path of unwholesome ways there fore the bodhisattva may manifest bad karma when it is actually not a bad action of body speech or mind Through the power of his vow he may take rebirth as a ferocious beast in order to subdue the beasts Although the bodhisattva manifests himself by taking the form of a beast he deeply understands peoples speech the words of the Dharma and true words he does not use coarse or unwholesome speech nor meaningless words His mind is always compassionate and he cultivates and accumulates kindness and compassion without laziness This is called the inconceivability of a bodhisattva Good son in the past when I took the form of a bear although I was filled with afflictions afflictions had no mastering power over me And why I had right thoughts At the time I pitied sentient beings protected the proper Dharma and cultivated On the Firm Determination of a True Bodhisattva Dharma practices I was born as a lizard a tawny monkey a rabbit a serpent a dragon an elephant a garuda a pigeon a deer a monkey a goat a chicken a peacock a parrot and also a shrimp When I took the forms of these animals although I was full of afflictions the afflictions had no mastering power over me And why I had proper thoughts I had pity for sentient beings pro tected the proper Dharma and cultivated the Dharma practice Good son at a time of famine I made a great vow Through the power of the vow I took the form of a large fish in order to help sentient beings who were hungry and thirsty Those who ate me could cultivate the way ponder it and be free from unwholesome ness At the time of an epidemic I again made a great vow Through the power of this vow I took the form of a medicine tree When the sick saw heard or touched me or ate my skin blood flesh bone or marrow they were cured Good son a bodhisattva mahasattva who undergoes sufferings like these and does not retreat is called a true bodhisattva W hen a bodhisattva practices the six perfections he does not desire the fruit Rather he cares only about sentient beings The bodhisattva knows well the faults of samsara therefore he takes delight in benefitting sentient beings and making them happy The bodhisattva knows the happiness of liberation and yet he is able to dwell in samsara This is the inconceivability of a bodhisattva The bodhisattva does not seek reward from what he does yet he always repays favors he receives Good son all sentient beings always seek to benefit themselves but the bodhisattva always benefits others This is the inconceivability of a bodhisattva The bodhisattva mahasattva is full of afflictions and yet he benefits equally both friends and foes This is the inconceivability of a bodhisattva Good son when heretics convert sentient beings they may use malicious speech beat them or scold them and in these ways subdue them The bodhisattva does not do these things When he teaches sentient beings he does not use coarse or filthy language angry words or sexual talk but gentle and true words When sentient beings hear his words they are like the green lotus greeting the moon and the red lotus greeting the sun Chapter IX b Good son although the bodhisattva has little wealth to give when he sees many people coming for help he does not feel distaste When the bodhisattva teaches the blind the deaf the mute fools or vicious people from the borderlands he never tires This is the inconceiv ability of a bodhisattva Good son the bodhisattva is inconceivable in four ways he is able to give what he loves he is full of afflictions and is able to endure vicious circumstances he is able to harmonize various kinds of contentions and even just before death ifhe sees a bad person he will speak the Dharma to convert him These are the four kinds of inconceivabilities in a bodhisattva Again the bodhi sattva is inconceivable in three ways he reproaches all afflic tions he dwells in the midst of afflictions and does not get rid of them and although he is full of afflictions and afflictive karma he is not lax Again the bodhisattva is inconceivable in three ways before giving his mind is joyful at the time when he gives for the sake of others he does not seek reward and after giving he is happy and does not have regrets These are three kinds of inconceivabilities of the bodhisattva Good son when a bodhisattva mahdsattva performs these practices he reflects Am I a bodhisattva in name only or a true one A sentient being who can perform these deeds is a true bodhisattva Good son there are two kinds of bodhisattvas It is not difficult to practice these deeds for the ordained bodhisattva but it is difficult for the lay bodhisattva And why Because the lay bodhisattva is bound by more unfavorable conditions Chapter X On Benefitting Oneself and Others c Sujata asked Worldhonored One what is enlightenment And what is the path o f enlightenment The Buddha replied Good son there is no path of enlighten ment apart from enlightenment itself and there is no enlightenment apart from the path The path of enlightenment is enlightenment and enlightenment is the path The path of enlightenment surpasses the fruition of the paths taken by all sravakas andpratyekabuddhas Sujata asked Worldhonored One the fruition of the path attained by sravakas and pratyekabuddhas is enlightenment and the path of enlightenment How can it be surpassed Good son the path of sravakas and pratyekabuddhas is not broad and they are not fully enlightened Therefore enlighten ment and the path of enlightenment are said to be superior For example among all the scriptures in the world the twelve divisions of the Buddhist scriptures are foremost And why All that is said in the scriptures is correct and without error The same is true when the path of enlightenment is compared with the path of the two vehicles Good son the path of enlightenment is learning and the result of learning What is meant by learning Learning means that before one perfects the path of enlightenment one does not retreat The result of learning means that after the attainment of enlight enment one does not regress Although one has not yet attained it  This is called learning In the third kalpa one definitely attains  This is called the result of learning During the first asamkhya kalpa one is not able to give everything all the time to all sentient beings During Chapter X the second asamkhya kalpa although one is able to give all one has not been able to give all the time to all sentient beings In these two periods of time is called learning During the third asamkhya kalpa one is able to give all at any time to all sentient beings This is called the result of learning Good son when the bodhisattva is practicing giving morality endurance vigor meditation and wisdom this is called learning Good son there is giving that is not necessarily perfected and there are perfections that are not necessarily the perfection of giving Good son the giving practiced by srvakas pratyekabuddhas all common people and heretics is not perfected During the first two asamkhya kalpas the bodhisattva practices perfections but not necessarily the perfection o f giving The bodhisattvas practice during the third asamkhya kalpa is both giving and the perfection of it Practices that are neither giving nor perfected mean the practices of morality meditation endurance and compassion by the srvakas and pratyekabuddhas Good son neither giving nor perfected means learning Good son enlightenment denotes ultimate wisdom and the wisdom of birthlessness The diligent cultivation of the thirtyseven practices in order to gain these two wisdoms is called learning After enlightenment is attained it is called the result o f learning To regulate ones own spiritual faculties and then to regulate those of others is called learning Ones own liberation and the liberation of others is the result of learning To cultivate the ten powers the four fearlessnesses great compas sion and the three mindfulnesses is learning To perfect and attain the eighteen uncommon dharmas is the result of learning To act for the benefit of oneself and others is learning The completion of benefitting others is the result of learning To study worldly dharmas is learning and to learn the worldtranscending On Benefitting Oneself and Others dharmas is the result of learning Not sparing ones body and wealth for the sake of sentient beings is learning and not sparrng ones life and wealth for their sake is the result of lea m i g transform sentient beings and to engage in the deeds of men and gods is learning To create undefiled karma is the result of learn ing To be able to give sentient beings any wealth is beaming and a to be able to give them the Dharma is the result of leami g break ones own stinginess greed and jealousy is learning and to break others stinginess greed and jealousy is the result of learn ing To uphold the five spiritual faculties and cultivate m m   is learning and to teach others to practice and perfect mindfulness is the result of learning Good son the bodhisattva with faith after benefiting dimself benefits others To benefit only oneself is not being To benefit others is to benefit oneself And why The bodhisattva mahasattva is not stingy with his body life or wea in order to bring benefit to others This is benefiting oneself The bodhisattva understands that if he teaches sentient beings e enlightenment of  a s and pratyekabuddhas t h e j w i l l  accept it Instead he teaches the enjoyments of men and gods T is benefiting others To benefit others is to benefit oneself an the bodhisattva does not benefit both himself and others but only himself this is inferior And why Such a bodhisattva is covetous of dharmas and wealth therefore he cannot benefit himself a practitioner lets others suffer and keeps himself m peace ami happiness such a bodhisattva cannot benefit others If the bo sattva himself does not practice giving morality and much Us e ing but teaches others to do so this is benefig them but not himself If he perfects the five spiritual faculti  such as faith and the rest and then teaches them to others this is the bodhisattvas benefit to him self and others Good son there are two kinds of benefit If the bodhisattva works only for present benefits he is not a true bodhisatfwa If he works for the future he can benefi both Good son just as there are two kinds of happiness If the bodhisattva possesses these two kinds of happiness and blessings and also teaches them to sentient beings he is benefitting himself and others Good son the bodhisattva can benefit both if only he possesses one thing that is no laziness b Good son if sramanas Brahmans elders men women or those in the great assembly make mistakes the bodhisattva having seen their mistakes and followed their intentions should speak the Dharma to them and subdue their afflictions If he speaks the Dharma without understanding their intentions he is an inferior bodhisattva Good son there are two types of bodhisattvas those who like to draw near beneficial friends and those who do not Those who like to draw near can benefit themselves and others Those who do not cannot benefit themselves and others The one who is willing to make offerings can benefit himself and others Being able to listen to the Dharma with sincerity can benefit oneself and others There are two On Benefitting Oneself and Others ways of listening with sincerity being able to raise questions and not being able to raise questions One who is capable of raising questions with regard to the meaning of the Dharma can benefit himself and others One who is not capable cannot benefit himself or others There are two kinds who are capable of questioning the meaning those who sincerely hold the meaning and those who do not One who holds the meaning with sincerity can benefit himself and others One who cannot hold it with sincerity cannot benefit himself or others There are two kinds who hold the meaning with sincerity those who ponder it and those who do not ponder it One who can ponder can benefit himself and others One who cannot ponder cannot benefit himself or others There are two ways to ponder the meaning to be able to comprehend the meaning and not to be able to comprehend One who can comprehend the meaning can benefit himself and others One who cannot comprehend the meaning cannot benefit himself or others There are two kinds of bodhisattvas who can comprehend the meaning those who properly dwell in the Dharma and those who do not properly dwell in the Dharma One who properly dwells in the Dharma can benefit himself and others One who cannot properly dwell in the Dharma cannot benefit himself or others There are two kinds of bodhisattvas who properly dwell in the Dharma those who perfect the eight wisdoms and those who do not perfect the eight wisdoms What are the eight wisdoms They are the wisdom of the Dharma the wisdom of meaning the wisdom of time the wisdom of contentment the wisdom of self and others the wisdom of the multitudes the wisdom of the spiritual faculties and the wisdom of superiority and inferiority One who perfects these eight wisdoms has the following sixteen charac teristics of speech timely speech sincere speech speaking in sequence speaking harmoniously speaking in agree ment with the meaning speaking joyfully speaking freely speaking without slighting the listeners speaking without scolding the listeners speaking according to the Dharma Chapter X speaking to benefit oneself and others speaking with focus speaking according to the meaning speaking truly speaking without becoming arrogant and speaking with out seeking worldly rewards Good son one who possesses the eight wisdoms can speak and listen to the Dharma Such a person can benefit himself and others One who does not possess cannot benefit himself or others Good son the impure way of speaking the Dharma is filthy betrays the Dharma is insulting erroneous and loses the meaning Speaking purely is immaculate proper true and an accumulation of the Dharma Good son if one knows the twelve divisions of the scriptures the theory of words and their meanings  and logic and if one understands ones own and others propositions reasons and examples  this is proper speech There are four kinds of listeners those who understand much while hearing On Benefitting Oneself and Others only a little those who understand distinctively those who understand according to the original meaning and those who understand literally word by word The Tathagata speaks the Dharma for the first three kinds of people not for the fourth kind And why Because they are not vessels of the Dharma These four types of people can again be classified into two types mature and immature The mature are those who have already been regulated while the immature are those who are to be regulated in the future Likewise there are four types of lay people easy to regulate but difficult to encourage difficult to regulate but easy to encour age easy to regulate and to encourage and difficult either to regulate or to encourage These four types o f people can again a be classified into three kinds those regulated by reproach by gentle words and by both reproach and gentle words Again there are two types those who can regulate themselves without help from others and those who cannot regulate them selves and ask to be regulated by others Again there are another two types those regulated through giving and those regu lated through a mantra There are two different times for being regulated when one is happy and when one is suffering There are two kinds of skillful means to be used when speak ing the Dharma to these four kinds of people The bodhisattva must know the affairs of the world well and must seek to serve Good son one who knows these two skillful means is able to benefit both himself and others One who does not know them cannot benefit himself or others Good son the bodhisattva mahasattva may first learn nonBuddhist texts in order to benefit others and then study the twelve divisions of the scriptures If sentient beings hear the twelve divisions of the scriptures they will discard nonBuddhist texts He praises the virtue of giving and reproaches the fault of stinginess The bodhisattva is always serene and praises the virtues of serenity He constantly practices the Dharma and praises it If one is like this one is benefitting himself and others The lay bodhisattva should regulate himself first If he does not regulate himself he should not renounce the householders life The lay bodhisattva can bring over many people but the ordained bodhisattva cannot And why Good son there is the path and the adornment of the path The path refers to the practice of the Dharma and its adornment denotes the laity An ordained bodhi sattva practices the path for the laity and lay people practice the Dharma for the ordained reciting and teaching Good son the bodhisattva mahdsattva also practices four dharmas namely receiving giving reciting and teach ing This is to benefit oneself and others If the bodhisattva wants to speak about the profound meaning of the Dharma Realm for sentient beings he should first speak of worldly dharmas and then of the profound meaning of the Dharma Realm And why The bodhisattva mahasattva should care for the thoughts of all sentient beings If he did not he could not subdue them The bodhisattva should also care for his own body otherwise he cannot regulate sentient beings A bodhisattva is not covetous of his body life or wealth If he protects his body life and wealth it is to regulate sentient ib beings The bodhisattva mahdsattva first eradicates his own faults and then teaches others to do the same There is no such thing as a bodhisattva teaching others to eradicate faults when he has not eradicated his own first Therefore the bodhisattva himself should first practice giving keeping precepts being content and vigorous On Benefitting Oneself and Others and then teach others to do likewise If the bodhisattva does not practice the Dharma himself he cannot teach sentient beings Good son with regard to sentient beings and bodhisattvas there are three levels of faculties inferior medium and superior The bodhisattva with inferior faculties can teach those with inferior faculties but not those with medium or superior faculties The bodhisattva with medium faculties can teach those with medium or inferior faculties but not those with superior The bodhisattva with superior faculties can teach all three Good son there are two types of bodhisattvas It is not difficult for the ordained bodhisattva to benefit himself and others but it is difficult for the lay bodhisattva to cultivate these two benefits And why Because the lay bodhi sattva is bound by more unfavorable conditions Chapter XI On the Adornment of Oneself and Others Sujta asked Worldhonored One how many dharmas does the bodhisattva mahsattva have to possess in order to benefit himself and others Good son the bodhisattva has to perfect eight dharmas to benefit himself and others What are they a long life superior appearance great physical strength noble birth much wealth being a male eloquence and fear lessness when facing great assemblies of people Sujata asked Worldhonored One what are the causes and conditions for the bodhisattva to attain a long life and so on up to fearlessness in the assembly The Buddha replied Good son the bodhisattva mahsattva has compassion and does not kill for immeasurable lives for this reason he obtains a long life In measureless lives he constantly gives away clothing and lamps and for this reason he enjoys a superior appearance In measureless lives he always destroys arrogance and for this reason he is born into a noble family In measureless fives he always gives food to others and for this reason he obtains great physical strength In measureless fives he always takes delight in speaking the Dharma and for this reason he obtains great wealth In measureless fives he loathes the female body and for this reason he is born as a man In measureless fives he keeps precepts sincerely and for this reason he is eloquent Pure things refer to those things not stolen from others not disapproved of by the sages not belonging to the public or the Three Treasures not given to one and then trans ferred to others not given to many and then transferred to one not obtained by troubling others or by cheating or bullying others c What does a pure mind mean When one practices giving one does not do it to gain rewards in samsara such as fame a superior appearance power wealth a continuous family fine or prosperous relatives Rather it is just for adorning enlightenment and sub duing sentient beings that one practices giving This is called purity of mind What does a pure field of blessings mean It means that the receiver keeps away from the eight unwholesome dharmas Good son by these three conditions one perfects the eight dharmas Good son the bodhisattva seeks a long life in order to praise nonkilling for the sake o f sentient beings The bodhisattva seeks a superior physical appearance in order to make sentient beings happy when they see him It is to cause sentient beings to become respectful that the bodhisattva seeks noble birth The bodhisattva seeks physical strength so that he can keep the precepts recite sutras and meditate The bodhisattva seeks much wealth to subdue sentient beings The bodhisattva seeks to be born as a male to become a vessel o f the Dharma and hold wholesome dharmas The bodhisattva seeks eloquence in order to have sen tient beings accept his teachings The bodhisattva seeks fearless ness in front of the assembly in order to distinguish the true Dharma Therefore good son a bodhisattva who perfects these eight dharmas can benefit himself and others To practice like this is true practice Good son a bodhisattva who possesses these eight dharmas perfects and upholds the ten good dharmas and takes delight in teaching people He also perfects and upholds the updsaka pre cepts and teaches others happily Although he maintains superior appearances he does not become arrogant Although he keeps pure precepts hears much Dharma progresses vigorously and has On the Adornment of Oneself and Others great strength noble birth and wealth he never becomes arro gant He does not deceive sentient beings with delusion or become lax about practicing the six harmonies A bodhisattva who perfects these dharmas is not different from one who has left the home life although he is still a house holder Such a bodhisattva will never create bad causes and condi tions for others And why Because he has a strong sense of shame Good son if a lay person keeps such upasaka precepts throughout his life he will never create bad causes and conditions even if he is reborn in places without the Three Treasures And why There are two reasons he has wisdom and is not lax Good son a there are four reasons for not behaving badly even in unwholesome places knowing the faults of the afflictions not following them being able to endure malicious suffering and not becoming frightened A bodhisattva who has perfected these four dharmas cannot be moved by any suffering or affliction Good son there are five reasons to become an unmoved bodhisattva taking delight in practicing wholesome dharmas distinguishing good from bad drawing close to the proper Dharma having compassion for sentient beings and knowing past lives Good son if the bodhisattva who has perfected these eight dharmas is slandered he is able to endure it If he is praised he feels ashamed He feels happy for himself when practicing the way but he does not give rise to pride or arrogance He can discipline erroneous people Seeing those in contention he can help them get along harmoniously He makes known the good deeds of others and covers up their errors He never spreads what people feel ashamed of Hearing others secrets he does not tell people about them He never makes vows concerning worldly affairs that is he never swears Receiving small favors he repays them with great ones He always shows kindness to his foes When friends and foes are suffering he first saves his foes He is compassionate to those who scold him Seeing someone steal his things he keeps silent and unmoved He has compassion for those who come to beat him He sees sentient beings as his parents He would rather die than tell lies And why Because he understands retribution He arouses Chapter XI resentful thoughts with regard to the afflictions and friendly thoughts with regard to good dharmas If he gives rise to thoughts of greed toward heretic dharmas he quickly observes the faults of the greed He does likewise with regard to all afflictions Although he may stay long with bad people he never takes the bad for good and although he may not stay with good people he does not feel far from them Although he makes offerings to support his parents and teachers he never does wrong on their behalf Seeing suppli cants who are in financial difficulties he does not feel disgust Although he does not draw near vicious people his mind is always full of compassion for them When harm befalls him he returns it with good When enjoying himself he does not slight others and when seeing others suffer he does not feel happy His actions are pure and he keeps the four deportments through which he teaches sentient beings His speech is purified by reading and reciting the twelve divisions of the scriptures through which he teaches sen tient beings His mind is purified by cultivating the four measure lessnesses through which he teaches sentient beings He is willing to make others happy through his own suffering Although secular studies are not beneficial he learns them for the sake of sentient beings What he learns should be the best in the world Although he masters the most superior worldly learning he does not become b arrogant He diligently uses what he knows to transform others He teaches others what he knows so that it can be perpetuated He does not cause his relatives or friends to do wrong He teaches happily and transforms sentient beings with the eight dharmas mentioned above He expounds cause and effect without mistake He is not afflicted when apart from dear ones because he contem plates impermanence He is not indulgent when enjoying himself because he contemplates suffering and impermanence Good son one who has perfected the eight dharmas is able to do things in this manner Good son there are two kinds of bodhisattvas lay and ordained It is not difficult for the ordained bodhisattva to cultivate these eight dharmas but it is difficult for the lay bodhisattva And why Because the lay bodhisattva is bound by more unfavorable conditions Chapter XII On Two Adornments Sujata asked How does a bodhisattva adorn himself and others The Buddha replied Good son the bodhisattva can adorn himself and others by perfecting two dharmas blessings and wisdom Worldhonored One what are the causes and conditions for attaining these two adornments Good son the bodhisattva who practices the six perfections will attain these two adornments Giving morality and vigor are the adornments of blessings Endurance meditation and wisdom are the adornments of wisdom Again there are six dharmas that are causes for the two adornments that is the six mindfulnesses The mindfulnesses of the Buddha the Dharma and the Sangha are the adornment of wisdom And the mindfulnesses of the pre cepts giving and heaven are the adornment of blessings Good son the bodhisattva who perfects these two adornments can bene fit himself and others He can undergo the suffering of the three evil realms for the sake of sentient beings without feeling regret If the bodhisattva perfects these two adornments he attains subtle wonderful skillful means and comprehends worldly and worldtranscending dharmas Good son the adornment of blessings is the adornment of wisdom and the adornment of wisdom is the adornment of bless ings And why One who has wisdom can cultivate wholesome dharmas perfect the ten good deeds and attain wealth and selfmastery Attaining the two he can benefit himself and others A wise person can learn the most superior worldly dharmas well and because of that he can gain wealth and selfmastery The Chapter XII bodhisattva who perfects these two dharmas can benefit himself and others in present and future lives The wise can distinguish the worldly dharmas from worldtranscending dharmas The worldly dharmas refer to all worldly teachings and meditation The worldtranscending dharmas refer to the doctrines of the skandhas the sensefields and the realms Because the bodhisattva knows the causes and conditions of the two dharmas he can benefit himself and others in present and future lives Good son although the bodhisattva knows that worldly pleasure is illusory and untrue he can create causes and conditions for it And why Because he wants to benefit sentient beings Good son there are two direct causes for the two adornments a kind heart and a compassionate heart Cultivating these two causes although the bodhisattva transmigrates in the samsaric sea of c suffering he does not have regrets Again the bodhisattva perfects two dharmas that can adorn unsurpassed enlightenment he does not take delight in samsara and he deeply contemplates liberation Therefore he can bring benefit in present and future lives He knows the characteristics of dharmas attains great wisdom and is able to increase his own and others wealth and life span Good son the bodhisattva mahasattva who perfects these two dharmas does not regret anything he has given and is forbearing when he encounters various bad conditions When the bodhisattva practices giving he contemplates two fields the field of blessings and the field of poverty The bodhisattva gives to the poor in order to increase blessings and virtues and he gives to the field of blessings in order to increase unsurpassed wonderful wisdom He gives to the field of blessings to repay kindness and he gives to the poor because he pities them In order to forsake afflictions he gives to the field of blessings and in order to accomplish merit and virtue he gives to the poor In order to increase the causes and conditions for all happiness he gives to the field of blessings and in order to eliminate the causes and conditions of all suffering he gives to the poor The bodhisattva gives to his dear ones so that he can repay kindness He gives to his enemies so that he can eliminate enmity On Two Adornments The bodhisattva mahdsattva sees the supplicant as his only son therefore he gives whatever he can This is called the perfec tion of giving When giving the bodhisattva keeps away from thoughts of stinginess This is called the perfection of morality Being able to endure the words of a supplicant is called the perfection of endurance Giving things away with his own hands is the perfection of vigor he sincerely contemplates liberation this is called the perfection of meditation He does not make a distinction between all friends and foes this is called the perfection of wisdom Good son just as the thought of a person who kills for greed is filled with the twelve causes and conditions so is the bodhisattvas thought of giving filled with these six perfections This is the cause and condition for the adornments of blessings and wisdom Further good son the causes and conditions from which the bodhisattva mahdsattva creates uncommon dharmas are called the adornment of blessings To teach sentient beings so that they can all attain the three kinds of enlightenment is called the adornment of wisdom Again good son if the bodhisattva subdues sentient beings  this is called the adornment of wis dom To undergo suffering with sentient beings is called the adorn ment of blessings That the bodhisattva can cause all sentient beings to avoid unwholesome views is called the adornment of wisdom To be able to teach sentient beings to dwell in faith giving morality much listening and wisdom is the adornment of blessings Again good son the bodhisattva mahdsattva who per fects the five dharmas can adorn unsurpassed enlightenment What are the five dharmas Good son the bodhisattva who perfects these two adornments a has seven characteristics What are the seven He knows his own faults does not talk about others faults looks after the sick happily gives happily to the poor acquires the aspira tion for enlightenment is not lax and sincerely practices the six perfections at all times Good son there are another seven Chapter XII characteristics Good son the bodhisattva mahdsattva who comprehends these seven characteristics can benefit himself and others Good son there are two kinds of bodhisattvas It is not difficult for the ordained bodhisattva to cultivate the two adorn ments but it is difficult for the lay bodhisattva And why Because the lay bodhisattva is bound by more unfavorable conditions Chapter XIII On Drawing In b Sujata asked Worldhonored One after the bodhisattva per fects the two adornments how does he draw in his followers and disciples Good son he should draw them in with the four allembracing virtues and cause them to leave behind all evil and increase good dharmas Good son the bodhisattva who draws in disciples without these qualities is a wicked person a bodhisattva in name only and not a true one He is like an outcast who is unclean and impure and who destroys the BuddhaDharma Such a person will not be looked upon favorably by the Buddhas of the ten directions Good son the bodhisattva should teach his disciples precepts at times At times means those times when they give rise to covetousness hatred and stupidity When their covetousness arises he should teach them various ways to counteract it so that they can eliminate it He does the same when they give rise to the other two  Next he should teach them the twelve divisions of the scriptures and samadhi and he should explain the profound meaning to discipline their bodies and minds He has them cultivate the six mindfulnesses without laxity He looks after them tirelessly when they are sick and endures slander scolding and the sufferings of body and mind If the disciples suffer he saves and helps them He helps them rid themselves of malicious and suspicious thoughts And why Transgressing against the precepts harnas only oneself but to take in bad disciples without teachfng then causes many people to do wrong slanders immeasurable toaeM of S StryS theharm i  s Sangha and leads to the hell o f unremitting suffering  Good son there are two kinds of bodhisattvas An ordained bodhisattva has two kinds of disciples lay The lay bodhisattva has only one kind of d i s c i   rdained b dhisattva Caches ordained disciples the twelve divisions of the scriptures According to their transgressions he has them repent He teaches them eight kinds  knowledge What are the eight knowledge of he Oha  knowledge of meaning knowledge o f time knowledge o f contentment knowledge of self knowledge o f others knowledge of the spiritual faculties and knowl edge o f discrimination Good son if the bodhisattva mahasattua can teach and sub  I  Tdamed diSciples like this both the master and the dmaples obtain immeasurable benefits Such a master and disaple can promote the Three Treasures And why practices giving Dharma without laxity dues sentient beings afflictions looks after the sick and g L s to Good son if the ordained bodhisattva has lay disciples he s ould first teach them the dharma o f not being lax Not being lax practicing the Dharma making offerings to parents teachers monks elders and virtuous ones giving peace and happiness sincerely accepting the precepts without transgression not appro priating what is entrusted being patient in the face of malice not using malicious language or meaningless words being compas sionate toward sentient beings always having respect and awe c toward kings elders and officials being able to subdue the afflictions of ones wife children and relatives distinguishing friends and foes and yet not slighting sentient beings severing arrogance and keeping away from bad friends being moderate with food eliminating greed having few desires and being con tent avoiding places of fighting and not using bad words even in jest If the ordained bodhisattva has a lay disciple he should at first teach him this practice of not being lax In painful and happy times the master and disciple should stay together If the disciple is in poverty and need the teacher should share generously except for the six items He should provide what the disciple needs when he is sick and when looking after him he should not become weary If he himself does not have things  he should go out everywhere to look for them and if he still cannot obtain them he can borrow from the Three Treasures After recovering from an illness the disciple should return ten times what he borrowed according to the law of Prasenajit King of Sravasti If he is unable to repay should teach him Now you owe the Three Treasures and are unable to repay You should diligently practice so as to attain the fruition of streamenterer up to that of an arhat If can sincerely arouse the aspiration for enlightenment teach thousands of people to bring forth pure faith in the Buddha Dharma or destroy even one persons extremely erroneous viewsif he can teach lay disciples things such as theseboth master and disciple will attain immeasur able benefits Good son the lay bodhisattva who takes a lay disciple should first teach him the practices of not being lax Not being lax means to make offerings to parents teachers monks elders and virtuous ones to support brothers wife children friends and relatives to Chapter XIII give food first to those who are about to travel and those who come from afar and to all servants Further he should teach his disciple to believe in the Three Treasures He shares with him pain and happiness and never isolates himself At all times he provides for him so that he does not experience hunger or cold He should never beat or scold but instead should teach with gentle words If the disciple is sick he should look after him He should look after what he needs and a teach him mundane affairs He will not match him in marriage with those of lower status He teaches him the five divisions of the scriptures of the Tathagata Seeing him separated or con tending with others he brings all into harmony Then he causes him to increase wholesome thoughts and to make offerings indis criminately to all Buddhist and nonBuddhist practitioners as far as he can He first draws them in by giving and then regulates them He teaches his disciple the six harmonies If the disciple seeks wealth by engaging in business farming or govern ment work he teaches him to do so properly Once wealth is gained he teaches him to protect it properly and happily give it away for blessings and virtue Seeing others do  he is pleased These are called the practices of not being lax If a lay bodhisattva can teach other lay bodhisattvas things like this the master and disciple attain immeasurable benefits Good son if fortunately the lay bodhisattva happens to be a king he should protect his subjects like his only son He will teach them to keep away from wrong and to cultivate good deeds When he sees others doing wrong he may beat or reproach them but he never kills them He taxes a sixth of his subjects property Seeing hateful and vicious people he teaches them the practice of endur ance and nonlaxity He teaches with gentle words and is able to distinguish good folk from bad He refrains from questioning the guilty Depending upon what he has he always gives to his people He does his best to read and recite the five collections of sutras and protects his body life and property well He skillfully teaches sentient beings not to do wrong He does not On Drawing In mind slander from bad people He does not gain wealth through improper means He properly protects his country and avoids the seven kinds of unwholesome actions He dislikes the six kinds of gambling in games chess and so forth hunting taking alcohol sensual pleasures vicious speech hypocrisy and wealth improperly acquired He always takes delight in making offerings to monks He always causes his people to take the king as their parent and to believe in cause and effect Seeing those better than himself he does not become jealous nor does he become arrogant when he is better than others He recognizes favors from others and returns small favors with large ones He subdues his sensual pleasure and purifies the three karmas  He praises good people and reproaches bad ones He thinks before he talks His words are gentle If he has not enough power he yields in a proper way and he does not use the four kinds of force to take over other countries When sentient beings are in fear he saves and relieves them He always embraces them with the four allembracing virtues He is able to distinguish various characteristics of dharmas Those who do not accept the Dharma he persuades with gentle words Good son there are two kinds of bodhisattvas It is not difficult for the ordained bodhisattva to take in two disciples but it is difficult for the lay bodhisattva to take even one disciple And why Because the lay bodhisattva is bound by more unfavorable conditions Chapter XIV On Taking Precepts Sujata asked Worldhonored One how does a lay bodhisattva take the upasaka precepts Good son if a lay bodhisattva wants to take the upasaka precepts he should first make offerings in sequence to the six direc    b tions of east south west north lower and upper The eastern direction represents parents Anyone who makes offerings to his parents with clothing food bedding medicine lodging and valuables pays reverence to them and praises them is making offerings to the east The parents return these favors in five ways sincerely loving their children never deceiving them giving them wealth arranging their marriages to those of good family and teaching them worldly affairs The south represents teachers Anyone who can make offer ings to his teachers with clothes food bedding medicine lodging and valuables pay reverence to them and praise them and get up early and stay up late to receive and practice the wholesome teaching is making offerings to the south The teacher responds with five things teaching without wasting any time teach ing as best he can without withholding not becoming jealous when the student excels referring to strict teachers and beneficial friends and giving the student his possessions before he dies The west represents ones wife If anyone can provide his wife with garments food bedding medicine and adornments such as necklaces set with precious stones he is making offerings to the west The beneficial friends respond in four ways teaching m to cultivate good dharmas causing him to avoid bad ones helping him when he is in fear and strengthening him against laxity when he is lax  On Taking Precepts Good son anyone who wishes to take the upasaka precepts so as to increase wealth and life span should consult his parents first If his parents give permission he should then inform his wife and servants If all agree he then asks the king for permission After gaining the kings permission he may then go to anyone who has been ordained and has awakened the aspiration for enlighten ment He bows and courteously asks him Great virtuous one I am a real man who wishes to take the bodhisattva upasaka precepts May the great virtuous one kindly allow me to take the precepts Then the bhiksu should say Have your parents wife serv ants and king given permission If the answer is yes he should then ask Do you owe anything to the Buddha Dharma Sangha or others If the answer is no he should further ask Do you have any physical or mental illnesses If the answer is no he should further ask Have you ever wronged a bhiksu or a bhiksuniV If the answer is no he should ask Have you ever committed any of the five cardinal transgressions If the answer is no he should then ask Have you stolen the Dharma If the answer is no he should then ask Are you a hermaphrodite or one without sexual organs Have you ever killed anyone who had aroused the aspiration for enlighten ia ment stolen things from the Sangha or used deceitful or unwhole some speech Have you ever behaved improperly to your mother or sisters Have you ever lied to the public If the answer is no he should then tell him Good son the upasaka precepts are very difficult to keep And why These precepts are the basis for the ten precepts of the sramanera the bhiksu precepts the bodhisattva precepts and even for unsur passed perfect enlightenment If one sincerely keeps the upasaka precepts one obtains the immeasurable benefits o f these precepts If one violates these precepts then in measureless and boundless lives one will dwell in the three evil realms and undergo great suffering  Now you wish to obtain immeasurable benefits If one has taken refuge m the Buddha one would rather die than take refuge in Isvaradeva or other gods If one has taken refuge in the Dharma one would rather die than take refuge in the scriptures of heretics And if one has taken refuge in the Sangha one would rather die than take refuge in heretics Can you sincerely take refuge in the Three Treasures as such If the answer is yes he should further say Good son the upasaka precepts are very difficult to keep One who has taken refuge m the Three Treasures should protect sentient beings from fear If he can give fearlessness he attains the updsaka precepts and even unsurpassed perfect enlightenment Can you give fear lessness to sentient beings If the answer is yes he should further say There are five things that prevent one from attaining wealth and a long life span in the present life What are they They are killing stealing sexual misconduct lying and taking intoxicants Because of killing sentient beings suffer in the present life from unpleasant appearance weakness infamy short lives decreased wealth separation from dear ones reproach from the sages dis trust from others and blame for the misdeeds of others These are called the retributions in the present life of the bad karma of killing After death one falls into the hells and suffers the afflic tions hunger thirst a long life span  bad appearance weakness infamy and so forth These are called the retributions in future lives from the bad karma  If one is again born as a human one again suffers from inferior appearance short life span and poverty Because o f the power of the unwholesome causes and conditions attached to this person the five kinds of grains and vegetables decrease in production The disaster of this person extends to all people in the world Anyone who likes to steal also receives the retribution of a bad appearance weakness infamy and a short life Wealth dimin ishes and one becomes separated from his family He is suspected if someone loses something Although he may be close to people he is not trusted and is often reproached by sages After death he is born in the hells to undergo the suffering of a bad appearance weakness infamy hunger and thirst for a long time These are called the retributions of bad karma in future lives If he is again reborn as a human he will be poor And although he might gain wealth he loses it as soon as it is received He is not loved by his parents his brothers or his wife His body often suffers and his mind is always full of sorrow Because of the causal power of one bad person others do not gain physical strength from what they eat This persons unwholesome retribu tion extends to millions of people  Good son anyone who likes to tell lies acquires a foul mouth and a bad appearance Although he might tell the truth people do not trust him but dislike and avoid him These are called the retributions of the bad karma in the present life After death he will be born in the hells to undergo the great suffering of hunger thirst and heat These are called the retribu tions from bad karma in future lives If he is reborn again as a human being his body and mouth will be deformed Although he tells the truth people do not believe him and avoid him Although he might speak the proper Dharma people will not like to listen All external things decrease because of the causal power of one bad person  Good son anyone who likes to take intoxicants loses wealth in this life These are called the retributions from taking intoxi cants in the present life After he dies he will stay in hell and undergo the immeasurable sufferings of hunger and thirst This is called the retribution from bad karma in future lives If he is reborn again as a human being his body and mind are always out of harmony and he cannot be mindful of the good dharmas Because of the causal power of one bad person all external things degenerate d S any ne Wh indul s in sexual misconduct cannot Protect himself or others and is suspect among all sentient beings Whatever he does he lies about it At all times he undergoes the suffenng of the afflictions His mind being distracted he cannot practice wefl and witlessly loses wealth He is not loved by his wife and children and his life span is short These are the present   I  ka a o   misconduct in the present  M fdeath he Wl be reb in the hells to undergo the suffenng o fa bad appearance weakness hunger and thirst for a ng time These are the retributions for bad karma in future lives he is again reborn as a human he will be born with inferior appearance and bad speech and people will avoid him He cannot protect and keep his wife sons or daughters Because of the causal power of one bad person all external things are not at ease Good soncan you keep away from these five bad dharmas f the answer is yes should then say Good son after taking the updsaka precepts one should not do four m ngS   ne Sh Uld nt be led t cheat because of hatred stupidity or fear Can you keep away from these four bad dharmas y ta k Z  anSWT  yeS he Sh  ld aga sa G d son after taking the upasaka precepts one should not roam to five places c namely the places of the butcher or the prostitute to bars to the palace and to the place of an outcast  Can you keep away from these four kinds of people If the answer is yes he should then ask Good son after ia taking the upasaka precepts one should not become lax What is meant by laxity Can you keep away from laxity If the answer is yes he should then say Good son after taking the upasaka precepts one should at first pursue secular studies After learning them one can seek wealth properly If one earns wealth one should divide it into four parts One part should be offered to ones parents oneself ones wife and ones relatives Two parts should be invested and the last part should be saved for future use Can you do these four things If the answer is yes he should then say Good son wealth should not be entrusted at four places places of old people distant places places of bad people and places of power ful people Can you avoid them If the answer is yes he should then say Good son after taking the upasaka precepts one should always keep away from four kinds of bad people those who talk of others faults those who express deviant views those who are gentle in speech but vicious in mind and those who do little but say much Can you keep away from these four kinds of bad people If the answer is yes he should have the person who wants to take the precepts live nearby and serve an ordained and wise Chapter XIV for six months Ifthis person can do as taught after six months a harmonious assembly of at least twenty monks is called to a meeting The wise one announces Great virtuous Sangha please listen This person is now requesting the updsaka pre cepts from the Sangha The Sangha has unanimously granted you permission to take the updsaka precepts These pre cepts are the basis of all good dharmas One who perfects these precepts will attain the fruition of a streamenterer up to that of a nonreturner One who breaks these precepts will fall after death into the three evil realms Good son the updsaka precepts are inconceivable And why After taking these precepts although one might enjoy the five pleasures they cannot prevent one from attaining the fruition of a streamenterer up to that of a non returner therefore they are inconceivable Can you take these precepts for the sake of sentient beings If the answer is yes the wise one should explain to him the procedure of taking refuge in the Three Treasures he same is done with the second and third  After having taken the Three Refuges one is an updsaka Then the wise one again says Good son listen attentively listen attentively The perfectly enlightened Tathagata says that there are different degrees of fulfillment of the updsaka precepts namely one precept held half of them held none held the major ity of the precepts held and the full precepts held If after taking re uge in the Three Treasures one does not take any of the five precepts one is called an updsaka  If after taking refuge in the Three Treasures one takes one precept one is called an upasaka holding one precept I f after taking refuge in the Three Treasures one takes and keeps two precepts one is called On Taking Precepts an upasaka holding partial precepts After taking refuge in the Three Treasures and taking two precepts if one breaks even one precept one is a nonpreceptholding upasaka If after taking refuge in the Three Treasures one takes and keeps three or four precepts one is a majorpreceptholding upasaka If after taking refuge in the Three Treasures one takes and keeps five precepts one is an upasaka holding the full precepts After giving the   b precepts he should further say There are six cardinal precepts among the upasaka precepts Good son after an upasaka takes the precepts he should not kill any being from a goddess all the way down to an ant After taking the precepts if he instructs others to kill or if he himself kills he loses his upasaka precepts This person cannot attain even the state of warmth  let alone the fruition of a streamenterer or a nonreturner He is called a preceptbreaking upasaka a stinking upasaka an outcast upasaka a defiled upasaka and an afflicted upasaka  He should not steal even as little as a penny for his own life If he breaks this precept he loses the upasaka precepts This person cannot even attain the dharma state of warmth let alone the fruition of a streamenterer or a nonreturner He is called a preceptbreaking upasaka a stinking upasaka an outcast upasaka a defiled upasaka and an afflicted upasaka  Even for the sake of his life he should not lie that he has mastered the contemplation of impurity or the fruition of a non returner If he breaks this precept he loses the upasaka pre cepts This person cannot attain even the dharma state of warmth let alone the fruition of a streamenterer or a nonreturner He is called a preceptbreaking upasaka a stinking upasaka an out cast a defiled and afflicted upasaka This is the third cardinal precept Chapter XIV Even for the sake o f his life he should not engage in sexual misconduct I f he breaks this precept he loses the updsaka pre cepts This person cannot attain even the dharma state of warmth let alone the fruition of a streamenterer or a nonreturner He is called a preceptbreaking updsaka a stinking updsaka an out cast a defiled and afflicted updsaka This is the fourth cardinal precept  Ven for the sake ofhis lifehe should not speak of the faults of bhiksus bhiksunis updsakas or updsikds If he breaks this precept he loses the updsaka precepts This person cannot attain even the dharma state of warmth let alone the fruition of a streamenterer or a nonreturner He is called a preceptbreaking upasaka a stinking updsaka an outcast a defiled and afflicted upasaka This is the fifth cardinal precept  Even for the sake of his life he should not sell intoxicants If he breaks this precept he loses the updsaka precepts This person cannot even attain the state of warmth let alone the fruition of a streamenterer or a nonreturner He is called a preceptbreaking upasaka a stinking updsaka an outcast a defiled and afflicted upasaka  Good son if a person who takes such updsaka precepts can sincerely keep them without transgressing he can attain the fruition of the precepts Good son the updsaka precepts are like a precious necklace and its adornment the fragrance of which perumes boundless realms and covers unwholesome dharmas The precepts are good dharmas and regulations the store of the unsur passed treasury the tranquil place of nobility and the ground for the growth of wholesome dharmas as sweet as dew One aspiring thought will bring such measureless benefits How much more so if a person takes and keeps them without violation c Good son as the Buddha has said if an updsaka who has taken the precepts does not make offerings to his parents and teachers he commits a grave offense duskrta He cannot rise from degradation nor can he purify his actions If an updsaka who has taken the precepts indulges in intoxicants he commits a grave On Taking Precepts offense He cannot rise from degradation nor can he purify his actions If not correct he should speak out and make it correct If he does not do so he commits a grave offense If an upasaka who has taken the precepts has sexual inter course m improper places and at improper times he commits a grave offense He cannot rise from degradation nor can he purify his actions If a preceptholding updsaka who is engaged in busi ness erases taxes or appropriates public funds he commits a grave offense  Good son if an upasaka can sincerely accept and keep these precepts he is like a white lotus flower among other upasakas a wonderful and superb fragrance among others a pure lotus among other upasakas a genuine jewel and hero among other upasakas  Good son as the Buddha has said there are two kinds of bodhisattvas lay and ordained An ordained bodhisattva is called a bhiksu and a lay bodhisattva is called an upasaka It is not difficult for the ordained bodhisattva to hold the precepts for ordained people but it is difficult for the lay bodhisattva to hold the precepts for the lay bodhisattva And why Because the lay bodhisattva is bound by more unfavorable conditions  Chapter XV On the Purification of Precepts Sujata said to the Buddha After he takes these precepts how does he purify them The Buddha said Good son there are three ways to purify these precepts There are another four ways knowing that the condi tioned dharmas are without a self and are not possessed by a self knowing that there is a karmic result for every action knowing that all conditioned dharmas are impermanent and knowing that happiness is the result of pain and pain is the result of happiness There are another three ways not being Chapter XV attached to sentient beings bestowing happiness on sentient bemgs with the thought of equanimity and practicing in accord ance with what one preaches suffering greatly for sen tient beings in sequence and suffering for them without intermission and although suffering not having regrets There are another three ways knowing well the skillful means of teaching sentient beings to avoid bad dharmas knowing well the skillful means of teaching sentient beings to cultivate good dharmas and never becoming tired when teach ing sentient beings There are another three ways not sparing ones body or life in order to help sentient beings avoid physical suffering not sparing ones body or fife in order to help sentient beings avoid mental suffering and not sparing ones body or life when teaching sentient beings to cultivate good dharmas There are another three ways attending to others affairs before ones own not selecting a time to attend to others affairs and not worrying about personal difficulties that might arise by doing so There are another three ways not being jealous rejoic ing when seeing others being happy and perpetuating whole some thoughts without interruption There are another three ways never forgetting even the smallest good seen in others always thinking of repaying the smallest favor and having a firm mind and never retrogressing when undergoing the immeas urable suffering encountered during immeasurable lives staying close to beneficial friends never becoming tired of listening to the Dharma and sincerely consulting and accepting the teachings o f beneficial friends There are nine other ways including avoiding three actions not having regrets during the three periods of the day and giving equally to the three kinds of sentient beings There are four a other ways kindness compassion joy and equanimity Good son if the bodhisattva purifies his mind with the pure Dharma he should do it during two times during the time when a Buddha appears in the world and during the time when a pratyekabuddha appears in the world Good son there are three ways through which sentient beings bring forth good dharmas listening  ponder ing  and practicing it One should listen to and ponder the Dharma during the two times mentioned above whereas practicing can be accomplished during either time Good son there are two kinds of bodhisattvas It is not difficult for the ordained bodhisattva to purify precepts but it is difficult for the lay bodhisattva to do so And why Because the lay bodhisattva is bound by more unfavor able conditions Chapter XVI On Eliminating Evils Sujata said Worldhonored One after the bodhisattva has taken the upasaka precepts if internal and external evils and impurities remain how does he avoid them Good son if the bodhisattva has inner and outer evils and impurities he should cultivate the mindfulness of the Buddha If one sincerely cultivates the mind fulness of the Buddha one can avoid internal and external vices and impurities and can increase compassion and wisdom Worldhonored One how does one cultivate the mindfulness of the Buddha One should contemplate the seven superiorities of the Buddha the superiority of the body the superiority of abiding in the Dharma the superiority of wisdom the superiority of perfection the superiority of practice the superiority of inconceivability and the superiority of liberation What is the superiority of the body The Tathagatas body is adorned with thirtytwo excellent marks and eighty excellent characteristics The power of each of his fingers matches the power of ten thousand eighty Airavanas  Sentient beings take delight and never get weary of seeing the Tathagatas body After the Tathagata himself has attained benefits he can afterwards pity help and benefit immeasurable sentient beings This is what is meant by the superiority of abiding in the Dharma What is the superiority of wisdom The Tathagatas wisdom consists of four kinds of eloquence that are beyond those of the sravakas and pratyekabuddhas This is called the superiority of wisdom This refers to the Tathagatas perfections in practice life morality and views What is the superiority of practice It refers to the practices of the Tathagata the Worldhonored One in the three samddhis and the nine grades of meditation which are superior to those of the sravakas andpratyekabuddhas What is the superiority of inconceivability It refers to the Tathagatas six supernatural powers which are superior to those of the sravakas and pratyekabuddhas the ten powers the four qualities of fearlessness great compassion and the three qualities of mindfulness This means that the Tathagata has perfected two kinds of liberation eliminating the obstruction to wisdom and severing the obstruction of all affliciib tions and a habits forever and has attained selfmastery over knowledge and conditions Therefore in the sutras Sariputra praised the Tathagatas seven kinds of superiority Going through the stages from the con templation of impurity to the attainment of unsurpassed perfect enlightenment and from the stage of adornment to that of libera tion the Tathagata surpassed the sravakas and pratyekabuddhas and is therefore called the Unsurpassed and the Honored One In order to benefit sentient beings the Tathagata practiced the samddhi o f emptiness and the samddhi of complete extinction  the four dhydnas kindness compassion and the twelve links of causes and conditions The Tathagata is completely enlightened and his sermons are absolute therefore he is called the Thusgone  The Buddha started from the stage of adornment and proceeded to the attainment of unsurpassed complete enlightenment He is therefore called the Thuscome  Because he completely attains the subtle wonderful Dharma he is called an Arhat And because he is worthy of offerings from all gods and men he is called an Arhat Because he comprehends the two truths the conventional truth and the ulti mate truth he is called the Perfectly Enlightened One Because he On Eliminating Evils cultivates and keeps the pure precepts and perfects the three insights he is called the Perfect One in Knowledge and Conduct Because he no longer transmigrates in cyclic existence he is called Wellgone  Because he knows the two worlds the world of sentient beings and the physical world he is called the Knower of the Worlds Because he knows well the skillful means of regulat ing sentient beings he is called the Tamer of All Because he relieves sentient beings from fear and expediently teaches them to rid themselves of suffering and to gain happiness he is called the Teacher of Gods and Men Because he knows every dharma and practice he is called the Buddha Because he can break the four demons he is called the Bhagavan Furthermore contemplate that the Tathagata practices morality meditation and wisdom in order to benefit sentient beings Over immeasur able and numerous lives he benefits both foes and friends with out discrimination He has eliminated immeasurable afflictions and knows each and every sentient being who undergoes great suffering for each affliction over immeasurable lives For the sake of sentient beings the Tathagata the Worldhonored One gives away what is hard to give and endures what is hard to endure The Buddha has two kinds of purity the purity of adorn ment and the purity of karma Because of the power of the causes and conditions of these two kinds of purity no god or man in the stages from the first ten to the last ten stages of practice is able to speak of his flaws The Tathagata is replete with eighty thousand voices sentient beings never tire of hearing him Because of all these the Tathagata excels all sravakas and pratyekabuddhas Good son if a preceptholding bodhisattva wishes to purify his precepts he should cultivate the mindfulness of the Buddha as above If he does this he will be free from the impure causes of all internal and external evils increase compassion and wisdom eradicate greed hatred and stupidity and perfect all wholesome dharmas It is not difficult for the ordained bodhisattva to   c cultivate the mindfulness of the Buddha but it is difficult for the lay bodhisattva And why Because the lay bodhisattva is bound by more unfavorable conditions Chapter XVII On Making Offerings to the Three Treasures Sujata said Worldhonored One after a bodhisattva takes the upasaka precepts how should he make offerings to the Three Treasures Good son there are three kinds of fields of blessings in the world The field of returning kindness refers to parents teachers and monks The field of meritorious virtue refers to those who attain the state of warmth all the way to those who attain unsurpassed perfect enlightenment The field of poverty refers to all povertystricken people The Tathagata the Worldhonored One belongs to two fields of blessings the field of returning kindness and the field of meritorious virtue The Dharma also belongs to these two fields The Sangha belongs to the three fields of blessings the fields of returning kindness meritorious virtue and poverty Because of this after a person has taken the upasaka precepts he should sincerely and diligently make offer ings to the Three Treasures Good son the Tathagata is the treasury of the Dharma therefore a wise person should sincerely and diligently make offerings to his physical body and to the relics images and stupas  In uncivilized places where there are no stupas or statues he should always remain mindful and respectful and constantly be full of praise  He should do this himself and he should encourage others to do likewise He should feel delighted when he Chapter XVII a sees others do so If he himself has meritorious power he should have others do it along with him After making offerings he should not slight himself nor the Three Treasures He does not force others to make offerings for himself nor does he make offerings in order to surpass others When he makes any offerings he should feel neither regret nor sorrow he places the palms of his hands together and with great respect and reverence makes the offering whether the offering be one penny up to immeasurable jewels one piece of silk up to immeasurable amounts of silk one flower up to immeasurable flowers one incense stick up to immeasurable amounts of incense one line of praising verse up to immeasurable lines of praising verses one bow up to immeasur able bows one circumambulation up to immeasurable circumambulations doing these once up to innumerable times or whether done by himself or with others Good son can sincerely make offerings to the Buddha Dharma and Sangha like this should do it indis criminately during my lifetime or after my nirvana When he sees a stupa he should make offerings with gold silver bronze iron banners music incense oil and light If he sees a stupa that has been stepped upon and ruined by birds or animals he should repair and clean it If it is destroyed by storms floods or fires he should also repair it Ifhe himself is not capable of making repairs he should exhort others to make repairs either with gold silver bronze iron soil or wood If is dusty he should sweep it and if it is filthy he should wash it with fragrant water If builds a jeweled stupa or statue of the Buddha he should make an offering to it of various banners canopies incense and flowers If he has no resources to build a jeweled stupa he should build one with clay or wood and also offer it various banners canopies incense flowers and music If there are grass unclean things dead bodies of birds or animals night soil or rotten and stinking flowers inside the stupa he should remove them If there are holes through which snakes or rats can go into the stupa he should fill them Whether the Buddha statues are made of bronze wood stone clay gold silver crystal and so On Making Offerings to the Three Treasures forth he should frequently wash them and apply fragrances to them According to his financial resources he should make various necklaces or even build a cakravartin stupa and he should put incense inside the temple If the stupa and statue are made of white clay they should be adorned with crystal pearl fine cloth silk thread and bells Materials used to paint the Buddha should not contain resin or eggs He should make offerings to it during the day as well as at night whether with garlands of various flowers clean mirrors powdered incense fragrant oils scatter ing incense burning incense or various types of music or dance He should not make offerings of burning ghee or barley as the heretics do Neither should he apply ghee to the stupa or to the statue of the Buddha nor wash it with milk He should not make a statue of only the torso of the Buddha If any Buddha statue is in bad condition he should cover it and have someone fix it After fixing it it can then be uncovered If he sees a damaged statue he should sincerely make offerings and worship it as if it were intact  himself should make offerings like this It it is beyond his capacity he should help others do so and exhort others to help Someone might make offerings to the Tathagata with all the jewels in the four continents whereas another person might simply pay respect with various merits and utmost sincere praise The blessings and virtues of these two persons are equal The Tathagata is perfect both physically and mentally Physically he possesses the thirtytwo magnificent marks and eighty excel lent characteristics and is endowed with great power Mentally he has the ten powers the four qualities of fearlessness the great compassion the three qualities of mindfulness the five wisdoms samddhi the three dharmadoors the eleven kinds of contem plations of emptiness wisdom derived from the twelve causal links and immeasurable concentrations and meditations Perfect ing the seven wisdoms achieves the six perfec tions If someone can praise these dharmas of the Buddha he is truly making offerings to him What is meant by making offerings to the Dharma Chapter XVII Good son if someone makes offerings to the twelve divisions of the scriptures he is making offerings to the Dharma b How does one make offerings to the twelve divisions of the scriptures If one sincerely believes in the merit o f the scriptures accepts recites and expounds them and while practicing in accordance wdh them exhorts others to do so also this is making offerings to the twelve drvrsmns of the scriptures If one can copy the twelve dmsrnns of the scriptures and after copying them make oiferings to them as he would to the Buddha and if one makes offerings to them and upholds and recites them except at the time of taking a bath one is making offerings to the Dharma One makes offer mgs to the Dharma just as one makes offerings to the Buddha  I r  a  u  D h a r  a th e b o d h is a   s c a p a c it y t h e pratyekab ddha s th ree levels o f capacity and th e three tru th s If one makes offerings to a person who arouses the aspiration or enlightenment keeps the pure precepts leaves the home life and works toward fruition from a streamenterer to the level of an arhat one is making offerings to the Sangha If one can thus make offerings to the Three Treasures the Buddha the Dharma and the Sangha you should know that this person will never be at a distance from the Tathagatas of the ten directions and when the Buddha  Sltting  r d Wn he WiU alWayS be with Good son if a person can make offerings to the three fields of blessing as much as mentioned you should know that he will enjoy benefits in immeasurable lives Good son there are two kinds of bodhisattvas It is not difficult for the ordained bodhisattva to make offerings to the Three Treasures but it is difficult for the lay bodhisattva And why Because the  bodhisattva is bound by more unfavorable conditions Chapter XVIII On the Six Perfections c Sujata said Worldhonored One the Buddha previously said that the six directions refer to the six perfections and that making offer ings to them increases ones wealth and life What are the charac teristics of those  The Buddha said Good son these are the characteristics of such a person Sparing none of his wealth he constantly engages in benefitting others He praises giving and when he sees people doing so he is delighted and not jealous When he sees supplicants he joyfully greets them and offers them seats so that they can request advice from him If they do not request advice from him he then tells them the rewards of giving He protects those in fear When there is a famine he happily gives away food Although he practices giving like this he seeks neither reward nor favor for his generosity He does not deceive sentient beings and he praises the merits and virtues of the Three Treasures He neither trades in unfair or inferior merchandise nor has desire for intoxicants or gambling He constantly culti vates the virtues of remorse and shame Although he has immense wealth he is not dissipated Although he often practices giving he never becomes arrogant Good son you should know that a person who has these character istics is able to make offerings to the perfection of giving If he mistakenly commits an offense he feels remorse ful about it and believes that this offensive action will result in bad retributions His mind is full of joy at his good deeds and of great sorrow at the small offenses he might commit So for whatever offense he has done he feels alarmed and remorseful He never beats scolds or annoys sentient beings He speaks after thought and speaks gently When he sees sentient beings he arouses loving thoughts toward them He is aware of peoples kindness and repays their favors He is not stingy does not deceive others seeks wealth in proper ways and is happy to create virtues He always transfers his merits and virtues to others When he sees poor and suffering people he is willing to suffer personally for them He always cultivates kindness and has compassion for all He helps those who have done wrong And when he sees those who do good he not only praises their virtue and talks about its good conse quences but also assists them with his own resources He frees those who are not free physically He always endeavors to rid himself of angry or hateful thoughts If such thoughts arise he immediately becomes aware of them and feels ashamed He speaks truthfully and tenderly and does not use deceitful or meaningless speech Good son you should know that anyone who has these characteristics is able to make offerings to the perfection of morality Good son he who has the following characteristics can make offerings to the perfection of endurance He can purify the actions of body speech and mind Even when sentient beings do terribly vicious things to him he never gives rise to any thoughts of anger nor repays evil with evil If someone comes to apologize he imme diately accepts it He always rejoices when he looks at sentient beings And when he sees them do wrong he has compassion for them He praises the effect of endurance reproaches hatred and preaches that hatred causes harmful results When he practices giving or endurance he does so to his enemies first He correctly comprehends the five aggregates as being the combination of On the Six Perfections v ariou s conditions Since it is so w h y be angry H e h a s th e rig in sig h t th a t

anyone w h o h a s th ese charac e n s ics is a to make offerings to th e perfection o f vigor His afflictions beinghght he is able to keep away from bad meditation and contemplation Toward his foes he practices fa ness and speaks to them of definite causal n sequ en cIH u s mind goes astray he becomes alarmed and remorseful He can skillfully teach sentient beings proper meditation Good son you should know that anyone who has these character istics is able to make offerings to the perfection of meditation Good son one who can make offerings to the perfection of wisdom has the following characteristics He is able to purify the actions of body speech and mind and learns all worldly studies His mind stays away from covetousness hatred and stupidity and he is neither unrestrained nor disarranged He is compassionate to sentient beings He makes offerings to his parents teachers monks elders aged people and virtuous ones He trains himself not to be lax When he speaks he speaks gently He never deceives sentient beings but knows the differences between right and deviant paths and between good and bad retributions He always enjoys quietude and the monastic life He teaches sentient beings about secular knowledge and never becomes jealous of those who excel him nor arrogant when he excels others He does not become miserable when suffering nor overjoyed when happy Good son you should know that anyone who has such characteristics as these is able to make offerings to the perfection of wisdom b Good son in each direction there are four aspects of the perfections If a person is not stingy with his wealth and does not at any time make distinctions between dear ones and enemies he is able to subdue sentient beings Because he is not stingy with his wealth he can practice giving which keeps him from the fault of stinginess This is what is meant by trans cending faults Before giving at the time of giving and after aving given he is joyful and never has regrets As a result he will enjoy mundane and heavenly happiness all the way up to unsur passed happiness in the future This is called benefitting oneself can relieve others from suffering from hunger or thirst This is called benefitting others The four aspects of practicing morality are adorning enlight enment transcending faults benefitting oneself and bene fitting others To adorn enlightenment means that the updsaka On the Six Perfections precepts and bodhisattva precepts are the basic foundation of unsurpassed complete enlightenment This is called adornment After one has taken precepts one can keep away from evil rules and customs and maintain no precepts This is transcending the faults  After one has taken precepts one attains the bliss of a man or a god to the level of unsurpassed bliss This is benefitting oneself To adorn enlightenment means that through endurance one is able to cultivate good And because of the cultivation of good one is able to attain the fruition of the first ground and to go on to the level of unsurpassed perfect enlightenment This is called adornment After one cultivates endurance one is able to avoid the fault of hatred This is what is meant by transcending faults Through endurance one is able to attain the mundane and heavenly bliss all the way up to the unsurpassed bliss This is called benefitting oneself The four aspects of practicing vigor are adorning enlighten ment transcending faults benefitting oneself and benefit ting others To adorn enlightenment means that because of being vigorous one is able to cultivate good And because of the cultiva tion of good one attains the fruition of the first ground and even to the level of the unsurpassed complete enlightenment This is called adornment After the cultivation of good one departs from the fault of laziness This is called transcending faults Because of this good dharma one attains the mundane and heavenly bliss all the way up to the unsurpassed bliss This is called benefitting oneself The four aspects of the perfection of meditation are adorn ing enlightenment transcending faults benefitting oneself  Chapter XVIII and benefitting others To adorn enlightenment means that because of the cultivation of meditation one attains the fruition of the first ground and even to the level of unsurpassed com plete enlightenment This is called adornment Because of the cultivation of meditation one can practice immeasurable good deeds and avoid erroneous ways of contemplation This is called transcending faults Because of the power derived from the cul tivation of meditation one always remains serene and thereby attains mundane and heavenly bliss and even the unsurpassed bliss This is called benefitting oneself To adorn enlightenment means that because of the cultivation of wisdom one attains the fruition of the first ground and even to the level of unsurpassed complete enlighten ment This is called adornment Because of the cultivation of wisdom one avoids ignorance and thereby keeps afflictions in check This is transcending faults The perfection of wisdom eradi cates the obstruction of afflictions and the obstruction to wisdom To teach sentient beings and to discipline them is called benefitting others Good son it is said that there are only four perfec tions because besides morality there is no endurance and besides wisdom there is no meditation To be able to forbear illtreatment without retaliation is of morality To cultivate meditation with an unscattered mind is wisdom There fore morality is endurance and wisdom is meditation Apart from wisdom there is no meditation and apart from meditation there is no wisdom Therefore wisdom is meditation and meditation is wisdom Apart from morality there is no vigor and apart from vigor there is no morality Therefore morality is vigor and vigor is morality Apart from giving there is no perfec tion of vigor and apart from vigor there is no giving Hence it cannot be said that there are six perfections This cannot be true And why cannot this be true Wisdom is the cause and giving is the result Vigor is the cause and morality is the result Meditation is the cause and endurance is the result The cause and the result cannot be one therefore there should be six perfections It is said that morality is endurance and endurance is morality This also is not true And why is it not true Precepts are acquired from others but not endurance It is possible that one can endure ill treatment without having taken precepts One can cultivate good for others and endure immeasurable suffering and undergo great suffering for sentient beings in innumerable lives without regret Therefore there can be endur ance apart from precepts Good son samadhi is samatha and wisdom is vipasyana Samatha means undisturbed by concen trating on one thing whereas vipasyana means discernment Therefore in the twelve divisions of the scriptures I said that meditation and wisdom are different and therefore there should be six perfections The Tathagata first taught the perfection of giving In order to teach sentient beings to be rid of covetousness when they practice giving he next taught the perfection of pre cepts In order to teach sentient beings how to forbear the thought of forsaking their belongings when practicing giving he next taught the perfection of endurance In order to teach sentient beings to be joyful and to disregard time when giving he then taught the perfection of vigor In order to teach sentient beings to be singleminded and undisturbed when practicing giving he then taught the perfection of meditation In order to teach sentient beings not to indulge in the pleasures of samsara when practicing giving he taught the perfection of wisdom Good son why are they called perfections  When giving if one does not seek internal or external rewards does not care if the field of blessing or not and gives all wealth without stinginess and regardless of time this is called the perfection of giving not transgressing even the most insignificant precept even at the cost Chapter XVIII of ones own life this is called the perfection of morality If one is patient enough not to become hateful even when wicked people cut ones body this is called the perfection of endurance If one is vigorous in praising the Buddha with one verse for three months without taking any rest this is called the perfection of vigor If one practices meditation so well that one perfects the thunderbolt samadhi this is the perfection of meditation Good son when one attains unsurpassed complete enlighten ment one accomplishes the six perfections Therefore it is called the perfection of wisdom Good son there are two kinds of bodhisattvas It is not difficult for the ordained bodhisattva to purify the six perfections but it is difficult for the lay bodhisattva And why The lay bodhisattva is bound by more unfavorable conditions Chapter XIX On Miscellaneous Subjects Sujata said Worldhonored One after a bodhisattva has culti vated the six perfections what can he do for sentient beings Good son such a bodhisattva can liberate sentient beings who are sunk in the sea of suffering Good son if one is stingy with wealth the Dharma or food one receives the retribution of poverty and stupidity for immeasurable lives Therefore when the bodhi sattva practices the perfection of giving he should benefit himself and others Good son if a person enjoys giving sees all foes as dear friends liberates those who are not free believes in the causes and consequences of giving and morality he will procure the result of giving This is not true And why is it not true The practice of giving involves the five aggregates because it involves the actions of body speech and mind If giving is to benefit oneself and others it should involve the five aggre gates To practice giving like this can adorn the path o f enlighten ment Separation from afflictions and attainment of great wealth is the primary result of giving There are three results of giving Because of great wealth one procures excellent results from giving Because of the excellent fields of blessings one procures excellent results from giving Because of being an excellent giver an excellent result is procured The excellent fields refer to the streamenterer or the future bodhisattva up to the Buddha Making offerings to them one procures an excellent result Good son what kinds of result does one receive from sincere giving One who gives sincerely receives a great wealth of gold silver crystal carnehan pearl and coral elephants horses cattle sheep farms houses and servants and many relatives A sincere giver gains rewards such as these What kind of result does one receive from giving personally He also receives the wealth mentioned above and is able to enjoy it personally Anyone who gives personally like this receives such rewards What kind of result does one who gives with faith attain After giving with faith in addition to the results mentioned above he also enjoys love from his parents brothers clan members and other sentient beings He who gives at the appropriate time receives such rewards What kind of result does one who gives at the appropriate time receive In addition to what was mentioned above he also receives the reward of receiving whatever he wants whenever he wishes What kind of result does one who gives in accordance with the Dharma receive He receives the rewards as mentioned above and his wealth will not be taken away by the king robbers floods or fire If one likes to give away colorful things one will as a result gain a wonderful and superior appearance If one gives fragrance to people one becomes famous If one gives away delicious things people like to hear and see him and after having heard and seen him people love him If one gives away touchable things one attains the most wonderful touchable things After the receiver obtains the gift receives longevity physical strength happiness and eloquence And why is this not true It is out of faith that the donor practices giving Therefore he should gain these five rewards Good son for example a bhiksu who cultivates kind thought procures immeasurable rewards even though his kind ness may not be directed at a particular object Likewise one who makes offerings to stupas and statues should also gain the five kinds of rewards Good son for example a person who plants grains does not reap melons This is also true of making offerings to stupas and statues Due to the fields of blessings one is able to plant the results Therefore I say that the fields  wealth and the giver produce the consequences Good son there are two kinds of giving the giving of wealth and the giving of the Dharma Through the giving of the Dharma one attains the rewards of wealth and the Dharma whereas the giving of wealth only results in the reward of wealth The bodhisattva practices these two kinds of giving for two reasons in order that sentient beings may avoid afflictions and in order that sentient beings may be disciplined Good son again there are three kinds of giving the giving of the Dharma the giving of fearlessness and the giving of wealth The giving of the Dharma means to teach others to take precepts leave the home life cultivate the way consult the Sangha about important matters preach the proper Dharma to those with deviant views distinguish between the true and the false and proclaim the four errors and nonlaxity This is called the giving of the Dharma If the bodhisattva sees sentient beings in fear of kings lions tigers wolves floods fires or robbers and saves them  this is called the giving of fearlessness The giving of wealth means to give away ones wealth freely and without consideration of its value or quantity Things such as cattle sheep elephants horses houses bedding trees wells slaves servants buffaloes donkeys vehicles utensils vases beds furniture copperware ironware earthenware clothes jewels lamps flowers tents hats shoes tables canes ropes plows axes grass water rocks and so on are if given considered according to the supplicants needs In addition to these the building of temples or living Chapter XIX quarters given to those who renounce the household life excluding elephants and horses is also the giving of wealth There are two ways to counteract these four obstructions the cultivation of nonself and the cultivation of impermanence If one breaks these five obstructions he will always be happy in giving and will attain five things Good son a bodhisattva means one who can practice universal giving What is meant by universal giving Good son a bodhisattva mahdsattva seeks wealth according to the Dharma and gives it away this is called universal giving He always gives with pure thoughts this is called universal giving He might possess little but is willing to give it away this is called universal giving He is able to give away what he loves and to break stinginess this is called universal giving Giving without seeking rewards is called universal giving When giving he does not care if a field of blessings or not this is called universal giving He gives to foes and friends equally this is called universal giving a There are two kinds of objects to whom the bodhisattva gives his wealth sentient beings and nonsentient beings To these he does not spare anything including his own life this is called universal giving The bodhisattva gives out of compassion this is called universal giving Before during and after giving he does not feel regret this is called universal giving He should not offer at any time impure things to the dead in order to please them He never gives alcohol poisons swords shades and so on to people whether they have attained selfmasteiy or not He does not give impure food or medicine to the sick nor does he steal as little as On Miscellaneous Subjects one penny so as to give The bodhisattva obtains selfmastery through giving and he does not beat or scold servants to make them angry or cause them to suffer He gives away wealth properly without seeking rewards in this life or future lives After having given he often thinks of the faults of afflictions and deeply con templates the subtle merits of nirvana He seeks nothing but enlightenment When he gives to the poor he brings forth compas sionate thoughts Wfiien he gives to fields of blessings he arouses joyful and respectful thoughts And when he gives to his friends he does not have thoughts of laxity When he sees the supplicants he knows what they want and gives accordingly without their asking for it Why does he so give To give without being asked produces immeasurable results Good son there are three kinds of givers superior medium and inferior The inferior refers to anyone who does not believe in karmic consequences is very stingy fears to exhaust his wealth and feels angry with supplicants The medium refers to anyone who believes in karmic consequences but is stingy and afraid of exhausting his wealth he arouses the thought of giving when he sees the supplicant The superior refers to anyone who deeply believes in karmic consequences is not stingy with his wealth considers it as impermanent feels happy if he can give to supplicants and feels sorry if he cannot give The medium giver gives but slights and disrespects  The superior giver gives before being asked and gives respectfully Again the inferior giver gives for present rewards the medium giver gives for future rewards and the superior giver gives out of compassion Again the inferior giver gives in fear of his superior the medium giver gives for his own purpose and the superior giver gives without making distinctions between foes or friends Again the inferior giver is defined as one who has wealth but denies it The medium giver is Chapter XIX defined as one who has much wealth but says he has little The inferior giver viciously reproaches the supplicant the medium giver honestly tells the supplicant that he has nothing to give and the superior giver feels ashamed and soriy for having nothing to give to the supplicant Good son the inferior giver is often reproached by sages the medium giver is always pitied and the superior giver is well liked by them Good son a wise person practices giving so as to benefit himself and others He realizes that wealth is impermanent In order to cause sentient beings to bring forth joyful thoughts to have compassion  to eradicate stinginess not to seek rewards and to adorn the path of enlightenment a bodhisattva gives everything without regret or fear that his wealth will be exhausted He draws near beneficial friends to accept good advice When he sees the supplicant he is as delighted as a person who has rescued his wealth from his burning house He rejoices in praising and speaking of the faults of attachments to wealth After giving he is as happy as if he had entrusted to a good person He says to the supplicant You are really the cause o f my meritorious virtue It is because of your supplication that I am able to be rid of covetous thoughts  He thus has loving thoughts for the supplicant After having given he then teaches him to keep the gift properly and to make offerings diligently to the Treasures of the Buddha the Dharma and the Sangha A bodhisattva who gives joyfully like this is able to avoid laxity Even when he sacrifices his own life he never gives rise to even one vicious thought but increases kindness compassion joy and equanimity He neither slights the receiver nor thinks highly of himself He feels fortunate to give wealth in accordance with the supplicants wishes His faith develops and he does not doubt the karmic results On Miscellaneous Subjects Good son if a person can see wealth as impermanent and considers sentient beings as his only son he can give to any c supplicant Good son he cannot be moved by the affliction of stinginess just as Mount Sumeru cannot be moved by the wind Such a person can be a refuge for sentient beings and can achieve the perfection of giving Good son a wise person rejoices in giving for four reasons giving can destroy afflictions from giving one makes various vows giving makes one happy and from giving one becomes wealthy Good son the noncovetous mind is called giving What is meant by noncovetousness It is because the practice of giving eradicates stinginess greed jeal ousy hatred and stupidity Why is it that one makes various vows from practicing giving It is because through the practice of giving one can make various good or bad vows from which one attains good or bad results And why is this It is because of the power of the vow Why is it that giving makes one happy Because of giving one enjoys mundane and heavenly happiness all the way up to unsurpassed happiness Why is it that giving makes one wealthy Because of giving one obtains gold silver or even animals as sought or wished Good son if a person gives joyfully he destroys five bad attitudes Avoiding these his mindis joyful And because of this joy he eventually attains true liberation Good son if a person cultivates giving without regret then even if he falls into hell because of some adventitious affliction he will not suffer from hunger or thirst in that unwholesome place Because of this he is always spared two kinds of suffering the suffering from the iron ball and the suffering from liquid iron  If he becomes an animal he can easily acquire what he Chapter XIX Heeds and lacks nothing If he becomes a hungry ghost he does not suffer from hunger or thirst but is always satisfied If he is born as a human he excels others in longevity physical strength happi ness eloquence faith precepts learning and wisdom Although he might live during a decadent age he does no evil Even when disasters happen he does not fall from the path And he does not become afraid in fearful places If he is born as a god he excels in ten aspects to Sr  Wn  t destry an B e c a u s e of this the Tathagata is called the unsurpassed Honored One Good son after giving a wise person does not expect loving thoughts from the receiver in return He does not seek fame or to be free from fear nor does he expect good people to become his followers a He does not seek worldly or heavenly rewards And why does he do this Such wealth will not follow me when I die Therefore I should give it away personally and should not become annoyed after giving but on the contrary should rejoice at giving accordingly Good son the giver should first test his own mind by giving external things After his mind is disciplined he can give away internal things Good son just as a person who travels a great distance with a heavy load becomes very tired and feels relieved after being unburdened o f it so the practitioner of giving who sees the suppli cant and gives him his wealth feels delighted Good son the wise person often thinks thus I would rather give away my wealth than have it follow me to my next life He deeply contemplates the suffering resulting from poverty and the happiness resulting from riches Thus he always mindfully takes delight in giving Good son if a wealthy person tells the supplicant that he has nothing  you should know that he is speaking of the poverty and shallow virtue in his future lives Good son if a poor person says he has On Miscellaneous Subjects nothing  this cannot be true And why cannot this be true There is no one who does not have access to water or grass  It is not necessarily true that a king is able to give and that the poor are not able to give And why is this Even the poor have some food After he has eaten he can give away the leftovers or give the water used to wash the dishes to those in need and thus he will attain merits If he feeds ants with a bit of noodle he can also gain immeasurable rewards Who in the world can be so poor that he does not even have a little bit of noodle Who could be so poor that he does not have three handfuls of noodles in a day Therefore people should give half of their food away to beggars Good son who is so poor that he has no clothes and thus has to go naked If he has clothes why can he not have one piece of cloth to give someone to bandage a sore or give even a small part of his possessions for making a lamp wick Good son who in the world is so poor that he does not have a body Since everyone has a body when he sees others creating merits he should happily and untiringly help He can thus be called a giver and gain blessings and virtue Some gifts may be worse than the same as or better than others Because of this when I received food from King Prasenajit I stated that the blessings and merits attained through giving by the king and by the poor are not different Good son just as a person who buys rubbing incense powdered incense scatter ing incense or burning incense smells its fragrance so do other people who come into contact with these four kinds of incense The fragrance smelled by the buyer of the incense and by the one who comes into contact with it is not different The incense does not lose its smell even a little bit The same is true of the cultivation of giving Whether much or little gross or subtle if one joyfully helps or rejoices when seeing others  the rewards one receives are not different  because their thoughts are the same Good son if one has nothing to give and becomes unhappy when seeing others give and has doubts with regard to the fields of blessings he is really poor If a person has much wealth is free Chapter XIX from obstructions and there is a good field of blessings to accept his offerings but still he has no faith and cannot give he is just b as poor Therefore a wise person should give according to his own resources Except by giving no one can attain the mundane and heavenly bliss to the level of unsurpassed bliss Therefore I said in a sutra that even if a wise person was in the situation whereby he would live if he ate the last handful of food but would die if he gave it away he should still give it away How much more so if he had a large amount of food Good son a wise person should contemplate the imperma nence of wealth Because of its impermanence it can be uselessly exhausted in immeasurable lives Although it is impermanent it can be given to do immense benefit So why be stingy and not give The wise person should further contemplate that if he keeps precepts and hears much of the Dharma because of the strength derived from these practices he can even attain arhatship How ever even this fruition cannot eliminate the suffering from hunger thirst and so forth Some arhats do not even have enough houses clothes food bedding or medicine because they did not practice giving in previous lives If a precept transgressor has happily practiced giving even if he falls into the lifepath of a hungry ghost or an animal he is often well fed and lacks nothing Good son one cannot achieve the two fruitions selfmastery and liberation without the perfection of giving Although a preceptholder can be reborn in a heaven if he does not cultivate giving he will not receive superb food or adornments If one wishes for worldly happiness and unsurpassed bliss one should joyfully give The intelligent person should see that samsara is bound less and so are pleasures Therefore he should give for the sake of severing samsara and should not seek pleasures He should further reflect Even if I were so rich as to own the four conti nents of the world and were able to enjoy immeasurable pleas ures I would never be content Therefore I should practice giving for the unsurpassed bliss and not for worldly and heav enly bliss And why is this On Miscellaneous Subjects c Good son someone might say The giver the receiver and the enjoyer are themselves the five aggregates which are impermanent and so in giving things to the imperma nent five aggregates who is it that can receive Although there is no receiver  the wholesome result is not annihilated even though there is neither the giver nor the receiver You should then ask him Are there giving and receiving If he answers that giving is giving and receiving is the self you should say The same is true for me Who is it that receives you should say Listen attentively to what I say to you Is the seed permanent or impermanent If the answer is permanent ask How is it that the sprout can grow only after the seed has broken If he sees the error he may say impermanent You should say to him If it is impermanent how is it that it grows into a sprout if you apply fertilizer and water and put soil on it If he argues that the seed is impermanent and it is the work that makes the sprout grow you should say the same is true of the five aggregates It is not right to say that there is already a sprout in the seed and the effect of man water and fertilizer are merely its auxiliary causes And why is this The auxiliary cause does not cause things to increase or decrease they just remain as they are But water and fertilizer cause the sprout to grow and therefore what is non existent comes into being If you say that there are two kinds of auxiliary causes a major and a minor and if you then conclude that the major will have a large effect and the minor a small effect just as a large lamp casts a brighter light than a small lamp then you are making a mistake Does a seed grow as tall as a man in a day or an hour just because you add a lot of fertilizer and water You may argue Although there are two kinds of auxiliary causes they both must wait for the right time  A great cause creates a big effect whereas a small cause creates a little effect Therefore I say that the auxiliary causes do not increase This argument is not true And why is it not true It Chapter XIX dh mas  pe       Good son seeds and sprouts are different Despite the differt  e o f SCmS  b  COn n  btWeen themJ    true of the five aggregates You maintain that the doer is the self and the eceiver is the body and therefore conclude that the doer and the recmver are different It is the self that observes the precept o f not mg and the body that receives the reward of fine features From this mistaken understanding you adopt the erroneous view that the receiver without any cause and the doer is not the result If someone argues If the body receives the result o f the r t u l t o f l e  telf thr i f mUSt bG HkeWiSe that ne e esult of the actions of other people you should in response say to clothes d   fr m the Self The body needs food clothes and ornaments g i  e dr r on causes and cnditionswhat  If the self undergoes sorrow or happiness then why does one person not receive retribution from anothers actions For example a man who takes cheese to gain strength may after ng it for some time gain both strength and fine features An gly skinny man seeing this wishes to be endowed with the same fine features Why is it so Because of the similarity a Good son someone may argue that the aggregates being impermanent lack continuity and that therefore there is no retri bution And why is it not true In my teaching there are cases in which the doer is actually the receiver the doer is different from the receiver and there is neither doer nor receiver The doer being actually the receiver refers to cases in which the aggregates receive the effect of their own actions The doer being different from the receiver refers to such a case as one in which a man does an action but receives the effect at another stage of existence Neither doer nor receiver means that since action is merely the result of a combination of causes and conditions it has no original selfnature and consequently there can be neither a doer nor a receiver of retribution And why is this view incorrect The same is true of the five aggregates They are different at different stages of existence yet there is continuity Therefore it is correct to say there are cases in which the doer is actually the receiver the doer is different from the receiver and there is neither doer nor receiver Apart from the five aggregates there is no self or thing possessed by a self Whether they advocate that form all the way up to consciousness is the self or that the aggregate of form is the self and the other four aggregates are the possessions of the selfthe same argument goes all the way up to the aggregate of consciousnessit is totally a mistaken view to hold that the self and the five aggregates are separate And why is this In the Buddhist teaching form is not the self because it is impermanent Chapter XIX inactive and dependent Therefore the other four aggregates are not the possessions of the self and likewise neither is the aggregate of consciousness All phenomena are bom as a result of causes reart th    ther ppear to be a doer in ality there is none Through the combination o f causes and conditions phenomena arise so although there appears to be a receiver  in reality there is none This is what is meant by there is neither doer nor receiver If you say that different actions result in different retributions why is it then that one person is not responsible for anothers action when they both Ind Z  are dS f differences the difference o f body personis Z t t h tr Z  Fr Xample  ne nm j diff t er e TlentSBeCaUSe  bdiS and names erent them bodies and speech are different Because their bodies and speech are different their actions are also different Because the actions are different life spans Physical appearances and levels of eloquence are also different erefore it is not possible that Tiente undergoes retribution for Potes action Although both of them possess five aggregates eir feelings thoughts and volitions are different Why is this Because when Fote is enjoying himself Tiente may be suffering or when Fote arouses greed Tiente may arouse anger Although the body and name are one they    real y may be white while Tiente may be black If the same name is taken to have the same meaning then when one man s bom all men should be bom or if one man dies men should die I f you do not agree with that argument you should agree with me that the doer cannot be other than the receiver b If you refute this by saying You maintain that the doer is different from the receiver and so do I As such we have made the eame mstake Why is it that you do not see your own error but see m ine Why is this not correct There are two kinds o f differences that I am referring to momentarily P duced and momentarily becoming extinct and momentarily On Miscellaneous Subjects produced and not momentarily becoming extinct When the pro duction is different the extinction is also different Therefore when I say the receiver is different from the doer or the receiver is the same as the doer I do not make a mistake as you do For example someone who wanted to burn down a village set fire to a bundle of dry grass The fire which in turn brought forth the causes and conditions  burned one hundred miles all the way up to two hundred miles When the head of the village caught the arsonist he asked You evil man Why did you burn the village The arsonist answered It was not I that burned down the village because the fire I set was already extinguished What I have burned was nothing but a bundle of grass I will pay you back two bundles of grass I do not have to pay the rest The head of the village spoke again Idiot Because the small fire you set continued to burn it extended to one hundred miles up to two hundred miles It was your fault Why should you not pay for it Although the former fire is different from the latter fire because of the continuity between them the arsonist is responsible for his crime The same is true of good or bad committed by the five aggregates At the time of receiving retribution one may argue that the aggregates do not take any action Still because of continuity one has to undergo retribution For example a man made a bet with another man that he could carry a torch to a place one hundred miles away After he had held the torch and had run for the one hundred miles he came to collect his bet The other man said The fire of your torch was extinguished as soon as you started running Why do you ask me to pay off the bet The torchholder said Although the initial fire of the torch may have burned up the torch continued to burn till here Both points of view are arguable And why is this Both arguments that the doer and the receiver are the same and that the doer and the receiver are different persons are right That is to say that both the argument that the doer and the receiver are the same and the argument that the doer and the receiver are different are not Chapter XIX mcorreet For example both this bank the other bank and the middle of the river are in totality called the river Ganges In summer the two banks are far apart whereas in autumn they are closer If someone should say that it is not a river the wise would reply that it is a river and also that it is not a river The wise see that this is true of the five aggregates They say that the doer and the receiver are the same c and that the doer and the receiver are different If you say that the two banks are soil the middle of the stream is water and the river god is the river this is not correct And why is it not correct If the river god is the river why does the river sometimes become clean and sometimes dirty Why does the depth of the river differ between the two banks and the middle And why is it that some times the water of the river reaches the ocean and sometimes it does not For example where there is a tree there is the abode of the gods If then there were no tree where would the gods live he same should be said of the river and the gods Therefore the continuity of the two banks and the middle o f the river is m totality called a river If you say at the light o f the lamp increases or decreases this is not true And why is it not true Because the fight momentarily becomes extinct it does not increase Because the fight is momentarily produced it does not decrease Because of its momentary exist ence the light of the lamp either increases or decreases You say that the lamp is impermanent and that the oil is permanent that when there is much oil there is much fight and that when there On Miscellaneous Subjects a is little oil there is little light This is not true Why is it not true Oil is impermanent so it can be burned and exhausted If it is permanent the two concepts should be eternal If so who can ever bum all the oil A knowledgeable person can say that the Atyaya language neither exists nor does not exist To say one or the other is in accordance with reason Then a man comes and states All the property belongs to me An official then says How can this property go to anyone other than a relative The man says I am the seventhgeneration offspring of the deceased man It is as you have said A wise person would also say that the same is true of the five aggregates in which the doer is the receiver and the doer is not the receiver You may argue After the five aggregates have created karma the action is completed Although the body remains as it is the karma depends on nothing If the karma depends on nothing it does not exist And why is it not right All past karma has to wait for the right object and time  For example an orange tree grows oranges and the oranges are sour before they are ripe The orange that grows out from the seed root stalk leaves and flower is not sour yet at the time when it is ripening its flavor is sour The sour flavor originally does not exist but now exists Fruit does not grow without reason rather it is the result Chapter XIX physica Ff e r  rrr  n czzi yr later Thc same is true  ThTrefo r  r  a  he riSh time rt reais ite i I f rC  ls aid that the aggregates have

of giving to follow the way of the sages to destroy their afflictions and to cause them to enter into nirvana and thus sever cyclic existences He practices giving in five ways not discriminating as to whether virtuous or nonvirtuous or good or evil disregarding caste not belittling the supplicant and not scolding him There are three ways of giving that do not result in attaining a superb reward ini tially thinking of giving much but in the end only giving a little choosing inappropriate things to give and having regrets after giving after having given looking for the recipients faults not giving equally after having given asking the to do something in return enjoying praising one self after having given saying that one has nothing before giving scolding after giving asking for double in return after having given and arousing doubts after having given A giver such as this cannot draw near to the Buddhas or the sages To give away things of good color smell taste and touch is pure giving To give things acquired properly is pure giving To give with the thought that wealth is not permanent and lasting is pure giving To give for the purpose of breaking afflictions is pure giving To give in order to purify ones mind is pure giving If one considers who the giver and the receiver are what to give and why to give and what consequences one receives from giving the giving through these reflections involves the twelve entrances  The receiver the giver the causes and conditions of giving and the rewards all involve the twelve entrances To give in this way is pure giving When giving one brings forth a joyful mind toward the fields of blessings The fields of blessings work for meritorious virtues likewise I do so unceasingly Giving to ones wife family members and servants causes them to arouse a Chapter XIX compassionate mind while giving to the poor eliminates their suffering One should not seek worldly rewards when giving Giving is for eradicating arrogance cultivating a gentle mind transcending cyclic existences and seeking unsurpassed liberation One gives because one deeply sees the faults of samsara When giving one should not see a field of blessings or not If one cultivates the land and grows for a livelihood one reaps what one sows Likewise after giving the giver receives rewards of blessings according to what he gives Just as the recipient who accepts attains life body power peace and eloquence the giver also attains these five rewards If one gives to animals one gains a hundred times in return Giving to the precepttransgressor one gains a thousand times in return Giving to the preceptholder one gains a million times in return Giving to the heretics who have done away with desires one gains a million times in return Giving to one who tends toward the way one gains a hundred billion times in return Giving to a streamenterer one gams immeasurable rewards Good son I have distinguished various kinds of fields of bless ings andhave told you hundredfold rewards to immeasurable rewards If one sincerely and compassionately gives to animals the blessings one gains are not different from those which one gains from making offerings to the Buddhas To say hundredfold rewards means that if one gives ones life body strength peace and eloquence the giver wifi gain from one hundred times to immeasurable times what he has given m return
