Why would you make him pay respect to me Then the holy man got up and with palms joined he worshiped the princes by bowing to his feet
The king and queen said to the holy man Please read the marks of the Prince carefully After reading the marks the holy man suddenly started weeping and could not control himself
Seeing the holy mans sorrow the king and the queen were frightened and trembled all over
They were overcome by distress like a small boat tossed around by great waves
They asked the holy man  Are the marks of our child so inauspicious that they cause you to weep The holy man answered The Prince has all the auspicious marks there is nothing inauspicious about him
I am only distressed that I am one hundred and twenty years old this year my life will soon end and I will be reborn in the Heaven of Nothought
So I will not see the Buddha arise and will not be able to hear his scriptural teaching
Therefore I am sad for myself
If a sentient being has the thirtytwo marks but some of the marks are in the wrong places or do not appear clearly for a long time such a person will become a universal monarch without fail
If the thirtytwo marks are all in the right places and also clear such a person will achieve perfect knowledge of all things
I now see that the marks of the great kings Prince are all in the appropriate places and they are also clear
For this reason I know for certain that he will accomplish full awakening When the holy man finished saying this to the king he took his leave and withdrew
The Fobenxing jing says
Great king I deplore that my years are advanced and my faculties have weakened I have declined and am now old
When the time comes for the great event I will not be here to see it
I shall not be able to benefit from this great opportunity
For this reason I now grieve and am saddened
It is not that is inauspicious Then for the kings sake he said in verse I deplore that something is greatly out of order for me And I shall miss this time for attaining the Way I have vainly spent my life without hearing the truth Isnt it the case that I will not be able to benefit from this great opportunity
I am old and my faculties have weakened The time for death is about to arrive and cannot be postponed Thinking that the present generation will experience this great event I am happy and yet distressed at the same time The ākya clan of the great king is about to flourish Having given birth to this boy a person of happiness and merits The world is full of oppressive suffering This Prince will bring peace and happiness to those who are now suffering in the world The Fobenxing jing says
Then Māyā came to the boy and taking his hand and holding his head she turned him toward the holy person as if he were paying respect  to his feet
Thereupon the power of the boys awesome virtue caused his body to turn around by itself with only his feet pointing toward the holy person
King uddhodana came to help the queen and again they turned the boys head toward the holy person to venerate him But the boys power again caused only his feet to turn toward the holy person all by themselves
King uddhodana once again turned the boys head toward the holy man but again the childs body turned so that only his feet pointed toward him
This happened three times in succession
When Asita saw the boy from far away the child sent forth light and illuminated the ground
Due to his awesome virtue the boy was pleasingly handsome his color was that of pure gold his head looked like a jeweled canopy his nose was straight and wellrounded his long arms stretched downward his limbs and joints were correctly formed
Lacking nothing he was endowed with all glorious ornamentation
Then Asita stood up from his seat and said to the king Great king do not try to turn the boys holy head toward me
It is not appropriate for him to pay respect to my feet
I should pay respect to him  his feet He repeated the following words How wonderful
How wonderful
A great being has appeared in the world
It is the most wonderful thing
A great being has appeared in the world
This boy is certainly and truly the person that I heard about from the gods
He does not differ in any respect Then Asita straightened his clothes exposed his right shoulder and knelt on the the ground with his right knee
He stretched out both of his hands and held the boy firmly cradling his head and carried him like that back to his seat
Once he sat down he lowered the child and placed him on his knees
The Fobenxing jing says
Then King uddhodana said to the holy person Great master I wish to always keep my child with me
What means can I employ to make sure that he does not forsake me Asita answered the king Great king I cannot say for sure what means you can employ to prevent the Prince from abandoning the householders life Then King uddhodana spoke again to the holy man Great master please listen to me
I will now employ various means
Once I have employed these means I will be able to keep my child from now through his childhood until he reaches adulthood from abandoning me even for a short while and leaving the householders life The holy person Asita then asked the king Great king why do you say such things King uddhodana answered the holy man Asita The honored teacher should know that all the oracle readers within my kingdom told me If the child stays in the world he will become a universal monarch That is why I say such things Asita then said to the king Great king you should know that those oracle readers were all terribly wrong these superior marks are not the marks of a universal monarch
Now this child has one hundred good marks and eighty secondary marks
These marks are outstanding and he is endowed with them most clearly and brilliantly King uddhodana then asked the holy person Great master what are the eighty secondary marks Asita  the king in detail
Here the text gives the eighty marks The passage is similar to those in scriptures I will give the list here following the Shengtianwang jing The Shengtianwang jing says
The Buddha himself said The eighty marks consist of the following
No one can see the top of his head The bone on top of his head is firm and solid His brow is wide and flat His eyebrows are high and long shaped like the crescent moon emerald blue in color His eyes are long His nose is high rounded and straight the nostrils are not visible His earlobes are thick wide and long and form a circular disc His body is solid like that of the deity Nārāyaṇa His body is indestructible The joints of his body are taut When he turns his body he looks like an elephant king His body is radiant His body is properly conditioned He is always young and never grows old His body has a rich texture His body defends itself against danger and he does not depend on others His body has all the necessary attributes His mind has all the necessary attributes He is endowed with proper appearance His awesome virtue is widely known and honored Everyone faces toward him His dwelling place is safe and secure there are no dangerous disturbances there His face is of the right size neither too large nor too long His face is broad and flat His face is round like the full moon He does not look thin or haggard His movements are like that of an elephant king His appearance is like that of a lion king He walks like a goose His head is shaped like a madana fruit The color of his body is pleasantly bright The soles of his feet are thick His nails are like red copper leaves When he walks a pattern imprints on the ground His fingers are gloriously decorated with various patterns The patterns on his fingers are clear The patterns on his palms are clear and straight The lines on his palms are long The lines on his palms are not broken He can move his arms and legs freely His arms and legs are red and white in color like lotus flowers His body is equipped with the proper orifices The length of his steps when walking is never too short The length of his steps when walking is never too long His steps when walking are stable and wellbalanced His naval is deep and thick it looks like a snake coiled up in a clockwise position His hands are blue and red in color and look like the head of a peacock His hair is rich and clean in color The hair on his body curls clockwise An unsurpassably pleasant fragrance comes out of his mouth both his body and hair also have the same fragrance His lips are red and look like a bimba fruit His lips are moist and well in proportion to each other His tongue is thin He observes everything with pleasure He follows the wishes of sentient beings and talks to them in a relaxed and happy manner Everywhere he speaks nothing but good words When he sees someone he always speaks first His voice is neither too high nor too low and accords with the criteria for pleasant speech among sentient beings When he preaches he uses the speech of the sentient beings  His preaching is not conspicuous He views sentient beings impartially He first observes and then acts He answers many questions by uttering one sound The sequence of his preaching is well ordered No sentient being can read all his marks Whatever he observes he is not repulsed by it He is able to produce all sounds and languages He manifests good colors Strong people submit when they see him those who are fearful attain peace when they see him His voice is clear and pure His body does not bend sideways His body is large His body is tall His body is not polluted Rays of light one zhang long illuminate his body throughout The light that illuminates his body moves as he moves His body is pure The rich color of the light is like that of a blue jewel His hands and feet are endowed with all good attributes His hands and feet have the character virtue inscribed on them

The Tathāgatas mark of a beautiful voice
by means of the marvelous great seed in the Buddhas throat he can utter happy and graceful sound like that of the kalaviṅka bird he can also utter the sound of deep and distant thunder like akras drum
These sounds have eight meritorious characteristics they are deep and distant harmonious and graceful clear pleasant to the ear endearing to the mind they give rise to joy they are easy to understand and they never cause fatigue
The Dazhidu lun says
The Tathāgata has a beautiful voice
Like heavenly king Brahmā five kinds of sounds come out of his mouth
they are very deep like thunder very clear penetrating very far and they bring happiness to those who hear them perceived as lovely in peoples minds easily understood and such that listeners wish to hear more and never tire of hearing them
Bodhisattvas utter these five kinds of sounds from their mouths
These sounds are lovely like the sound of the kalaviṅka bird and deep and distant like the sound of the heavenly deity akras drum
The new Posha lun says Question
What is the meaning of mark
Answer
It means a sign of excellence and auspiciousness Question
Why does the Courageous One have only thirtytwo marks neither more nor less
The Buddhas attendant said If there were either more or less that would cause doubt
If there are thirtytwo marks in accordance with the teaching of marks then everyone in the world will agree that this is an auspicious sign
If the number is neither more nor less and if the thirtytwo marks decorate the Buddhas body he is the Most Superior One Beyond Comparison in the world
If there were fewer signs then his power would be insufficient
If more then the signs would become disorderly
Neither of these is good
Therefore the Courageous One has thirtytwo marks The Zhidu lun says
Question In the classification of the three types of actions action of which category plants the seed for these thirtytwo marks
Answer It is mental action not physical acts or speech
This is because mental action is sharper
Also in the list of six kinds of consciousness it is mind consciousness that plants seeds not any of the other five kinds of sense consciousness
This is because the other five kinds of consciousness are incapable of making distinctions
Question
How much time is necessary to mature the seeds for these thirtytwo marks
Answer
One hundred world ages at the longest and ninetyone world ages at the shortest
ākyamuni Bodhisattva attained the thirtytwo marks after ninetyone world ages
A scripture tells the following story
A very long time ago during the time of a buddha called Tiṣya there were two bodhisattvas
one was called ākyamuni and the other Maitreya
Tiṣya Buddha wished to see whether or not ākyamuni Bodhisattvas mind had been purified and matured
Upon observation he learned that the Bodhisattvas mind was not yet purified and matured but the minds of all of his disciples had all been purified and matured
He also learned that Maitreya Bodhisattvas mind had already been purified and matured but that the minds of his disciples had not yet been purified and matured
Tiṣya Buddha then thought that it is easy to transform the mind of one person but difficult to mature the minds of many people
After thinking this Tiṣya Buddha wished to cause ākyamuni Bodhisattva to attain buddhahood quickly so he climbed the Himalayas and entering a jeweled cave he began the fire meditation
At that time ākyamuni Bodhisattva was a holy person in a nonBuddhist religion
He climbed into the mountains looking for medicine and saw Tiṣya Buddha sitting in a jeweled cave having entered the fire meditation he was emitting great light from his person
When ākyamuni saw this a feeling of joy and respect arose in the Bodhisattvas mind
For seven days and nights he stood still with one leg raised his hands crossed in front facing the Buddha observing him with great concentration never even blinking his eyes
He praised the Buddha in verse
Neither in heaven nor in this world is there anyone like the Buddha And in all the worlds in ten directions there is none comparable to him I have seen everything in the worlds There is no other one who is like the Buddha
Observing the Worldhonored One for seven days and nights without even blinking his eyes ākyamuni Bodhisattva skipped over nine world ages and achieved highest enlightenment in the ninetyfirst world age
The Bodhisattva values the thoughts in the mind and not wordy speech
If he had praised the Buddha with more verses he would have disturbed Tiṣyas mind
Therefore during the long period of seven nights he praised the Buddha with only this one verse
Question
Why was ākyamuni Bodhisattvas mind not yet purified and matured while the minds of his disciples were purified and matured and why was Maitreya Bodhisattvas mind purified and matured while the minds of his disciples were still impure
Answer
ākyamuni Bodhisattva paid more attention to benefiting sentient beings and was less concerned about himself
Maitreya Bodhisattva was concerned more about himself than about sentient beings The Dewugoun jing says
The Buddha said A bodhisattva obtains the thirtytwo marks of the Coura geous One through completing four deeds
These four deeds are
scattering gold on the Buddha frequently making offerings of oil to a tathāgatas stupa presenting the gift of worship by giving various kinds of flowers and incense or dancing and playing music and attending and looking after masters and teachers  Then the Buddha spoke in verse
Scattering gold over the Buddha Rubbing fragrant oil on the Buddhas stupa Making offerings of flowers incense and music And respectfully attending to the teachers If you perform these four deeds You will obtain the thirtytwo marks You will be handsome and extraordinarily beautiful Endowed with all virtuous characteristics The Bodhisattva obtains the eighty secondary marks by completing four deeds
These four deeds are
decorating the Buddhas seat with various kinds of beautiful cloth attending to others tirelessly not fighting and causing disorder at the teachers place and teaching sentient beings to cultivate the practice that leads to enlightenment Then the Worldhonored One spoke in verse
With beautiful clothes decorating the Buddhas seat Attending to others tirelessly Teaching the highest wisdom to sentient beings One easily obtains the eighty secondary marks If a bodhisattva cultivates these things Because of these four virtuous deeds He is always ornamented with superior features The new Posha lun says
Question Where are the eighty secondary marks located
Answer They are located among the primary marks
They follow the primary marks and ornament the body of the Buddha most beautifully
Question Do the primary and secondary marks interfere with and obstruct each other
Answer They do not
The primary and secondary marks accentuate each other more clearly in the same way that flowers in a forest accentuate the trees in the forest more clearly
The primary and secondary marks ornament the Buddhas body in the same manner as many jewels decorate the gold mountain
Question What are the differences between the thirtytwo marks obtained by the Bodhisattva and the marks of a universal monarch
Answer The marks obtained by the Bodhisattva are superior in four respects they are more brilliant clearer fuller and located in the right places
Another list gives these five points of superiority of the marks as they are located in the right places they are correct and awesome they are more deeply patterned they are accompanied by superior wisdom and they are free from defilement
The Fo apitan jing says
All the merits of the sentient beings in the worlds as many as one thousand units of the incalculable number  constitute a single hair follicle of the Buddha
If this amount of merit the merit of a single hair follicle were multiplied by the number of all the hair follicles on the Buddhas body the resulting amount of merit would be sufficient to constitute one secondary mark of the Buddha
In this way one can calculate the merit of the eighty secondary marks If that amount of merit is then multiplied one hundred times the resulting amount is sufficient to constitute the merit of one primary mark on the Buddhas body
If one multiplies by one thousand times the merit of thirtytwo primary marks thus obtained the resulting amount of merit is sufficient to constitute the merit of the primary mark of one white hair on the Buddhas brow
If one multiplies by one hundred times the amount of merits for one thousand white hairs the resulting amount is sufficient to constitute the merit of the primary mark of the bony protuberance on top of the Tathāgatas head
Even flying deities cannot see the top of his head
Such pure merits beyond our comprehension together constitute the Buddhas body
Therefore the Tathāgata is the most superior among gods and humans
The Youposaijie jing says
The Buddha said The Bodhisattva cultivates merit for each of the marks and surrounds each one with one hundred units of merit
There are fifty kinds of cultivating minds and fifty kinds of reflection minds
Thus one hundred kinds of merit are mentioned here
Good friends all the merit of all the worlds together are less than the merit of one hair of the Tathāgata
The merit of all of the Tathāgatas hair is less than the merit of one of his secondary marks
All the merit of the eighty secondary marks together is less than the merit of one of his primary marks
All the merits of all the primary marks together is less than the merit of the mark of one of his white hairs
The merit of the mark of his white hairs is less than the merit of the mark of the invisible protuberance on the top of his head
An infinite amount of merit has been achieved by the Tathāgata and is present in him
These thirtytwo marks are the result of his great compassion The new Posha lun says Question
A sutra says that the Buddha cultivates merits for each of his marks and decorates each mark with a hundred units of merits
What are these hundred units of merits
Answer Here one hundred thoughts are called one hundred units of merit
What are the one hundred kinds of thoughts
When the Bodhisattva performs deeds for constituting the mark of secure feet he first gives rise to fifty thoughts in order to condition his body to make it pure and adaptable
Then he gives rise to one thought to secure the mark
He then gives rise to the fifty thoughts again to make the mark full and perfect
This process may be compared to the work of a farmer first he conditions the soil then he plants the seeds and then he nourishes the seeds by providing water and fertilizer The cases of the other marks of the Buddha are also similar to this
the work for the mark of secure feet consists of the ornamentation through one hundred thoughts going from this mark at the bottom upward to the mark at the top the accomplishment of the mark of the uṣṇīṣa  is also the same
For this reason the Buddha said  cultivate merits for each of the marks and ornaments each one with one hundred units of merits Question
What are the fifty thoughts
Answer Each of the ten good deeds is accompanied by five thoughts
The practice of avoiding killing is accompanied by the thought of avoiding killing the thought of encouraging others to follow the right way the thought of praise the thought of joy and the thought of transferring merits which means transferring the merit of this cultivation toward achieving enlightenment
Similarly each practice constituting the list of the ten good deeds up till the last item the practice of correct view is accompanied by five thoughts
The sum total of these thoughts is what is called the fifty thoughts According to another view each of the ten good deeds gives rise to five kinds of thoughts low middle high higher and ultimate
This is similar to the situation of miscellaneous practices of meditation
According to still another view each of the ten good deeds gives rise to the following five thoughts
purity of practice fundamental purity the purity that arises afterward not harming and the compassionate thought of saving sentient beings
According to another view the conditions for each of the Buddhas marks arise and last for fifty moments
Those who have not cultivated these thoughts miss these conditions and continue transmigrating 
Question What is the quantity of each of these one hundred units of merits
According to one view the karmic condition sufficient to acquire the throne of a universal monarch who is born freely anywhere in the four continents is equivalent in quantity to one unit of merit
According to another view the karmic condition sufficient to acquire the throne of the deity akra who is born freely anywhere among the gods of Brahmās and akras heavens is equivalent in quantity to one unit of merit
According to yet another view the karmic condition sufficient to acquire the throne of the ruler of the uppermost heaven belonging to the realm of desire  who is reborn anywhere among the deities of the realm of desire is equivalent in quantity to one unit of merit
According to another view the karmic condition sufficient to acquire the throne of the god Brahmā who is born freely either in the realm of desire or as one of those in the first stage of meditation in the realm of form is equivalent in quantity to one unit of merit
According to another view the merit that the deva king Brahmā the ruler of the sahā world accumulated by requesting the Buddha to turn the wheel of the Dharma is equivalent in quantity to one unit of merit
Question When he made the request to the Buddha King Brahmās mind was free from defilement and transcended the distinction between good and evil which belong to the realm of desire
How can you call that merit
Explanation
When the king who lived in the Brahmā world wanted to come and make this request he first gave rise to the following good thought
I will benefit sentient beings by requesting the Buddha to turn the wheel of the Dharma If one calls this Brahmās merit that would be wrong
The merit was achieved not before but after the action had taken place
This being the case the matter can be explained as follows
after making his request to the Buddha King Brahmā returned to his palace
Later when the Worldhonored One turned the wheel of the Dharma earthly deities sang and the sound spread and reached Brahmās palace
When Brahmā heard the sound he was overjoyed and congratulated himself his mind became pure and he felt great joy and only at this point was the merit achieved
According to yet another view when the world came into being the karmic powers of all sentient beings became stronger and were capable of producing three thousand chiliocosms
This power is equivalent in quantity to one unit of merit
According to another view excluding the case of those bodhisattvas near the rank of the Buddha the karmic conditions of all sentient beings capable of producing prosperity and happiness are equivalent in quantity to one unit of merit
Another view explains the quantity of merit by means of an illustration
If all sentient beings were born blind and if one sentient being restored their sight with great skill the merit of that sentient being would be equivalent in quantity to one unit of merit
Or if all sentient beings drank poison and suffering uncontrollably were about to die but one sentient being removed the poison from them all and caused them to recover consciousness the merit of that sentient being would be equivalent in quantity to one unit of merit
Or if all sentient beings were arrested examined and were about to be executed but one sentient being released them and saved their lives the merit of that sentient being would be equivalent in quantity to one unit of merit
Or if all sentient beings violated the precepts and held mistaken views but one sentient being corrected them both in regard to the precepts and the views they held then the merit of that sentient being would be equivalent in quantity to one unit of merit
Evaluation
These views are all skillful means that give rise to pure mental pleasure
These views praise the quantity of the Bodhisattvas merit but none of them describes the facts
The fact is that the quantity of the merit produced by the Bodhisattva is infinite because he has accumulated all perfections over a period three times the infinite number of world ages and has made an extremely broadly encompassing vow
Only the Buddha can comprehend the extent of his merit others cannot comprehend it
This amount of merit multiplied by one hundred decorates one mark
Each of the thirtytwo marks contains one hundred units of merits
The Buddha thus has thirtytwo sets of one hundred units of merit ornamenting his body along with the eighty secondary marks
Therefore he is the Most Honorable and Most Superior One among gods and humans Introduction The Teacher Sports and Calculation 
I have heard that the one who has attained perfect knowledge of all things in all respects is called Siddhārtha
He began his career at the beginning of three infinite numbers of world ages ago he stood at the lonely apex of accomplishment at the end of one hundred world ages
The whole realm of Dharma is his knowledge and empty space is his body
Thus his body is beyond measurement beyond the limits of all measurement
His wisdom uses everything and transcends the limits of all mental representations
He cannot be fathomed by inference from human affairs
How could he be discussed here
In order to open up the sight and hearing of ignorant people and point to the shadows and traces he once again appeared among heretics taking the form of a child
This was in order to guide ordinary beings by joining the same category of beings as they were and teaching others by taking a form that was alien to him
After this he was praised as the Supreme One and a god among gods
Because he passes through the stages of the ignorant and wise mysteriously and his ordinary and holy forms are difficult to distinguish his virtue is beyond human understanding and is a greater accomplishment than any other
The Fobenxing jing says
At that time King uddhodana realizing that the Prince was now eight years old Note The Yinguo jing Tc says he was seven years old gathered his officials ministers and the prime minister and told them You must know who is the wisest man in the realm under my control whose knowledge is the most extensive and who is thus best qualified to be the Princes teacher The ministers replied Great king at the present time Viśvamitra knows the treatises most excellently and marvelously
This great teacher is qualified to teach the Prince Note
This passage has been abbreviated here The king sent his men out to bring this teacher to him and then asked him Honorable great teacher can you teach all the arts books and treatises to my Prince Viśvamitra answered Great king I submit to my sovereigns orders
I am capable of teaching him and I am delighted to do so Thus with five hundred boys of the ākya clan in front and behind him to his left and right and with countless other children following them the Prince went up to the study hall
When the great teacher saw the prince from afar the power of the Princes irresistible virtue caused the teacher to suddenly rise from his seat and lower his head to bow at the Princes feet
After he finished paying his respects all those who were nearby and had witnessed the scene felt embarrassed
Viśvamitra felt ashamed for having claimed to be able to teach such a great being
A god called Jingmiao appeared in the sky
He had come from the heavenly palace in Tuṣita Heaven where he had once guarded the prince constantly along with an infinite number of the greatest heavenly kings This god was in the sky but he did not show his body
He spoke in verse
All worldly arts And all scriptures and treatises All these this man knows exhaustively and is capable of teaching Because this one who is superior to all sentient beings Is following and conforming to the ways of this world Even though he has been studying for a long time He now adopts the form of following a teacher to study All knowledge that leads one to renounce this world All truths and all powers These are all the things that are produced by karmic conditions They arise and disappear into nothing In one thoughtinstant he realizes knowledge of all these things That they are nothing other than appearing and disappearing names and forms If even of this profound truth he can achieve definitive knowledge How much more so of mere words and letters
When the god finished uttering this verse many kinds of flowers fell over the Prince and he immediately returned to the palace
When the Prince began his study he took his writing board made of the best and most beautiful oxhead sandalwood its four rims decorated with seven jewels and the back surface rubbed with many kinds of specially fragrant heavenly incense and went to the teacher Viśvamitra
He said Honorable teacher which books will you teach me The script of Brahmās teaching  the Karoṣṭhī script the script of the sage Puṣpas teaching the puṣkarasāri script the aṅga script the maṅgalya script the xiemeini script the aṅgulīya script the xie nanika script the śakāri script the brahmavali script the pāruṣya script the fuyu script the vetāla script the drāviḍa script the kirāta script the dākṣiṇya script the ugra script the sāṃkhyā script the avamūrdha script the anuloma script the piyemeishala script the darada script the aparagoḍānī script the khāṣya  script the madhyā hāriṇī script the ṛṣitapas taptā rocamānā script the dharaṇīprekṣiṇī script the gaganaprekṣiṇī script the sarvauṣa dhi niṣyandā script the sarvasārasaṃgrahaṇī script and the sarvabhūtarutagrahaṇī script
Having mentioned these scripts the prince again asked the teacher Viśvamitra There are altogether sixtyfour kinds of scripts
I do not know which scripts the Honorable One intends to teach me When Viśvamitra heard the Prince recite the scripts he was delighted and happy but he was also secretly embarrassed
Overcoming his pride and arrogance he spoke to the Prince in verse
A man of rare purity and wisdom Yet well informed about the many teachings of the world You are yourself widely educated in all the treatises Yet you have come to my study hall The names of these scripts even I do not know To have learned all these scripts so that one can recite them This is the great honorable way among gods and humans Yet still you wish to seek a teacher
Spiritual truth has no sound we describe its meaning by means of speech
Spoken words leave no visible trace we diagram their sound by means of letters
Thus letters are the fish trap for speech speech is the fish trap for snaring the truth
If sound and meaning match then we should not deviate from the point
Thus when letters resonate and function correctly they reach everywhere in the universe
Their traces are bound to brush and ink yet the principle expressed in them matches spiritual reality
Three ancient masters invented writing
The oldest one was called Brahmī his writing went from left to right
The second one was called Kharoṣṭhī his writing went from right to left
The youngest one was called Cang Jie his writing went from top to bottom
Brahmī and Kharoṣṭhī resided in India
Cang Jie who was the court historian of the Yellow Emperor lived in China
Brahma and Kharoṣṭhī followed the practice in heaven Cang Jie patterned his writing after the traces of birds feet
Their writings indeed differed but the truth they transmitted is the same
There are sixtyfour kinds of scripts The Buddhas teaching at the turning of the Dharma wheel in the Deer Park was recorded in written records in an orderly fashion
The writing styles of the eight categories of beings such as dragons and supernatural beings are all different
People followed Brahmī and Kharoṣṭhī and considered theirs to be the superior writing system in this world
Therefore many kingdoms in India call these the writings of the gods
The manuscripts of the scriptures in the West are all based on Sanskrit sources
Yet there are frequently differences among the thirtysix kingdoms
These differences may be compared to the different styles of writing in China such as the Zhuan and Zhou styles
Thus the old writing of Cang Jie changed over generations and became the Zhou style the Zhou style changed to the Zhuan style the Zhuan style was transformed into the Li style
The changes were numerous and produced the eight styles of writing which were then used to describe the immortals dragons and miraculous grasses they produced the twentyfour writing styles used in sacrifices and acupuncture These writing styles are numerous and their uses are limited
To return to the fundamentals however all writing styles are exhausted in the six principles for the formation of characters
If our interest is in convenient and speedy writing then nothing is more appropriate than the Li style of writing
The origin of the Eastern and Western methods of writing can be clarified in this fashion
The Fobenxing jing says
Then King uddhodana gathered his ministers together again and said Where is a teacher skilled in martial arts who can teach my Prince The ministers replied to the king There is in our realm a man of the ākya clan whose name is Shanque
His son who is called Kṣāntideva Note In Chinese Rentian is qualified to teach military skills to the Prince
He is versed in the twentynine kinds of martial arts and is clever and skillful
Kṣāntideva said to the king I am indeed qualified to teach the Prince The king built a garden for the Prince and called it Qinqu 
The Prince then went into the garden to play or to receive a massage from his attendants
Now the five hundred ministers of the ākya clan had all had sons at the same time that the Prince was born
Earlier when all the books and scriptures were taught to the Prince the ministers own children were also taught along with him
Ordinary people of this world study for many years and months yet they do not always master what they have learned
The Prince mastered everything within four years
The other children of the ākya clan also were able to complete their schooling successfully having mastered everything and they could use their knowledge freely without obstruction
At that time Kṣāntideva spoke to the Prince in verse Though you are young You studied in a correct and unhurried manner
Without much effort You quickly understood everything Having studied for only a short period of time You are superior to others who have studied for many years The skills you have learned You have mastered to a higher degree of accomplishment than others The Prince was growing up in the kings palace
As a small child he played and did not study
At the age of eight he went to his teachers and entered the study hall
From the two greatly honored teachers Viśvamitra and Kṣāntideva he learned to read scriptures and treatises as well as to master miscellaneous military skills
After four years when he was twelve years old the Prince had explored and mastered numerous skills and could follow the ways of the world comfortably and happily
Once he was playing in the Qinqu Garden shooting arrows
The other five hundred children were also playing in their own gardens
Then a flock of geese flew over in the sky
At that time the child Devadatta drew his bow powerfully and shot down a goose
The goose that had been shot fell into Siddhārthas garden with the arrow still piercing its body
When the Prince saw the goose fall to the ground injured by an arrow piercing its body he took it gently in his hands and sitting with legs crossed he placed it securely on his lap
While holding the goose gently in his left hand he pulled the arrow out with his right hand and sealed the wound with pure fermented milk and honey
At that point Devadatta sent a messenger to the Prince saying I shot a goose and it fell into your garden Send it to me at once
You may not keep it The Prince replied to Devadattas messenger  If the goose dies I shall return it to you
If it does not die you cannot have it Devadatta sent the messenger back to the Prince with this message
Whether dead or alive you must definitely return the bird
I first shot that goose with my own hands
Why do you intend to keep it for yourself The Prince answered I first adopted this goose while on my path of salvation
The reason is as follows
When I first cherished the intention of seeking enlightenment I adopted all sentient beings on my path of salvation
How could this goose be an exception and not belong to me Due to this incident a conflict arose between the Prince and Devadatta and the elders and wise men of the ākya clan gathered in order to decide the matter between them
At that time a god of the uddhāvāsa heavens transformed himself into an elder and on entering the meeting place of the ākya clan made the following statement
Whoever feeds and raises the goose takes the animal into his possession the one who shot the goose has thrown it away The elders of the ākya clan all agreed with this statement and all together they shouted loudly It is so
It is so
This is how the Humane One speaks These were the circumstances under which Devadatta first formed vengeful thoughts against the Prince
The Yinguo jing says
When the Prince was ten years old he competed with his brothers in athletics
Once when he was about to leave the walled city with his ten thousand attendants there was a large elephant standing at the city gate and people did not dare to pass in front of it
Devadatta hit it on the head with his hand and the elephant dropped to the ground
Nanda kicked the elephant with his toe and hurled it to the roadside
The Prince lifted the elephant in his hands and tossed it outside of the city wall and then caught it again in his hands so that it would not be injured
The elephant revived
At the time people marveled at the unprecedented feat deeply impressed by it
A great multitude of people had arrived from afar from all four directions to observe this event
Inside the garden there were seven kinds of drums golden drums silver drums copper drums iron drums and so on there were seven of each kind of drum
Devadatta shot first and his arrows penetrated three golden drums
Nanda then shot and his arrows also penetrated three drums
The Prince rejected the bow they had used as being insufficient
He had brought from the storage house his ancestors most excellent bow which was so strong that no one could draw the bowstring
The Prince sat down and drew the bow with his hands
His voice could be heard throughout the city
A hundred thousand citizens of the state as well as deities in the sky marveled aloud at this feat When the Prince released the arrow it penetrated all the drums and went into the ground
A spring of water gushed up from the place where the arrow entered the ground
The arrow also passed through the Great Iron Mountain
The Fobenxing jing says The arrow that the Prince shot at this time was picked up in the sky by the heavenly ruler akra  who then directed it to the Heaven of the Thirtythree Gods
When it reached that heaven an arrow festival was established there to honor the special arrow
Regularly on an auspicious day the deities gather to make offerings of incense and flowers to the arrow
This arrow festival is still celebrated by gods today
The prince shot another arrow that went through seven iron wild boars and it then hit the ground and reached the realm of the dead
The place where the arrow entered the ground became a well
Today people constantly praise this arrowwell
The Prince also wrestled with other members of the ākya clan
They all ended up flat on the ground yet their bodies were uninjured
Then all of the youths of the ākya clan together wrestled with the Prince at the same time
As the Prince touched them one by one they fell to the ground
At this time all the members of the ākya clan and the other spectators were impressed by this extraordinary feat
Up in the sky innumerable deities simultaneously uttered the verse
Of all the worlds in ten directions Even all the courageous warriors And all powerful opponents like Devadatta Are not as powerful as one sacred hair on the Princes head The awesome power of the Great Being is unbounded With a momentary touch by his hand all fall to the ground The awesome spiritual power of the Holy One is immense How could you presume to compete with him Even the immovable Mount Sumeru Securely surrounded by iron walls Along with with other mountains in the ten directions The Princes mere touch would crush them all into fine dust Strong whips made of steel and other metals as well as Diamond jewels and all other treasures The power of great wisdom can grind them all into powder Indeed it is a trifling thing for the Prince to wrestle with powerless beings
When the deities finished uttering these verses they scattered many kinds of heavenly flowers over the Prince
They were in the sky but they had hidden their bodies and they were invisible
By this time King uddho dana knew that the Prince surpassed everyone else in all skills but when he saw this with his own eyes he danced in joy
He ordered his men to bring a white elephant decorated with necklaces and lead the Prince into the city riding on it
When the elephant was going out of the city gate Devadatta was at that moment returning to the city from outside
Seeing the white elephant he asked the man  Who gave you permission to take this white elephant out of the city
Where are you taking him to The man replied I am to take the elephant out of the city and lead Siddhārtha back to the city riding on this elephant Jealous Devadatta grasped the elephants trunk with his left hand and hit it on the temple with his right hand causing the animal to drop to the ground
The elephant rolled over three times and died
As the white elephant lay on the ground blocking the gate no traffic could go through the gate
The road was blocked and no one could pass
Another boy called Nanda arrived at that place shortly afterward and asked what had happened
Grasping the tail of the elephant in his right hand he pulled it away from the gate for a distance of about seven steps
The Prince then asked Who pulled the elephant away from the gate People replied Nanda The Prince said Good Nanda
What you did was good The Prince thought These two have demonstrated their power
The elephants body is very large however and later as it rots a bad smell will pervade the area around the gate He then lifted the elephant with his left hand switched it into his right hand and then threw it high into the sky so that it would land outside the city
The elephants body sailed across the seven walls and seven moats and fell to the ground a long distance outside of the city where it made a large hole
At the present time there is a legend among the people in which that place is called the hole where the elephant fell This legend refers to this incident
At that time an incalculable number of hundreds of thousands of sentient beings chanted in one voice How rare
How extraordinary
It is unheard of and then said in verse
Devadatta struck and killed the white elephant Nanda pulled it seven steps away from the gate The Prince lifted it in his hands up to the sky And threw it far beyond the city wall as if it were a lump of earth The Jiyiqiefude sanmei jing says
At that time in the great city of Vaiśālī there was a powerful athlete called Jingweide
He became so strong that none among the sentient beings in the world could match him
When he heard that the ascetic Gautama had achieved the ten powers and the Nārāyaṇa body he thought I should go and see the ascetic Gautama
How could he be me Jingweide went to the Buddha and as soon as he saw the Tathāgata he believed in him and understood 
He bowed to the Tathāgatas feet and singleminded contemplation of the Buddha
The Buddha knew Jingweides original intention and wished to subdue him
He said to Mahāmaudgalyāyana Fetch the arrow that I used when I was a bodhisattva and competed in athletics with members of the ākya clan in front of the beautiful Gopī Mahāmaudgalyāyana said to the Buddha I do not know where it is So the Worldhonored One emitted light from his right foot which illuminated widely the vajra wheel at the bottom of the three thousand worlds
The arrow was firmly attached to the wheel
The Buddha asked Mahāmaudgalyāyana Do you see the arrow Mahāmaudgalyāyana replied I have seen it The Buddha said to Mahāmaudgalyāyana Go get the arrow and bring it here Mahāmaudgalyāyana then went down to the place in an instant
Everyone in the large gathering saw him leave and then immediately return with the arrow and present it to the Tathāgata
The Buddha said The power that my parents gave me enabled me to send the arrow to the vajra wheel
With this supernatural power I would have been able to send the arrow through incalculable and limitless buddha worlds The Jiyiqiefude sanmei jing says
The Buddha said to Mahāmaudgalyāyana The sum total of all the power of all the inferior gods in the four heavenly realms equals the power of one heavenly ruler in these heavens
The sum of the powers of ten heavenly rulers equals the power of one god in the Heaven of the Thirtythree Gods
The sum of the powers of all the gods in the Heaven of the Thirtythree Gods equals the power of the deity akra 
The sum of the power of ten akra deities equals the power of one inferior deity in Yama Heaven
The sum of the power of all the inferior deities in Yama Heaven equals the power of the heavenly ruler in Yama Heaven
The sum of the power of the ten heavenly rulers in Yama Heaven equals the power of one inferior deity in Tuṣita Heaven
The sum of the power of all the inferior deities in Tuṣita Heaven equals the power of one heavenly ruler in Tuṣita Heaven
The sum of the power of ten heavenly rulers in Tuṣita Heaven equals the power of one inferior deity in the Heaven of Enjoying Selfproduced Objects 
The sum of the power of all the inferior deities in the Heaven of Enjoying Selfproduced Objects is equal to the power of one heavenly ruler in the Heaven of Enjoying Selfproduced Objects
The sum of the power of the ten heavenly rulers in the Heaven of Enjoying Selfproduced Objects is equal to the power of one inferior deity in the Heaven of Enjoying Objects Produced by Other Deities 
The sum of the power of all the inferior deities in the Heaven of Enjoying Objects Produced by Other Deities is equal to the power of one heavenly ruler in the Heaven of Enjoying Objects Produced by Other Deities
The sum of the power of the ten heavenly rulers of the Heaven of Enjoying Objects Produced by Other Deities is equal to the power of one inferior deity in Māras heaven
The sum of the power of all the inferior deities in Māras heaven is equal to the power of one heavenly ruler in Māras heaven
The sum of the power of the ten heavenly rulers in Māras heaven equals the power of a halfNārāyaṇa
The sum of the power of ten of these halfNārāyaṇa equals the power of one Nārāyaṇa
The sum of the power of ten Nārāyaṇas equals the power of one great Nārāyaṇa
The sum of the power of ten great Nārāyaṇas equals the power of a bodhisattva who has been cultivating merit for a period of one hundred world ages
The sum of the powers of ten bodhisattvas who have been cultivating merit for a period of one hundred world ages equals the power of a bodhisattva who has been cultivating for a period of one thousand world ages Keep on multiplying by ten times in this way until you reach the power of a bodhisattva who has been cultivating for a period of ten to the fourteenth power of world ages
His power is equal to the power of the bodhisattva who has achieved the acceptance that the reality of existence is nonbirth  The sum of the power of ten bodhisattvas who achieved the acceptance that the reality of existence is nonbirth is equal to the power of one bodhisattva of the tenth stage
The sum of the power of ten bodhisattvas of the tenth stage is equal to the power of the bodhisattva of the final body
For this reason Mahāmaudgalyāyana because the Bodhisattva had achieved such powers he could walk seven steps immediately after he was born
If a buddha had not held up this world it would have fallen apart
When the Bodhisattva walked seven steps after he was born this world was sixty thousand yojanas wide and long
When the Bodhisattva was born and lowered his foot onto the ground it sank to a depth of one hundred thousand yojanas
When he raised his foot the world rose back up again one hundred thousand yojanas
Because the Buddha held up the world and made it firm and free from destruction sentient beings were spared suffering
A bodhisattva of the final body as soon as he is born is equipped with such mighty power
Even if the sentient beings in all worlds were endowed with imminent enlightenment the sum of the powers of these bodhisattvas would not amount to onetrillionth of the power of the Tathāgatas wisdom of truth and untruth which is one of the ten powers of the Buddha
The difference cannot be expressed through numbers
Having attained these ten kinds of powers a being is called Tathāgata One Worthy of Offerings by Gods and Humans  and Perfectly Enlightened One
The above passage still does not sufficiently clarify the Bodhisattvas power
With the Bodhisattvas supernatural power he can take as many worlds as there are grains of sand in the Ganges River and place them all on the tip of a single hair of his toe or throw them beyond infinitely large worlds as numerous as grains of sand in the Ganges River
Wherever he goes the Bodhisattva relieves the suffering of sentient beings
Such supernatural power is beyond measurement and beyond calculation
Even if the Tathāgata were to manifest all his supernatural powers you hearers of the Way would still not believe that they are real
How then could other sentient beings be expected to believe in them When the athlete Jingweide heard the Buddha say that it was the power the Bodhisattva had received from his parents that enabled him to send the arrow to the vajra wheel he was amazed and all the hair on his body stood on end
Marveling at this he was freed from all arrogant thoughts took refuge in the Three Jewels and gave rise to the aspiration to pursue the highest goal
One Thousand Buddhas Introduction The Royal Consecration Ceremony The Marriage Proposal Slanderous Rumors The Long and Difficult Pregnancy and Miracles
The dharmakāya is formless yet it manifests itself in different forms appropriate to various circumstances Since the capacities of sentient beings and their karmic conditions differ in numerous ways the Buddhas teaching takes more than one concrete form
Sometimes he rejects desires and receives the Way sometimes he places himself in the midst of defilement and conducts himself in ways considered appropriate for the world
If he did not take a queen ordinary people might say that he was not of human origins
Even though he placed himself in the middle of the five desires he did not lose his original singleminded determination
Therefore when he visited the four gates of the royal city and saw the eight kinds of suffering such as physical decline old age illness and death he lamented Life is like this
How can one bear to stay in this world His act of renouncing the world in search of the truth began with this event
Therefore the Weimo jing says First the Bodhisattva draws people using desire as means and they are then led into the Way of the Buddha The Yinguo jing says
When the Prince became older his father the king sent messages to other countries
On the eighth day of the second month we will consecrate the Crown Prince in an abhiṣeka ceremony
All of you should attend gather together in order to appoint him as the Crown Prince The royal message reached its numerous destinations and when the time arrived the kings and ministers of other countries gathered together in great numbers to witness the appointment of the crown prince an act in which great benefit was conferred upon him
Vinaya Master Daoxuan of Ximingsi Temple in Changan possessed numinous virtue that worked mysteriously
His practice was lofty yet simple
All his life he engaged in difficult practices diligently and with sincerity
He found a teacher early in his life and for over fifty years sought the Way with great dedication His intention was to uphold the Way and he paid attention only to this one thing
In this manner he contributed to the cause of the Three Jewels 
He compiled ritual works totaling over one hundred fascicles the lofty models he gathered carried profound implications
In midspring of the second year of the Qianfeng period Daoxuan was staying in the Qinggong Residence at the former Jingyesi Temple  south of the capital city
There he sought quietude and cultivated the Way
As he was already in his old age his vital power was in decline
He thus meditated singlemindedly on the four kinds of living beings that are born in different ways and reflected on the three assemblies of Maitreya Buddhas preaching
Suddenly he achieved contact with mysterious spirits by virtue of his previous karmic conditions
His illness was gradually alleviated and he diligently practiced devotion he obtained mysterious communication
At that time a subordinate of the four heavenly kings appeared at the entrance of Vinaya Master Daoxuans residence
behaved like a human being walking in short steps and speaking
The Vinaya master asked him Who are you He answered I am Zhang Qiong a disciple of the Buddha The Vinaya master asked again Where do you live He answered I am the fifteenth son of the king of the southern heaven in the first realm of desire
The king has ninetyone sons all of whom are extraordinary strategists and warriors
They rule over kingdoms and cities in the realm that they rule both land and sea the monks and laypeople are distinguished and those who uphold the Buddhist teaching and those who dont are separated
These sons of the rulers all accept the Buddhist teaching themselves and maintain the proper treatment of good and evil conduct thus permitting the transmitted teaching to prosper while they themselves accumulate their own merit
According to the names mentioned in the scripture I am the son of the vaiḍūrya king of the southern realm
I am on guard constantly my office is not in name only The Vinaya master asked again You hold a respectable position
You have not come to see me because your inherited virtue is inferior
Why dont you enter through the front gate The apparition answered I as a disciple of the Buddha do not dare to enter unless I am invited to do so by you a master The Vinaya master said Please come in and take a seat came in and having paid respect sat down with his head lowered
The Vinaya master asked again You believe in the Three Jewels and are protected by the word of the Buddha
It is good that you have come to see me
Why dont you show your true form The apparition answered My retribution body is different from that of others
The light that shines from it is also unusual
It may disturb ordinary people
It is sufficient to discuss matters with the master
I need not bother with showing my true form Vinaya Master Daoxuan asked again Since this spring my vitality has been declining Medicine has no effect
I do not know whether the end of my life determined by karmic conditions is near or far The apparition answered The life of the Vinaya master is about to end
Do not trouble yourself with medicine Daoxuan asked again When is the time predetermined by my karma for the end of my life The apparition answered How would I be able to tell the time
I only know that your life will end soon
You will be reborn in the fourth heaven where Maitreya Buddha dwells The Vinaya master asked again Who will accompany me The apparition said My third brother Zhang Yu He is very intelligent and has achieved superior enlightenment
He has faith in the Buddhist teaching and is the compiler of the Zhihuan tu jing in over one hundred fascicles
The work describes the rows of tall heavenly palace buildings and the earthly government offices that have never been heard of before When Vinaya Master Daoxuan heard this he was delighted and requested the apparition to describe all of this in detail so that he could instruct the monks and laypeople
There was also the god Wei Kun one of the eight generals of the king of southern heaven
The four heavenly kings have thirtytwo generals altogether This god was the head general among them
Intelligent by nature he had renounced the impurities of desire early in his life
He practices the pure disciplines of a Buddhist monk and performs the duties of a youthful disciple who attends a buddha
Having received directly from the Buddha his last order before leaving this world Wei Kun has made the protection of the Dharma everywhere his dominant concern
Throughout the three continents he is foremost in upholding the right Dharma
Free from selfishness and any flaw he is deeply concerned about the Buddhist community consisting of the four groups 
Serving as a bridge between the people on the one hand and the Dharma on the other he achieves great salvation by means of the five vehicles 
Because of him the teaching of the Buddha has been preserved for the four groups of the Buddhist community
When the principles become compromised from interaction with the outside world or when the model of the monastic community is threatened Wei Kun is always there to protect the community He frequently offers the means for dealing with a difficult situation and explains the auspicious strategies in detail Wei Kun admired Vinaya Master Daoxuans compositions and preserving other records of the Holy Ones teaching he compiled a collection of these matters
When the Vinaya master heard about this he accepted it as sacred responsibility that he should make a copy of the collection
Rising from his sickbed he took up his pen and wrote down what was dictated to him producing a record consisting of ten fascicles
The Vinaya master was anxious either that his life might end or that the deity would return to heaven before the task was completed as there was a large amount of material to be copied
He concentrated on the task neglecting everything else and wrote in a simplified style reaching for the holy intention behind the message and not following formal conventions
All essential points were preserved
When he was not sure about a point in the teaching he always asked the deity to remove his doubts
Altogether there were three thousand eight hundred items distributed into ten chapters
the first chapter described the ceremonies concerning the compilation of the Buddhist scripture the second chapter described the verses of the heavenly maidens the third chapter described the circumstances under which the Buddhas relics had been entrusted the fourth chapter described the circumstances under which the Buddhas robe and bowl were entrusted the fifth chapter described the circumstances under which the scripture and images were entrusted the sixth chapter described the circumstances under which the Buddhas possessions were entrusted the seventh chapter described the circumstances that preceded the compilation of the scripture and the consequences of this event Note
The eighth and ninth chapters are incomplete and lacked titles and the tenth chapter described the miraculous events that happened to those who steadfastly upheld the Dharma
Vinaya Master Daoxuan received the mysterious transmission personally and as he received these instructions left behind by the deity he was delighted at each revelation
Even though his eyes and ears were fatigued he did not feel weary
He regretted only that if he had learned these things earlier he might have been able to make a more complete record
What the god said at that time did not contradict the teaching of the scriptures so he recorded all of it
Though he had received these teachings from a god it was identical with what the Buddha taught
From the second month until the sixth month the deity came everyday to confer the information and there was no time passed in idleness
On the third day of the tenth month Vinaya Master Daoxuans vitality slowly declined Fragrances and banners filled the sky
A holy congregation of gods said simultaneously We have come from Tuṣita Heaven to welcome the Vinaya master The Vinaya master sat upright in proper form and concentrated his mind with his palms joined
Maintaining this reverent attitude he passed away
At the time of his death over one hundred monks and laypeople saw fragrant flowers welcome him and accompany him as he went up into the sky
Vinaya Master Daoxuan and myself  were formerly fellow students
On the day we ascended the ordination platform we received instruction from the same teacher
Though his conduct was particularly virtuous he also enjoyed collecting records more than anyone else
He gathered a variety of records that he had seen or heard some on abstract matters of principles of the teaching and others on matters of practice and historical facts
He summarized the essential points and organized them into sections and chapters
In this way he contributed to the preservation and upholding of the transmitted teaching
At that time the four heavenly kings related the following to Vinaya Master Daoxuan
When the Tathāgata was about to enter final nirvana he was staying with a large congregation of humans and gods at Oxhead Temple south of Anavatapta Pond on top of Mount Gandhamādana
He said to Mahā kāśyapa Have Subhūti blow a great conch shell on top of Mount Sumeru to assemble the bodhisattvas and hearer monks from the ten directions and the ten realms as well as a billion Brahmā and Indra gods and the kings of the four heavenly realms
Also call the buddhas of the ten directions to gather at Mount Gandhamādana Kāśyapa followed this instruction and the great congregation gathered like a cloud
Then the Buddha sat in the crosslegged position and entered the vajra samādhi
The great earth shook in six different ways and light emitted from the Buddhas brow illuminated throughout the three thousand great chiliocosms
After seven days had passed everyone in the great congregation began to wonder why the gathering had been called
The Worldhonored One rose from his samādhi and smiling happily said to the great congregation
When I first left my fathers city and departed through the palace gate there was a gandharva king outside accompanied by his followers performing thousands of pieces of heavenly music
He approached me and asked Where do you wish to go I answered I wish to seek enlightenment He told me You will definitely attain supreme enlightenment
When Krakucchanda Buddha was about to enter final nirvana he entrusted me with a golden jar
Inside the jar was a jeweled stupa containing sevenjeweled seals
There were also two gold seals and five silver seals He ordered me to give the jar to Siddhārtha
He also ordered me to guard you constantly
Now you are destined to attain supreme enlightenment so I came looking for you I accepted the jar as I was instructed and shortly thereafter I attained enlightenment
The great Brahmā king and the earth deity who holds the earth firmly built a vajra platform to the south of the bodhi tree enlightenment
They built it out of gold and silver and decorated it with numerous jewels
At that time the gandharva king said to the buddhas of the ten directions I have seen that the past buddhas  when they attained enlightenment all ascended a vajra platform
A golden jar filled with water is then be poured over the head of the Buddha and he attains to the kings rank according to the law 
I now see that ākyamuni is about to achieve enlightenment and is ascending the vajra platform just as previous buddhas did
I heard that there are seven layers of clear ocean under Mount Sumeru and that the water of eight merits is found in this ocean
I went and collected that water myself and I am now about to pour it over the head of ākyamuni The gandharva king opened the jar removed the stupa of seals from it and collected the water in the jar
The buddhas of the ten directions then ordered me to ascend the platform and I walked around the platform three times
From the top of the platform on the southern side I turned to the west and then went northward until I reached the center of the platform
Then I laid out the square mat myself and venerated the buddhas of the ten directions
The buddhas ordered me to sit and enter the vajra samādhi
The buddhas of the ten directions also instructed the dragon king Sāgara Go to the top of Mount Pinjialuo on the continent of King Baoma at the bottom of the great ocean
There is a rock cave there called the vajra storehouse where the pots used for a universal monarch and the pots for the Dharma King are kept
These pots are made of gold and decorated with white jewels
When a buddha appears in the world water is poured over the top of his head from one thousand of these pots
When universal monarchs appear in the world water is also poured from one thousand pots
Go and bring the pots for the Buddha do not use the pots for universal monarchs
We will fill the Buddhas pots with the water of eight kinds of merit and anoint ākya muni with the water The dragon king accepted the buddhas instruction and brought the golden pots and handed them over to the buddhas of the ten directions
Receiving the pots the buddhas ordered the gandharva king Bring the water and fill these pots When the buddhas received the pots filled with water the earth shook in six different ways each of the buddhas of the ten directions emitted light from the white hair between their eyebrows and while encompassed in that light they praised the merits of the buddhas
I arose from samādhi and also emitted light from my brow
The light from all the buddhas together formed a jeweled canopy that covered the three thousand great chiliocosms
The sun moon and stars the oceans and mountains and the karmic retributions of sentient beings were all manifested exhaustively within that light
Trillions of buddha lands could also be seen inside the jeweled canopy
The buddhas ordered me to stand on the golden platform and pay respect to the buddhas of the ten directions
At that time the buddhas of the ten directions also instructed the dragon king Vāsuki Go to the top of Mount Pinjia
There is a cave there where the seats for the buddhas and for the universal monarchs are kept
They are both made of gold to look like Mount Sumeru the seat of the Buddha is surrounded by nine dragons and the seat of the universal monarch is surrounded by five dragons
The former is used when the Dharma King rises to the rank At that time the buddhas of the ten directions also ordered the great king Māra and the great king Brahmā together to carry the Buddhas seat to the vajra platform
The buddhas ordered me to sit upon the seat I obeyed and sat down
Then the buddhas of the ten directions filled the golden pots with water and poured it over the top of my head
After the buddhas had anointed me with the water the kings of the four heavenly realms the gods Indra Māra and Brahmā all poured water on my head one by one
After that I achieved the samādhi of purity
An infinite number of the buddhadharmas were realized simultaneously and the earth also shook
Thousands of trillions of māras came to surrender themselves
The Brahmā kings in the ten directions all performed heavenly music meant for the occasion when a buddha completes the path
From each of the instruments light appeared and the light taught the six perfections
At that time the gandharva king brought the sevenjeweled seals mentioned above and handed them over to the buddhas of the ten directions
Accepting these seals the buddhas stamped my face  which resulted in seven holes
The buddhas then said to me We have now made seven holes with the seals
You are now endowed with the sevenfold practices of awakening They first put the seals on my face to enable me to examine different delusions and categories of knowledge
In this way they marked my ears eyes and nose one by one with the seals
Then the gandharva king handed over the golden seals to the buddhas of the ten directions
Accepting these seals the buddhas stamped three places on my chest
Because you have received the three seals of the Dharma you have attained the threefold wisdom of emptiness and understand the BuddhaDharma completely The gandharva king then handed over the silver seals to the buddhas of the ten directions
Accepting these seals the buddhas stamped the top of my head and my hands and feet
Having received these seals you have attained pure wisdom
You are endowed with the five attributes of the spiritual body of the Tathāgata When the buddhas had finished stamping me with the seals each placed a golden hand on top of my head and rubbed it
When they rubbed their hands against the top of my head I attained one hundred thousand samādhis and attained the wisdom of the one thousand kinds of dharmas
It has been a long time since I realized these teachings of the buddhas
For the sake of sentient beings I appeared bearing the marks of the universal monarch
I also appeared bearing rare and auspicious marks
From the top of my head my hands and my feet fivecolored light issues forth
In each ray of light a hundred thousand buildings appear
All my different bodies are found in these buildings and each of them has received the seal and attained the great spiritual rank in the same way as I did
After completing my path of spiritual cultivation I have been constantly carrying this jar stupa but I have never before shown it to you
Now it has been revealed The Buddha also said to the mahāsattva Samantabhadra Open the jar and bring out the jeweled stupa Samantabhadra obeyed and brought out the stupa in front of the Buddha
When the Worldhonored One rose and paid respect to the stupa the door of the stupa opened by itself
Inside were pavilions of pearls altogether one hundred and thirty thousand in number
Each pavilion contained a seal and a beautifully decorated copy of the Vinaya
Again there were one hundred and thirty thousand of these altogether
Inside the stupa were five monks who had entered the samādhi of cessation
The Buddha said to Mañjuśrī Take my Dharma horn decorated with golden rims go to the monks and play the music Renouncing the Householders Life and Entering Deep Samādhi When the monks heard these tunes they immediately came out of samādhi and asked Mañjuśrī What buddha age are we in presently Mañjuśrī answered It is the age of ākyamuni Buddha the fourth in the age of the wise The monks said We are the great hearer disciples of Kra kucchanda Buddha
When that buddha entered nirvana he ordered us to guard the seals inside this stupa until the time of Ruci Buddha the last of the one thousand buddhas of the age of the wise enters nirvana Then the monks rose from their seats greeted the Worldhonored One from a distance and enquired into his welfare
Then the monks told Mañjuśrī That past buddha Krakucchanda instructed us When ākyamuni is about to enter nirvana you should choose twentythree seals from the many seals and give them to him
After ākyamuni Buddha has  the teachings he leaves behind will be neglected
Sentient beings of that time will be heavily burdened with the defilement of heretical views and they will not uphold the precepts
The gods dragons and other beings will not offer protection and the fourfold congregation will be powerless
I leave these seals with ākyamuni Buddha so that a great bodhisattva will be able to inscribe the teachings he leaves all over with the twentythree seals
He will inscribe the fourfold congregation so that there will be no infraction of any rules
If there is someone who takes pleasure in reading and reciting scripture he will stamp the mouth of that person with a seal so that he will not forget the words of the scripture
If there is someone who cultivates meditation to tame his mind he will also stamp that person so that after his death his body will not decay and may glow with light
When evil sentient beings see these miracles they will all give rise to the intention of seeking salvation After the monks spoke these words the door of the stupa closed by itself
The Fobenxing jing says
When the Prince grew up and was nineteen years old King uddhodana built him three palaces for the three different seasons
the first was a warm palace for midwinter the second was a cool palace for the heat of summer and the third was a middle palace to be used in spring and fall
Many ponds and pavilions were constructed in the back garden and trees that bloom and bear fruit were planted
Many people performed music for the Prince who was constantly guarded The detailed description of all this will be abbreviated here
King uddhodana also remembered that when the prince was born the fortuneteller Asita had noted that the Prince would either become a universal monarch or achieve enlightenment
The king therefore asked the members of his clan how he could prevent his son from renouncing the householders life so that he would instead succeed to the kings throne
They answered Quickly build another wing onto the palace and have many court ladies perform and entertain there
Then the Prince will not renounce the householders life They then said in verse
The prediction made by Asita indeed cannot be changed Members of the ākya clan recommend the construction of palace buildings And hope that this will prevent the prince from renouncing the householders life
The king then told the members of the ākya clan All of you look around to see which woman deserves to be the Princes consort Thereupon each of the five hundred ākya clanspeople said My daughter deserves to be the princes consort The king thought Suppose I were to examine all of their daughters but if I then found that they are not adequate it will lead to conflict in the clan
This would be no different from causing conflict by forbidding the Prince to seek the spiritual path The king then came up with another idea
I will have articles made decorated with miscellaneous jewels that make a person forget worries I will take these things to the Prince and allow him to give them to the court ladies
I will secretly observe the Prince as he gives the vases away paying attention to his eyes
If his glance stays longer with one of the ladies I will invite her to become the Princes consort Then the king rang a bell and announced For a period of seven days starting from now our Prince wishes to see all the ladies and confer articles decorated with miscellaneous jewels and used in a variety of pleasurable entertainments that cause people to forget their worries The ladies all decorated themselves and came to the gate of the palace wishing to see the Prince but because the Prince was so powerful they dared not look at him directly
Each simply accepted the jeweled articles and passed by him quickly with her head lowered
All the jeweled articles were given away
There was one lady left the daughter of the minister Mahānāma of the Hastā branch of the ākya clan
Her name was Yaśodharā
She came accompanied by attendants both before and behind her
When she saw the Prince from a distance she stood up tall and directed her glance at him
She walked toward him slowly and elegantly and looked straight into the Princes eyes without averting her gaze or avoiding his
Approaching slowly to greet the Prince she seemed like an old acquaintance of his not at all shy or embarrassed
She said to the Prince Give me a jeweled article The Prince replied You came too late
They have all been given away She then said to him What did I do wrong to cause you to cheat me and not give me a jeweled article The Prince answered I did not cheat you you did not arrive in time At the time the Prince was wearing a large signet ring of great value
He removed it from his finger and offered the ring to Yaśodharā
She said As soon as I come to you do you give to me whatever pleases you  The Prince answered You can have any other jewels that I am wearing Yaśodharā said again How could I take things that the Prince is wearing
I should instead be adorning the Prince With these words she showed her displeasure and she turned around and departed
After the Worldhonored One had attained buddhahood the noble one Udāyin said to the him The Tathāgata wears no jewels on his body
How is it that even if he were to have given all the jewels he wore on his body to Yaśodharā she would not be happy The Buddha said to Udāyin Listen carefully
I will speak to you about this matter Udāyin said Please preach to me about it Then the Buddha told Udāyin the following story
I recall a time an infinite number of ages ago
In the city of Vārāṇasī in the kingdom of Kāśi there was a king who governed the kingdom on the basis of heterodox teaching and held wrong views
That king had a prince who committed a minor offense
His father the king exiled him and sent him outside of the kingdoms borders The prince walking slowly reached a temple of a deity
He stayed in this temple with his wife who had accompanied him
When they ran out of food the prince hunted and killed various animals in order to survive
In the hunting ground the prince found a crocodile
He chased and killed it
After removing its skin he threw the carcass in water and boiled it
The meat had not quite fully cooked but all the juice had completely evaporated
At that time the prince told his wife The meat is not fully cooked
Go and get some water The princes wife then went to get water After his wife had gone the prince felt extremely hungry and could not wait
So he ate all of the crocodile meat leaving nothing behind
When the princes wife returned with the water she asked her husband Where is the crocodile meat  The prince answered The crocodile suddenly came back to life and has now gone away In disbelief the wife said How can such a thing just happen all of a sudden The meat of the crocodile was already cooked
How could the animal come to life and walk away The wife did not believe the princes words and thought to herself My husband must have felt very hungry and eaten all of the meat
He is trying to deceive me by saying that the crocodile walked away She felt miserable and angry and after this incident she was depressed all the time
Several years later the princes father the king died and the minister welcomed the prince back to the kingdom and anointed him as king
After he became the king the prince gave all the jewels he obtained to the queen but she was still not pleased
The king asked her How is it that you still have an unhappy expression on your face His consort said the following verses to answer the king
Most superior king please listen
When you hunted a long time ago You took your arrow and sword And shot and killed a wild crocodile Having removed its skin and when the meat was almost finished cooking You sent me away to get more water to add to the pot Then you ate all of the meat And lied to me saying that the crocodile had walked away The Buddha told Udāyin You should know the following
The one who was the king at that time is none other than myself
The one who was the queen is none other than Yaśodharā
At that time I committed a minor offense lying to the queen
Yaśodharā is still not pleased because of this The Fobenxing jing further records
When the minister Mahānāma saw that the Prince had expertise and was well informed in all branches of the arts with better skills than anyone else he said to him Please accept my repentance
Earlier I said that the prince had no understanding of many arts and allowed doubt to arise in my mind Because of this I would not allow my daughter to be married to you
I now know better
Please accept my daughter and make her your consort The Prince chose an auspicious day and time and following proper convention he provided the proper means for the wedding to his own family
Relying on the powers and authorities of a great king he welcomed the daughter into his house as his consort
Yaśodharā adorned with many jewels entered the palace accompanied by five hundred attendant ladies
The couple was happy and enjoyed the pleasures of the five senses
Therefore a verse says
Yaśodharā was the daughter of a minister Her reputation spread throughout the kingdom and everyone far and near knew about her Choosing an auspicious day through an oracle the Prince took her as his consort And went to her house to welcome her into his palace The Prince and his consort enjoyed many sense pleasures They indulged in these pleasures never tiring of them Just as the heavenly king Kauśika had pursued pleasure with his consort acī
When the Worldhonored One first attained buddhahood Udāyin said to him I do not understand fully
How and by what circumstances could the Worldhonored One a long time ago make the woman of the Gautamī clan reject many other men and take the Tathāgata as her husband
She was happy in her heart
How could this have been achieved The Buddha said to Udāyin You Udāyin
Listen carefully
It is not only in this world that the woman of the Gautamī clan rejected other men and found happiness with me
It was just like this in another world in the past
In that world she also rejected others and took me as her husband
As I remember that past world at the foot of the Himalayas many kinds of creatures lived
Innumerable numbers of animals roamed there and each of these animals had its place among others in the food chain
At that time among the animals there was a female tiger and she was uniquely beautiful and incomparable among all the animals
That tigers fur was very lustrous
When a mate was to be chosen for the tiger from the innumerable number of animals each of them said Come to me
Come to me Some animals told the others Wait a minutedont fight with each other
Let the female tiger herself choose a mate
Whatever animal she chooses will become the king among us Among the animals at that time was an ox king and he said to the female tiger in verse
People of the world all take my excrement And paint the ground with it for the purpose of purification For this reason the beautiful female tiger Should take me as her mate The female tiger answered the king of oxen in verse
Your neck is large and high All it is good for is to pull a carriage or drag a plow How is it that with your ugly body You suddenly wish to become my husband and master At that time there was also a large white elephant who said to the female tiger in verse
I am the great elephant king of the Himalayas You cannot win a battle without using me Since I am endowed with such great powers Why dont you now become my wife The female tiger answered the white elephant in verse
If you were to see the lion king You would be frightened out of your wits and run away as fast as you can Dropping excrement and urinating as you flee in great confusion How could you deserve to be my husband
Among the animals was a lion king of all the animals
He said to the female tiger in verse Gaze now upon my body and see how it looks The front half is large and expansive and the back is finely tapered
I live as freely as I please in the mountains And I can also bring comfort to other sentient beings I am the king of all animals There is no other animal that can beat me in battle If they catch a glance of me or hear my voice All the animals run away I am ferocious and powerful And my authority is great and undisputed Thus wise tiger you should know about me And you may become my wife
The female tiger said to the lion king in verse
You are powerful ferocious and authoritative And your body is very beautiful in appearance I have now found my husband I greet you respectfully and will obey you Then the Buddha said to Udāyin You Udāyin must understand the following
The lion who was the king of all animals at that time is none other than I myself
The female tiger at that time is none other than the present ākya woman of the Gautamī clan
The innumerable animals at that time are none other than the present five hundred young men of the ākya clan
At that time the Gautamī woman disliked the animals and therefore was not willing to choose any of them as her mate
As soon as she heard my verses she become my wife
Today the situation is the same
The reason she rejected the five hundred young men of the ākya clan was because she disliked and despised them so she chose me as her husband
The Yinguo jing says When the Prince became seventeen years old the ministers gathered to discuss the matter of his marriage
One brahman whose name was Mahānāma had a daughter called Yaśodharā
She was beautiful in appearance and her intelligence and wisdom was unsurpassed by others She possessed all of the graceful feminine manners
Due to these virtues she was asked to become the Princes consort
The Prince received her as his consort and she accompanied him constantly in his daily life but the Prince never entertained worldly thoughts and cultivated only the practice of meditation
The Puyao jing says
At that time the warriors and elders of the ākya clan said to the king If the Prince becomes a buddha the lineage of the holy king will end The king answered Where is a jadelike woman whom we should give to the prince as his consort
Let us use skillful means to see whether we can find her The king ordered his artisans to construct a standing golden image with an inscription that read
If there is a woman whose virtue is as I describe here she should answer this invitation to come to the palace The king told the brahmans attending him Go all around the kingdom of Kapilavastu to search for such a woman They found a woman pure as a lotus flower and comparable to the best of the jadelike women
They chose this woman who was of the ākya clan with the name Gopī
She demonstrated her extraordinary talents to the Prince and he took her as the consort of the Bodhisattva
Again elsewhere in the same text it says that when the prince was seventeen years old the king found a consort for him
Out of thousands of candidates the one left at the end was called Gopī
She was the most attractive and her conduct was impeccable but she was a girl who sold flowers
When she was brought to the palace to become the princes consort he would not touch her
The woman wished to approach him but the prince said As a woman you are polluted You will defile my bed So Gopī did not dare to approach the Prince
The other ladies of the court suspected that the Prince was impotent
The Prince then pointed at the womans torso with his finger and said In six years you will give birth to a boy The woman thus became pregnant The Wumeng jing says
The Prince had three consorts The first had the surname Gautama
She was the daughter of Elder Sheyi whose personal name was Shuiguang 
The name of his wife was Yuming 
The wife lived near the capital city
When their daughter was born the sun was setting but the fading light illuminated the interior of the house clearly
For this reason she was given the name Gopī Note This means Bright Woman She was the Prince's first consort
The second consort whose name was Yetan or Yashu  gave birth to Rāhula
Her father was Elder Yishi The Ruiying benqi Shanquan as well as the Zhidu lun say that Rāhula was born to the second consort Yaśodharā
The Wumeng and the Shieryou jing say that it was the first consort who gave birth to him
The Shieryou jing did not say this originally but the earlier version of the text later disappeared
might have been compiled by arhats in the West 
This work was mentioned in the preceding fascicle The third consort was called Luye 
Her father was Elder ākya
Because the Prince had three consorts King uddhodana built palaces for the three seasons for him
In the West a year is divided into the three seasons of spring summer and winter there is no period designated as autumn
Each season consists of four months
This explains the expression palaces for the three seasons In each of the palaces there were twenty thousand court ladies who served to entertain the Prince
When the Prince did not renounce the householders life he became a universal monarch or cakravartin The Zhidu lun says
The Bodhisattva had two wives
One was called Gopikā
She was a jade woman and was barren
The second was called Yaśodharā
After the Bodhisattva had renounced the householders life some people plotted at night Since the Prince has renounced the householders life how could she have gotten pregnant She will defile the blood of the ākya clan
We should throw the mother and son into a burning pit and slaughter them Yaśodharā resented this because there was no substance to this charge
She made a great vow If the child I am carrying came into being through immoral conduct let both mother and child be burned and destroyed After making this vow Yaśodharā threw herself into a burning pit but the fire went out and both mother and child survived
The fire turned into a pond filled with lotus flowers and the mother sat upon a lotus flower throne
People realized that true and not false
Later a child was born who resembled the Bodhisattva physically
The father  the king was delighted and prepared cakes of one hundred different tastes and presented them to the Buddha
the Buddha transformed himself into five hundred monks each of whom had the body of the Buddha
Rāhula took the cakes and put them into the Buddhas almsbowl
In this way he demonstrated that he was truly the son of the Buddha
The Dashanquan jing says
Some doubted that the Prince might be impotent and incapable of fathering a son
So the king brought Gopī the daughter of a man who belonged to the ākya clan
Rāhula was born miraculously he was not born from intercourse between his parents
The Fobenxing jing says
At that time Mahāprajāpatī and the daughter of the ākya clan Yaśodharā brought various objects of offering they had prepared and went to the shrine of a god
The name of the god was Lutiluojia and the garden in which the shrine was located was also called Lutiluojia from the name of the god
When the Bodhisattva was still living the householders life he often played athletic games in this garden
There was a large rock in the garden and in the past the Bodhisattva used to sit on that rock
At that time when Yaśodharā the daughter of the ākya clan brought Rāhula to the garden she sat him down to rest behind the rock and then she took the rock and threw it into the water
She vowed I now vow that what I say is true and not false
Except for the Prince I have never been with another man
The child to whom I have given birth is his descendant and he carries the Princes blood
If this is not false let the large rock float on the surface of the water and not sink As she had requested in her vow the large rock stayed on the waters surface just as a banana leaf floats on water
It did not sink or drop down again just like a banana leaf
When the large crowd saw and heard everything that had happened they marveled and expressed their joy out loud they could not stop themselves from dancing shouting jumping and singing their robes and sleeves swirling around
They also played various kinds of music
As for the choice of the date of Rāhulas birth at the time when Yaśo dharā lived Rāhula was the king of the asuras
He once grasped the moon in eclipse held it for a moment and then let it go
For this reason he is called by the name Rāhula He was pleasingly handsome and everyone who saw him became happy
The skin of his body was yellowishwhite in color and looked like pure gold The top of his head was like a parasol
His nose was high and prominent like a parrots beak
His arms reached down to his knees
Nothing was amiss with his limbs and joints all his sense organs were perfect
The Fobenxing jing says
Rāhula came out of his mothers womb after six years had passed from the time the Tathāgata renounced the householders life When the Tathāgata returned to his fathers house he had just turned six years old
Question
Why did Rāhula stay in his mothers womb for six years before being born
Answer Rāhula was a king in a past life
A sage  went into a garden and did not come out for six days
Because of this Rāhula stayed in his mothers womb for six years
The basic idea is the same
Question Why did his mother Yaśodharā remain pregnant for six years
Answer The old Benxing jing relates the following story
The Buddha said Monks I recall that in a world an infinite number of years ago there was a herd of cows in a pasture
The wife of the cows owner took her daughter and went to the herd to milk them
The two milk containers they brought were soon both full
The wife made the daughter carry the bigger container and she carried the smaller container herself
Midway as they were carrying the full containers back the mother said to her daughter Go quickly
The road around here is dangerous The daughter said to her mother This container is very heavy
How can I go quickly In this way the mother told her daughter again and again that she must hurry because there were frightening things on the road
The daughter then entertained the following thought
Why should I have to carry the heavier container and have to listen to her tell me to go quickly too This angered the daughter and she said to her mother Mother will you carry this container too
I must relieve myself So the mother took the larger container and carried it
The daughter followed behind her slowly
At that time the mother carried the heavy burden for six miles The Buddha said to the monks Have no doubt that that daughter became angry and made her mother walk six miles carrying the heavy burden do not entertain any contradictory thought
The woman of the ākya clan Yaśodharā is that daughter
Because of the fault she committed at that time deceiving her mother into carrying a heavy burden for six miles on the dangerous road she received an infinite amount of suffering in this life filled with defilements
The remaining karmic effect of this fault caused her to carry the fetus in her womb for six years in this life
Another scripture says that because in a previous life Rāhula had covered over a mouses hole and the mouse was unable to come out for six days he remained in the womb for six years The Guanfo sanmei jing Tbc ab ab Yaśodharā and five hundred court ladies entertained the following thought
Since the Prince been born in this world his life has been accompanied by many extraordinary things
There is one thing however about which we have some doubt One woman among the court ladies called Xiumanna said to the princes consort The Prince is a divine person
I have been serving him for many years but I have never seen his male organ
I certainly have not seen him engage in any worldly activities Another woman Jingyi said Queen I have served the Prince for eighteen years but I have never seen him troubled by such things as urinating or defecating
I certainly have not seen him show any sexual desire At that time each of the court ladies said various things like this and they all said that the Prince must be impotent
The Prince was taking a nap but he heard everything that the court ladies had said expressing their desire to get a glimpse of his penis
Lotus flowers appeared at the place of the Princes male organ
They were red and white in color and two or three flowers were connected together vertically
When the ladies saw the flowers they said to each other Divine people have such lotus flowers
The mind of this person is definitely free from anything defiled Having said this they were overcome by emotion and unable to speak
Then the Princes male sexual organ appeared in the middle of the lotus flowers
It looked like a boy
The ladies saw it and said to each other The Prince is now going to cause a miracle to happen Suddenly the organ changed its shape to that of a man
The ladies were overjoyed when they saw this
When this miraculous vision occurred Rāhulas mother saw the male organ
Flowers appeared one after the other and massed together they all resembled the kind of cotton trees that grow in heaven
On top of each flower were an infinite number of large bodhisattvas who held in their hands white flowers that covered their bodies
This vision appeared and then disappeared just as the previous days sun had risen and disappeared
This vision is called The Vision of the Bodhisattvas Male Organ At that time some other court ladies gossiped that Gautama lacked a male organ
When the Buddha heard this the Princes slowly appeared
When it first appeared it looked like an eightyearold boy but it grew gradually and began to look like a youth
The ladies were delighted
Then it grew even more and came to look like a flag formed of lotus flowers
Each of the layers consisted of millions of lotus flowers
Each of the lotus flowers was constituted by millions of colors representing different shades of jewels
Each of these colors contained millions of manifestations of the Buddha
Inside each of the manifestations of the Buddha were millions of bodhisattvas and an infinite number of people who all served as the Buddhas attendants
At that time the manifested buddhas spoke simultaneously condemning the womens evil desires and faults
They said in verse
Even if there were young men All aged fifteen or sixteen At the peak of their vigor As numerous as the grains of sand in the Ganges River And they were presented to these women They would be unable to satisfy them even for a single instant When the women heard these words they felt ashamed and distressed
They fell to the ground raising their hands and hitting their heads and said Alas we were possessed by evil desires and caused the buddhas to utter these disparaging words we harbored evil thoughts and were attached to defiled desires and failed to recognize them as wrong
The buddhas heard this and condemned our evil desires
Each of us detests our female body Four thousand women then gave rise to the intention to seek the path of salvation
Two thousand women freed themselves from defilement and purified their Dharma eyes
Two thousand women were to achieve the path of the pratyekabuddha
The Buddha said to nanda When I first achieved enlightenment on the bank of the Nairañjanā River there were five ascetics each accompanied by five hundred and fifty disciples
They claimed to have achieved enlightenment and came to me
The male organs of each of these ascetics was twisted around his body going around it seven times
They came to the place where I had spread out some grass for a seat and was sitting there
They said Because we are free from desire our bodies are like this
We are just like the gods in the highest heaven in the realm of desire
Our supernatural powers are billions of times greater than the monks powers At that time the Worldhonored One said to the ascetics You have no knowledge of the Tathāgatas organ
Any of you who wishes to see it should come and have a look at it as you wish
For a period of many world ages the Tathāgata has been engaged in spiritual practice
Even while I was still living the life of a householder I entertained no thoughts of desire and my mind was never defiled That is why I attained this reward
My organ is like that of a horse made of jewels It is sometimes hidden and sometimes visible going back and forth between these states in an entirely unpredictable fashion
For your benefit I will now reveal my male organ for a short while Then the Worldhonored One came down from the sky and made manifest four bodies of water that looked like four oceans
Mount Sumeru was located in the middle of the four oceans and the Buddha resided on Mount Sumeru
He laid down with his back on the ground and emitted golden light
This bright light illuminated the bodies of the gods
Slowly his penis appeared and wrapped around the mountain seven times
It looked like golden lotus flowers had appeared one flower on top of another reaching all the way up to the realm of the god Brahmā
From the Buddhas body there appeared billions of lotus flowers made of miscellaneous jewels
It looked as if a flag made of flowers covered the Buddhas penis
These lotus flowers formed millions of layers and in each of these layers were hundreds of thousands of manifestations of the Buddha
Each of these manifestations of the Buddha was accompanied by billions of bodhisattvas and an innumerable number of monks who served as his attendants
The manifestations of the Buddha sent forth light and illuminated all the worlds of the ten directions The ascetics were amazed and overcome with awe
They said The vision that results from the Buddhas pure practices is beyond the reach of human understanding
is not ugly in form but as beautiful as lotus flowers
We will now pay respect to the Buddhas merits that are as vast as the ocean They asked the Buddha to allow them to follow the life of the renunciants under him and they all achieved the fruit of their spiritual quest Introduction Observing Planting in the Field Excursions and Aversion to the Life of Desires
There are fine distinctions among the three realms of existence each of the four kinds of living beings is endowed with its own nature
Beings in each of these categories roam around inside this burning house and they all drown in the ocean of desires
They wriggle and squirm showing signs of life being small creatures they look upward and open their mouths as if seeking something
For this reason the Dharma King who brings enlightenment to these lands chooses the right occasion for bringing vehicles of salvation and leads the playing children to the superior realm
He has compassion for the creatures caught in worldly entanglements and affectionately delights in those who have renounced the world
Therefore when the Prince saw the dancing girls asleep lying around like dead corpses in the palace he realized that the queens quarters in the palace were no different than a graveyard in ruins
He deplored the fact that life means growing old and suffering from illness and aspired to the eternal happiness that results from renunciation of this world
For this reason the Prince abandoned the kingdom and its capital city to seek loftiness and purity outside of this world
When he succeeded in conquering the māras the Prince achieved enlightenment 
The Fobenxing jing says
The king and many members of the ākya clan took the Prince outside the city on an excursion to observe the planting in the fields
The laborers in the kings territory worked naked and toiled hard to break the ground and plant
Birds were flying eating insects in flight and harming these creatures while at the same time singing Alas
Sentient beings in the world suffer extreme pain of many kinds such as birth old age illness and death
They also suffer other agonies and revolve in the cycle of rebirth unable to escape from this world
Why dont they seek release from these numerous kinds of suffering When King uddhodana had finished observing the fields he went with many youths into a garden
At this time the Prince slowly glanced about and walked around looking for a quiet place
Suddenly he saw a jambu tree in one spot
The tree brought pleasure to those who saw it with its thick foliage of leaves and its branches that spread widely in all directions
When the Prince saw the tree he said to his attendants You should now leave me and go far away
I wish to walk around by myself At the time the prince sent his attendants away and having dismissed the group of his followers he slowly approached the spot under the tree
He then sat down crosslegged on the grass and meditated
Sentient beings suffer from a variety of painful conditions such as birth old age illness and death
He then gave rise to compassion and was able to concentrate his mind
Cutting himself off from desire and abandoning all things that are not good the Prince stopped the karmic flow of the realm of desire and attained the first trance state 
All the heavenly deities such as the god Indra saw the Prince sitting in the trees shadow and came flying to the place to pay respect to him praised him in verses and then departed
Whenever King uddhodana lost sight of the Prince even briefly he became unhappy
He asked the others Where is the Prince now
He has suddenly disappeared The ministers ran around in all the four directions to the east west south and north passing each other as they went in different directions
They looked everywhere for the prince but they could not find him
Then one minister saw the Prince from a distance sitting under the jambu tree meditating
He also saw that the shadows of all the other trees had shifted away so that only the shadow of the jambu tree shaded the Prince
When the minister saw that the Prince had caused this extraordinary phenomenon beyond normal human understanding he was delighted and uncontrollably began to dance around
He quickly ran to the king kneeled down before him and reported what he had seen
He said in verse
The Prince of the great king is now Under the jambu tree He is sitting under its shadow With his legs crossed he has entered a trance Light shines all around him as if the sun has come out This man is truly a great person Only the jambu tree now casts a shadow and the shadow does not move Please Great King come and observe him yourself How could we describe the appearance of the Prince He is like the ruler of the heavenly realm of the Brahmā gods He is also like the god Indra in the Heaven of the Thirtythree Gods He is awesome standing tall and alone clear and bright light Shines everywhere in the forest of trees around him
When King uddhodana heard this he immediately went to the location of the jambu tree and from a distance saw the Prince sitting crosslegged under the tree
The sight may be compared to a brightly burning fire on top of a mountain in the middle of a pitchblack night the flames of the fire rise up ferociously making manifest its awesome power and casting light everywhere from the lofty spot
The sight may also be compared to a bright moon in the sky emerging from behind a bank of dark clouds or when one takes a large bright light inside a dark room
When the king saw the Prince he was amazed his body began to tremble all over in fear and all the hair on his body stood on end
He then bowed his head to the Princes feet and paid respect
Dancing around in delight he uttered the following words
How wonderful How wonderful
The Prince is endowed with great powerful virtue Words of praise expressed in verses followed
Like a massive fire on top of a mountain Or a bright autumn moon emerging between clouds that cover the sky I now see the Prince sitting in meditation Without even knowing it my hair stood on end and my body trembled in fear
After uttering these verses King uddhodana again paid respect by bowing to the Princes feet and said again in verse
Again I bow down with my entire body And pay respect to the most wonderful feet which are marked Like the feet of the Buddha with the pattern of a spoked wheel I have been with you from birth until now And suddenly I see you sitting in meditation At that time there were some young boys who were carrying traps to catch fish and hares
These boys who were accompanying the great king spoke to each other in childish voices making fun of the king
A minister scolded them Be quiet you little children Then the boys answered the minister Why dont you listen to us as we speak freely and loudly The minister then answered the boys in verse
Even though the light of the sun is extremely bright and its heat is also fierce It cannot affect the coolness of that trees shade There is also another kind of light that is extraordinarily wonderful Its awesome power is unparalleled in this world Sitting straight in meditation under the tree Unmoving and not swaying like Mount Sumeru Prince Siddhārtha has gone deep within his mind He finds pleasure in the shade of this tree and he will not give it up
The Fobenxing jing says The Bodhisattva said to King uddhodana in verse
pleasures are like a house of gold that is ablaze in fire Or delicious food mixed with poison Or a flowerfilled pond where dragons live The one who sits upon a kings throne enjoys such pleasures First and suffers great pain later The Fobenxing jing Fobenxing ji jing Tcc b c ab ab b says
At that time the god Ghaṭikārakumbhakāra wished to cause the prince to leave the garden so that he would see both desirable and detestable things give rise to aversion to worldly things and consequently eventually renounce the world
When the Prince heard the god say this he immediately ordered his charioteer Go quickly and put the chariot in order
I now wish to go to the garden for sightseeing When King uddhodana learned that the prince wanted to go out he ordered that everywhere in the city of Kapilavastu be swept clean and to put incense and flowers here and there
Everyone who was walking around in the city was to be adorned appropriately
Anyone who had the signs of old age illness death or was defective in any of the six sense organs was expelled from the city
At that time the charioteer decorated the chariot and placed the horses under tight control and when everything was ready he said to the Prince Let me inform the holy son that the chariot is ready The Prince left by way of the eastern gate and was on his way to the garden
At that point the god Ghaṭikārakumbhakāra met the Prince in front of a narrow alley
He transformed himself into a shabby old man
When the Prince saw him he asked the charioteer What kind of person is this
His body is covered with wrinkles He has little muscle and his skin is flaccid and loose
His eyes are red and tears flow from them He is extraordinarily ugly unlike anyone else  Then the Prince said to the charioteer in verse
Listen carefully now charioteer who drives well What sort of person is this who is in front of me His body is not quite right and his hair is thin Was he like this from birth or did he become like this with old age
The charioteer answered the Prince in verse
The time of old age is called great suffering It destroys beauty and pleasure All the sense organs are ruined and lose their objects The limbs no longer move as the mind wishes them to The Prince asked the charioteer Did this happen to this man as an exception or does this happen to everyone The charioteer answered It is not an exception
This happens to everything in this world
Whether noble or humble no one escapes growing old The Prince said If I cannot escape old age take me quickly back to the palace
Since I cannot escape old age how can I engage in indulgences King uddhodana asked the charioteer what had happened and the charioteer answered in detail
The king said How extraordinary is it that this sight appeared
I fear that the Prince will renounce the householders life So the king increased the number of pleasurable objects of the five senses available to the prince but the Prince found these objects repugnant and contemplated only the vision of old age and suffering
Later on a different occasion the Prince was again leaving the royal city from the southern gate on his way to the garden
The king had ordered the roads to be decorated and cleaned to an even greater degree than before
At that time the god Ghaṭikārakumbhakāra appeared in front of the Prince having transformed himself into an ill person whose body was reduced to a skeleton from excessive suffering and who was about to die
He was lying in excrement rolling around and groaning unable to raise himself up
The man cried out hitting his head on the ground and begging someone to help him sit up
When the Prince saw this he asked the charioteer What sort of person is this
His abdomen is so bloated it looks like a large pot
When he breathes loudly his entire body trembles
His suffering is so extreme that no one can bear to see him or listen to him The charioteer explained in verse
The Prince asked the charioteer saying Why is this man suffering this pain The charioteer answers the Prince When the four elements are not in order illness arises Later on another occasion the Prince was leaving the city from the western gate on his way to the garden
At that time the god Ghaṭikārakumbhakāra appeared in front of the Prince in the form of a corpse laid out on a bier
Many people were carrying the bier and countless relatives were crying aloud around it hitting their chests and heads
They shed tears like rain and cried aloud and their choked agony was sharp and difficult to hear
When the Prince saw this he felt great sadness and asked the charioteer What sort of person is this man carried around by people who weep aloud all around him He asked in verse
The Prince was wonderful in appearance his body handsome and upright He asked a question to the charioteer Who is this Laid out on a bier carried by four people His relatives are all around him loudly weeping The charioteer answered the Prince in verse
Having lost his mind and all the other senses The corpse has no consciousness and is now like wood or stone His relatives cry aloud and gather around it for awhile Having loved him they are here to bid him a long farewell The Prince asked again Am I also to die like this The answer came in verse
All sentient beings end their lives like this Whether gods or humans noble or humble we are all equal in this regard We may be located in better or worse places among the many realms But nothing is permanent and when the time arrives there is no difference in our fate of death Later on another occasion the Prince was leaving the city from the northern gate
At that time the god Ghaṭikārakumbhakāra using his supernatural powers at a point not far from the chariot and before the prince transformed himself into a man whose hair and beard had been shaved wearing a monks robe with his right shoulder bared
Carrying a zinc staff in his right hand and holding an almsbowl in his left hand the man was walking on the road
When the Prince saw him he asked the charioteer What sort of person is this
Before me he holds himself in a dignified posture and walks slowly
He looks straight ahead and does not look to either the right or left
He walks with his mind in control unlike anyone else 
His hair and beard have been shaved off the color of his robe is bright red rather than white the color of ordinary peoples robes
His bowl shines with a dark reddishblue color like the color of the paint used to paint ones eyebrows The charioteer said to the Prince This man is called a renunciant of the householders life
He constantly performs good deeds and avoids evil deeds
Skillful in controlling all his sense organs fearless he is compassionate toward all sentient beings
He never kills or harms sentient beings and keeps the protection of all beings in his mind When the Prince heard this he asked the charioteer Drive the chariot toward that renunciant of the householders life The charioteer obeyed the Princes order and led him toward the renunciant
The Prince asked the man Who are you The renunciant replied in verse
Having observed that the world is an entity bound to disappear I sought nirvana which is inexhaustible I have rejected my parents in order to achieve a mind of equanimity I do not engage in worldly activities that involve desires I stay in the mountains forests or under a tree Or directly on the ground in cemeteries Having renounced all conditioned things And having seen truthfully absolute reality I live by Begging alms from others The Prince respectful of the teaching then descended from the chariot and approached the renunciant on foot
He paid respect to him in the timehonored way kneeling down and gently placing the renunciants foot on top of his head
He circumambulated the renunciant three times and then mounted the chariot again
He then immediately ordered the charioteer to return to the palace
At that time there was a lady at the palace whose name was Kṛśāgautamī
She saw the Prince returning to the palace from far away and felt desire for him
She said in verse
King uddhodana enjoys great pleasure Mahāprajāpatī is free from worries The ladies in the palace are extremely beautiful Who will be able to join this holy son at his place The Dashanquan jing and the Yinguo jing give the following account
The Prince slowly grew up and the time for his renunciation arrived
He took leave of his father and went on four excursions from the four gates of the city
On the first three occasions he encountered sights that caused him to feel aversion to worldly life
He was only pleased on the fourth excursion when he saw a man who had renounced the householders life
All the great masters of prognostication knew that if the Prince did not renounce the householders life after seven days he would attain the throne of the universal monarch
He would then rule over the entire world and the seven kinds of treasures possessed by a universal monarch would appear spontaneously
Each of these masters separately related what he had learned to the king
The king placed one thousand soldiers at each of the four gates in order to guard them
He also placed soldiers everywhere in a oneyojana radius outside of the city to make sure that the Prince would not be able to depart Chinese fu verses on the four gates from the Guang hongming ji T
The verse on old age at the eastern gate
A hollow plantain is easily violated The precarious ivy can also be nibbled on Even following the stalk in hiding  This indeed is the year of long parting Even if you leave on a white horse In the end you experience the heat of red flowers One day and the beautiful appearance disappears A lone lamp stands fruitlessly by itself
The verse on illness at the southern gate Lying with our heads on a pillow we are attached to the precarious light of this life In illness our entanglement with life is easily broken The grasses grow the side of the snowbank for no certain cause My thought returns to the hole of Mount Mang Skin intestines and other organs are reduced to nothing Pain troubles us and binds our limbs Why are we in such a hurry to accumulate age in ourselves No being is free from suffering and distress The verse on death at the western gate
Even though we have relaxed our mind in order to let it accommodate different uses Can we determine which of the disappearing shadows is better Following the wind of karma everything disappears in the end And in the end is shown to be illusory constructions The five aggregates are truly unreal It would be better to cut off rebirth in the six realms Declining we all return to the same source Anxious thoughts are formed by empty manifestations The verse on the renunciant at the northern gate The shadows produced by the illusions of this world are empty
The anxious mind is covered by the dust of desire Thus he rejects the four kinds of defilements And having renounced the householders life he seeks the three gates of liberation Beginners go against the natural flow of the mind But he departs from the dark and profound truth Having painfully realized that the appearances of worldly things are empty He then reduces the pond to emptiness
The Fobenxing jing Fobenxing ji jing Tb b When the Prince heard the verse his body trembled all over and his tears fell like raindrops
Loving the pleasure of nirvana and purifying his senses he sought only to renounce the world and did not enjoy being a part of this world
The king the wise ministers the courtiers and the court ladies all tempted the Prince with various tricks and illusions
At that time the son of the court priest Udāyin was serving the prince as his attendant and he taught the court ladies the arts of enchantment
He said in verse
Court ladies you are greatly endowed with the power of skillful means You can cleverly delude and enchant others And expertly project the visions of your fantasy world Even the one who has distanced himself from desire Such as the true and authentic spiritual adept If he happens to see you he will surely feel desire It is impossible that this Prince If he observes how you enjoy these pleasures Will fail to indulge in the five kinds of desires And in the end he will reject this wonderful place Desire is the foundation of the emotional life of love and attachment
The female body can be valued and enjoyed only by men
If the mind has no attachment glory and beauty have difficulty in materializing
Verses say
Women enjoy the attention that men pay to them Attention is the greatest of their pleasures If no attention is paid to them all that remains is their physical form They are then like a tree that does not produce flowers The Prince answered in verse
Though worldly honor is pleasurable Birth old age illness and death exist Since these four kinds of suffering exist My mind distances itself and does not take pleasure in The realities of birth old age illness and death If you live in the midst of these birth old age and illness Yet your mind enjoys life Then you are no different from the birds and beasts The Prince Udāyin and the others exchanged verses back and forth until sunset
When the Prince saw that the sun had already gone down he went into the palace and engaged in the pleasures of the five desires with the court ladies
They gathered in a circle
That night the Princes consort Yaśodharā became pregnant
Later on another occasion the Prince felt strong aversion to the five desires and sought the path of renouncing the householders life He said in verse
Nothing among the impurities delusions and evil things in the world Surpasses the nature of a womans body Because it is decorated with clothes and jewels Ignorant men desire and yearn for it If a person is capable of observing in this way As he observes illusions dreams and things that are not true Quickly removes ignorance and does not indulge his whims He can certainly achieve liberation in a body of merit
The Ruiying jing says When the Prince turned fourteen years old he spoke to the king about going out on an excursion The Yinguo jing says
A son of a brahman called Udāyin was very intelligent and wise
The king ordered him to befriend the Prince saying Entertain him
Do not let him renounce the householders life Udāyin went to the Prince as he had been ordered by the king and said The king ordered me to befriend you
There are three important things in friendship
if your friend does something wrong you will immediately reproach him if you find something good in your friend take profound delight in it and if your friend is in difficulty never abandon him
I now offer some advice Please do not blame me for it
Kings in ancient times all enjoyed the life of the five desires and later they renounced the householders life
Why does the Prince wish to abandon this world so urgently The Prince answered None of those kings escaped suffering and that is how I differ from them Introduction Leaving the World Shaving the Hair Obtaining the Robe Sending Back Chanda the Charioteer and Kaṇṭhaka the Horse The Kings Admonishment to the Son Choosing the Attendants The Buddhas Hair The Age of the Prince When He Achieved Renunciation and Harmonizing Differences Causes and conditions exist provisionally and sentient beings senses become attached to them
Fundamental reality which is the wondrous principle obtained by adepts differs from this
Therefore in the three realms constituting this world and the six destinies of rebirth sentient beings commit evil deeds that obstruct their progress on the path and they are led astray
The Buddha guides sentient beings back to the correct path and to the insight of emptiness through the eightfold method of meditation and the ten kinds of wisdom
For this reason Great Master ākyamuni joined the world of conditioned things to spread the teaching
He felt compassion for those trapped in the burning house and deplored the incessant torrential flow of desires
He took human form as a prince in King uddhodanas palace and illuminated it with the golden color of his body
Dwelling amid the three poisons of greed anger and ignorance he showed that the world of the palace which is like a painted box does not represent true reality
He went on excursions out of the city from its four gates and developed aversion to the world that is as transitory as floating clouds deploring it
Thereupon a heavenly deity presented him with a white horse that the Prince rode as he left the palace the deity served the Prince by taking his jeweled crown back to the palace Here is an example of a person who abandoned everything to seek true salvation
Similar examples include Xiao Shi who lived at the time of the Qin dynasty and Zi Jin who lived during the age of Zhou
Xu You rinsed out his ears at Mount Ji 
Zhuang Zhou preferred to be a living turtle and dragged his tail in the Pu River
Thus how can we belittle the renouncing worldly life
Those who admire its virtue put an end to evil deeds and begin a life of proper conduct
Those who esteem its influence purify themselves and cultivate good deeds
Renunciants alter their appearance abandoning the good looks of hair and beards in order to realize their intentions
They differentiate themselves from worldly ways in order to live according to the Way
Thus they eschew the beautiful clothing of a universal monarch and while in appearance they do not seem to serve and honor their parents perfectly internally they cherish the virtue of filial piety
Though they do not follow the ordinary rules of decorum by means of which others serve the ruler in their hearts they are grateful for the rulers love bestowed on their subjects Cosmic benefits fall both to those who are hostile and those who are friendly and in this manner great harmony is achieved
Cosmic fortunes are conferred both on the hidden and the manifest so why should we be troubled by minor digressions from accepted norms of the world
The wise base themselves on the Buddhas words and they therefore receive benefits
The inferior disparage holy words and suffer losses
If we adopt the policy that emphasizes punishing evil people paradoxically more of those who disobey the norms appear anew
If we follow a more positive policy that promotes good deeds then everyone is affected by the moral influences of these words
These are the reasons why the prince pulled out his hairpin in the forest of spiritual adepts and began his austerities on the banks of the Nairañjanā River
He bathed his golden body in pure water and went to the auspicious tree that marked the place of his meditation
He took the rice gruel offered to him and sat down on the grass placed for his seat
Thereupon the Buddha with his wisdom consisting of the ten powers and equipped with six supernatural powers scattered Māras soldiers and achieved great enlightenment
The Yinguo jing says The Prince thought to himself I am already nineteen years old
This is the seventh day of the second month
I should go out
I have been thinking about renouncing the householders life Now is the right time for it When he entertained this thought his body emitted light that illuminated the palace of the ruler of the four heavens as well as the palace of the deity uddhāvāsa
people could not see this light but when deities saw it they all realized that the time for the Prince to renounce the householders life had come
They immediately came down to the place where the Prince was and paid respect to him bowing their heads and touching the Princes feet
With joined palms they said The vow that we have been cultivating for an infinite number of world ages is now about to come to fruition The Prince answered Just as you have said now is precisely the time
However my father the king has ordered his officials both inside and outside the palace to keep close watch over me
Even though I wish to leave I have no attendant to come with me The deities answered We will skillfully arrange a way for the Prince to depart without letting anyone know Thereupon with their supernatural powers the deities caused all the palace officials to take to their beds
While sleeping Yaśo dharā had three dreams
first she dreamed of the moon falling to the ground second she dreamed that her teeth had fallen out and third she dreamed of losing her right arm
While she was asleep and having these dreams she was startled and woke up
She felt frightened and reported the three dreams to the Prince in detail
The Prince said The moon is still in the sky your teeth have not fallen out and your arm is still attached to your body
You should know that these dreams are false and not true
Do not succumb to unreasonable fear Yaśodharā then said to the Prince I am afraid the dreams must be a sign that you are about to renounce the householders life The Prince answered again Sleep in peace
Dont be bothered by such worries When she heard this Yaśodharā went back to sleep
The Puyao jing says
At this time the Prince observed the dancing girls lying around in the middle of the night
Their many limbs all akimbo lacked the appeal they had presented earlier there was no appealing substance to them just as wild plants are hollow inside their nine orifices were impure and there was nothing that brought pleasure to the Prince
As soon as the morning star appeared the Prince ordered Chanda to put the saddle on the horse Kaṇṭhaka
The instant he uttered these words the deities of the four heavens demons and dragons all wearing armor appeared from all directions
They bowed before the Bodhisattva and said The people in the city are all exhausted and the peacock and other birds are also asleep The Benqi jing says All the deities said The Prince should go now We fear that he might stay
He should distance himself from this world which is like a massive fire When he finished his reflection it was after midnight
uddhāvāsa and the other deities of the heavens of the realm of desire filled the sky and in unison said to the Prince Everyone both inside and outside of the palace is fast asleep
This is precisely the moment for leaving the householders life Then the Prince immediately went to Chanda the deities power caused Chanda to wake up on his own
The Prince told him Bring Kaṇṭhaka to me When Chanda heard these words he trembled in fear and felt hesitant in his heart on the one hand he did not wish to disobey the Princes order but he feared the kings strict orders
Having thought for a while he wept and said We are familiar with the kindly order of the great king
Furthermore it is not the time for going on an excursion for pleasure nor is it the moment for us to go out to conquer a hostile enemy
Why do you suddenly wish to have the horse brought to you like this after midnight
Where do you want to go The Prince again said to Chanda I wish to conquer the enemy of the defilements for the benefit of all sentient beings
You should not now obstruct my intention Chanda wept loudly hoping to wake up Yaśodharā and all the others so that they would know that the Prince was about to leave
Yet due to the gods power they all remained asleep
Chanda then brought the horse
The Prince stepped forward slowly and said to Chanda and Kaṇṭhaka All affectionate relations end in separation
Worldly things are easily accomplished but the conditions for renouncing the householders life are very difficult to achieve When Chanda heard these words he fell silent and did not say a word and neither did the horse Kaṇṭhaka neigh
The Prince then manifested his luminous appearance
Light shot forth from his body illuminating in all directions
He uttered a lions roar saying Following the way of the past buddhas who renounced the householders life I now also renounce the householders life Thereupon the deities held up the horse Kaṇṭhakas four legs and led it while Indra holding the umbrella  followed them
The deities then caused the northern gate of the city to open spontaneously without making a sound
Chandas sorrow was doubled
The gate had been closed and locked up Who would open it
At that time the gods and demons caused the gate to open spontaneously
The Prince then went out through the gate
Gods in the sky sang praises and followed him
By the time the light appeared in the sky he had traveled three miles down the road
Then the heavenly beings who had been following the prince to that place to ensure that the task was accomplished suddenly disappeared
The Prince went to the forest in which the adept Bhārgava was practicing austerities
He dismounted from the horse Kaṇṭhaka and patting its back said You have now accomplished the difficult task He told Chanda Only you were able to accompany me
This was an extremely rare event
I have now reached a quiet spot
You may now take Kaṇṭhaka and return to the palace When Chanda heard these words he wept and cried out loudly dropping to the ground on his knees in distress and losing control of himself
Having heard that he was to be sent away Kaṇṭhaka bent his knees and licked the Princes feet his tears falling like rain
How can I now abandon the Prince and return to the palace alone The Prince answered The law of this world is that you are born alone and die alone
You have no companion in these events
I now wish to destroy all the defilements that cause suffering
That is why I have come here
When suffering has been completely terminated I will then be a companion for all sentient beings The Fobenxing jing  says
When the rulers of the four heavens who protect the world and the deity Indra learned that the time had come for the Princes renunciation of the householders life they each decorated themselves with the means available to them and went out accompanied by millions of their followers in front and behind them making a variety of music
They came from all four directions and surrounded the city of Kapilavastu in three circles
Each of the deities with palms joined bowed their bodies and lowered their heads
Facing the Prince they filled the sky
The Gui lunar station appeared and when it came together with the moon the deities shouted loudly O Prince you who are a great holy man the Gui lunar station has now come together with the moon
Now is the time
If you wish to seek the superior teaching do not remain in this world The Prince heard this and observed all the court ladies polluted and impure who were asleep and unconscious
The Prince pulled on their hair to wake them up and he also stepped on their bodies but they remained unconscious
The rest of this passage is the same as the one given above When the Prince got outside of the city he uttered a lions roar saying I vow that I will first achieve enlightenment of the truth of suchness and only then will I return to the city to teach The deity of a massive fig tree happened to be there at that place and said to the prince in verse
If a someone wishes to cut down a tree he must cut it at the root You must put an end to the world of ordinary beings By crossing the water you can reach to the other side Once you utter these word they cannot be in vain Hatred will also be erased everyone will be joyous
Then the Prince answered the tree deity with a verse The location of the Himalayas can be moved The water of the ocean can become dried up Heavenly deities may fall from the sky to the ground
But the words that I utter cannot be in vain
The Prince removed the jeweled crown from his head and gave it to Chanda to be taken back to the king and said the following in verse Even those who love each other and remain together in the same place for a long time Will have to part with each other when the time comes I have seen into the reality of momentary transitoriness And therefore now seek liberation
When Chanda heard these words he replied in verse
Even those whose hearts are made of steel If they hear these vows Who among them will not experience sharp pain How much harder is it for myself who loves the prince With whom I share the same birthdate The Prince responded to Chanda in verse
Even if it takes as long as the blood and flesh of my present body As well as the joints muscles vessels and skin To become worn out and disappear Even if it means that I will not be able to preserve my life I will persevere I will not see you again until I throw away The heavy burden of life in this world And traverse all suffering to reach the ultimate source Not before I have achieved liberation and sit in the place of meditation Will I ever see you again
At that time Chanda wept loudly and said to the Buddha Even though this horse is only an animal still he is saddened
Weeping tears and crying kneeling down he licks the Princes feet with his tongue
What disaster could those who are close to you see in this Then the Prince patted the head of the king of horses Kaṇṭhaka and said in verse
In the webbed fingers of the right hand of the Prince The pattern of the wheel with a thousand spokes appeared
With his soft and pure hand He patted the head of the king of horses Kaṇṭhaka The two spoke to each other as if they were two people You king of horses Kaṇṭhaka born on the same day as I was Do not cry in excessive sorrow or be distressed You have now finished your work as a horse If I realize the absolutely subtle state The profound truth of distinction and the mysterious teaching To you the one who can carry me on his back I will report this truth back to you without fail The Fobenxing jing says
The Prince took up a sevenjeweled dagger decorated with maṇi jewels from somewhere near Chanda and holding the dagger in his right hand pulled it from its sheath
Then he grasped his hair bound in a topknot that curled clockwise the color of a dark blue lotus flower and cut it off with the dagger he held in his right hand
Holding up the topknot with his right hand he threw it into the sky
The deity Indra marveled and was filled with joy
He held up the Princes topknot so that it did not fall down and placed it in a beautiful heavenly cloth
The deities worshiped it making offerings to it of the best items for worship that exist in the heavens
The large crowd of deities in uddhāvāsa Heaven stood at a distance from the Prince neither too far nor too close
Under a flower garland called sumanā a barber appeared holding a sharp sword
The Prince said to the barber Can you dress my hair The barber answered I certainly can and immediately shaved the Princes head with his sharp sword
At that time the deity Indra marveled at this and did not allow even one strand of the hair removed from the Princes head to drop to the ground
Instead he caught each strand of the hair in a heavenly cloth and took it to the Heaven of the Thirtythree Gods where he worshiped it
The Bodhisattvas topknot crown and comb have been preserved until the present day
The Daoxuan lshi ganying ji says
The god answered the Vinaya master In the thirteenth year after the Tathāgata first achieved enlightenment he was at the Jetavana residence
At that time the great deity Brahmā requested the Buddha to turn the wheel of the Dharma
Buddhas in billions of buddha lands in all directions gathered like a cloud
Bodhisattvas hearers and the eight divisons of dragons and supernatural beings of the great chiliocosm also gathered at the Jetavana Garden
Then the deity akra said to the Buddha Worldhonored One I see that the great deity Brahmā requested the Buddha to turn the wheel of the Dharma
I now wish to wash the Buddhas body
Please grant this request The Buddha granted the request and a temporary palace made of seven jewels as well as perfumed hot water were brought and the deity prepared to bathe the Buddhas body
The Buddha said to nanda Go to the stupa to the west of the vajra seat under the tree of enlightenment and get my sevenjeweled shaving sword and the vajra bowl
I wish to dress my hair nanda obeyed this command and brought the objects to the seat of the Worldhonored One
After accepting the sword the Buddha said to the congregation Since I have achieved enlightenment I have not told you the story about this sword
You must now listen carefully
When I first left the city and reached a point sixty miles from the palace of my father the king Chanda said to me I am a little tired
Let us please take a short rest As soon as I heard this I stopped
At the place where we rested there was a large dragon pond forty miles in circumference
In the pond there were many lotus flowers of five colors
Around the pond on four sides were flowering trees that gave pleasure to people
I went to the pond and washed my face with water from it
Suddenly two youths came to the place where I was and asked where I was going
I answered that I was seeking enlightenment
The younger one said I am the dragon king of this pond
I have books and the canonical writings of the Vedas
In the present world age of the wise one thousand buddhas are to appear
I have lived through ten world ages since having taken a dragons body and I have seen several Worldhonored Ones achieve enlightenment and enter final extinction 
When Kraku cchanda Buddha was about to enter final extinction he entrusted me with a golden vajra bowl
Inside was a shaving sword
Since then three earlier buddhas of the world age of the wise have appeared this shaving sword and vajra bowl have been passed on from one buddha to the next
I now wish to invite the Benevolent One to come to my palace so that I can present modest offerings to him
Would you allow this I then followed him to his palace and accepted his offerings
He also presented the sevenjeweled sword to me
The dragon then said to me When you cultivate the path you will be frequently troubled by māras
When you meditate place this sword securely on your right knee
This sword will emit light that will cover your body and enlarge it into an image a billion yards tall
The light of this sword will project a curtain that covers your body
On the curtain projected by the sword will be thousands of warriors each holding a sword
They will line up facing out
When the māras see the images of the warriors they will be frightened and they will refrain from entertaining evil thoughts
I will wait until you are about to achieve enlightenment and you are going to shave your hair and beard
Then I will take the vajra bowl and appear at the place where you are When I achieved enlightenment I went to the river to bathe
That dragon brought the bowl to me The Buddha said to the Brahmā king Take the treasure sword and go up to Brahmās palace
Tell the deity of the great earth From the vajra realm construct a vajra platform seven thousand miles in height and have the Tathāgata sit upon it Tell the dragon king Sāgara Transform yourself into eightyfour thousand golden dragons with heads made of seven jewels and bodies made from gold
From the top of Mount Sumeru pour water of the eight superior qualities over the top of the Worldhonored Ones head Also tell the heavenly Māra Wash the Worldhonored Ones hair Instruct the god akra Take the vajra bowl to receive the Worldhonored Ones hair The king of the Nirmāṇarati deities of the fifth heaven of the realm of desire will produce a white silver canopy to shade the Bodhisattvas head
All the buddhas of the ten directions will arrive at the place where I am each seated on a vajra platform and holding a sevenjeweled sword
The buddhas of the ten directions will rub my head with their golden hands
After they have done this I will obtain one hundred thousand kinds of samādhis The Worldhonored Ones who arrived instructed the king of Brahmā Heaven Take the sword and shave the Tathāgatas hair When the king of Brahmā Heaven took the sword and tried to shave the Tathāgatas hair the top of the Tathāgatas head could not be seen
They all looked higher for the top of his head but they still could not see it The Buddha said to the Brahmā king I have seen that the past buddhas all shaved their own hair
The reason why all beings both those who are ignorant or those who are advanced in the path fail to see the top of my head is because I have already shaved my hair my beard and hair are both gone
There are only two strands of mustache left which did not fall even after I had shaved Having shaved I went into the river
The kings of the deities such as Brahmā Indra and the dragon king came rushing to take hold of my hair The buddhas said to the large crowd
We will give a little bit of the Buddhas hair and beard to each of these gods Brahmā Indra and the dragon king
We will also give pieces of the beard to King uddhodana The buddhas of the ten directions again told me The king of the deities in Brahmā Heaven is your great devotee
You should make the top of your head visible and let him take up the sword to shave your beard and hair When I heard these words I made the top of my head visible to him and handed the sword to the Brahmā king
The great earth shook in six kinds of ways and the sword emitted light that illuminated billions of buddha lands
My head that I had made visible reached upward to the top of the realm of form
The Brahmā king went up to the top of my head and started shaving my hair and then shaved the two strands of my mustache
When the mustache was shaven it emitted great light when that light reached this world of Jambudvīpa it formed two jeweled stupas
The stupas were very tall and were richly decorated
After achieving buddhahood I was the first to come to these stupas
The buddhas of the ten directions said to me in unison Give these mustache stupas to the Brahmā king and have him protect them
Make the deity of the firm earth build a small vajra stupa and place the shaving sword and the golden bowl in it
We have seen that when past buddhas ascended to the rank of Enlightened One they first bring salvation to five people
They take this treasure sword and shave their hair with their own hands
Even though they use the sword to shave just before the sword actually touches the hair they chant Welcome and the hair drops off by itself
Worldhonored One now that you have achieved the goal of the path you can take this sword go to the Deer Park and save five people in the same way that the past buddhas saved five people I obeyed these words and went to the Deer Garden
I shaved the hair of five people at Koṭigāma
I used the command Welcome and later taught them the rules of a monks conduct
He also instructed Subhūti You should come out from the ordination platform and light a fire to illuminate hundreds of billions of buddhas so that all the buddhas who are other manifestations of myself will gather together at the ordination platform Subhūti upheld my order and they all assembled
The Tathāgata came from the lecture hall with the shaving sword in his hand
nanda was holding the golden bowl
Accompanied by a large congregation of humans and gods they arrived at the ordination platform and circumambulated it three times
ascended the platform from the northern side and told the Brahmā king I will make shaving swords with the artisans and the gold and steel in heaven that you have offered to me He also told the deity of the firm earth With the vajra you have offered to me I wish to make small stupas and enshrine these treasure swords in them He also told the dragon king Sāgara Your dragon artisans are most skillful
The Tathāgata may make boxes for the treasure swords for me The gods and humans followed these instructions and because the Tathāgata used his supernatural powers the three types of objects were all completed in the span of time it takes to eat just one meal
The shaving swords that were made numbered eightyfour thousand
They were all placed in inner boxes and then placed inside the vajra stupas
The Tathāgata spoke to the buddhas of the ten directions requesting them to offer sword stupas
The sword stupas offered by the buddhas numbered eight billion
He entrusted them all to Mañjuśrī and Samantabhadra
After I enter nirvana take these stupas everywhere throughout the eight billion great kingdoms in the great chiliocosm
Place one stupa in each of the kingdoms
In each of the many worlds of Jambudvīpa there are eightyfour thousand gates of defilements
Sentient beings there all wish to be liberated
These stupas will cause them to renounce the householders life and become liberated from the cycle of birth and death
The numerous kinds of benefits these stupas bring cannot be described in detail The Buddha told Mañjuśrī After the end of this year take this sword stupa of mine to Vajra Cave on Mount Qingliang in China and place it safely there The Buddha told nanda Go to the palace of my father the king
Get the hair I cut off there and give it to the god akra  nanda obeyed the command and gave the hair to the god
The Buddha then asked akra  How many stupas are you going to build for my hair akra answered I will take each strand of the Tathāgatas curling hair and make a stupa for it The Buddha told the dragon king Prepare agate jars and golden boxes and give them to akra so that he can place the strands of curled hair in them At that time the work of constructing these stupas would have required a period of threetimesseven days if akra had made his workers carry it out
Due to the Tathāgatas supernatural power however the hair stupas were all completed in the span of time required to eat one meal
They numbered roughly two hundred and sixty thousand
The Buddha said to the ruler of heaven Keep three hundred stupas here and have them protect the heavenly realm above
As for the other stupas after I enter nirvana Mañjuśrī will be entrusted with eightyfour thousand stupas which will freely bring benefit to all the places where my teaching prevails in the abovementioned kingdoms of Jambudvīpa The Buddha again said to nanda Go to my father the king and bring my beard 
There were sixtyfour strands of hair all together but I already gave two strands to the Brahmā king
Bring the rest here I wish to build stupas nanda obeyed the command to bring the beard hair and gave it to the Worldhonored One
The Buddha said to the rākṣasa demons I will give you two strands of my beard
Build boxes decorated with seven jewels and stupas made of sandalwood
Place these strands of beard in them and worship them
Because of the beards power you will be able to eat and drink The demons said to the Buddha We are very grateful for your kind offer of the strands of your beard and allowing us to build stupas but we do not know how tall the stupas should be The Buddha answered the rākṣasa demons They should be over forty yojanas in height
You should also prepare boxes and stupas for the other sixty strands of the beard
The stupas for these should be about three zhang in height The demons obeyed the command and built the stupas and they were all exceedingly happy
The Buddha also said to the demons You should protect these stupas do not let the evil followers of heterodox teachings demons ghosts or poisonous dragons maliciously destroy my stupas
These stupas are the source of your life
If you protect them you will be provided with abundant food and drink
The stupas will emit light on three separate occasions during the year and illuminate your bodies
Due to the power of this light the seasonal rains grain rock sugar and a variety of fruits and vegetables will be provided for you in sufficient quantity
If you entertain evil thoughts the light will not appear and food and drink will disappear spontaneously
If you see this evil sign you should gather all the rākṣasa demons go to the location of the stupas and express your deeply felt remorse
The stupas will again emit light and sufficient food and drink will again appear As for these beard hair stupas when the Worldhonored One entered nirvana he entrusted the sixty beard stupas to the silent bodhisattvas and ordered them to protect them so that evil kings could not damage them
In the world of Jambudvīpa there are sixty kingdoms where the practice of writing exists
One stupa was placed in each of these kingdoms and the god of the firm earth was ordered to build a vajra stupa three zhang in height where the box containing the beard hair was placed
Famous mountains of these sixty kingdoms were selected in which rock caves were carved to place the stupa inside them
The gates of the caves were sealed firmly so that evil kings could not later open them and damage the stupas Thus the stupas were preserved for a long time
The Fobenxing jing says
When the Buddha had shaved his hair the god changed his appearance once again and this time took on the form of a hunter
He put on a robe made of dyed cloth and took up a bow and some arrows
When the Prince saw the hunter he said Would you give your robe to me
I will give you in return my robe made of Kāśi cloth worth billions of pieces of gold
It has also been perfumed with numerous kinds of sandalwood incense Then he said in verse
This is the robe of a holy person who has achieved liberation Anyone who wields a bow and arrow should not wear it In delight offer the robe to me Do not begrudge passing the heavenly robe on to me The hunter answered Good
Indeed I do not begrudge this gift The god uddhāvāsa then gave the robe that he had manifested and took from the Bodhisattva his wonderful robe of Kāśi cloth and flew up into the sky in an instant to Brahmā Heaven
This was because the deities there wanted to worship the beautiful robe
When the Bodhisattva saw this he was delighted
The Bodhisattva having shaven his hair and put on the monks robe now looked very different
Now dressed in an austere and correct manner he uttered the great vow I am now to be called a true renunciant of the householders life 
Sending Back Chanda the Charioteer and Kaṇṭhaka the Horse The Fobenxing jing Fobenxing ji jing Tbc b Then Chanda and the king of horses wept in sorrow and took leave of the Prince
A verse says
The Bodhisattva left and traveled all through the second half of the night Chanda took his leave and led Kaṇṭhaka away Because of their pressing sorrow they lost their proper manners And after eight days returned to the palace
When Chanda and the horse returned to the city it appeared empty and deserted weeping tears like rain they entered the city
While still outside the palace gate the horse Kaṇṭhaka tried to look inside to see where the Prince used to sit
Failing to see the Prince there the horse wept tears like a stream
All the people and those who had been close to the Prince saw only Chanda and the horse walking toward the palace
They raised their hands and cried out loudly and the tears they wept streamed down their faces A verse says
The court ladies suffered severe pain in their hearts Desperately longing to see the prince return They suddenly saw Chanda and the horse returning alone With tears falling and covering their faces they wept loudly Tearing off their jeweled necklaces and rending their beautiful clothing Letting their hair fall scattered all over their thin bodies Each raised her two hands aloft unwilling to accept what had befallen them Crying aloud they did not fall asleep throughout the night Until dawn arrived The distress among those in the palace who were close to the Prince cannot be described in detail
The great consort Yaśodharā said to Chanda I am a wife who has lost her husband
I have seen the course of events that occurred spontaneouslyhe has left the house and walked into the mountain forests
If I were to stay alone in an empty room how could I keep my heart from breaking in sorrow
Then she said in verse
My body and heart are now very strong As strong as steel and stone My lord has abandoned his householders life and entered the mountains The palace is empty inside How is it that my heart does not break now
Then King uddhodana thought about the Prince and the pain and suffering cut him sharply
Lost in distress he fell to the ground and remained unconscious
A verse says
When the king heard that the Bodhisattvas vow was serious And he saw Chanda and Kaṇṭhaka return He was suddenly lost in distress and his body fell no longer in his control It was as if Indra had taken delight in breaking the kings flag When the king regained consciousness he said in verse
Kaṇṭhaka you are a horse that runs fast Take me back to the place where my son is Because I have lost him I am having difficulty To keep on living I am like a very ill person who does not have a doctor The Puyao jing says
When the Bodhisattva went out of the city gate all living beings in the city of Kapilavastu knew that the Prince had left
They said so to each other and rejoiced
When Gopī the consort of the Prince rose from her bed the next morning and heard people talking at a distance she realized that the Prince had already departed
She heard loud voices and did not see the Bodhisattva or the horse  or Chanda
The king was greatly distressed and threw himself to the ground
In his grief he was shouting at the top of his lungs I have lost my hope forever
On whom am I now supposed to rely Gopī rose from her bed and rolled over onto the ground pulling her hair and tearing off the jeweled necklace from her body
Why was she suffering such pain
He was my teacher I relied on him as if he were a god
Yet he left me and went away How can I go on living anymore
We had not lived very long together as affectionate husband and wife and now we are again separated Her tears streamed down like rain uncontrollably
Everyone was disheartened at not seeing the Bodhisattva
All the trees in the land suddenly lost their vitality and stopped blooming and bearing fruit
All the clean places were filled with dust
The king heard about this and surrounded by his ministers and attendants he went to the garden to see for himself
He too was in sorrow and pain
Gopī wished in her heart that the Bodhisattva would return
Chanda said The Bodhisattva has told the king and Gopī that he will return to see them after he has achieved the Buddhas path The king observed that the treasure robe Chanda and the white horse had returned but he did not see the Prince
He threw himself to the ground Alas
My child well versed in the scriptures and expert in all extraordinary skills has now abandoned the kingdom and the ten thousand people who live in it
Please Chanda explain this to me
Why did my son the Bodhisattva choose the life of a wandering monk
Who opened the city gate
How did the heavenly beings worship him Chanda said King please listen to me
I was peacefully sleeping in my usual place
The gates of the city were closed
At that time the Bodhisattva instructed me to saddle the horse 
The ten thousand people inside the city were all asleep
The ruler of heaven opened the gate and four heavenly kings ordered four deities to hold up the legs of the horse
Hundreds of thousands of deities of the heavens of Indra and Brahmā accompanied the Bodhisattva and sent him off
They sternly guarded the road and illuminated the path with a great light
They scattered flowers and burned incense
Many deities performed music all at once and danced up in the sky
Deities surrounded the Prince and sent him off
Having gone a very long distance the Bodhisattva took off his robe and treasure necklace and he sent me back along with the white horse to report to the king and apologize to his consort
Only after I have attained buddhahood will I return to see you again
Please do not be distressed When Gopī heard Chandas words  her grief deepened
Embracing the white horses head she said sorrowfully The Prince went out riding on you Why did you come back alone
The Princes face was extremely beautiful just like a full moon and adorned with the features of those who are to become buddhas Now he has taken leave of us
People both near and far grieve for this deeply and all are greatly saddened
Why did he go away by himself Who will go after him
Chanda looks miserable and just stares into my eyes defiantly When Chanda saw the pain and suffering of the king and Gopī as has been described here he was even more saddened and weeping he uttered the painful reprimand mentioned above
What the Prince did was all in accord with the path
None should be saddened by it anymore The Fobenxing jing says
King uddhodana sent his messengers to the mountains to admonish the Prince to return
They said in verse
The tip of the thorn is sharp and pointedbut who has ground and sharpened it The colors of the birds and animals form complex patterns but who has drawn them Each following his karmic conditions evolves and changes There is no creator of this world who created it in all its details according to their whim
The Prince replied to these messengers and his reply convinced the king deeply of the doctrine of causes and conditions  So the king rejected his earlier view of what is natural according to which the Prince should not have done anything unnatural like renouncing the householders life
This is a long story and I will not reproduce it in detail here
The Puyao jing says His father the king heard that the Prince had renounced the householders life
He cried in sorrow and wept tears
He then asked What are your wishes
When will you return
You must make a vow with me
I am growing old and there is no one else who can inherit the family and the kingdom from me The Prince answered in verse
If I can obtain four wishes I will not renounce the householders life
First not to grow old second to be forever free of illness Third not to die and fourth never to part from anyone
Gods and immortals who possess the five supernatural powers may stay in this world for the duration of one world age but even they are not free from death
When the king heard his sorrow deepened
Nobody either past or present has ever obtained these four wishes
Who could be an exception to this rule
The Fobenxing jing says
At that time King uddhodana told other members of the ākya clan Members of the ākya clan if you understand the meaning of the present time each branch of the family must allow one person to renounce the householders life
If a particular branch family of the ākya clan has five brothers let three of them renounce while two remain as householders
If there are four let two renounce and two stay
If three let two renounce and one stay
If two let one renounce and one stay
If there is only one then you must not let him renounce the world
The reason for this is that we must not let any of the lineages of our ākya clan be terminated
The Guanfo sanmei jing says There are eightyfour thousand strands of hair on the Tathāgata's head
They grow toward both sides of his head and curl clockwise
The pattern in which these hairs are set apart from each other in an orderly fashion was clearly visible and the four corners of this pattern are also clear
From each of the hair pores fivecolored light emits in a spiral and this light merged with the abovementioned light of fourteen colors
In the past when I was in the palace my nurse washed my hair
At that time Mahāprajāpatī came to me
When Siddhārtha was born many miraculous things happened
If someone were to ask me how long is of my childs hair how am I to answer
I should now measure the length of his hair so that I will know its measure Then the king issued an order for me to stretch out my hair and my mother measured it
It was one zhang three chi and five cun long
As soon as they let go of the locks of hair it curled clockwise forming a spiral pattern
When I was to receive my consort they again measured the length of my hair
It was one zhang three chi and five cun long
When I renounced the householders life heavenly deities took my hair away
It was again one zhang three chi and five cun long
Now the father the king looked at the Tathāgatas hair and stretched it out with his hands
It stretched from the Nyagrodhārāma residence to the fathers palace like a ribbon of dark blue lapis lazuli
It went around the city seven times Such was the length of the Buddhas hair
Everyone in the congregation saw a light indescribable in detail
When the hair was rolled back the light spiraled over and over in a clockwise direction and then going back to the top of the Buddhas head it formed a spiral pattern there
The Sengzhi l
says When the Buddha was in this world he shaved his hair once every fourth month The Sapoduo lun says
Though the Buddha shaved his hair once every fourth month he looked look like ordinary people who had shaved their hair seven days earlier
The Wenshushili wen jing says
Ordinary people should shave their hair when it reaches the length of two fingers
Some shave after two months even if their hair is still short
These are the bodhisattvas who have learned everything there is to learn
Those who let their hair grow beyond the length of two fingers are also bodhisattvas who have learned everything there is to learn
The fingernails should not be allowed to grow to the length of the shorter diameter of a grain
The reason is because ones nails are used to scratch itchy spots
The Sifen l
The Buddha said Monks cut your nails down to the nail bed
You should cut them before your nails reach the length of one grain of wheat
Shave your hair once every halfmonth
Let the hair to grow to the length of two fingers at the longest If you shave only once every two months your hair will grow exceedingly long
The term two months here means a set of white and black months each of which is fifteen days in duration
A period of thirty days is treated as two months The Binimu jing says
The Buddha said to the people The hair cannot be placed in an old cloth or an old vessel
You must use new things The prince of King Juboluo begged the Worldhonored One for his hair
The Buddha said Place it in a vessel of seven jewels and worship it The Sifen l
At that time nanda brought an old vessel in which to put the Worldhonored Ones hair
The Buddha said You should not use an old vessel for the Tathāgatas hair
You should use a new vessel and a new cloth embroidered like an almsbowl cloth and place the hair in them Then a prince General Juboli who was about to embark on a journey of conquest throghout the four directions came asking for the Worldhonored Ones hair
The Buddha said He may have the hair The prince did not know how to put it in a safe place
The Buddha said You may place it in a golden stupa or a silver stupa or a jeweled stupa or inside a cloth embroidered with a complex pattern The prince did not know how to hold it
The Buddha said You may ride on a carriage drawn by elephants or horses and carry it on your head or your shoulder Then the prince departed holding the Worldhonored Ones hair
Everywhere he went in his journey of conquest he achieved victory He returned to his kingdom and built a stupa for the Worldhonored Ones hair
The Buddha also permitted monks to take the Worldhonored Ones hair and place it safely in the abovementioned manner
A monk who had attended to the Buddhas bodily needs and had not washed himself took hold of the Worldhonored Ones stupa
The Buddha said Do not do that
Let only a clean person hold it A monk placed the Tathāgatas stupa safely in an unpleasant room the monk himself went upstairs and spent the night in a nicer room
The Buddha said Do not do that
You should place the Tathāgatas stupa safely in the nicer room upstairs and spend the night in the unpleasant room A monk placed the Tathāgatas stupa in a room downstairs while he himself spent the night in a room upstairs
The Buddha said Do not do this
You should place the Tathāgatas stupa in the upstairs room and spend the night in the downstairs room A monk spent the night in the same room
The Buddha had said Do not do that The monk wanted to provide strong protection but he was fearful and reverent so he would not spend the night in the same place as the Tathāgatas stupa
The Buddha said Place it safely on a post
If you place it on a post this is as good as sleeping with it near your head
If it is for the sake of providing protection to the stupa I permit you to spend the night in the stupa
Furthermore because it is for the purpose of protecting what is inside the stupa I also permit you to spend the night there A monk who was wearing leather sandals or holding them entered the stupa
The Buddha said Do not do that The Buddha said I permit sitting down under the stupa for eating but will not allow littering the place with unclean things
If you have unclean things gather them near your feet and after eating take them away Note To mention a similar case suppose there is someone who is about to embark on a journey of conquest
He has not seen the Buddhas hair but possesses a small image made by a wellintentioned layperson a piece of a relic and a copy of a roll of a small scripture
He places all of these inside his hair
I do not know whether this is permitted
Answer
There is no statement in the holy teaching on this point
However if someone with good intentions wishes to take a scripture an image or a piece of relic then following the abovementioned instruction to those who take the Worldhonored Ones hair on a journey of conquest he is permitted to place the object in a small stupa for safekeeping Place the precious object inside the stupa and do not put anything else in it
It is also permitted to wrap the object in a clean piece of embroidered silk and take it on the journey
When you reach your destination you should place it on a good post putting it there safely as described above
If you want to place the object in your hair I fear that your hair may be dirty smelly and impure
Furthermore on the road at some point in the military expedition you may suddenly need to defecate or urinate At that time there may not be enough time to undo your hair and take the object out from there
As in the case of the Buddhas hair mentioned above it is not permitted to take such objects and place them near a latrine
Permission to carry scriptures and images is given according to the instruction mentioned above The Shieryou jing  the Zengyi ahan jing  and the Chang ahan jing all say that the Prince renounced the householders life at the age twentynine
The Zengyi ahan jing says The Prince remained among the teachers of heterodox teachings for twenty years To give a broad outline of the Buddhas life the Tathāgata stayed in this world for seventynine years
If he renounced the householders life at the age of twentynine he would have achieved enlightenment at the age of thirtyfive
His teaching career would have spanned a period of fortyfive years
The Chanyao jing says In his lifetime ākyamuni taught sentient beings for thirtynine years Many scriptures say that the Prince renounced the householders life at the age of nineteen We should take this as the correct information
The Weizengyou jing says Yaśodharā said The Tathāgata was with me for less than three years The Ruiying jing says The Prince took his consort at the age of seventeen which proves that the view that he renounced the world at the age of nineteen is the correct one
The view that the Prince renounced the householders life at the age of twentynine and achieved enlightenment at the age of thirtyfive appears only in a few scriptural passages
Furthermore if we take into account the passage that states that the Prince studied among teachers of heterodox teachings for twenty years he would have achieved enlightenment at the age of fifty
This would be absurd
Different views appear because the capacities of sentient beings differ
Comment We are talking about matters that belong to a generation far in the past
The sounds of nonChinese languages and the Chinese language are very different
There have been many different translators and the words and names received through them also differ
Even though we wish to harmonize these different stories in the end there is no fixed standard
The books regarding the lifetime of ākyamuni Buddha have been transmitted and copied over and over and mistakes due to similarities in the characters have crept in
There are furthermore differences between things that come from outside the country and those that developed within
These books in their original forms are thus as distant from us as birds flying in the clouds above
Even if we seek them from here it is difficult to get them in their unambiguously original forms
There are furthermore such stories as that the Yellow Emperor had three faces or that Duke Yuechen was onelegged
Even where there is no problem of bridging the gap between China and foreign places there are regional differences in China such as the proverbial contrast between Chu and Yue
Heterodox practices are easier to understand the correct teaching is difficult to grasp completely
Where there are differences in words between those that are central and those that are peripheral sometimes these are copied in the wrong order
When we look into the matter in detail how could it not be that different versions of the original stories appear in the sources
One Thousand Buddhas Introduction Almsbegging Studying Meditation Austerities Taking Gruel The Grass Seat Conquering Māra Enlightenment Praise from the Gods and Transformations
It is heard that when the time came the Great Sage manifested himself through cosmic response
The shadow of his influences covered all directions and his teaching reached everywhere in the three realms
He was the leader of the four kinds of living beings the ferryboat for all beings in the six realms of rebirth
He was born in Tuṣita Heaven and had a short lifetime in the world
When he entered the womb wearing the sun as his crown flying stars left traces in the darkness In the Lumbinī Garden he showed the thirtytwo marks of an extraordinary being for the first time
The vilakṣa tree under which he was born emitted ten kinds of light
With the help of the mirror of the four city gates he renounced the life of five desires
Abandoning the awesome city he went away alone
With the help of the tree of truth  he ascended beyond the limits of this world
He brought the four bowls sent by the four heavenly kings together into one almsbowl at the Nairañjanā River and saved the five ascetics in the Deer Garden
Those who indulge in love are caught up endlessly in attachment
washed off defilements in the twilight of earlier world ages
The Sun of Wisdom has already shone and its light has purified the jails of hell
Having succeeded in initiating the work of teaching sentient beings he cast the light of compassion on the four kinds of living beings
He teaches in one voice and all beings understand him differently according to the capacity of the category of beings to which they belong
The rise of Buddhism has been slow but steady its development has been occurring for a long time now
The Sifen l
At that time the Bodhisattva was traveling slowly
Crossing the border into the kingdom of Magadha he went to the city of Rājagṛha and spent the night there
The next morning he went into the city and begged for almsfood
He had a handsome appearance stretching and bending his body and looking up and down he walked in a dignified manner
His gaze was directed straight ahead he did not look around to the right or left
Wearing a robe and holding an almsbowl he entered the city of Rājagṛha to beg for food
At that time the king of Magadha was on the top of a tall building surrounded by ministers before and behind him
He saw the Bodhisattva enter the city to beg for food walking in a dignified manner The king turned to his ministers and praised the Bodhisattva with a verse
Then he sent a messenger to ask the monk Where shall I go to have an audience with you The Bodhisattva answered There is a mountain called Paṇḍava
I am staying there The messenger quickly returned and reported this to the king
As soon as the king heard the message he ordered the elephants and carriage to be prepared and decorated and accompanied by many people he went to the Bodhisattva to worship him
At that time the king said to the Prince Please stay here now
I will give you all of my kingdom everything that I own and this crown of jewels
Ascend the kings throne and rule over the kingdom
I will serve you as your minister The Bodhisattva replied I have given up the status of universal monarch and have renounced the householders life in order to study the path
How could I now accept the rank of ruler of this border kingdom and remain in the world
Now as the king should know if a person who has seen the great ocean then sees a tiny puddle of water in the footprint of an ox how could he become attached to that puddle
Your offer is just like this
How could anyone who has given up the status of universal monarch become accustomed to the rank of the king of a minor kingdom
It is wrong to expect that Then the king said before the Bodhisattva  If you attain highest enlightenment first visit the city of Rājagṛha and have an audience with me The Bodhisattva answered That I can agree to The king paid respect to the Bodhisattvas feet and circumambulated him three times and then departed
The Fobenxing jing says
The Bodhisattva said to the king of Magadha Great king we are now certainly not afraid of those poisonous snakes nor are we afraid of thunder and lightning
We are also not afraid of fierce fiery flames which when a great wind blows burns up the fields and marshes
We are only afraid of the realm of five desires pressing upon us
All desires are transitory like thieves they steal the merit we have accumulated Then the Bodhisattva spoke in verse The five desires are transitory and harm merit The six kinds of sense objects empty and illusory damage sentient beings Retribution in this world is ultimately nothing but deception to people Who among the wise would stay here even for a short while The ignorant are not content even in heaven
How could they obtain what is agreeable to their hearts in the human realm The desires are for defiled things they have not awakened to knowledge Their desires are like a fierce fire burning dried grass Long ago a holy ruler born into the highest rank of society Conquered the four realms of the world and raised high the golden ring of the universal monarch He was also allowed to sit next to the god akra and serve as his deputy Yet suddenly he felt greed and immediately fell Even a king who rules everywhere in this great earth Still further desires to rule over other places The desires of worldly people are limitless They are like a great ocean that swallows all streams Let the great king know
Underneath Mount Sumeru there were demons
Two demon brothers desired the same jade woman
The two brothers fought and injured each other and they both died Then he said in verse
A long time ago two demon brothers Harmed each other for the sake of a jade woman With desire for bones and flesh defiling attachments increase The wise observe and know this and they are free from greedy desires The Bodhisattva also said Because of the five desires people are reborn as gods and humans
Having been born because of their attachment to the five desires they end up throwing themselves in water or walking over fire
Due to the five desires people invite hatred and revenge upon themselves He then said in verse
Because of love and desire foolish people end up in poverty and dire straits Bound injured and then killed they suffer many kinds of pain They think that if their desires are fulfilled many things will be accomplished They do not realize that their strength will be exhausted before they achieve this goal And their misfortunes will continue into future lives Also the Fobenxing jing says
The Bodhisattva said in verse
Even if loving each other we stayed together When our lives end we still must part from each other I see that life is transitory and lasts only for a brief moment For this reason I now seek liberation The Sifen l
Then the Bodhisattva went to rāḍa Kālāmas place and studied the meditation of the sphere of nonapplication
He practiced this diligently and before long he had mastered this teaching
He then abandoned and departed
Later he went to Udraka Rāmaputras place and studied the meditation of neither thought nor nothought
He practiced this diligently and before long he had mastered this teaching
The Bodhisattva thought These two meditative states are definitely neither nirvana nor the restful state of eternal quietude
I do not take pleasure in these teachings He then abandoned these two teachers and went in search of a superior teaching
The superior teaching that the Bodhisattva looked for at that time was the supreme teaching of quiescence
At that time the five ascetics who followed the Bodhisattva said If Bodhisattva achieve enlightenment you should preach to us The Fobenxing jing says
The holy man Arada answered the Bodhisattva The human love of ordinary people is based on greedy desires and results in suffering such as that which comes from bondage
Everything is caused by the mental realm of the external world He then said in verse
Mountain goats are killed because of their loud cries that attract death Moths throw themselves into lamps because of the flames color Fish in water are caught because they swallow bait Worldly people proceed to death because they are pulled by external objects The new Posha lun says
When the Buddha was still a bodhisattva he developed aversion to old age illness and death
He left the city of Kapilavastu in search of supreme wisdom
At that time King uddhodana sent five people of the ākya clan after him to attend him
Two of them were from his mothers clan and three from his fathers
The two from the mothers clan were ordered to take charge of the sense pleasures of the Bodhisattva so that those pleasures could be pure
The three from his fathers clan were to take charge of the austerities so that these could be pure
When the Bodhisattva was practicing austerities the two people from the mothers clan could not bear to see this in their hearts and they immediately left
The Bodhisattva later realized that practicing austerities was not the right way
He abandoned them and  gruel and ghee
He put oil on his body and walked around in the place where he practiced
All three people from the fathers clan said The Bodhisattva has gone mad and lost his will and they too abandoned him and departed
Later when the Worldhonored One had achieved buddhahood he had the following thought These people were all from my parents clans
Earlier they came to pay respect to me and looked after me
Now I wish to reward them but where have they gone The gods said They are now in the holy ones Deer Garden in the kingdom of Vārāṇasī All other items are given in this source in the same manner as above Question
Why is the place called Vārāṇasī
Answer It is the name of a river
Not far from the river stands the kings city
Therefore the city is also called Vārāṇasī Question
Why is it called the place where the holy ones debate
Answer
According to one view all buddhas meditate in this place and turn the wheel of the Dharma 
According to another view buddhas are the most superior among the holy ones
They all turn the wheel of the Dharma for the first time in this place
Therefore it is called the place where the holy ones debate
According to this view buddhas do not meditate here they turn the wheel of Dharma
According to yet another view it should be called the place where the holy ones live
When the buddhas appear in the world the holy one who is the Buddha and his holy disciples live there
When the Buddha is not in the world only pratyekabuddhas live there
When pratyekabuddhas are absent holy ones of five supernatural powers live there
Because holy ones always live there constantly in past present and future times it is called the place where the holy ones live
According to one view the place should be called the place where the holy ones fell
In the past five hundred holy ones flew in the sky but when they reached this place they encountered the conditions for regression and instantly they all fell 
Question Why is the place called the Forest of Making Offerings to Deer
Answer Deer have always roamed here
Therefore it is called the Deer Park
Long ago a king called Brahmadatta made offerings to the deer in this forest
Therefore it is called the Forest of Making Offerings to Deer
Elder Kalanda dug a pond in a bamboo garden in Rājagṛha and offered it to the kalandaka bird so that it could roam and play there
For this reason the pond is called Veṇuvanakalandakanivāpa Pond
The name of the Forest of Making Offerings to Deer was given to the park in question in the same manner as in the example of Veṇuvanakalandakanivāpa Pond According to an older translation the bird is called jialanduo
The Shanjian lun says that this bird resembled a magpie The Bodhisattva practiced austerities at the place of the five Koṭigāma monks in this Deer Park
For six years he lived in extreme conditions and the excessive pain he experienced surpassed those of his teacher
Even though he starved himself he did not achieve the goal of the path consequently he labored in vain and his appearance showed signs of exhaustion
The Niepan jing  says
When the Bodhisattva was practicing austerities in order to discipline his mind he ate one sesame seed a day
After seven days he took rice red beans hemp seed and grain gruel
He also took white beans in the same way eating one on each of the seven days
As he practiced in this way his skin and flesh became thin and wrinkled and he began to look like a calabash that had been cut from its stem and placed in the sun 
His eyes sank into his eye sockets and looked like stars reflected at the bottom of a well
His flesh was emaciated his ribs stuck out and his torso looked like a grass house that was rotting away
The discs on his spine could be seen and resembled bricks laid on top of each other in two pillars
The place he sat upon looked like a horseshoe
When he tried to sit down he fell forward when he tried to stand up he fell backward
Even though he experienced such pain that brought no benefit he still did not give up the intention of seeking enlightenment
The Pusa chutai jing says
The Buddha said to a bodhisattva who was practicing austerities Long ago I practiced an innumerable number of even more extreme austerities
On the banks of the Nairañjanā River I practiced austerities for six years
I took one sesame seed and one grain of rice every day
In the past I had committed offenses of speech against a pratyekabuddha on four occasions and had refused offerings on one occasion
For this reason I was paying heavily for the crime of taking the truth lightly
The Daji jing says
At this time Jyotirasa Bodhisattva said to the congregation in verse An infinite number of world ages ago I made a variety of gifts to practice the perfection of giving I preserved the purity of the precepts and practiced patience Vigor meditation and studied wisdom For the comfort of all sentient beings I endured numerous kinds of suffering Inside the palace there were sixty thousand ladies But I abandoned them and renounced the householders life As easily as if I were slipping out of my shoes I lived alone for six years and cultivated austerities I ate one hemp seed and one grain of rice and wheat 
I practiced vigorously day and night without sleeping And my body was reduced to skin and bones When I sat down under the tree of enlightenment to meditate Eight hundred heavenly māras came Filling all directions on the ground and in heaven Within an area of eighty miles in all directions Such an army of māras and their attendants I could destroy and force to surrender Having achieved supreme enlightenment I realized the fruit of the absolute truth The Fobenxing jing says
After six years had passed in the spring on the twentysixth day of the third month the Bodhisattva had the following thought I should not continue like this any more
After taking some nourishment I will realize supreme enlightenment
From whom shall I now obtain some delicious food
Who will give me food and enable me after having eaten to realize supreme enlightenment When the Bodhisattva had this thought one deity learned of this thought in the Bodhisattvas mind and quickly went to Sujātā the second daughter of the village head
On arrival the deity immediately said to her You the daughter Sujātā know what the present time now signifies
The Bodhisattva now wishes to partake of some delicious food
The Bodhisattva must now have the highest quality food
After he eats this delicious food he will then realize supreme enlightenment
You must now prepare sixteen portions of milk gruel At that time the second daughter of the village head having heard the deity speak in this fashion was overjoyed with excitement that immediately coursed through her body
She quickly collected one thousand cows and gathered their milk
Then she fed the milk in turn to five hundred cows
On a different day she collected milk from those five hundred cows and in turn fed it to two hundred and fifty cows
On a later day she gathered the milk of those two hundred and fifty cows and fed it to one hundred and twentyfive cows
On a later day she collected the milk of those one hundred and twentyfive cows and fed it to sixty cows
On a later day she collected the milk of those sixty cows and fed it to thirty cows
On a later day she collected the milk of those thirty cows and fed it to fifteen cows
On a later day she collected the milk of those fifteen cows and mixing it with a portion of good quality unpolished rice she prepared cooked milk gruel for the Bodhisattva
When that second daughter was cooking the milk gruel a variety of visions appeared
a vision of a jar filled with flowers the banks of the river of merit the sign of the auspicious svastika a wheel of merit with one thousand spokes a largenecked oxen the king of elephants and the king of dragons a fish a great person the god akra  the god Brahmā the milk gruel boiling up half way to the top of a tāla tree and coming down then boiling up again to the top of the tāla tree and coming down or milk gruel rising up to the height of one zhang and returning into the pot with not even a drop of it missing the pot and falling 
While she was cooking the milk gruel a seer skilled in prognostications numerical calculations and reading signs appeared to her
Seeing these visions appear from the milk gruel he observed them carefully and then said How extraordinary How extraordinary
If someone obtains this milk gruel and eats it not long thereafter that person will realize the marvelous medicine of immortality On the twentythird day of the second month the Bodhisattva came in the morning to the great gate of the house of the village head and stood there silently thinking about asking for almsfood
When the daughter of the house saw this she took out a golden bowl from where it had been safely stored and also took honey and milk gruel and filled the bowl with them
Holding the bowl in her own hands she went before the Bodhisattva and said to him I request the Venerable One to accept this bowl filled with honey and milk gruel out of pity and compassion for me The Bodhisattva accepted the milk gruel and took it to the banks of the Nairañjanā River
A dragon princess called Niliantuye jumped out of the ground holding in her hand a decorated heavenly fish trap which she presented to the Bodhisattva
Having received this gift the Bodhisattva sat down upon it
After sitting down the Bodhisattva took the milk gruel that the daughter of the village head Sujātā had given him and ate it as much as he wished until he was full
He ate all of the gruel
When the Bodhisattva had finished the milk gruel due to the effect of the merit he had accumulated in previous lives through performing acts of giving his body and its marks were restored to their original state
He was again delightfully goodlooking fully endowed with all marks without any flaws
After the Bodhisattva had finished eating the gruel he threw the golden bowl into the river
At that time the dragon king was gripped by a rare and extraordinary feeling
Marveling at the fact that the Bodhisattva had appeared in this world he took the golden vessel and pretended as if he were going to worship it and was about to take it back to his own palace
Then the ruler of heaven akra transformed his body into that of a garuḍa with a vajra beak
He approached the ocean dragon king snatched away the golden bowl and flew toward the palace in the Heaven of the Thirtythree Gods to worship it there constantly
The bowl is still there at this time
The thirtythree gods established a ceremony for it called the ceremony of worshiping the golden bowl which has been continued without a break from that time until now
When the Bodhisattva finished eating he rose from his seat and slowly walked toward the tree of enlightenment
The dragon princess came and took the fish trap away and after returning to her palace she worshiped it
A verse says
The Bodhisattva ate milk gruel as determined by the teaching It was what the woman Sujātā presented to him After he finished eating he was delighted and went to the tree of enlightenment He was definitely about to realize the highest knowledge The Daoxuan lshi ganying ji says
This work relates a number of stories in detail I also reproduced some in the royal consecration section The deities of the four heavens said to the Vinaya master In the eleventh year after the Worldhonored One had achieved enlightenment he was in the garden of Elder Soma in the city of Rājagṛha
He told many great bodhisattvas and great disciples When I first left the city I went to the kingdom of Pingsha and on the road met a girl who was a cow herdess
I said to her I am a little hungry
Let me beg food and drink from you The girl answered Where are you going I answered I am in search of enlightenment She also asked What is your name I answered My name is Siddhārtha The girl then said to me I have read in the Vedic scripture the following words
In the near future a great sage will appear and achieve supreme enlightenment
I see that your appearance and voice are those of the Buddha
I am the deity of this mountain
For the period of sixteen world ages I have personally met all past buddhas
You should follow me and come to the place where I live
I will give you food and drink
At the time when the past buddha Kāśyapa entered nirvana he entrusted me with a bathing pot
At the top of the ladle there is a pattern of two entwined dragons at the bottom there is a squatting lion
It was made by Kraku cchanda Buddha and is to be passed on from one person to another until it reaches Ruci Buddha the last of the one thousand buddhas
Inside this dragon jar is the water of eight merits
You should drink this water if you are hungry and thirsty
It will reduce defiling passions and allow the seeds of enlightenment to grow
Do not underestimate this small jar
Even if you were to pour all the water of the four great oceans into this jar it would still not become full
A dragon king lives inside it
At the beginning of the present world age of the wise three buddhas appeared in the world All the teachings that these buddhas left are preserved inside this jar
The jar is identical with the palace of the Sāgara dragon
Kāśyapa Buddha also entrusted me with an incense burner and a golden box
I entrust these to you
Sixteen animal heads are on the front of the incense burner
half of these are lions and the other half white elephants
A lotus flower platform rises above the heads of  two animals
The platform is shaped into a burner
At four edges of the burner six silver pavilions rises separately and from each pavilion a divine youth two cun tall emerges
There are ninetysix divine youths altogether
Every time incense is burned each of these youths takes a turn one by one to offer incense
On the back of the burner are crouching lions facing outward
From the top of the lions heads rise nine dragons twisted around each other
They hold aloft a golden lotus
Inside this flower is a golden platform which is in fact a jewel 
Inside this jewel are one hundred and thirty thousand pavilions of pearls each of which contains various kinds of marvelous incense
There are also one hundred and thirty thousand copies of Vinaya scripture
Inside are monks in the meditative state of the samādhi of cessation 
When incense is burned the heavenly youths at the top of the incense burner come to the place where the treasure stupa platform is located and each youth sings the tune for burning incense 
The door to the stupa platform opens spontaneously and monks emerge out of meditation and come outside
They take incense from the pavilions of pearls and give it to the heavenly youths After they have given the incense to the youths the door closes spontaneously
Each of the nine dragons holds a white silver pavilion inside its mouth
The pavilion is surrounded by platforms
On each of the silver platforms are heavenly youths constantly singing heavenly music giving praise and burning incense
The sound of this music is incomparably pure and elegant
A sentient being who hears the sound gives rise to faith in the path of enlightenment
Every time the Tathāgata preaches the Dharma he holds this incense burner in front of the congregation
Heavenly youths bring incense and give it to the Buddha so that he can make an offering
There is also a golden box which holds a copy of the Great Perfection of Wisdom Scripture  altogether three billion verses
The book is made of gold
The division is marked by white jade and the letters are in white silver
The box is three cun long
Inside there are two monks who had also entered the meditative state of cessation
Both this box and the incense burner were made by Krakucchanda Buddha and they have been passed on from one person to another through me until they reached Ruci Buddha the last of the one thousand buddhas
When the buddhas are about to appear in the world they all open this golden box and examine the scriptures carefully
Due to the power of the Perfection of Wisdom they are not troubled by heavenly māras and they quickly attain supreme enlightenment
I now entrust these to you
Make an effort to protect them and do not let them be damaged Having accepted these I practiced austerities for six years under the tree of enlightenment
I always drank the water from this jar and was therefore free from hunger and thirst
The defiling passions also decreased
Again when I first was about to achieve enlightenment I went into the river to bathe
I accepted milk gruel from the second daughter 
When I came to the base of the tree of enlightenment and was about to ascend the vajra platform a mountain deity came to me and said The enlightenment that you will now achieve follows the example of past buddhas
When they first achieved enlightenment and were about to ascend the vajra platform they first took the incense burner and circumambulated the platform seven times
Each of the buddhas of the ten directions picked up the incense in their hands and put it in the burner The enlightenment attained by the Buddha followed the example of earlier buddhas
The Buddha followed this instruction circumambulated the platform and the tree of enlightenment altogether thirtytwo times
The buddhas of the ten directions also offered incense and then ordered human kings divine kings akra Brahmā the dragon king and the most advanced bodhisattvas of the tenth stage to offer incense
Due to the Buddhas great power the fragrance pervaded throughout all ten directions up to the very apex of the universe
When sentient beings suffering from pain smelled this fragrance they were liberated all their organs were restored and their wisdom enhanced
It is not possible to describe in detail the numerous miracles that occurred
The buddhas of the ten directions also ordered the Brahmā king Bring the dragons jar of water to wash the Worldhonored Ones feet Human kings heavenly kings akra and Brahmā took turns washing his feet
The earth shook in six different ways and golden light was emitted from under the Tathāgatas feet
The Tathāgata was sitting on the seat of golden lotus flowers
Each of the buddhas of the ten directions came and threw incense
In the light Vairocana Buddha stretched his golden hand and rubbed the top of ākyamuni Buddhas head and then preached the marvelous teaching
We the buddhas of the ten directions now confer on ākyamuni Buddha the ceremony of ordination as he attains the royal throne of the supreme teaching
By means of this ceremony the buddhas ascend the golden platform An infinite number of gods and people as numerous as grains of sand in the Ganges River heard the buddhas words and immediately became very quiet the silence was so deep that it was like that of a monk who has entered the fourth meditative state
With that ceremony the buddhas conferred the royal throne 
The earth shook greatly in six ways and the Buddha emitted light that illuminated throughout the ten directions
The Buddha performed many of the things that buddhas are supposed to do and benefited everyone
These were so numerous that they cannot be described in detail here The Fobenxing jing 
When the Bodhisattva bathed in the river and had eaten the milk gruel his body was cleansed and its beautiful appearance was restored to its original form
Strong free and relaxed he again approached the tree of enlightenment
The Bodhisattva thought What kind of sitting place shall I make in this place of enlightenment Immediately he realized that he should sit on grass
At that time the god uddhāvasa said to the Bodhisattva When they wished to achieve enlightenment all the past buddhas sat on grass and obtained supreme enlightenment The Bodhisattva looked around thinking Who will give me grass for this purpose At that time akra  the heavenly ruler of the Heaven of the Thirtythree Gods learned by means of his divine knowledge what was on the Bodhisattvas mind and he transformed himself into a grass cutter
At a place neither too far from nor too close to the Bodhisattva he stood to the right and cut and gathered grass
The grass had green edges
Its color was like that of a peacocks neck
It was soft and smooth and when you touched it with your hand it felt like fine Kāśi cloth
The grass was beautiful in color fragrant and curled in a clockwise direction
The Bodhisattva asked that man O wise and good person what is your name The man answered My name is Svastika The Bodhisattva thought I now seek something auspicious for myself
I also seek something that is auspicious for others
This man whose name is Svastika  is right in front of me
I now will definitely achieve highest enlightenment He asked Can you give me some of this grass The phantom one replied I can give you this grass At the time when akra transformed himself into a man cut grass and offered it to the Bodhisattva the Bodhisattva took one bundle and held it in his hand
When he held the grass the ground immediately shook in six ways
Then he took the grass and walked toward the spot at the base of the tree of enlightenment
On his way carrying the grass five hundred blue sparrows appeared from all ten directions and flew around the Bodhisattva in a clockwise direction
After flying around the Bodhisattva three times they then followed him Other creatures did the same
five hundred kokila birds five hundred peacocks five hundred white geese five hundred large cranes five hundred white gulls five hundred kalaviṅka birds and five hundred twoheaded birds
There were also five hundred white elephants all sixtusked five hundred white horses with ravenblack heads and ears and red long and scattered manes and tails and five hundred ox kings all with massive necks like black clouds
Then there were five hundred boys and five hundred girls each ornamented with a variety of beautiful necklaces
There were also five hundred heavenly deities five hundred heavenly maidens and five hundred treasure jars The jars were filled with incense and flowers and contained a variety of wonderful perfumes
The perfume flowed spontaneously without anyone holding the jars
Furthermore all of the auspicious things in this world gathered together from all directions like clouds and rain and they all came to be placed on the Bodhisattvas righthand side
They circled around the Bodhisattva three times and then followed him
Every kind of heavenly music sounded joyfully in the sky praising the Bodhisattva
All these cannot be described in detail here
The Ruiying benqi jing says
akra took the form of an ordinary person and held pure and soft grass
The Bodhisattva asked What is your name He answered My name is Svastika  When the Bodhisattva heard this he was filled with great joy
He destroyed inauspicious things and realized auspicious things
The Guanfo sanmei jing says
When he set down the grass for a seat the earth shook greatly
The buddhas projected the vision of eighty thousand bodhi trees and lion seats
Some of the bodhi trees were eight thousand miles or four thousand miles  some were one hundred thousand yojanas
All the buddha trees are accompanied by eighty thousand bodhi trees of different sizes
The tree of ākyamuni is the shortest The robes of gods are spread over some of these trees
The Guanfo sanmei jing Tbc a b The Buddha told his father the king After I left your palace city not far from the city of Gaya I paid respect to the ashuduo tree
Jian along with one hundred thousand other deities all had the following thought If the Bodhisattva is to sit here he needs something to sit on
I will now present heavenly grass and then grabbed a bunch of pure and soft heavenly grass called jixiang 
After the Bodhisattva received the grass he placed it on the ground and sat down upon it
At that time the deities saw a white hair between the Bodhisattvas eyebrows three cun long and curled clockwise
One hundred thousand colors flowed into each of these hairs
Each deity thought The grass the Bodhisattva took now was the grass I offered and not yours Then billions of bodhisattvas appeared in each white hair sitting with crossed legs in the meditation posture all of them had accepted some grass and was sitting under a tree
The deities all saw this vision in the white hair
A deity called Yueyi saw a grass blade grow from the ground pass through the Bodhisattvas flesh and reach upward to his elbow
He told the other deities How extraordinary
This persons practice of austerity is such that he did not take food for a long time yet he does not cry and he does not even realize that grass is growing through his body Then the Bodhisattva straightened a white hair with his right hand and when the strand of hair was stretched out perfectly straight it extending to a length of one zhang four chi and five cun
It looked like a heavenly white jewel hollow and translucent
Deities saw billions and billions of rays of light inside these rays of light were fine and subtle and were indescribable
When the deities saw this they marveled at it as something never before seen
Then the white hair curled clockwise and returned to its original form
At that time the Bodhisattva conquered Māra who then returned to his heavenly palace
The white hair followed him passing right through the six heavens
Innumerable heavenly beings and heavenly maidens saw the hole that the white hair went through
It was hollow within beautifully cylindrical just like a Brahmā kings flag
The Tathāgata has innumerable marks and in each of these marks there are eightyfour thousand minor marks
Yet even a small part of the merit of one white hair is greater than that of all these marks
The Yinguo jing says
On the seventh day of the fourth month the Worldhonored One conquered Māra
At that time the light of the setting sun disappeared and the bright moon illuminated everywhere
Though it was not yet spring flowers and fruit trees in the garden bloomed
The Zhidu lun says
At that time heavenly māras came with one hundred and eightythousand followers and harassed the Buddha
The Buddha illuminated them with the light that appeared from between his eyebrows and they all fell to the ground
The Guanfo sanmei jing says
King Māra became angry and wanted to advance
A son of Māra reprimanded him Why does my father the king seek trouble for no reason
The practice of the Bodhisattva is pure as immovable as the ground
How could we destroy it The Zabaozang jing says
Long ago when the Buddha was sitting under the tree the Evil One Māra leading eight billion associates was about to come to destroy the Buddha
He said to the Buddha How can you sit here alone by yourself
Get up quickly
If you do not get up I will grab you by your legs and throw you into the ocean The Buddha said I observe that in the world there is no one who can assault me
In a previous life you received the eight precepts for one day in a temple and offered a bowl of food to a pratyekabuddha
For this reason you have been reborn in the six heavens of the realm of desire as the great king Māra
I also offered food to an innumerable number of hearers and pratyekabuddhas for a period of three sets of innumerable numbers of world ages Māra said You say that long ago I upheld precepts for one day and offered food to a pratyekabuddha
This is indeed true
I know this as well as you do
Who bears witness to what you say about yourself The Buddha pointed to the ground and said This ground is my witness When he spoke these words the ground everywhere shook in six ways
The earth deity appeared from the vajra realm and holding her palms together in greeting said to the Buddha I will serve as your witness
Ever since this earth was formed I have always been within it
What the Worldhonored One said is not false but the very truth The Buddha said to Māra If you are able to move this jar of water you can then take me and throw me into the ocean When Māra and his eight billion associates could not move the water jar Māras army was thrown into confusion collapsing from within and totally routed the army scattered in all directions
The Fobenxing jing says
Then the oldest son of King Māra whose name was Shangzhu  greeted the Bodhisattva by bowing his head to the Bodhisattvas feet
Repentant he begged for pardon saying Great Kindly and Holy One please accept apologies from my father
He says I am ignorant shallow and full of shortcomings just like a child and deprived of wisdom
I went suddenly and disturbed the Holy One
Leading many associates of Māra I projected many visions in order to frighten the Holy One Earlier I advised my father from the loyal and correct point of view
I said to him Even a wise person skilled in many arts cannot conquer Prince Siddhārtha
We certainly cannot conquer him I only wish that the Holy One will forgive my father
He is ignorant and unfamiliar with moral principles and therefore he is frightened
Great Holy One where will he be reborn
Great Holy One may you quickly achieve what you earlier vowed to achieve namely that you will soon attain supreme enlightenment The Puyao jing says
The Bodhisattva sat under the tree and when the morning star appeared he suddenly achieved great enlightenment
He had renounced the householders life at age nineteen and achieved enlightenment at age thirty
The Banruowen lun says In the uruvilvā forest he achieved enlightenment The Zishi sanmei jing says
When first achieved enlightenment each of the buddhas of the ten directions sent a robe
The Buddha combined them to make one robe
This robe is now worshiped in Brahmā Heaven
The Kongxing sanmei jing says Amitābha Buddha achieved enlightenment four world ages earlier than I did
Vipaśyin Buddha achieved enlightenment three world ages before I did
There was a buddha called Nengru
He entered nirvana at the age of thirty
Kāśyapa Buddha achieved enlightenment at age eighteen I achieved enlightenment at the age of twentyseven
Here I follow the more frequently found view and determine that the age when the Bodhisattva renounced the householders life was nineteen and he attained enlightenment at thirty
This must be the correct information
Furthermore these dates are in harmony with other sources of information
The Shanjian l
says On the third day after the moon reappeared the Bodhisattva attained complete wisdom The Niyuan jing says All buddhas achieve their first enlightenment on the eighth day of the fourth month We accept this as the correct information now
The Huayan jing says
Using his supernatural powers the Tathāgata without leaving his seat under the tree of enlightenment reached the palace of supreme beauty at the summit of Mount Sumeru and the palace decorated with jewels in Yama Heaven
He went to all the palaces decorated with jewels in Tuṣita Heaven
At that time the king of Tuṣita Heaven accepted his power and said in verse
The Tathāgata free of all impediments is like a full moon He is the first among all auspicious beings Because he enters into many palaces decorated with jewels here This heaven is the most auspicious among all The Huayan jing says
At this time because of the supernatural power of the Tathāgata in all the Jambudvīpa worlds within all the four continents in all the buddha worlds in the ten directions a tathāgata sitting under a tree of enlightenment appeared
At this time because of the power of the Worldhonored One without rising from his seat the Tathāgata went up toward the palace of akra at the summit of Mount Sumeru
Then the god akra said in verse
Among the seven buddhas Dīpaṅkara Buddha and others He is supreme among all these auspicious beings Because that buddha came to this place in the past This place is the most auspicious among all At this time because of the Worldhonored Ones supernatural power without leaving the place of enlightenment he reached akra s palace
Then he went toward the palace decorated with jewels in Yama Heaven
At that time the king of that heaven said in verse
The name that praises him as the Tathāgata is heard everywhere He is supreme among all auspicious beings Because he came to the palace decorated with jewels This place is the most auspicious among all The Huayan jing says
Disciples in one thoughtmoment of all the buddhas ten kinds of infinite wisdom appear
What are the ten
In one thoughtmoment all worlds appear and in these worlds the Bodhisattva comes to the end of his life in Tuṣita Heaven in one thoughtmoment all worlds appear and in these worlds the Bodhisattva is born in one thoughtmoment all the worlds appear and in these worlds the Bodhisattva renounces the householders life in one thoughtmoment all the worlds appear and in these worlds the Bodhisattva goes to the place of cultivation and under the tree of enlightenment achieves supreme enlightenment in one thoughtmoment all the worlds appear and in these worlds the Tathāgata turns the pure wheel of the teaching in one thoughtmoment all the worlds appear and in these worlds the Tathāgata instructs sentient beings according to their circumstances and leads them to salvation in one thoughtmoment all the worlds appear and in these worlds which are decorated variously in innumerable ways the Tathāgata freely all storehouses of wisdom in one thoughtmoment all the worlds appear and in these worlds the Tathāgata purifies sentient beings in one thoughtmoment everywhere in all the worlds all the buddhas of the three ages appearbecause in each of the thoughtmoments in which various organs stimulate vigorously the desirous nature the seed and essence of the buddhas of the three ages are manifested and bodhisattvas achieve supreme enlightenment and guide sentient beings
Disciples these are the ten kinds of infinite wisdom that emerge in the thoughtmoments of all the buddhas
The Zhidu lun says
According to the Abhidharma two minds cannot exist simultaneously
When the manifestation of the Buddha speaks the Buddha himself is silent when the Buddha himself speaks the manifestation is accordingly silent
How is it possible for all the buddhas to preach the six perfections simultaneously
Answer
This principle applies only to the transformation and manifestation in nonBuddhist schools and the school of the hearers
The power of the samādhi that enables the Buddha to transform and manifest himself is beyond our understanding
For this reason when the Buddha himself speaks an infinite number of manifestations of the Buddha also speak simultaneously
Furthermore nonBuddhist teachers and hearers are transformed manifestations not those who transform and show manifestations
The Buddha the Worldhonored One however is able even in the state of transformed manifestation to transform and manifest himself in still another form
Therefore once nonBuddhist teachers and hearers have died or entered nirvana they are unable to remain in this world and continue to manifest themselves in transformed bodies
Even after he has entered nirvana the Buddha can remain in a form no different from his form before that event
The Abhidharma says that two minds cannot exist simultaneously
This principle apply to the Buddha as well
When he speaks in the transformed manifestation that form has no mind of its own
The Buddhas mind entertained the thought of the transformed manifestation and if that mind wishes to make the transformed manifestations speak then all transformed manifestations speak simultaneously
Dharma Introduction Teaching Those of Suitable Capacity and Broadening of the Scope of the Teaching
When the capacity of the Great Sage is matched by the suitable capacities of his disciples his influence extends without limit
Wherever he appears benefits result
In the realm of truth there is the distinction between absolute truth and worldly truth In the objective world there is a distinction between physical objects and intentions in the mind
Taking advantage of the dual structure of provisional and ultimate truth students reach upward
Making use of the vehicle of the provisional teaching the teacher approaches the students at their lower level
If one is caught up in the world of birth old age illness and death there is no occasion for renouncing the world
There is evidence that proves one can achieve enlightenment and nirvana through spiritual cultivation The Buddhist scriptures are extensive however and the teachings are given in view of readers capacities
The wheel of Dharma was first turned in the Park in Vārāṇasī
The first monk to be ordained was Kauṇḍinya then followed the Kāśyapa brothers Maudgalyāyana and a friend
The Dharma spread widely in Central Asia and was preached widely in the East
All the rulers of the twentyeight heavens and the sixteen kingdoms on earth followed the teaching wholeheartedly They accepted the Dharma and greeted it with joined palms
Thus the teaching of the ten stages of the bodhisattvas progress is expounded in the palace of the uppermost heaven in the realm of desire
The three vehicles were preached in a gathering on Vulture Peak 
Subhūti taught the teaching of nonobtaining Vimalakīrti made manifest the meaning of nonspeaking
The nonBuddhist teachings of the ten holy ones were overcome and the six groups of monks whose conduct was improper were disciplined
The Buddha manifests and then reabsorbs rivers right in front of him and moves mountains and valleys on the palm of his hand
He speaks of the long period of world ages in which large rocks are reduced to nothing and he discusses numbers sufficient to enumerate the most minute dust mote
He is the Great Master of the three universes and the lone presence since ancient times
How can an untalented person such as myself describe him exhaustively
Duke Zhou established rites and created music
Confucius transmitted the Book of Changes and edited the Book of Poetry The eloquence of Zaiy
and Si  the literary skills of Shang and Yan  and furthermore Zuo Yuanfang and the immortal Ge Lao Dan Duke Heshang Zhuang Zhou and othersall these remain in the realm of this limited world
How could they be worth talking about
The scope of our Great Masters teaching includes the worlds of humans and gods and its ritual engages the three thousand realms of existence
The Dharma flows into the Chinese Middle Kingdom and bestows profound benefits
The Dharma cures beings of the three poisonous illnesses the Dharma is transmitted ceaselessly through a hundred lamps that illuminate the darkness of ignorance How could any words of praise be too much for it
The Huayan jing says
The appearance of the Tathāgata in the world can be compared to the rising sun which first casts its light on great mountains then on all other large mountains then on the mountain of the vajra jewel and then on everything on earth
The sun does not entertain the thought that I will first cast light on great mountains and then later on the great earth According to the mountains height the light is cast earlier on some and later on others
The teaching of the Tathāgata is similar
He brings universal salvation to everyone
According to the different capacities of sentient beings however some respond to the teaching immediately and others later
What sentient beings see and hear is different and the consequences for those with different capacities also differ
The Mishasai l
Seven days after the Buddha achieved enlightenment he received the pleasures offered to those who have achieved liberation
Five hundred carts loaded with rock sugar which had been collected in a foreign country passed by the tree of enlightenment
The owners of the carts were two brothers Trapusa and Bhallika and they offered rock sugar and toasted wheat to the Buddha
Four heavenly kings held the bowl
After accepting this offering the Buddha preached the teaching of the Three Refuges
After another seven days the dragon king Mucalinda offered him food of nonhuman beings After yet another seven days Senani offered food
Four sisters accepted the Three Refuges
After seven days the Brahmā king came and requested him to turn the wheel of Dharma The Puyao jing says
The Brahmā king and sixtyeight thousand associates came to the Buddha After bowing their heads to the Buddhas feet they requested him to turn the wheel of Dharma
The Buddha accepted the request
He then said In my previous life in Vārāṇasī I made offerings to six billion buddhas
In order to repay the kindness shown to me by those buddhas I must first turn the wheel of Dharma there seven days after I have arisen from the vajra seat and observed the tree of enlightenment For that reason he did not preach the Dharma right then and there
The Zhidu lun says Immediately after achieving enlightenment the Buddha did not preach the Dharma for fiftyseven days He examined the capacities and conditions of sentient beings and then he preached
For the first seven days he meditated on the Great Vehicle teaching
On the fortyninth day after that he taught the Small Vehicle to accommodate sentient beings capacities
The Pusa yinglo jing says The Buddha turned the wheel of Dharma in the Qingming Garden in the Deer Park
He offered the sweet dew of his teaching to those who had been starved for it for a long time
The Zhong benqi jing says
The Worldhonored One entertained the following thought The road I took a long time ago led through the forest of brahmans
rāḍa Kālāma treated me with proper manners
I should go there and bring salvation to him A voice in the sky said That man died seven days ago The Worldhonored One then thought I should bring salvation to Udraka Rāmaputra Again a god told him His life ended yesterday also thought of the five people sent to him by his father the king a long time ago they were called jñātakauṇḍinya Aśvajit Daśabala Kāśyapa and Mahānāma
They served me diligently so I should go to them to bring salvation The Zhuanfalun jing says
When the Buddha was under a tree in the Deer Park a dharmacakra came flying from nowhere and spun around in the air in front of the Buddha
The Buddha rubbed it with his hand and the wheel stopped turning
From the beginning of time I have been here turning the wheel of name and form Now the intention of loving desire has been exhausted
So I will no longer turn  The wheel then stopped
The Shieryou jing says
From the eighth day of the fourth month to the fifteenth day of the seventh month the Buddha sat This is the event of the first year
In the second year he preached to the five monks in Deer Park
In the third year he preached to the three brothers of UruvilvāKāśyapa The number of monks increased to a thousand
In the fourth year he preached to dragons at Mount Gayāśīrṣa
In the fifth year he ordained āriputra and Maudgalyāyana
āriputra achieved the superior result in seven days
Maudgalyāyana achieved the superior result in fifteen days
In the sixth year Anāthapiṇḍada presented the Jetavana Garden and built a temple there for the Buddha
There were twelve buddha halls seventytwo lecture halls three hundred and sixty residences and five hundred towers
In the seventh year he preached the Perfection of Wisdom scripture to Bhadrapāla and others altogether to eight monks in Godhanīya Garden This scripture in one fascicle threw light on the matter of austerities In the eighth year he preached to the brother of King Drumakinara on Willow Mountain
In the ninth year he preached to Ajuemo in Pollution Valley
In the tenth year he preached to King Fusha in the kingdom of Magadha
In the eleventh year he preached the Origin Scripture to Maitreya under the tree of fear This is none other than the Xiuxing benqi jing T
to eightyfour thousand people of the ākya clan
The Zhong benqi jing says The Worldhonored One stayed in the kingdom of Magadha for six years and then returned to the kingdom of his birth
The king sent Udāyin to welcome the Buddha This account is different from the earlier one I have so far not been able to determine which one is more reliable
The Puyao jing says
There was a brahman whose name was Udāyin
The king ordered him to go and bring the Buddha back to the kingdom
After twelve years he was able to find the Buddha and have an audience with him
After seven days the Buddha returned to the kingdom of his birth The Fenbie gongde jing says
When the Buddha returned to the kingdom of his birth he rose into the sky until his feet were at the height of peoples heads
This continued until his father the king touched his feet The Buddha did not wish his father to bow down to greet him
The Daji jing says Sixteen years after the Buddha attained enlightenment he knew that bodhisattvas were upholding the storehouse of the Dharma
He caused a massive jewel staircase to appear in the middle of the realm of desire
Everyone in the assembly rose up to the middle of the stairs and then flew up into the sky
The Fenbie gongde jing says
When he could not find places for preaching the Buddha preferred to stay in the city of rāvastī
The Buddha stayed in this kingdom for twentyfive years longer than in any other kingdom
There were many marvelous things in this kingdom
Many people were morally minded and receptive to his teaching
Many miracles occurred in the Jetavana Garden residence
When people gathered together thousands of monkeys and flying birds came to listen to the teaching
They listened in total silence without making any noise and when the discourse was over they went back to where they lived
When the gongs were sounded to call everyone to assemble all the animals came back
Because there was a great deal of loving compassion in this kingdom even the animals followed the Buddha just like a shadow
The Zhidu lun says
In the city of āvastī there were nine hundred million families
Three hundred million of them were able to see the Buddha clearly
Another three hundred million had faith in the Dharma but had not seen the Buddha
The other three hundred million had never seen nor heard about the Buddha
The Buddha stayed there for twentyfive years
Those who had faith in him received an infinite amount of benefit
The Pusa chutai jing says
Then the Worldhonored One manifested many miraculous forms
He transformed all the bodhisattvas and caused them take on the appearance of a buddha They were all given a halo and the appropriate marks and preached the Dharma in unison
They paid respect to each other
Each sat in a most beautiful high seat decorated with seven jewels
During the first sermon the audience consisted of men only there were no women
During the second sermon the audience consisted of women only there were no men
During the third sermon the buddhas brought salvation to those who followed the correct teaching
During the fourth sermon they brought salvation to those who followed wrong views
During the fifth sermon the audience consisted both of men and women in equal numbers
During the seventh sermon the audience consisted of the followers of the correct teaching and those of wrong views in equal numbers
In the course of these sermons the teaching gradually took shape the idea of the self was overcome and the fruit of the Way matured
The Dharma preaching by the buddhas is miraculous
During the seventh sermon the Worldhonored One preached eightyfour thousand teachings on walking in empty space
During the eighth sermon he preached eightyfour thousand teachings of no form
During the ninth sermon he preached eightyfour thousand teachings of no desire
Each of these teachings was infinitely rich in content
Suppose someone who is petty but has clever worldly wisdom had a body with a thousand heads and each of the heads had a thousand tongues and each of the tongues said one thousand things
Even if this person tried to preach all of the teachings offered in these nine sermons they would not be able to cover even oneonehundredth of a part of these teachings
Such was the storehouse of the secrets of many buddhas The buddhas had studied and mastered completely each item in this storehouse
Further benefits of teaching are described in detail in other chapters  One Thousand Buddhas Introduction Covering Light Mourning Chronology and Disciples The fortunes of we sentient beings have been exhausted the Dharma King has passed away
He was then placed with his head toward the north on the bank of the Ajiravatī River  he was eighty years old
The transformation body has been broken into small pieces how can we chase after the flowing blood rushing to have the last doubt resolved and racing to make a final offering
The torch of wisdom and the cloud of compassionate love have disappeared for a long time
Truly the beings who appear in this long night are to be pitied
But the Dharma body is in perfect tranquility there is absolutely no activity in the Dharma body
In his enjoyment body and provisional body the Buddha guides sentient beings responding to worldly beings according to their karmic endowments
Once the Buddha was born however how could he have been free from extinction
There have been many different kinds of holy beings but not one of them could escape this fate
Therefore he made the mysterious statement about his back being in pain and turned the sweet dew  looking as if he was lying down on his right side he emitted light
These are the signs of dying without illness
Even though he was covered with a thousand layers of cloth his two feet still showed when the golden coffin was about to be closed he stood up with joined palms
These are the signs of no extinction
Therefore the body of ashes presents the temporary truth the eternal presence manifests absolute truth
Metaphors of the moon and vessels clarify this relationship
The Dazhidu lun says
When he was one hundred and twenty years old Subhadra had a dream
all human beings and gods were blind and stood naked in the darkness the sun was about to fall into hell the ocean had dried up windstorms had blown Mount Sumeru into pieces
When he woke up he was frightened
A god said This is the sign that the one who knows everything is about to enter final extinction
It is not a sign about your fate When morning came Subhadra went to the forest and requested to see the Buddha
nanda refused his request three times
The Buddha knew about this and called Subhadra from a distance to come to him and they took leave of each other
The Pusa chutai jing says
At midnight on the eighth day of the second month the Tathāgata himself folded the three sets of monks robes  and put them in the golden coffin
Placing himself in the golden coffin he handed his almsbowl and pewter staff to nanda and then entered the diamond samādhi divided relics
The Buddha stuck his diamond arm out of the golden coffin and asked for Kāśyapa and Gavāṃpati
nanda answered Arhat Gavāṃpati has already entered final extinction The Buddha said I now enter eternal extinction Then he went into the golden coffin and remained silent not uttering a word
Once again he stuck his arm out and asked nanda I preached the Great Vehicle for the sake of the eight kinds of beings
Have you heard all these sermons without exception nanda answered Only the Buddha knows the answer The Buddha again asked In the Thirtythree Heavens I preached to my mother
Did you know that
nanda answered I did not know The Buddha asked again I preached in the Dragons Palace
The dragon attained the Way and left the relic of the whole body which measured one hundred and thirty zhang
Did you know that nanda answered I did not know I stayed in my mothers womb for ten months and manifested for various bodhisattvas the Dharma wheel of nonretrogression
Through his supernatural powers the Worldhonored One manifested himself inside his mothers womb walking standing sitting and lying down all the bodhisattvas gathered together like a cloud inside the womb
Did you know that nanda answered I did not know it Note How could the great sage nanda not know about these things
He said that he did not know because he wanted to encourage the Tathāgata to teach in greater detail
This is why he said that he did not know The Niepan jing says
Good friends at these twin śāla trees I uttered the great lions roar this is called the great extinction
At the twin trees to the east I put an end to impermanence and achieved permanence at the twin trees to the north I put an end to impurity and achieved purity
For the sake of these twin trees sentient beings here protect the śāla forest they do not allow outsiders to take branches and leaves and break them up
I also do likewise
For the sake of the four teachings I cause my disciples to guard the teaching of the Buddha
The four kings are in charge of these four twin trees
Because the four kings guarded my teaching I stayed among them and achieved nirvana there
The Zhong ahan jing says
Then the Tathāgata went to the twin trees
Spreading the worship robe on the ground he prepared a resting place and using the great robe as a pillow he lay down on his right side
With his legs extended and placed together he achieved nirvana
The Pusa chutai jing says
Then the eight kings brought five hundred pieces of fine white cotton cloth
Having placed different kinds of incense inside the golden coffin they covered the golden coffin with five hundred layers of fine white cotton
Then they brought five hundred carriages laden with fragrant oil and poured the oil over the fine white cotton
At that time the great Brahmā king leading the other gods in his heaven stood to the right Indra leading the other gods in the realm of the Thirtythree Heavens stood to the left
Maitreya Bodhisattva and other bodhisattvas endowed with supernatural powers from the ten directions stood in front
Then the Worldhonored One wished to enter the diamond samādhi to dissolve his body in the sahā world
When he had this thought the world in all ten directions shook six times
The Moye jing says
Aniruddha went up to the realm of the Thirtythree Heavens and told Māyā 
Māyā came immediately and the coffin spontaneously opened up the Buddha rose from inside the coffin with his palms joined and said You came down from afar to this realm below The Buddha then told them You should know that for the sake of later unfilial sentient beings I rose from the golden coffin and greeted my mother The Sengzhi l
says The body of the Buddha was cremated near the Stupa of the Heavenly Crown The Jiayefufoniepan jing says
Then Kāśyapa took leave of the Buddha and entered Mount Yituli twentysix thousand miles from the kingdom of rāvastī
Seven jewels were frequently found on this mountain sweet fruits a wide variety of fragrant trees and other miscellaneous medicines were there in innumerable numbers
There were also miraculous animals red sparrows phoenixes and practitioners of the heterodox arts
There was a perfectly flat and square rock the color of lapis lazuli one hundred and twenty miles wide and deep and trees with leaves of five colors grew there in a thicket forming neat lines on this rock Kāśyapa walked around the rock reciting scriptures
In his lifetime Kāśyapa had taught one thousand disciples who had all attained arhatship they now sat permanently on this rock
As he walked around reciting scriptures seven of the disciples had dreams that the same evening
One monk dreamed that the middle of the rock he was sitting on broke and all the trees were uprooted
Another monk dreamed that all the springs within forty miles dried up and with no water all the flowers withered and died
Yet another monk dreamed that all the seats around the Gouluo continent tilted and broke
Yet another monk dreamed that the ground of the Jambudvīpa continent tilted and collapsed
Yet another monk dreamed that Mount Sumeru broke into pieces
Yet another monk dreamed that the Ruler of the Golden Wheel died
Yet another monk dreamed that the sun and moon fell from the sky and light disappeared from the realm under heaven
When the morning came each monk reported his dream to Kāśyapa
Kāśyapa said Earlier we saw light and the ground shook violently several times You now have had these dreams
The Buddha is about to enter nirvana He told his disciples that they should go to Kuśinagara
The Pusa chutai jing 
When Kāśyapa arrived the Buddha extended his two legs
Kāśyapa said in verse What the Buddha taught continues to affect people
The salvation he made accessible has spread everywhere But my practice lost its orientation I lament not seeing the Buddha Thereupon he circumambulated the coffin seven times
nanda was at the northwestern corner Nanda was at the northeastern corner and various deities were in the back
At a point fortynine steps directly north of the twin trees Mahākāśyapa took the torch in his hand and ignited the pile of fragrant wood  The Za ahan jing says
After the Buddha had entered nirvana flowers appeared on the twin trees and hung down from the trees to pay respect 
nanda said in verse
The five hundred layers of white cotton around the body Were all burned to let the body disappear Of the thousand pieces of fine cotton that clothed the Tathāgatas body Only two did not burnthe uppermost and the one closest to the body The method of cremation is described in a number of scriptures Because writing on this subject is extensive I omitted this material here The Niepan jing says
Why did the Tathāgata enter nirvana in the second month
Good friends the second month is called the month of spring warmth when myriad things grow
At this time sentient beings frequently have the thought that things are permanent
In order to destroy such thoughts of permanence in sentient beings he taught that all things are impermanent and that only the Tathāgata is permanent and free from change
Among the six time periods the beginning of winter is a time when everything is withered and reduced and sentient beings do not love and take pleasure in this season sunny springtime is when everything is in harmony and fresh and people love this season excessively
In order to destroy worldly pleasures in sentient beings the Buddha preached the teaching
The same consideration applies to the questions of permanence pleasure self and purity
In order to destroy the worldly understanding of self and purity he taught the Tathāgatas true teaching of self and purity Birth renunciation enlightenment and the turning of the marvelous wheel all occurred on the eighth day
Why does only nirvana take place on the fifteenth day
The Buddha said Good friends on the fifteenth day the moon is free from waxing and waning
Buddhas and tathāgathas are also like this
When they enter nirvana they are free from waxing and waning
This is why the Buddha entered nirvana on the fifteenth day The Chang ahan jing says
At that time a brahman with the surname Droṇa asked King Ajātaśatru At what time is the Buddha born
At what time does he become enlightened
At what time does he become extinguished King Ajātaśatru answered When the lunar station Puṣya appears he is born
When the lunar station Puṣya appears he renounces the householders life
When the lunar station Puṣya appears he becomes enlightened
When the lunar station Puṣya appears he becomes extinguished When is the Buddha the highest among twolegged beings born When does he go out into the forest and practice asceticism When does he obtain the highest Way When does he enter nirvana When the lunar station Puṣya appears the Buddha  When the lunar station Puṣya appears he goes out into the forest and practices asceticism
When the lunar station Puṣya appears he obtains the highest Way When the lunar station Puṣya appears he enters nirvana On the eighth day the Tathāgata is born On the eighth day the Buddha renounces the householders life On the eighth day he achieves knowledge On the eighth day he becomes extinguished In the second month the Tathāgata is born In the second month the Buddha renounces the householders life In the second month he achieves knowledge In the second month he becomes extinguished In the second month the Buddha the highest among the twolegged beings is born In the second month the Buddha goes out into the forest to practice asceticism In the second month he obtains the highest Way In the second month he enters the city of nirvana
The Sapoduo lun says On the second day of the second month when the lunar station Puṣya appeared the Buddha achieved perfect enlightenment
Also on the eighth day of the second month when the lunar station Puṣya appeared the Buddha was born
On the eighth day of the eighth month when the lunar station Puṣya appeared the Buddha turned the wheel of Dharma
On the eighth day of the eighth month he entered nirvana The Zhidu lun says
Elder Kāśyapa compiled the Tripiṭaka at Mount Grdhrakūṭa in order to save sentient beings
Having done so he followed the Buddha and entered nirvana
Early in the morning he took his almsbowl and went into the city of Rājagṛha after almsbegging he went back to Mount Gṛdhrakūṭa and said to his disciples Today I will enter nirvana without remainder All those who heard these words were greatly distressed
Toward the end of the day Kāśyapa arose from meditation sat among the congregation and preached on impermanence the emptiness of suffering and no self
Having preached a variety of teachings in the great robe that he had received from the Buddha he then took his robes almsbowl and staff rose up into empty space like a garuḍa and performed eighteen kinds of miracles
At the summit of Mount Gṛdhrakūṭa with his robes and almsbowl he made the following vow
This body of mine is indestructible
At the time Maitreya attains buddhahood the bones and body will appear again and go directly into the rock at the top of the mountain as easily as if they were entering soft mud
Having gone into the rock they will become one with the mountain
After this event people will have a life span of eightyfour thousand years and the will grow to a height of eighty feet
The height of Maitreya Buddha will be one hundred and sixty chi the Buddhas face will be twentyfour chi tall its halo will extend for ten li
At that time when sentient beings hear that the Buddha has appeared in this world in innumerable numbers they will become followers of the Buddha and renounce the householders life The Dabei jing says
Using the supernatural power derived from his original vow Kāśyapa held himself up in empty space and manifested a variety of miracles
Then with the fire issuing from his body he cremated his own body
When the cremation was over no ashes remained
The Sapoduo lun says
āriputra and Maudgalyāyana could not bear to see the Buddha enter nirvana so they entered nirvana before the Buddha
Because they entered nirvana first seventy thousand arhats also entered nirvana at the same time
At that time everyone in the Buddhist community was greatly disturbed
Then using supernatural powers the Tathāgata caused his two great disciples to appear standing on his right and left side
This miracle delighted sentient beings and their distress abated The Buddha preached the Dharma for them bringing benefit to everyone
As the absolute truth solidifies in the darkness of profound mystery the essence of Dharma remains empty and quiet
Yet in order to instruct and guide the uninitiated it is necessary to use language
Therefore the silent teaching of nonduality adopts the path of explaining emptiness
The sound of this teaching echoes in the realms of numerous beings
When the Buddha appeared in the world he first began teaching at Deer Park and stopped after crossing the Golden River
The Small Vehicle scriptures entice beginners and the Mahayana scriptures appeal to great minds
These teachings are divided into twelve divisions and eighty thousand sections
The mysterious traces of the Buddha were first compiled by arhats as scriptures beginning with the four gamas
When the scriptures were compiled five versions of precepts were presented
The great treasure lies here
If sentient beings sincerely hope for salvation from suffering they must not neglect the teaching uttered by the Buddhas golden mouth
The four occasions of the compilation are explained clearly and in detail here
The first occasion is described in two treatises the Dazhidu lun and the Jingang xian lun 
In the realm beyond the Iron Mountains the Tathāgata along with Mañjuśrī and the buddhas of the ten directions compiled the collection of Mahayana scriptures
The second is described in the Pusa chutai jing T
nirvana Mahākāśyapa and five hundred arhats gathered in an assembly of eighty billion and eight thousand from all of the worlds in the ten directions and together compiled a Tripiṭaka
The third is based on the Dazhidu lun
On the fifteenth day of the summer retreat after the Tathāgata had entered nirvana Mahākāśyapa and one thousand arhats compiled a Tripiṭaka in Rājagṛha
The fourth is based on the Sifen l
Within a hundred years after the Tathāgata had entered nirvana Vṛjiputra indulged in ten practices
Mahā kāśyapa and seven hundred arhats compiled a Tripiṭaka in Vaiśālī
I will present the accounts of these compilations by listing relevant scriptural passages in the hope that future intelligent scholars will be spared unnecessary deliberations
Compilation of the Mahayana Scriptures The Dazhidu lun and the Jingangxian lun say The account of Mañjuśrīs compilation of scriptures contains the following explanation
When the Tathāgata had left this world but had not yet arrived at another world the buddhas of the ten directions gathered together like a cloud and preached the teaching this teaching is called the Scripture of Speech Mañjuśrī later compiled this scripture
He invited an innumerable number of bodhisattvas and great arhats from everywhere
Each of them said that suchandsuch scripture was what they had heard from the Buddha
Subhūti said The Diamond Wisdom Sutra is what I heard from the Buddha Respective sections of each scripture all had a disciple who had heard it
In cases where more than one disciple had heard it at the same time all the disciples said that each of them had heard it directly from the Buddha
Therefore not only nanda transmitted the Buddhas teaching but only nanda heard all the scriptures other disciples heard only limited portions
The Niepan jing says
The teachings that the Great Sage taught are divided into three vehicles
There were also three people who transmitted them
The first is called nanda which means joyful He upheld the storehouse of the Small Vehicle teaching
The second is called Anantubatuo  which means joyful and wise He upheld the storehouse of the Middle Vehicle teaching
The third is called Anantuosuoqueluo  which means ocean of joy He upheld the storehouse of the Great Vehicle teaching
The names of these three differ but in reality they refer to one and the same person
The Weimo jing says
āriputra asked the heavenly maiden What do you seek in the three vehicles
 The deity said If the Small Vehicle is used to teach I am a śrāvaka
If the Middle Vehicle is used to teach I am a pratyekabuddha
If the Great Vehicle is used to teach I am a bodhisattva From the above we know that nanda was someone who upheld both the Great and Small Vehicles
Among the three named above the first two transmitted what they had heard directly from the Buddha or heard from others
For this reason at the time of compilation nanda sat in the seat
According to the Dazhidu lun  uttered the following verse
As for the first sermon of the Buddha I have not seen or heard it This has been reported through various intermediaries The Buddha traveled to Vārāṇasī To the five monks he preached The Dharma wheel of the Four Noble Truths This indicates that it is inappropriate to speak of having heard directly in all cases
Only the third nanda can be said to have heard all The Compilation of the Five Hundred The Pusa chutai jing says
Seven days and seven nights after the Buddha had entered extinction Mahā kāśyapa told five hundred arhats Sound the bell and gather the assembly
All five hundred of you should go to the buddha worlds in the ten directions and bring to this place between the twin trees in the Jambudvīpa world all those who are arhats or who have obtained the six supernatural powers
ākyamuni Buddha has now ended his life span and they raised a stupa of seven jewels
We shall now gather and reproduce his body of truth
You should now quickly collect the subtle and marvelous words he had uttered in his teaching Having heard Mahākāśyapas instruction the five hundred arhats quickly went to the buddha lands in the ten directions as numerous as grains of sand in the Ganges River and gathered eight hundred million and eight thousand arhats who came to this world and listened to the words of the Buddhas teaching
The Sengzhi l
Then Mahākāśyapa told the monks Compile the storehouse of teachings and do not let the Dharma disappear People wanted to go to different places to compile the collection
Kāśyapa said You should all stay at Rājagṛha
There is housing for five hundred They said As you wish and then made Aniruddha guard the Buddhas relics saying Do not let the deities take them away
In the past when Kāśyapa Buddha entered extinction the disciples lost their composure in distress and without their knowledge some deities took away the relics
No one in this entire world could make offerings to them At that time nanda did not go
Kāśyapa took one thousand people and went to the Saptaparṇaguhā Mountain cave and presented offerings to the Buddhas relics
Maudgalyāyana sat next to Kāśyapa and in the fourth month they compiled the scriptures They had cut off all contact with the outside world There were two less than the full number of five hundred people
Aniruddha returned but there was still one person missing
Kāśyapa sent Maudgalyāyana along with the disciple Revatakhadiravaniya who was an elder and an arhat instructing them Go to the realm of the Thirtythree Heavens and call for the arhat Tina When the arhat Tina heard that the Buddha had entered nirvana he could no longer stand to see the places where the Buddha had walked and himself entered extinction
Later Kāśyapa sent them to the airiṣaka Palace to call upon the arhat Gavāṃpati and to the heavenly palace of the deity Vaiśravaṇa to call upon the arhat Xumituo
Both had entered nirvana
The Pusa chutai jing says
Seeing that the congregation had gathered together Kāśyapa said to Upāli You occupy the position of the monastic official therefore reprimand nanda Following these instructions Upāli reprimanded nanda and punished him for not asking the Buddha to live out the long life span 
Upset nanda thought to himself It has not been long since the Buddha has entered extinction
Yet they now shame me in this way Having contemplated on the Four Noble Truths himself he attained arhatship before the congregation all impurities disappeared and in great clarity he was awakened
The holy congregation praised him and deities sang songs of praise
At that time the earth shook six times
Then Mahākāśyapa immediately made nanda go up the high seat decorated with seven jewels
Kāśyapa said Recite the teachings of the Buddha word for word do not omit anything
In one place collect the teachings for the bodhisattvas in another place collect the teachings for hearers the monastic rules should be collected in yet another place Then nanda recited the sutras for the first time
The collection on the teaching given in the mothers womb was the first the collection preached in the intermediate state was the second the Mahayana collection was third the Vinayas were fourth the collection for the ten stages of the bodhisattvas was fifth the miscellaneous collection was sixth the vajra collection was seventh the Buddha collection was eighth
In this way the scriptures and instructions of ākyamuni Buddha were made complete
Then nanda uttered these words
I have heard the following
At one time at the place where the Buddha was staying Kāśyapa and all of the members of the holy congregation uncontrollably shed tears and cried out How suddenly old age and death like phantoms have come upon us
Yesterday we saw the Buddha today we recite Thus have I heard The Sifen l
At that time in the city of Kuśinagara in the kingdom of the Mallas in a place surrounded by twin trees the Buddha entered nirvana
Citizens of the Malla kingdom washed the Buddhas remains and prepared the body for cremation
Having finished the cremation Kāśyapa gathered the monks and said We will now together discuss the Dharma and the Vinaya
Let us not allow the followers of heterodox teachings to criticize us by saying that the rules of Gautama are like smokewhile the Worldhonored One was in the world they all studied the precepts but now that he has entered extinction no one studies the precepts
Elders we should now select monks who are learned and wise and have the status of arhat Then they selected four hundred and ninetynine people all arhats learned and wise
Then the monks said We should select nanda to be included in the group Mahākāśyapa said Do not include nanda in the group
nanda suffers from attachment anger fear and ignorance
That is why he should not be included in the group The monks said nanda was the person who attended and took care of the Buddha
He accompanied the Buddha all the time and received the teaching directly from the Buddha
He must have questioned the Buddha about many unclear matters
That is why he should be included in the group Thereupon nanda was included in the group
The monks had the following thought
Where should the Dharma and the Vinaya be discussed
We must be provided with ample drink food and bedding Then they all said Only in the monastery at Rājagṛha are there adequate supplies of drink food and bedding
We should now all go there in order to discuss the Dharma and the Vinaya Then Mahā kāśyapa proposed to call a meeting in Rājagṛha
While he was traveling and in a quiet place nanda thought I am like a newborn calf still suckling milk who is traveling with five hundred large cows
I am a student who has to keep up my cultivation yet I am now traveling with arhats At that time the elders all reached Vaiśālī
nanda was at Vaiśālī
Many monks and laypeople came to ask questions of nanda and a large gathering formed
At that time there was a monk called Vṛjiputra endowed with great supernatural powers including the knowledge of others minds obtained through the divine eye
He now saw nanda and wondered whether nanda was someone who had desire or who was free from desire
When he examined the case he learned that nanda had desire and was not free from desire
Wishing to cause him to give rise to feelings of disgust Vṛjiputra uttered the following verse Sit quietly under a tree with leaves or fruit
Let the mind contemplate nirvana We should not be careless while sitting in meditation What can we accomplish by speaking a great deal When nanda heard this verse he immediately went to a quiet spot and practiced cultivation carefully
He sat silently freed from desire
Under the open sky at night he practiced walking meditation many times
Just before daybreak he felt exhausted and wanted to lie down but before his head touched the pillow in the middle of that movement liberation without outflows occurred in his mind
This was something nanda had never before experienced
At that time nanda achieved arhatship and uttered a verse
I have heard numerous sermons And attended the Worldhonored One constantly Having put an end to life and death Gautama now wishes to lie down Having gathered the monks Mahākāśyapa then proposed to begin the discussion of the Dharma and the Vinaya
Thereupon nanda rose from his seat and exposing his right shoulder and kneeling with his right knee on the ground with palms joined he said to Mahākāśyapa Of the words of the Buddha that I heard directly from him and have memorized everything from the opening section through all the chapters  appendix and numbered lists are gathered together in the Vinaya collection He then collected all the long sutras in the collection called Chang ahan all the middlelength sayings into the Zhong ahan the lists of one to ten and of ten to eleven formed the Zengyi ahan and all miscellaneous matters were collected into the Za ahan
As for the scriptures describing the Buddhas birth and previous lives and other verses they were collected into a miscellaneous collection
Passages that present difficulties and those that are arranged according to topics form the Abhidharma
Thus the Tripiṭaka was compiled in Rājagṛha
Five hundred arhats compiled the Dharma and the Vinaya
For this reason it is said that this compilation of the Dharma and the Vinaya involved five hundred people
Compilation of the One Thousand The Zhidu lun says
When the Buddha had entered nirvana Mahākāśyapa thought How can I make the Buddhas teaching remain forever This teaching has been attained through three infinitely long periods required for the path leading to buddhahood
I should have the Tripiṭaka compiled so that the teaching will remain permanently and people in the future can receive and practice it Having thought this he remained at the summit of Mount Sumeru and hit the bronze bell uttering the following verse
Many disciples of the Buddha If you think of the Buddha You should return the Buddhas love Do not enter nirvana
The sound of the bell made Mahākāśyapas voice reach the chiliocosm the threetimesonethousand worlds that constitute the universe Everyone heard Kāśyapas voice
All the disciples endowed with supernatural powers gathered and among the one thousand chosen by Mahākāśyapa everyone except for nanda was an arhat
They had read and were familiar with both the internal and external scriptures as well as the extensive scriptures of the eighteen kinds of heterodox teachings
Each was able to debate and defeat scholars of other teachings
Mahākāśyapa said When in the past I used to go on almsrounds followers of the heterodox teachings constantly forced me to debate difficult questions causing me to neglect the practice of the teaching
Now a provision will be made for you in the city of Rājagṛha to feed one thousand people
This is why we should not select more than one thousand monks He said to King Ajātaśatru Send food to us every day
Since we are engaged in the compilation we cannot go out for almsrounds elsewhere This happened in midsummer at the time for the threemonth retreat
The monks gathered when it was time for the precepts to be recited
Mahākāśyapa entered into meditation and saw with his divine eye who among those in the assembly had not yet gotten rid of polluting desires
There was only one person namely nanda who was not entirely free of polluting desires
The other nine hundred and ninetynine monks were all completely free of polluting desires and were pure and unstained
Mahā kāśyapa rose from meditation and leading nanda out of the congregation by hand said We are now about to compile scriptures in an assembly of pure 
You have not entirely gotten rid of pollution therefore you should not be here nanda was greatly dejected and wept
He thought to himself I served the Worldhonored One for twentyfive years taking care of his immediate needs
Yet I never heard such a painful thing
The Buddha is a truly great person of virtue compassionate and tolerant Having thought this he said to Mahākāśyapa I have the ability to attain the Way but according to the Buddhas teaching an arhat cannot serve as the Buddhas personal attendant
For this reason I kept some remaining bondages and did not remove them completely Mahākāśyapa said You have also committed a crime
The Buddha originally did not intend to let women renounce the householders life You asked him very politely to allow this and he agreed
Because of this the right Dharma of the Buddha will decline after five hundred years
You should make repentance for this minor transgression nanda said I felt compassion for Mahāprajāpatī
Furthermore the buddhas of the three ages have all had congregations that consisted of four groups which included the nuns order
Why should our ākyamuni Buddha be different Mahākāśyapa also said When the Buddha was about to enter nirvana he was approaching the city of Kuśinagara and he had back pain
The Buddha lay down on top of the four layers of ceremonial robes and said to you I need water but you did not provide water
This constitutes a minor sin nanda answered At that time five hundred carriages had crossed the stream and the water had been churned up 
That is why I did not take it Mahākāśyapa then said You should have used the muddy water
The Buddha has a strong supernatural power that can make muddy water into clear water
Why did you not give him any water
You have committed this sin
You must make a repentance for this minor transgression Mahākāśyapa said again The Buddha asked you If a person has well cultivated the four foundations for supernatural powers he can stay in this world for one world age or decrease his life span by one world age
The Tathāgata has well cultivated the four foundations Do you wish for me to stay in this world for one world age or to decrease my life span by one world age You remained silent and did not reply
The Buddha asked you the same question three times yet you deliberately remained silent and did not reply
If you had replied the Buddha would have stayed in this world for one world age or decreased his life span by one world age
Because you the Buddha the Worldhonored One entered nirvana early
You must make a repentance for this minor transgression nanda said It was because Māra had obscured my mind that I did not say a word
It is not that my mind harbored evil and I did not answer the Buddha deliberately Mahākāśyapa said again You stepped on the Buddhas ceremonial robe
You have committed this sin
You must make a repentance for this minor transgression nanda said At that time a wind arose suddenly and no one was there to help me
When I grabbed the robe the wind blew it and it dropped under my foot
It was not out of lack of respect that I inadvertently stepped on the Buddhas robe Mahākāśyapa said After the Buddha had entered nirvana you showed his penis to women
How shameful
You must perform a repentance for this minor transgression nanda said At that time I thought that if women saw the Buddhas penis they would spontaneously feel repugnance for their female bodies and wish to obtain a male body in order to engage in Buddhist cultivation that results in many virtues
For this reason I showed  to the women
It was not because I was shameless and consequently broke a precept Mahākāśyapa said  You have committed these six minor transgressions
You must repent for each of them fully before the monastic community At that time nanda kneeled on the ground with his palms joined his right shoulder was exposed and he removed his shoes
He then performed six kinds of repentance for minor transgressions
Mahākāśyapa then led nanda away from the congregation by hand saying You may return after you have put an end to the flow of polluting desires
Do not come back if the bondage of desire has not been completely removed Kāśyapa then closed the door
The arhats discussed among themselves saying Who should compile the Vinaya Elder Aniruddha said āriputra is the second buddha
He has a good disciple called Gavāṃpati
He is gentle and elegant and always stays in a quiet place letting his mind dwell in quiet meditation
He is familiar with the Vinaya
At the moment he is living in the forest of the airiṣaka Palace in heaven
Send a messenger to invite him to come Mahākāśyapa said to a lowerranking monk You should be the messenger The monk was delighted and accepting the order of the monastic community he said to Mahākāśyapa When I reach that place what shall I say Mahākāśyapa said When you get to that place tell Gavāṃpati Mahākāśyapa and other arhats who have put an end to the flow of desires have gathered in the Jambudvīpa world and are holding an important meeting of the monastic community
You should come quickly The lowerranking monk kneeled before Mahākāśyapa and touched the great monks foot with his forehead
He circumambulated him three times with his right shoulder closest to the great monk then flew up in the sky like a garuḍa and went to Gavāṃpatis place
The monk greeted Gavāṃpati by bowing his forehead to his feet and then spoke to Gavāṃpati as he had been instructed by Kāśyapa
At that time Gavāṃpati felt suspicion arise in his mind
He said to the monk Did the monastic community call for me without any disagreement
Was there a schism in the community
Has the Buddha who is like the sun entered extinction The monk said The Buddha has entered extinction Gavāṃpati said The Buddha entered extinction too soon
The Eye of the World has entered extinction
My master will succeed the Buddha in turning the wheel of the Dharma
Where is he now The monk answered He entered nirvana earlier Gavāṃpati said Great masters and generals of the Dharma have taken their leave one by one
What can we do
Where is Mahāmaudgalyāyana The monk said He too has entered extinction Gavāṃpati said The teaching of the Buddha is about to be scattered
We should take pity on sentient beings
The Great Being has also passed away In this way Gavāṃpati asked about many arhats
He said The great teachers who taught me to abandon attachment to desire have all entered extinction
I cannot return to the Jambudvīpa world
I will stay here and enter nirvana Having said these words he performed eighteen miraculous transformations and emitting fire from his heart he cremated his own body
Water poured out of his body and flowed in four streams down to where Mahākāśyapa was
A voice was heard from the water uttering the following verse
Gavāṃpati greets you by bowing my forehead to your feet You are the most virtuous monk in the wonderful congregation Having heard that the Buddha had entered extinction I followed him Just as where a great elephant goes the young elephants follow
Then the lowerranking monk took robe and almsbowl and returned to the monastic community
At that time nanda reflected on the dharmas seeking to completely eradicate all remaining flow of desire
At night he sat in meditation and performed ritual walking reverently seeking the Way
nanda was advanced in wisdom but his powers of meditation were limited
This is why he had not attained the Way
Only if meditation and wisdom are balanced can one reach the goal quickly
Just before dawn nanda felt exhausted and he withdrew to lie down in order to get some rest
Before his head reached the pillow he suddenly attained enlightenment
Just as lightning appears in the darkness he suddenly saw the Way
Entering into the vajra meditation nanda destroyed all the mountains of desire
Having attained the six supernatural powers that night nanda went to the door of the monastic hall and knocked calling out for someone
Mahākāśyapa asked Who is knocking at the door nanda answered It is I nanda Mahākāśyapa said Why did you come nanda said Tonight I put an end to all flows of desire Mahākāśyapa said I will not open the door for you
You must come in through the keyhole nanda answered That will be all right Then he used supernatural power to enter through the keyhole of the gate
Worshiping  the monks feet he repented
Mahākāśyapa no longer accused him He patted nandas head and said I deliberately did what I did in order to cause you achieve the goal of the Way by yourself
Do not resent what I did
I did it in order to cause you to achieve the goal yourself
If we paint a picture with our hand in empty space nothing is colored 
The mind of an arhat is like this He is free of attachment to any dharma
You may now return back to your original seat Then the congregation resumed the discussion Gavāṃpati has already entered extinction
Who else is capable of reciting the scriptures for the compilation Elder Aniruddha said Elder nanda is a disciple of the Buddha who attended him closely and listened to the discourses as they were preached
He has learned the scriptures carefully and constantly praises them
nanda can recite the scriptures for the compilation Elder Mahākāśyapa patted nandas head and said The Buddha entrusted you with his teaching ordering you to learn the scriptures of his teaching firmly
You should now return the Buddhas affection
Where did the Buddha teach the first sermon
Among the disciples of the Buddha those who are capable of guarding the teaching have all entered extinction
You are the only one left
Following the Buddhas mind which took compassion on sentient beings you will now compile the collection of his teachings nanda greeted the congregation and sat on the lion seat
Mahākāśyapa said in verse The Buddha the Sage is the king of lions
nanda a son of the Buddha Sits on the lion seat And observes the absence of the Buddha in the congregation Like a night when there is no moon The empty sky is not clearly illuminated Many great people of wisdom said You the son of the Buddha should perform Where did the Buddha gave his first sermon Now you should offer this gift At that time Elder nanda concentrated his mind and with palms joined he turned toward the place where the Buddha had entered nirvana and said When the Buddha gave his first sermon I did not observe the circumstances of that occasion I have heard the following from others
The Buddha was at Vārāṇasī
For the benefit of five monks the Buddha Opened for the first time the gate of the sweet dew of his teaching He preached the teaching of the Four Noble Truths The truths of suffering the cause of suffering the cessation of suffering and the path that leads to this goal jñātakauṇḍinya was the first to be enlightened Then eighty thousand gods heard the teaching and were enlightened
When the one thousand arhats heard these words they rose up into empty space to a height seven times as high as tāla trees
They all said Fie on such great power of impermanence
We see the Buddha teaching with our own eyes
We now speak of what we hear They then said in verse
We now see that the Buddhas body Like a mountain of refined gold The many powers of this marvelous sight have disappeared Only the name remains For this reason we must use skill in means And bring salvation to the three realms We will diligently gather the good teachings Nirvana is the greatest happiness
Then Elder Aniruddha uttered the following verse
Fie on the world that is impermanent Like the moon or a banana plant reflected in water The merit that fills the three realms Is destroyed by the wind of impermanence Then Mahākāśyapa also said in verse The power of impermanence is very great
The ignorant or wise poor or wealthy and noble Those who have attained the Way and those who have not No one can escape this power Not with clever words nor marvelous treasure Not through deceit or physical violence The fire that burns myriad things Impermanence which is death is like this fire The Compilation of the Seven Hundred The Sifen l
One hundred years after the Worldhonored One entered nirvana in Vaiśāli the monk Vṛji committed the following ten deeds saying that these acts are pure and that the Buddha had given permission for them
Taking food when the shadow on the sundial is two fingers past noon After eating  traveling to another village to eat another meal the same day Holding several fortnightly assemblies within the same boundaries Confirming an ecclesiastical act in an incomplete assembly and obtaining approval from absent monks afterward
Citing ones habitual practice as an authority for violations of monastic procedures Mixing sesame oil sugar and ghee
Spending the night in the room where salt is stored
Drinking unfermented wine
Possessing an uncut mat
Accepting gold and silver
On the day of the fortnightly assembly he received gifts of gold and silver from his patrons and divided them among his followers
Such practices were examined in detail one by one and all ten practices were found to be contrary to the teaching they were not in accordance with the Vinaya and not what the Buddha had taught
These matters were all decided by votes at Vaiśāli where seven hundred arhats had gathered to discuss the Dharma and the Vinaya
For this reason we speak of the Council of the Seven Hundred
The Daoxuan lshi ganyingji says
The Vinaya master asked the deity After the Worldhonored One entered nirvana the teachings were collected
What were the rituals for this activity like The deity answered The Great Sage appears and disappears according to karmic conditions
In compiling the Buddhas heritage in the Tripiṭaka there are differences in the number of monks that are said to have gathered and accordingly there were some differences in the Vinaya and Abhidharma sections
In the compilations done with five hundred and seven hundred monks described in the Vinaya the honorable Mahākāśyapa always served as the head of the congregation According to the Dazhidu lun 
They selected one thousand people all with the rank of those who have exhausted all learning and compiled the scriptures
They invited members of other congregations and went over what they had compiled
As for the differences they can be attributed to the two groups
The group that follows the version given by Venerable Kāśyapa was called Sthavira the others which follow the version taken from the other congregations are mostly called Mahāsaṃghika
The two groups mentioned in the Wenshu wen jing refers to these groups
All of the Tripiṭakas including Small and Great Vehicle scriptures were recited by nanda
They were compiled in Rājagṛha
The Mahayana scriptures compiled in summary form by congregations that gathered around Mañjuśrī were produced outside great Mount Cakravāḍaparvata in a realm between the two worlds Now I will discuss the rituals
One month after the Buddha had entered extinction offerings were made to the remains which were then cremated
According to the Vinaya the waiting period was seven days The cremation was delayed until Kāśyapa arrived Within the same day the remains were burned the stupa was also completed
Everyone in the large congregation went to Jetavana Temple in rāvastī
Venerable Mahākāśyapa sent one Maudgalyāyana to the ordination hall of the monastery Note There were six people who had the same name of Maudgalyāyana All were endowed with great supernatural powers He rang the bell to gather the congregation
At that time ten billion monks nuns and laypeople in the four realms under heaven gathered and immediately uttered the four karman formulae
Punishments were imposed on Pindola and nanda
Then nanda ascended the high seat and put on the Buddhas great robe
He first recited the Sutra of Final Instruction 
It was as if the Buddha was still in the world and giving instructions
At that time great bodhisattvas arhats all the monks the eight divisions of gods and dragons who heard this wept and shed tears uncontrollably
Then Mahākāśyapa rose from his seat donned his great robe and taking his mat he came before of the high seat
He placed his mat there and greeted nanda ceremonially
He circumambulated the seat counterclockwise three times and then stood in place
At that time the heavenly king great Brahmā held a canopy decorated with seven jewels above nanda
Then the god Indra came forward and placed a table decorated with seven jewels in front of him
The demon king Rāhu brought an incense burner decorated with seven jewels and placed it before nanda who received it and then placed it on the jeweled table
The ruler of the deities in the highest heaven in the realm of desire brought an armrest decorated with jewels and placed it behind the table
Then the māra king Pāpīyas brought a duster decorated with jewels and presented it to nanda
Then all the deities along with Indra stood on both sides of nanda
The kings of the four heavenly realms stood in attendance at each corner of the high seat
Thirtytwo messengers were behind kāśyapa each reverently kneeling and listening respectfully
When Mahākāśyapa finished greeting nanda he circumambulated nanda three times again and then before him he asked how the teacher was in exactly the same way that he used to ask the Buddha
Then kāśyapa asked how the Buddha had taught Each teaching as recorded in the scripture beginning with the phrase thus and ending with they were delighted and honored  kāśyapa asked again
I in the sutras of the past buddhas the teachings are given in separate groups
You were constantly at the Buddhas side
You must have received his teachings  nanda answered The Worldhonored One gave me the following instruction
The sentient beings of later ages suffer heavily from the contamination of desire and therefore they are unable to understand my teaching
You should not mix different groups and categories of teaching as you offer it but instead distinguish different kinds of teaching as you teach
Place different teachings in different groups as you see fit some in ten chapters and others in five so that those who are slow may understand my teaching kāśyapa asked again When he was in this world the Tathāgata ordered Upāli and Mahākāśyapa to go into the Eastern Treasure Hall and examine the Vinaya of the ancient buddhas
When there are discrepancies as I compile the scriptures should I follow the teaching of the ancient buddhas or should I follow what the present Buddha has taught nanda answered The Worldhonored One told me this instructing me to relate to Mahākāśyapa
When compiling the Vinaya he should do so in five versions
The Vinaya preached by the ancient buddhas was uniform and could not be divided into different versions
Since sentient beings today are endowed with little merit we teach them in many versions
After I enter extinction ignorant and stupid people will divide my teaching into five versions eighteen versions or five hundred versions
Although the content will be diluted in this way it will still be my correct teaching At one time the Buddha told the rulers of the four heavenly realms You should donate agate stones to me He also told Indra You should donate gold and silver to me He also told the māra king and the Brahmā king You should offer me heavenly artisans He again told the dragon king Vāsuki and the demon king Rāhu You should offer me the bright moon treasure jewels and maṇi jewels which shall be used as lamps The kings of the gods obeyed these orders and the dragons made offerings
The Worldhonored One accepted them and with his supernatural power in one thoughtmoment he produced many stupas
The ground shook in six different ways and the stupas all emitted bright light
A terrace of gold and silver appeared extending from Mount Gandhamādana straight to the ordination platform
There was a peak on this terrace on which ten billion buddhas preached a variety of wondrous teachings praising those who uphold the precepts and reviling those who break themThe Buddha said to nanda The treasure stupa of previous ages is now located at Mount Gandhamādana
When the Worldhonored One enters nirvana he instructs Indra and the kings of the four heavenly realms After the Worldhonored One has entered nirvana you should take his remains to the ordination platform
Place the remains outside of Nanhua Forest for ninety days
After kāśyapa has finished compiling the scriptures first produce a draft in which the teachings of the Tripiṭaka are recorded
Then have King Ajātaśatru make five copies
With my gold and silver seals stamp the original draft and Ajātaśatrus copies
You must stamp Kāśyapas draft with the sevenjeweled seal
Then stamp King Māras copy with the sevenjeweled seal
For the three copies produced by the Brahmā king you may use the silver seal
For the seven copies produced by Indra you may use the golden seal
The eighty thousand copies produced by the dragon king Sāgara should be stamped in all three colors Everything has to be stamped and authenticated
Let all the copies that circulate in Jambudvīpa and the three realms under heaven be stamped with seals
Once the scriptures have been stamped the copies are to be placed in a golden jar located to the south of the ordination platform
The text of the Tripiṭaka teachings compiled by Kāśyapa is perfect and complete
Let nanda respond to questions as they arise so that no part of the scriptures is forgotten
With these two matters in mind guard the scriptures safely in the area south of the ordination platform
After kāśyapa has entered the meditation the kings of the four heavenly realms and Indra will take the stupa and the golden jar and go to the summit of Mount Gandhamādana
For one hundred years Indra and the four heavenly kings will make daily offerings of various heavenly pleasures to the teaching 
The adepts of five supernatural powers who live on that mountain numbering eighty thousand will one by one appear in this Jambudvīpa world and they will cause the minor rulers who lack faith in the correct teaching to develop faith
For the purpose of developing their faith these objects should be guarded safely on Mount Gandhamādana
This is also for the sake of King Aśoka who at first will lack faith in my teaching but will eventually reject wrong views develop right views and build eighty thousand stupas Then the Buddha said to Maudgalyāyana Go to the summit of Mount Sumeru sound the bell and call to assemble from the ten directions the various buddhas who are my alternate bodies the hearers and the bodhisattvas of the entire universe The Buddha emitted light the ground shook and the buddhas gathered together like a cloud
The Worldhonored One rose from his seat he and the buddhas who are his alternate bodies with palms joined paid respect to the stupa pavilion door
The door opened spontaneously inside the golden stupa there were eighty thousand pavilions of pearls and white silver filled with the Buddhas sutras and great Vinayas
On each of pavilions terrace a great maṇi jewel served as a lamp
there were six monks who had entered the meditative state in which all mental functions have ceased  Inside the white silver pavilions were many lion seats in the shape of a lotus flower decorated with seven jewels
There were eight million seats in all
On each of the seats shaped like a lotus flower there were images of various buddhas and hearers and of the divine guardians of the eight directions
There were also fifty monks who were in the meditative state in which all mental functions have ceased
The Buddha said to Samantabhadra Take my golden conch shell to the place where these monks are and play the music that accompanies my appearance in this world
You should also tell them that I am entering nirvana When Samanthabhadra finished playing as instructed the monks came out of the meditative state in which all mental functions have ceased and asked Sa mantabhadra Which buddha has now appeared Samantabhadra answered ākyamuni Buddha is now about to enter nirvana The monks accompanied by Samantabhadra came to the Buddha and paid their respects to him enquired how he was and then stood to one side
The six monks inside the stupa had told the Buddha When Kraku cchanda Buddha entered nirvana he ordered us to stay inside this stupa and wait for ākya to Ruci
That buddha instructed us as follows
When the Buddha who appears in a later age enters nirvana and the Tripiṭaka is compiled you must open my pavilion and take out my copies of the sutras and Vinaya
In the ten billion countries in this world there exist sixtyfour styles of writing
Take one copy written in each of these styles and give it to that buddha so that after he has passed into extinction and the Tripiṭaka has been compiled those left behind can take the text of my scripture as a model to copy and ornament it
Different countries use different methods of writing
If these languages serve the purpose of transmitting written texts they can all be used except those  that use skin bones and soil should not be used for transmitting 
Other methods that use tree bark paper silk gold precious stones iron and so on may all be used That buddha ordered us to enter into a meditative state and protect the scriptures and images so that we can pass on the scripture to the Worldhonored One and let it circulate widely among many countries after the Worldhonored One has entered nirvana and kāśyapa has finished the task of compilation Then the Buddha told the dragon king Sāgara the rulers of the four heavenly realms and the others Make offerings to me of pearls maṇi gold and silver
I wish to build stupa pavilions and fill them with the previous buddhas scriptures and images The gods and dragons made this offering
Having accepted it the Tathāgata with his supernatural power in a short period of time completed pearl terraces and gold and silver stupa pavilions
There were eight million of each of these all filled with scriptures and images
The Buddha also said to the other buddhas who were his alternate bodies Each of you should make an offering of one stupa and one pavilion of white silver where all the teachings I leave for the entire universe will be guarded safely secure from destruction When the buddhas heard these instructions they made their offerings accordingly
Ten billion buddhas each emitted light from their mouths and shared their delight
The Buddha also told the bodhisattvas Preserve and protect my terraces and stupas and transmit and translate the scriptures
Use the scriptures and images at these terraces and stupas as the basis for circulating  These terraces and stupas are all located at the summit of Mount Gandhamādana
When the Worldhonored One entered nirvana he instructed me and Rāhula to serve as abbot and he instructed us that we are to guide sentient beings spiritually and help them escape various forms of suffering in the evil world yet to come in the future
The terraces and stupas will move to Indras palace and be placed in the Garden of Delight 
They will then move to the realm of the māra king who will worship the stupas for five hundred years
After five hundred years the teaching will circulate among many countries
When the time for the destruction of the teaching arrives the stupas will again rise up to Tuṣita Heaven
When Maitreya sees the stupas approaching him he will know that the teaching is about to be destroyed
He will emit bright light that will illuminate all of the parts of hell
Later encountering Ruci Buddha all will achieve liberation
After that year the stupas will descend again from Tuṣita Heaven and stay in the dragon king Sāgaras palace
The Worldhonored One handed over the stupas and white silver pavilions that he produced to Mañjuśrī Samantabhadra and Avalokiteśvara
The entire universe is surrounded by these pavilions and stupaseach country has one pavilion and one gold stupa
This is the case in China
At that time Mañjuśrī took the stupa and pavilion to the Vajra Cave on Mount Qingliang and placed them there where they still exist now
The bodhisattvas mentioned above bring scriptures and images out from the terrace and show them to those of us who uphold them so that they can circulate in the world without difficulty
When the present Buddhas teaching is destroyed they will be taken by the great dragon Sāgara to his palace under the great ocean
asked again All of the sutra collections have already been compiled
In which country should we place them for safekeeping To which king should we entrust them
The compilation should in some cases serve as a comprehensive collection and in others as a summary collection
Please explain the matter in terms of this distinction answered I have heard the Worldhonored One say Entrust to Mahākāśyapa and have him collect them widely He also entrusted to Mañjuśrī the task of going to the places on the great mountain Cakravāḍaparvata where many bodhisattvas dwell
There are nine locations where eighty thousand bodhisattvas dwell
Mañjuśrī is to produce the summary collection 
The Buddha entrusted King Ajāta śatru to produce five copies of the collection the divine kings Indra and Brahmā are to assist Ajātaśatru in copying the teachings that are left behind
Place the text that Kāśyapa compiled safely in a demons cave also asked While the Worldhonored One was still present in this world I heard him say When the compilation is finished entrust my Tripiṭaka to the dragon king Sāgara What I hear from you now differs from what I heard in the past answered I heard the Worldhonored One say Compile the Tripiṭaka in the asura demons cave
After twenty years when Mañ juśrīs compilation has been completed you should then entrust it to the dragon king Sāgara also asked In Jetavana there are ancient buddhas the Tripiṭaka and oracle books as well as instruments used for worship
To whom should these be entrusted answered These matters are discussed in the Zhihuan tu jing  The people to whom each item is to be entrusted are specified there
I will not repeat the instructions here asked again I heard from the Buddha the following
After he has entered extinction all the Vinayas will circulate in Jambudvīpa and the other three realms under heaven
Sentient beings will seek them eagerly but they will see different versions
Over ten billion versions will circulate in the realms under heaven
For which gods and people is the version I am now compiling intended
Please answer this question of mine answered I received the Buddhas instruction 
After I enter extinction tell Mahākāśyapa and Mañjuśrī to circulate my Vinaya among the thirtytwo countries in Jambudvīpa Sentient beings here are all endowed with great capacity so it is possible to circulate the Buddhas teaching preserved by Mahākāśyapa among them
In the Pūrvavideha continent in the east are two hundred and fifty countries in the Aparagodānīya continent in the west are one hundred and thirty countries
In all these countries the Buddhas teaching preserved by kāśyapa should circulate
In other realms under heaven the merits of sentient beings are limited and it is not possible for them to hear this teaching Do not circulate the teaching in those places
Within forty years after the Tathāgata has entered extinction the two versions of teachings will circulate in the four realms under heaven also asked What are these two versions of the teaching answered They refer to the Fourpart Vinaya Sifen l T
After forty years in the one hundred and eleventh year the Vinaya preserved by kāśyapa will have circulated in the countries mentioned above
As for the countries in China they are called countries of gentlemen Those who live there are quick and deft and due to this superior capacity three versions of the Vinaya may circulate there
Within the territories of altogether four hundred and three countries the same writing system is used and the abovementioned three versions of teachings of Vinaya will circulate there also asked What are the three versions of the teaching answered They refer to the two versions of the teaching mentioned above and that of the Mahāsaṃghika school
In the country of Qiuliuli and the two other realms under heaven only one version of the teaching circulates namely that of the Sarvāstivāda school Under the eaves of the Jetavana Temple building are four silver terraces
Inside the two terraces are golden sutras written on folded white jade
Inside the other two terraces is the Vinaya collection written on folded gold sheets with white silver letters
The Vinaya collection is in the writing of the dragon king the sutra collection is in the writing of the māra king
Both these collections consist of scriptures of the ancient buddhas who appeared in the past prior to the world age of the lunar stations
In Jambudvīpa these two scriptures are foremost in importance
After the Buddha entered nirvana the dragon king Sāgara took them into his palace and worshiped them
Furthermore at the time of Kāśyapa Buddha there was one person in China who wrote a great Vinaya collection and a sutra collection
The sutra scriptures were written in gold on silver paper the Vinaya was written in silver on gold paper
At the time they were written a copy was made at Damingsi Temple in Jingzhou
The scriptures were located in a terrace southeast of the lotus flower the Vinaya is in the terrace on the western side on top of the leaf
They are decorated and worshiped in innumerable ways
If we seek writings that are comparable to these among the writings in the four realms under heaven in all the ten billion universes there are those of Zhong  Zhang  Wang  and Madame Wei all masters of calligraphy but even such people pale in comparison
While the Tathāgata was still in this world holy people from many countries came to see these sutras and Vinayas and frequently they were shown them
After the Buddha had left Mañjuśrī took these scriptures and Vinayas and placed them safely in the Vajra Cave on Mount Qingliang
Furthermore inside the terrace were Vinaya books preached by past buddhas of which there are thirtyeight thousand kinds
Within the four realms under heaven in all the ten billion universes the text identical to the one in this world is the foremost
The third son of the king of the southern heaven Zhang Yu compiled the Zhihuan tu jing in one hundred fascicles
The sixteenth son of the king of the northern heaven produced the Record of Five Monasteries in five hundred fascicles Both of these works are in the respective heavens
verses say To take delight from afar in the Great Awakened Ones Their supernatural accomplishments are broad in scope The four dhyānas transcend images The three supernatural knowledges are all empty
One thousand buddhas left different traces But the mind that achieves knowledge is one and the same Spirits in manifest form descended to the world Teaching extensively they bring light into the darkness of ignorance During the world age of the wise four buddhas have appeared first the other buddhas remained hidden Succeeding the previous seven buddhas They inherit the task reverently Eternal words rest in the chambers of Vulture Peak Sincerity is made to rest in Brahmās palace In the eight events of the life of the Buddha that culminated in his enlightenment Ten thousand virtues are amalgamated in a vacuum Gods and human beings receive merits Evil ceases and good prospers The Buddhas reputation spreads widely among sentient beings They all are filled with gratitude Miracles The Zhoushu records the birth and extinction of the Buddha The Shiji records the Buddha as a Great Sage In the Former Han there was the introduction of Buddhism under Emperor Xiaowu and ritual performances under Emperor Ai In the Qin Buddhism had arrived by the time of Emperor Shihuang In the Later Han the Jiaosi zhi records that the Buddha was a Great Sage the Three Jewels were all present under Emperor Ming In the Western Jin two images of Vipaśyin Buddha and Kāśyapa Buddha came floating in from the ocean In the Qi dynasty the Buddhas tooth arrived under Emperor Wenxuan In the Sui dynasty Zhiyi of Mount Tiantai miraculously saw the jeweled staircase that connects the three realms of existence In the Tang dynasty Tanrong of Luzhou under the Tang miraculously saw the appearance of the seven buddhas
Miraculous responses of the Perfected Ones change with the circumstances of the world Their compassionate teaching is unlimited how could it be limited to specific forms of teaching
Even if people hear the same thing they understand it differently even if the teaching that is preached is the same people experience spiritual awakening in different ways
As these Perfected Beings climb the ranks and stages of the bodhisattva path they move upward
As they are assigned to the realms of the deluded they come down
Sometimes they leave behind relics that preserve the form of their original bodies sometimes the original bodies are broken and leave only fragmentary relics
These remains are sometimes gathered together in one stupa and sometimes scattered among many different stupas
When the supernatural light is illuminated wrong teachings are destroyed
When traces of miracles are highlighted deep faith follows
Since the stream of the Dharma began to flow eastward the light of the Way reflected westward
Truly outstanding sages appeared in great numbers and there have indeed been many miracles
King Aśoka raised stupas and this opened the way for the rise of the Zhou ākyamunis father produced an image of the Buddha and this lies behind the good fortune of the Han
From these on through the ages more and more effects accumulated
I think that it is not only in India that teachings by miracles occurred
Thus a scripture says that as for the spread of the right Dharma it will first go northward then eastward and southward
When it has reached the middle it will be destroyed
Here I will list a small number of examples of Buddhist miracles that I have noted from the time of Emperor Ming of the Han to that of the present great kingdom
There are others that I have not included here they are described in detail in other records
According to the Zhoushu yiji on the eighth day of the fourth month in the twentyfourth year during the rule of King Zhao of Zhou the jiaying year in the sixtyyear cycle designation the water levels in streams rivers springs and ponds suddenly rose well water spilled over and the mountains and rivers quaked
A ray of fivecolored light penetrated the Taiwei constellation and on reaching the western end of the sky the color of the light turned blue and red
Court astronomer Su You said A Great Sage has been born in the west
After a thousand years a foreign teaching will arrive here King Zhao immediately ordered this to be carved in stone as a record and then had the stone buried in front of the shrine for heaven in the southern suburb
This occurred at the time of the Buddhas birth
Marquis L then was the prime minister rode eight fast horses traveling in search of the Buddha He was provided food by the court
At dawn on the fifteenth day of the second month of the fiftythird year during the rule of King Mu of Zhou the renshen year in the sixtyyear cycle designation violent winds arose damaging buildings and uprooting trees the earth quaked and the sky darkened
To the west twelve rainbows appeared
The astronomer Hu Duo said The Sage in the West has died This was the sign of the Buddhas entry into nirvana
According to the Chunjiu  in the fourth month during summer of the seventh year during the rule of Duke Zhuang of Lu  stars did not appear the night was as bright as the day
This was the auspicious sign of the Buddhas birth
Indeed the Buddha is endowed with two bodies true and responsive two truths provisional and real three kinds of supernatural knowledge eight kinds of meditations that lead to salvation five kinds of vision and six kinds of supernatural powers
His supernatural activities are beyond human understanding
teaching is designated as that of the workings of a mind beyond discursive understanding
The path he teaches transports many sages to nirvana
His powers reach down to contact ordinary beings drowning in the ocean of suffering He can be crudely described as being as tall as a mountain and moving slowly like a great river
Therefore there is this passage in the Liezi
Chief Minister Pi of Wu asked Confucius Are you a sage Confucius answered I am widely learned and have a good memory but I am not a sage The minister asked again Were the ancient Three Emperors sages Confucius answered The Three Emperors were skilled in using wisdom and courage
I do not know whether or not they were sages The minister asked again Were the Five Rulers sages Confucius answered The Five Rulers were skilled in using humanity and truthfulness
Again I do not know whether or not they were sages The minister asked again Were the Three Kings sages or not Confucius answered The Three Kings were skilled in dealing with contemporary circumstances
Again I do not know whether or not they were sages The chief minister was surprised and said Then who is a sage The masters expression changed and after a while he said People in the Western Region have a Great Sage
He moves slowly like a great river and people cannot name him If the Three Emperors and the Five Rulers were sages how could it be that Confucius hid this fact and did not speak of it
He would then have committed the sin of hiding sages
We can infer from this that the Buddha was the Great Sage
Furthermore the Laozi xisheng jing says Our master transformed himself and traveled freely in India and he became skillful in entering nirvana We can judge from this the relative superiority and inferiority 
Former Han Dynasty During the Yuanxiu period Emperor Wu r  BCE and Huo Jubing went on an expedition to conquer the Xiongnu people
He reached Yilan and passing through Mount Juyan he captured King Xiutu and others of the Kunya group
He also captured a golden image of a person over one zhang tall
When the general returned to the Ganquan Imperial Palace the emperor considered this golden image to be a great sage and worshiped it
When an official relationship with Central Asia was established the emperor sent Zhang Qian to Daxia Upon his return he reported that there exists a kingdom called India where the teaching of the Buddha was first heard
These stories describe how the image and teaching of the Buddha slowly began to be known in China
During the Yuanshou period under Emperor Ai emissary Jing Xian went to the kingdom of Dayueshi
He recited Buddhist scriptures there then returned to China
It was around this time that Buddhist rules of purity began to be practiced in China
For the reign of Emperor Cheng in the biography of Liu Xiang  Commissioner of Water Ways and Grand Master of Splendid Happiness the following passage appears
He examined written works widely and frequently found Buddhist scriptures among them
He then composed the Liexian zhuan in which he stated I examined books in the palace library
The Liexian tu  compiled by the Grand Astrologer contains biographies of one hundred and fortysix immortals starting from the Yellow Emperor to contemporary figures seventyfour of these had seen Buddhist scriptures This clarifies that the teaching of the Buddha circulated in China even before the time of the Qin and Zhou dynasties
This is clear from the sequence of the biographies
According to a Buddhist tradition one hundred and sixteen years after the Buddha entered extinction a universal monarch appeared in a kingdom in eastern India and established his rule throughout the world
He gathered relics of the Buddha and with the aid of ghosts and gods he built eightyfour thousand stupas
Details are given in appropriate sections below in the present collection
The remains of these stupas are found in all of the nine continents
These were precisely the stupas built by King Aśoka
In the twentysixth year of the reign of King Jing of Zhou  the dingwei year in the sixtyyear cyclical designation these stupas were raised
After twelve kings in succession in the twentyfourth year of the Founding Emperor of Qin  books were burned
From that time on King Aśokas stupas have remained hidden
By examining the catalogues of scriptures compiled by Daoan and Zhu Shixing we learn that during the reign of the Founding Emperor of Qin the foreign monks Shi Lifang and others altogether eighteen sages brought Buddhist scriptures and taught 
The Founding Emperor was not converted and he imprisoned these messengers
In the middle of the night a huge warrior carrying a diamond hammer six zhang tall broke into the jail and let them out
The Founding Emperor was frightened expressing his utmost respect by ceremonially bowing his head he apologized ref
Lidai fabao ji Tc From this we learn that Buddhism had come here before the time of the Qin and Han dynasties
The twelve sages Daoan mentions may also have been among the seventy that had been mentioned the Liexian zhuan mentioned seventytwo people
According to the Wenshu bannihuan jing  four hundred and fifty years after the Buddha entered extinction Mañjuśrī went into the Himalayas and preached to immortals
The Dilizhi Xiyu zhuan says
The Himalayas refers to the Congling Mountains
At their foot are thirtysix kingdoms which began sending tribute to China during the rule of the Qin and Han dynasties
The Congling Mountains run eastward and end with Mount Zhongnan
It was in these mountains that Mañjuśrī came to teach immortals
Looking into the matter in detail the comments by Liu Xiang can be seen to be reliable
Later Han Dynasty The Jiaosi zhi says
The word buddha means in Chinese awakening He intends to awaken people in this world
His teaching centers on cultivating the mind
Refraining from killing living beings followers work singlemindedly to achieve purity
Those who energetically engage in this work are called śramaṇas which means ceasing evil conduct They shave their heads changing their physical appearance they leave their families and the secular world stopping emotion and purifying desire they follow the teaching of no action They believe that after a person dies his spirit is not destroyed but receives another incarnation they also believe that good and evil deeds have corresponding retributions
They put emphasis on doing good deeds and cultivating the Way for the purpose of refining their minds
Through ceaseless refinement they reach a state in which they are enabled to escape rebirth and attain buddhahood
The Buddha is six zhang tall and golden in color illuminated from behind by the light of the sun and the moon he constantly changes his appearance and can go anywhere
Thus he can penetrate through myriad things and bring salvation to people everywhere in this world
There are scriptures numbering thousands of fascicles that advocate empty nonbeing as the central principle they treat everything both subtle and crude systematically
Skillful in extensive and exaggerated speech they seek causes inside ones own body and clarify their expressions in the realm of things that are seen and heard
Ultimately they focus attention on profound and minute matters deep and distant these matters are difficult to fathom
Therefore kings dukes and elders who observe the cycle of life and death and moral retribution all are frightened and lose their bearings
The rest of this account parallels the record in the Han faben neizhuan
During the reign of Emperor Ming  at Baima Temple in Luoyang there was Mātaṅga who was originally from central India
He was graceful in conduct and understood the Mahayana and Hinayana scriptures and he had adopted the life of a migrant teacher
In the third year of the Yongping period Emperor Ming dreamed that a golden person flew over in the sky and came to him
The emperor gathered a large number of his ministers together and asked them about the meaning of the dream
Scholar Fu Yi said I have heard that in the Western Region there is a deity called Buddha
What the emperor dreamed of must be this deity Approving this response the emperor sent Inner Gentleman Cai Yin National University Student Qin Jing and others as messengers to India in search of the Buddhas teaching
Cai Yins group encountered Mātaṅga there and invited him to return to China with him
Mātaṅga had vowed to spread the teaching and he was not concerned about enduring physical difficulties so he crossed the desert and arrived at Luoyang
Emperor Ming appreciated this greatly and met him outside of the western gate of the city The emperor established a temple as the monks residence
This was the first time that a monk had come to China 
Furthermore from afar Emperor Ming invited Dharma Master Mātaṅga to come to Luoyang
Outside the Yong gate in the western quarter of the city the emperor established Baima Temple
This was the first time that a Buddhist temple had been established in the land of China
According to tradition there was once a king of a foreign country who destroyed temples only Zhaoti Temple had been left untouched
At night a white horse circumambulated the stupa and neighed in great distress
When this was reported to the king he immediately ceased the destruction of temples and changed the name of Zhaoti Temple to Baima 
Many other temples took this as a model and adopted this name 
Zhu Falan  a man from central India lived in Baima Temple in Luoyang
He claimed that he could recite several tens of thousands of chapters from scriptures and treatises and he served as a teacher of Indian scholars
When Cai Yin arrived there Zhu Falan agreed to travel with Mātaṅga and so he followed him here 
At that time the students there temorarily prevented him from traveling
Consequently Zhu Falan waited for a while and then came here and stayed in the same place as Mātaṅga
Shortly after arriving in Luoyang he became versed in Chinese and translated the scriptures obtained by Cai Yin in the Western Region
There were five works including the Shidi  the Duanjie  the Fobenxing  and the Sishier zhang 
At the time the capital was moved and barbarians invaded China the texts of the first four works were lost and only the Sishier zhang exists today
It contains more than two thousand words
The preservation of this text in China marks the beginning of the compilation of scriptures here
Zhu Falan later died in Luoyang
He was over sixty years old
During the reign of Emperor Ming of Han the Indian master Zhu Falan brought a painted image of the reclining ākyamuni
This was the fourth work produced by the carpenters of candana wood for King Udayana
When it was brought to Luoyang Emperor Ming ordered his painters to produce a copy and place it in the Qingling Terrace and on top of the Xianjie Ling tomb
These ancient paintings have now been lost
Gaoseng zhuan T This was the first time that a image was brought to China Note The Wei shu also explains how the Three Jewels were brought to China at the time Emperor Ming of Han In the past when Emperor Wu of Han ordered the Kunming Pond to be dug in the ground workers found black ashes at the bottom
When the emperor asked Dongfang Suo about this he said It is not mentioned in our scriptures
Ask the foreign monks from the Western Region Later when Falan arrived many people asked him about this and he said When the world comes to an end a great conflagration blazes
These ashes come from that fire Suos words were thus substantiated
A large number of people came to believe in him
Western Jin Dynasty Stone images of Vipaśyin and Kāśyapa appeared long ago
In the first year of the Jianxing period  under Emperor Min of the Western Jin  images appeared floating in the ocean and came to the point where the Hudu River downstream of the Songjiang River pours into the ocean in the Wu region
From a distance they looked like two people floating on the oceans surface
None of the fishermen could get close to look at them so they invited a master spirit medium to pray thinking that the two figures were ocean gods
The local Daoist leader suspected that they were the spirits of immortals
Some sounded bells to present requests and other common people went to pray to them
Invariably the waves rose higher fog appeared and the sky darkened The images moved against the current of the ocean further into the distance
A person who worshiped the Yellow Emperor and Laozi said that they were heavenly masters and went out in a boat to welcome them
The wind and waves remained threatening as before
Zhu Ying of Wu district worshiped the right Dharma of Buddhism
He invited the nun Bo of Donglingsi and several other Buddhist practitioners and together they went out into the ocean to welcome the images
Thereupon the clouds scattered and the bright sun appeared the wind fog and waves all disappeared The images followed the oceans current and came to shore
Turning around they revealed inscriptions
As soon as the stone images were met they climbed onto the boat as light as feathers
Later when the people placed the images on a cart they were as heavy as a mountain
In the end the images were placed in an old temple called Tongxuan jingshe in Wu
Details of this incident are described in an old inscription
In the seventh year of the Yongming period of Qi an auspicious stone again came floating into the Wu area
It was hard and solid and shone brilliantly
Riding the tide and waves it looked like a pinewood boat
At that time Scribe Zhu Farang grandson of Zhu Ying who had obtained the stone images earlier was sent to Wu to obtain the stone and he presented it to the court
At that time Emperor Wu of Qi had had a temple built called Chanling it had seven roof tiers and was beautifully decorated
The auspicious stone appeared not far from it
The timing was perfect reflecting their matching karmic conditions
The court officials conferred and said that the miraculous gift should be honored and that it should manifest the Dharma body
Thereupon the order was given to stonemason Lei Bei and others to turn the miraculously obtained stone into a sitting image of ākyamuni three chi and five cun tall
Including halo and the seat the height of the image was six chi and five cun
The carving of the image was extraordinary and the boat was most skillfully decorated with gold
Beautiful patterns were carved to manifest the marks of this remarkable image and to emphasize its mysterious and auspicious character
In my opinion the nature of a stone is to sink  so it is the miraculous response that causes it to float
Many images have arrived repeatedly under different reigns crossing the ocean to this same location of Wu
Some are older than others and are made differently but altogether seven buddha images have been obtained in this way
The people who obtained these images were also all members of the Zhu family
Thus there has been a mysterious and miraculous consistency from the beginning to the end
For this reason a preface was written to record these past events and make the evidence for this miracle widely known
The two stone images obtained under the rule of the Song  seven chi tall were inscribed on their backs one saying Vipaśyin and the other Kāśyapa The dates of their production were not indicated but the letters were clearly legible
They are at Tongxuan Temple in Wu Commandary
The auspicious image produced during the Qi dynasty had earlier been placed at Chanling Temple 
Qi Dynasty At the time of Emperor Wenxuan of Qi the late master  Tongshang lived
The masters family was in Liang zhou
When he was thirteen years old he made a vow to travel to the West
In the fifth month of the third year of the Yuanwei period of the Song  Rui from there he proceeded to Yutian 
On the day Tongshang was to leave that place a monk brought out a copper box from a sealed room and handing it to the master said A tooth of the Buddha is inside this box
The tooth is one cun wide and tall and three cun long
You should take this back to the south and let it benefit people widely The master was delighted and accepted the gift he felt as if he had seen the very body of the Buddha
This monk also said I got this tooth in the kingdom of Wuchan and encountered extreme difficulties in doing so
I also obtained one piece of a copper seal and a painting of the kings face
They are also sealed inside this box Master Tongshang later heard monks discussing with each other The Buddhas tooth from the kingdom of Wuchan has been lost and we do not know which kingdom is benefiting from its merits
The monastic community should get hold of it and worship it When the master heard this he was secretly delighted and doubled his efforts to honor the relic
He then brought it back to Mount Zhong
For fifteen years even as a circle of intimate acquaintances formed there none of his disciples heard anything about it
He only showed the tooth secretly to Vinaya Master Faying of Linggen Temple who held it up high to the crown of his head and showed it to old acquaintances
A monk from Kucha who did not know whether or not the story was authentic nevertheless was very suspicious
At that time the Minister of Education was Prince Wenxuan of Jingling Even in his youth he had shown signs of superior intelligence
With a firm commitment to promote learning he sincerely sought for miraculous responses
A miraculous response came quickly On the eighth day of the second month of the seventh year of the Yongming period  while he was attending a Buddhist gathering in the inner hall of the western residence he saw the Buddha approaching from the eastern direction He looked powerful and dignified his body shone brilliantly
Wenxuan looked up to him and greeted him with the highest honor bowing his head to the Buddhas feet
He then stood next to the Buddha and attended him
He felt his headdress tear apart and fall to his feet
The Buddha looked down and smiled When the Buddha coughed the air turned white like newly formed snow
When people picked it up on their hands the substance turned into jade rice plants
Later Wenxuan moved to the Eastern Administration
On the twentyninth day of the sixth month he again had a dream in which he went to Dinglin Temple to see the deceased master who claimed to be ill and in bed
Wenxuan then asked Even adepts equipped with the five supernatural powers cannot escape birth old age illness and death
Beyond the robe and almsbowl could the Dharma Master have obtained some specially meritorious objects The master answered There is a priceless supernatural treasure in my storage building
I respectfully entrust it to you
Please go there and take it yourself Wenxuan went to the storehouse as instructed and found boxes
He opened them one by one most contained scriptures or images
In the end he saw a small box that was floating in space
When he took it and opened it he saw light of changing colors
First he said it was an image but then that it was not an image
As soon as he said it was not an image it again became an image
Wenxuan awakened from the dream and knew that it was an auspicious sign
The next morning he sent Attendant Yang Tanming to the master who in secret told him the story of Wenxuans dream miracle and said There must be an unusual treasure in the masters storehouse
Please show it to us The master immediately said He is looking for worldly treasure Because he did not think that the object was the Buddhas tooth he answered in the usual polite manner but he kept thinking about it and in the middle of the night he realized what the request was all about
The matter was difficult to explain however so he himself went to the government office and explained the matter in detail saying I showed this only to Vinaya Master Ying
No one else knows about it
Now the donor has had a miraculous experience It was indeed a sign
This matter is beyond our understanding
Now that its trace has become known to others how could I dare to go on humiliating the deities and neglect worshiping the Buddha
I present this treasure so that it can be properly worshiped Three days later he himself brought it to the East Administration and Wenxuan thus obtained the Buddhas tooth relic
Ten days after Wenxuan had the first dream he had another dream
Something that looked like an ox horn over three chi long appeared in the sky
It emitted miraculous light that shone on his right arm
Suddenly he saw a wax image also three chi tall
The image blinked and spoke uttering the three praises beautifully
The late master also obtained fifteen pieces of relics in Yutian
They were distributed to many places
When construction of Chanling Hall in Zhiyuan Monastery began the relics were distributed
One piece was sent to Wenxuan who was at that time a crown prince
He used purified water to test its authenticity
He set it to float in a bowl and suddenly it disappeared
Dozens of monastics and laypeople looked for it diligently but they could not recover it
They looked around both inside and outside and everyone was exhausted
Wenxuan then made repentance
Suddenly it unexpectedly appeared on the ground on the other side emitting brilliant light that extended one chi in height
Everyone saw this and all marveled at it
The late master took the remaining two pieces and placed each into a silver box which was then sealed
When they went to check both boxes and relics had disappeared
Three years later when they opened the original box to take out the Buddhas tooth the two pieces of relics were found there
The original two pieces had multiplied and become three but the silver boxes in which they had been placed were no longer there
It is not possible to fathom the processes of supernatural transformation
Wenxuan had earlier heard that Buddhas tooth and hair existed in the West  and was overjoyed
In the third year of Jianyuan he memorialized Emperor Gao  requesting to send Tanmoduoluo to look for them to worship
He also made a small jeweled curtain intending to send it to the West The curtain was finished but still awaiting shipment when miraculous signs seemed to appear
Unexpectedly the late master reached the capital city and performed miraculous deeds
The jeweled curtain was then used as an offering
Miraculous coincidences are known from other reigns
Wenxuan later produced a jeweled platform on which to place the curtain
A jeweled container was produced in which to keep the box and people reverently honored it
These stories appear in the Han fa neizhuan and other miscellaneous records as well as the Biographies of Eminent Monks ref the biography of Faxian in the Gaoseng zhuan Tba
Sui Dynasty Zhizhe National Teacher of the Sui Shi Zhiyi of Guoqing Temple on Mount Tiantai his secular surname was Chen and he was from Yingquan
Virtuous and intelligent few throughout history could be compared to him
He always loved living in the mountains where he practiced meditation in quietude
Monks nuns and lay believers looked up to him and rulers and ministers thought highly of him
Before Zhiyi went to Mount Tiantai Dingguang a monk from Qingzhou had lived on the mountain for thirty years
Dingguang cultivated both meditation and wisdom and was indeed a person of supernatural attainments
When Zhiyi arrived on the mountain he saw Dingguang and expressed his admiration for him
Dingguang said Do you remember me
Many years ago I waved my hand and beckoned to you  Zhiyi was amazed and realized that the miraculous consequence of the dream had been realized
This took place in the fall in the ninth month of the Taijian period of the Chen dynasty 
Zhiyi also heard the sound of a bell everywhere in the valley everyone found it strange
Dingguang said The bell is sounded to gather together those who are endowed with suitable karmic conditions
You may stay here Zhiyi then identified through an oracle a superior location for his residence to the north of the place where Dingguang lived south of Mount Folong at the mouth of the Luoqi ravine
This quiet and wide open place was suitable for the pursuit of spiritual truth the ground was even and the spring water was clear
Zhiyi wandered around and stopped to spend the night
Suddenly he saw three people wearing black headdresses and red robes holding a memorial They requested him to proceed along the same road
Zhiyi built a grass hut at this place and planted pine trees
In the course of several years other buildings were added one after another and a busy community developed there
Dingguang said Please make do with this for the time being
When the state is purified and the three regions are unified a noble person should build a temple for you
Buildings will fill the entire mountain At this time no one understood the meaning of this statement
Later when Zhiyi engaged in ascetic practices on Huading Peak to the north of the temple strong winds uprooted trees from the ground and thunder roared and shook the ground thousands of groups of monstrous creatures appeared taking on a hundred different appearances shooting fire and screaming It was indescribably frightening
Yet Zhiyi controlled his mindpeaceful and patient in a state comparable to tranquil water he was unaware of the dangers to himself
He also suffered mental and physical pain such as being burned by fire
Again he saw his dead parents who put their heads on Zhiyis legs and complaining of their troubles begged him to take pity on them
Zhiyi remained firm in his enlightened wisdom and as immovable as a mountain consequently the frightening and pitiful forms manifested by karmic conditions disappeared
Suddenly a supernatural Central Asian monk appeared and told Zhiyi Having conquered the enemy and overcome the temptations from your loved ones you can be said to be courageous and so on
Emperor Xuandi of Chen issued an edict
Meditation Master is a hero of the Buddhist teaching other masters of the present time honor him
He instructs monks nuns and laypeople and the entire state looks up to his teaching
We should take the taxes from Shifeng district and use them to cover the various expenses 
People from two households will be exempted from government labor in order to provide him with water and firewood
The district in which Mount Tiantai was located was named Anle 
The director of this district Yuan Zixiong of Chen Commandery was a believer in Buddhism
Every summer Zhiyi lectured on the Vimalakīrtisūtra
Suddenly a staircase decorated with jewels connecting the three superior realms of existence descended from the sky and dozens of Indian monks came down the staircase
They came into the hall to worship holding incense burners in their hands and circumambulated Zhiyi three times
After a long while they disappeared
Members of the community all saw this and marveled at the wonders of the mountain
Zhiyis attainments produced miraculous effects  these effects were always like the example given above but they cannot be described in detail here
On the twentysecond day of the tenth month of the seventeenth year of the Kaihuang period  Zhiyi suddenly told the members of his community that he was about to leave them
Having said this he sat in the proper meditation position and passed away before the large stone image at Mount Tiantai
He was sixtyseven years old
After Zhiyi died many miracles occurred
Up until the last year of the Renshou period he would suddenly appear staff in hand wearing the robe looking just as he did before his death
Altogether he descended to the mountain temple seven times once he reappeared at Folong and said to his disciples Because you maintain the practices of the olden days everyone is at peace Everyone in the community saw this paying respect to him in sorrow and they spoke to him and asked him questions
After a while he disappeared 
Tang Dynasty Tanrong of Fazhusi Temple at Luzhou secular surname Zhang was from Dingzhou
His spirit was fierce and grave his temperament was pure
He was famous for his contemplative practice and diligent in teaching others Adapting himself to the circumstances of his audience he taught widely never forming attachments
Every year in spring and summer he practiced the vaipulya and pratyutpanna meditations and in fall and winter he engaged diligently in meditation and recitation
He said to the members of his community The power of relics is such that they appear and undergo changes freely everywhere
Where a karmic bond has been dissolved the relics respond and appear to those who pray for them Thereupon everyone placed a bowl of water in front of themselves and placing an incense burner in front of the bowl they all intensely prayed for relics through the night
When morning came altogether over four hundred pieces of relics were obtained in these bowls
Later the building in which Tanrong lived collapsed suddenly
Images and relics that had been placed on the altar spontaneously moved out of the building spreading out all over the courtyard and escaped any kind of damage
In the seventh year of the Zhenguan period lay followers Chang Ningbao and others requested Tanrong to perform vaipulya repentance at Fazhusi Temple in the city where the local government offices are located
On the fourteenth day of the seventh month the monk Sengding of Tanrongs base temple who strictly observed the precepts and was diligent in cultivation saw a massive light inside the practice hall the light was of five colors that appeared intermittently and moved from the bottom to the top
Seven buddhas with extraordinary signs of buddhahood appeared inside this mass of light and said to Sengding I am Vipaśyin Tathāgata Free From all Attachment Arhat One Who Has Realized the Highest Truth
Because your sins have been dissolved I came to certify this accomplishment
However since I am not your proper teacher I cannot officially predict your future achievement of buddhahood The first six buddhas all spoke these same words 
The last buddha said I am your proper teacher ākyamuni Tathāgata
Because your sins have been dissolved I have come to confer the prediction for future buddhahood on you
Tanrong is the reason you were able to extinguish your sins
During the world age of the wise there will be a buddha called Puning
Your body has become pure
Later you will become the buddha called Puming Such miraculous phenomena would indeed be difficult to prearrange
In the thirteenth year of the Zhenguan period Tanrong died at Fazhusi Temple
He was eightyfive years old Xu gaoseng zhuang T
Paying Respect to the Buddha Introduction Reciting the Name of the Buddha Contemplating the Buddha Amitābha Maitreya Samantabhadra and Avalokiteśvara The Perfect Being responds miraculously and comes to beings of appropriate capacity
His appearance is accompanied by rays of light and he confers his teaching which is like sweet dew in a meadow
As he leaves his shadow behind in paintings and statues his teaching is preserved in the ages when the sun has disappeared
Thus when he had gone to Tuṣita Heaven for awhile his holy appearance was carved in sandalwood
In the longer period of darkness how much more appropriate would it be to make certain that the experience of longpast days is not forgotten
Thus in the Western Region where the images appeared Udayana rst produced an image Emperor Ming of the Han dynasty  BCE
Following these rst ones artisans succeeded one after another in reproducing the Dharma body decorated with rare jewels
Decorated with gold stones pearls or jade all these images made of wood or plaster embroidered or painted most skillfully represented mental images Therefore they are most beautiful
In the old days under the Jin dynasty the monastic community began to produce images of unparalleled beauty
Emperors of the Song and the Qi dynasties made images with constant innovations
Many of these images lack records and inscriptions
Fearing that knowledge of their origins may be lost I now present records of the most superior examples
Through these models the benets of these images are manifested
of the Buddha The Great Sage has the mark of equanimity the disciples have the virtue of praising the Buddha
Thus the buddhas of the ten directions all emerged from the impurities of mud and enlightened in three bodies they sit upon lotus ower pedestals
Whatever aspects of theirs that we might think of they all bring benets
Thus in the period that began with renouncing the householders life and ended with enlightenment when events such as conquering Māra under the tree of enlightenment and preaching the sermon at the Deer Park occurred Buddha displayed perfect marks and was illumined by bright light
The color of his body was pure like molten gold and his face was handsome like a full moon
His teeth were as white as jade and snow and his hair was like shining conch shells
His eyes were comparable to blue lotuses his eyebrows were just like green willows that have grown densely
His voice with its eight marvelous qualities sounded clearly and all the features of his appearance were gentle and calm
His ve eyes saw penetratingly and his six supernatural powers reached far
His speech owed like a rapid stream and converts followed one after another
the three round dots constituted the Buddhas body and the ve items of the precepts meditation wisdom liberation and liberating knowledge formed the substratum of his body
Equipped with the two truths one provisional and the other ultimate to bring salvation to beings he guided people appropriately sometimes sending a massive wind of compassion and sometimes pouring down a heavy rain of teaching
He allowed his body to be used as a eld of merit that sentient beings could cultivate and left his teeth as supreme relics
When the tree of the mind bloomed its leaves never withered
He approached without making any effort he saw without making any effort to see
For the benet of sentient beings he appeared in response to their specic circumstances
Billions of beings in the ten directions all wished to attend him and in the worldsystem consisting of threefoldthousand worlds all succeeded in receiving instruction
These beings have long been accumulating merit by planting seeds in the merit eld of the Buddhas body offering services everywhere to attend to its needs
They pull out the roots of wrong views and cut down the trunk of greed and anger
Practicing recitation of the Buddhas name becomes the cause that produces the saving vision of the Buddha
A verse in the Lotus Sutra says
If people with their minds scattered enter the stupa And concentrate on reciting the name of the Buddha They all will attain the Way of the Buddha Again the Piyu jing says
Once there was a king who had killed his father in order to ascend the throne
There was an arhat who knew that this kings life would soon end
He calculated the length of the kings remaining life span to be only seven days and learned that after his life had ended the king was certain to fall into the lowest hell and suffer for a period of one world age 
The arhat then went to see the king to teach him and urged him sincerely to utter the name of the Buddha for seven days without interruption When he was about to leave the arhat again told the king not to forget his instruction
The king then folded his arms in front of his chest and concentrated on uttering the name throughout the day and night without stopping and at the beginning of the seventh day his life came to an end
His spirit went to the lowest hell but before he mounted the vehicle he uttered the name of the Buddha and when the vehicle reached the gate of hell and he realized that he had come to hell he shouted loudly the name of the Buddha
The sinners in the jails of hell heard a voice uttering the name of the Buddha and they all immediately uttered the name
The ferocious res of hell then disappeared immediately and all the sinners were liberated and reborn as human beings
Later the arhat taught the king again and the king became a streamwinner
Thus the merits of uttering the name of the Buddha are innite and incomparable
The Guanfo sanmei jing says
Once when the Buddha was in the world for the benet of his father King  and members of the congregation he preached the Scripture on the Buddha Contemplation Samādhi
The Buddha has thirtytwo primary marks and eighty secondary marks his body is of the color of pure gold and emits innite light
At that time ve hundred sons of the ākya clan were sitting before the Buddhas seat
Because of their sins the Buddha appeared to them like a wasted brahman the color of coal
When they saw this they wailed aloud and pulled their own hair
They threw themselves on the ground causing their noses to bleed
The Buddha comforted them Do not wail aloud
I will speak for your sake
In the past there was a buddha whose name was Vipaśyin
After he entered nirvana during the period of the counterfeit teaching  there lived an elder called Riyuede 
He had ve hundred sons all of whom were intelligent and welleducated
Their father had faith in the Three Treasures and frequently taught his sons the meaning of the Buddhas teaching
the sons held wrong views and none of them had faith
Some time later all the sons became gravely ill at the same time and their father came where they were
Weeping he joined his palms and said to them You hold wrong views and do not have faith in the Buddhas teaching
Now the sword of impermanence is about to sever your bodies On whom are you going to rely
There is a buddha a worldhonored one whose name is Vipaśyin
You should utter his name When the sons heard this out of respect for their fathers words they uttered the name of the Buddha The father the king also taught them to utter the words Dharma and Sangha When they had nished uttering these words their lives ended
Because they had uttered the Buddhas name they were reborn in the heavens of the four heavenly kings but due to the wrong views they had held before their lives ended they then fell down into hell
The demons who served as jailors pierced their eyes with heated irons
As they were experiencing pain the sons remembered their fathers lesson to utter the name of the Buddha and they were reborn from hell into the human world where they lived in poverty among lowerclass people
Later ikhin Buddha appeared in the world and these sons happened to meet him
They could hear the Buddhas name but they could not see his form
Later Viśvabhū Buddha Krakucchanda Buddha Kanakamuni Buddha and Kāśyapa Buddha appeared all the sons heard their names but they could not see their forms
Because they heard the names of these six buddhas they were reborn together as fellow ākya clanspeople
My body is beautiful like Jāmbūnada gold
You see only a wasted brahman whose skin is the color of coal because of the wrong views you held in your previous lives
You may now utter the names of the past buddhas and the name of your father along with my name and the name of Maitreya Buddha
Having uttered these names honor them and turning to the congregation of virtuous monks greet them by prostrating yourself and publicly repent your sins of holding wrong views
Having been taught thus the sons repented and then saw the Buddha who was like a golden Mount Sumeru
Having seen this they said to the Buddha We now see the Buddhas thirtytwo primary marks and eighty secondary marks illumined by innite light As they said this they became streamwinners
They renounced the householders life to seek the Buddha and attained arhatship and were endowed with the three kinds of supernatural knowledge the six kinds of supernatural powers and attained the eight meditative states that lead to salvation The Buddha told the monks After I enter nirvana if you utter my name and the names of other buddhas you will obtain innite merits The Guanfo sanmei jing says
In a very distant past a buddha whose name was ākyamuni appeared in the world
After he had entered nirvana there was a prince called Jinchuang  who was arrogant followed wrong views and did not believe in the Buddhas teaching
There was also a monk called Dingzizai 
He told the prince Images of the Buddha exist in the world
They are decorated beautifully with many jewels and are very attractive
Go inside a stupa and observe the buddha images The prince then went into a stupa and saw an image
He said to the monk If the image of the Buddha is as beautiful as this how much more beautiful would the true body of the Buddha be The monk said to him You see the image now and yet you do not know how to pay respect to it
Join your palms and utter the name of the Buddha At that time the prince held his palms together and uttered the name of the Buddha
After he returned to the palace he kept thinking of the stupa and for this reason at night he saw the buddha image in his dream
When the dream ended he was lled with joy and abandoning wrong views he took refuge in the Three Treasures
Due to the merit gained from entering the stupa and uttering the name of the Buddha when the princes life ended he saw ninety billion nayutas of buddhas and before each buddha he attained the deep samādhi of recitation of the name of the Buddha
Because of this samādhi buddhas appeared before him and predicted his future destiny
Ever since then over the course of ten billion asaṃkhyeya kalpas he was never reborn into lower realms of existence and today he has achieved the śūraṅgama samādhi
This past prince is the present Caishou Bodhisattva
In the light of this story those who are endowed with wisdom should practice recitation of the Buddhas name
the Buddha I have heard of the power of the Dharma King the saving power of his Way is unlimited
From his great compassion the voice of his preaching resounds to the summit of the universe
Like a thick and dense cloud he rains down his teaching beneting each being according to their capacity
Bright as a clear mirror he views sentient beings according to their categories
Therefore when the Buddha in his golden body was born the stars lost their brightness and the moon lovingly dimmed its light thus allowing the brightness of the morning light to dominate
When the Buddhas voice in eight different modes sounded the mistaken path of the Jains was disrupted
After the Buddha had taught for a short while in seven types of marvelous speech Pūrṇa became a follower
Thus we know that the Buddhas power is divine and his benets reach widely and deeply
Yet it is rare for someone to take part in the joy of attending the Buddha seeing and hearing him in person
Therefore it is recommended that practitioners constantly engage in Buddha contemplation in which the mind maintains the marvelous appearance of the Buddha as if he were standing right in front of the practitioner
As the mind entertains the thought of the luminous appearance it appears very close by
Although the Dharma body is one the Buddha teaches the three vehicles according to circumstances
When the capacities of teacher and disciples match there are many ways leading to the truth
I now rst record passages from the scripture
Later I will relate stories of miraculous events
Detailed records not included here are found elsewhere
The Guanfo sanmei jing says
In a very distant past going back for uncountable reigns a buddha called Baoweide shangwang appeared in the world
At that time a monk accompanied by nine disciples went to the stupa of a buddha and paid respect to the buddha images
He noticed one jeweled image strikingly attractive and having paid his respects he uttered verses in praise of the image
Later when their lives ended the monk and his disciples were all reborn in the eastern buddha land of Baoweide shangwang
They were spontaneously born there sitting crosslegged upon large lotus owers
Ever since that time they have encountered buddhas all the time and before each buddha they have engaged in pure practice and attained the ocean of the recitation of the name of the buddha samādhi
When they attained this samādhi the Buddha predicted their future destiny
each monk will become the buddha of one of the ten directions
Shande Buddha of the eastern direction was that teacher
His nine disciples became the buddhas of the nine directions namely
Wuyoude Buddha in the southeastern direction Zhandande Buddha in the southern direction Baoshi Buddha in the southwestern direction Wuliangming Buddha in the western direction Huade Buddha in the northwestern direction Xiangde Buddha in the northern direction Sanshengxing Buddha in the northeastern direction Guangzhongde Buddha in the direction above and Mingde Buddha in the direction below
Because in the past they paid respect at a stupa and on viewing a buddha image had praised it in verse these ten monks have now attained buddhahood in the ten directions
The Guanfo sanmei jing says
In the very distant past a buddha whose name was Kongwang appeared in the world
After he had entered nirvana four monks were studying together cultivating the Buddhas correct teaching
Their minds were obscured by passions and they could not uphold rmly the treasure house of the Buddhas teaching
Having committed numerous evil deeds they were about to be reborn in lower realms of existence
A voice was heard in the sky speaking to these monks The Tathāgata is in nirvana but your crimes are such that it is impossible to save you
You should now go into the stupa and observe the image
In form and illumination the image will be no different from the Tathāgata as he was in the world When the voice in the sky ceased they went inside the stupa and observed the image When they saw the white hair between the eyebrows  one of the thirtytwo primary marks of the Buddha they spoke aloud their thoughts Is there any difference between the illumined body of the Tathāgata when he was in this world and this image
We request this mark of the Buddha as a great being to remove our sins Having said this they threw themselves on the ground like a collapsing great mountain and while prostrating they repented
Due to going inside the stupa observing the hair mark and repenting when these monks were reborn in lower realms of existence for eight billion asaṃkhyeya kalpas in each of their rebirths they always saw the buddhas of the ten directions
Before each of the buddhas they practiced the deep samādhi of the recitation of the name of the Buddha
When they obtained this samādhi the buddhas of the ten directions appeared before them and predicted their future destiny
They have now all become buddhas
In the eastern direction the name of the land is Miaoxi  and the buddha there is called Achu 
He was the rst monk
In the southern direction the name of the land is Huanxi  and the buddha there is called Shixiang 
He was the second monk
In the western direction the name of the land is Jile  and the buddha there is called Wuliangshou 
He was the third monk
In the northern direction the name of the land is Lian hua zhuangyan  and the name of the buddha there is Weimiaosheng 
He was the fourth monk
In the light of this story those who practice should contemplate the Buddha frequently
The Jiaye jing says
In the very distant past asaṃkhyeya kalpas ago a buddha appeared in the world
His name was Guangming 
There was a bodhisattva called Dajingjin 
He was sixteen years old of brahman birth and very handsome
A monk had painted a buddha image on a white cloth and brought it to jingjin
When he saw the image his heart was lled with joy and he uttered the following words The image of the Tathāgata is so beautiful
How much more beautiful must his body itself be
I vow that in a future life I too will obtain such a beautiful body Having said this he thought If I remain a householder it will not be possible to obtain such a body He then spoke to his parents begging their permission to renounce the householders life
His parents replied We are now old You are our only child
If you renounce the householders life we will die The son said to the parents If you do not give your permission from this day on I will not eat or drink
I will not go to bed nor will I speak Having made this vow he did not eat all that day and continued like this for six days
Friends of his parents and eightyfour thousand women all wept and paid respect to Dajingjin
Shortly thereafter his parents gave him permission
Having renounced the householders life he took the buddha image and went to a mountain
Gathering grass for a seat he sat crosslegged in front of the image and contemplated singlemindedly thus
This painted image is no different from the Tathāgata the image of the Tathāgata cannot be perceived all dharmas are like this
without characteristics and transcending characteristics their substance is empty and quiet Having contemplated thus after one day and night he obtained the ve supernatural powers complete with innite attainments He obtained unobstructed speech and the samādhi of allpervasive light
Having obtained the great ray of light with his divine eye he saw innumerable buddhas in the eastern direction
With his divine ear he was able to hear all the sermons preached by those buddhas
He continued in this manner for seven entire months
He took wisdom as food
All the gods scattered owers and attended to his needs
He came down from the mountain and entering villages he preached the Dharma for the benet of others
The rst thought of seeking enlightenment arose in twenty thousand sentient beings
Innite and innumerable numbers of people performed meritorious deeds along the paths of the hearers and the pratyekabuddhas
His parents and other associates attained the stage of nonregression and supreme enlightenment
The Buddha said to Kāśyapa I myself was this Dajingjin of the past
Due to the practice of contemplating the image I have now attained buddhahood
If a person practices this contemplation it is certain that they will realize the supreme Way in the future Miracle Stories Fiftythree stories are summarized here
This fascicle contains fteen stories The teaching of the Buddha was rst brought to the Eastern Han and then slowly spread to the kingdom of Wu in the south
During this period miraculous images of the Buddha appeared everywhere in the empire they were listed in numerous records
The stories included in these records differ but there are no discrepancies in the miraculous signs reported for each specic image
The presentation here is by specic images and is not chronological
This is because the stories about some images begin in the Jin period and continue into the Sui and Tang periods
In instructing people the consequences are sometimes positive and sometimes negative
Therefore it is impossible to establish a ranking of these images
The collection is organized in terms of the stories around specic images Eastern Han dynasty  The story of the ākyamuni painting in Luoyang Southern Wu dynasty  the story of the golden image discovered in the ground in Jianye
Western Jin dynasty  the story of the stone images arrived oating in the Jiang River and the story of the auspicious golden image at Mount Tai sent by seven kingdoms Eastern Jin dynasty  the story of the golden image discovered on a beach in Yangdu the story of the golden image in Xiangyang that walked in the mountains the story of the golden image in Jingzhou that came down from afar the story of the golden image that was discovered in the water in Wuxing the story of the auspicious incense and the wooden image at Kuaiji the story of the golden image in Wu Commandery the story of the golden image dug out of the ground at Dongye Gate and the story of the golden image of Mañjuśrī at Mount Lu Wei dynasty  the story of the monastic robe that appeared at Mount Shixiang in Liangzhou Northern Liang dynasty  the story of the clay images at the southern cliff produced by the Prince of Hexi and the story of Juqu s rock image six zhang in height Eastern Han Dynasty The Mingxiang ji  compiled by Wang Yan of the Southern Qi  contains the following passage
Emperor Ming of the Later Han dynasty saw a divine being in a dream that was nearly two zhang tall
Its body was golden in color and it carried a shining sun behind its head
asked his ministers about his dream
Someone answered There is a deity in the West who looks just like the being you dreamed about
Perhaps this is what you saw Thereupon the emperor sent a messenger to India who returned to the Central Kingdom with copies of scriptures and images
The Son of Heaven the princes and the nobles all paid respect to them
They heard that when a person dies his spirit does not disappear Everyone was frightened and dumbfounded
First the messenger Cai Yin with the Western monks Kāśyapa and Mātaṅga brought a painting of ākyamuni in a reclining position produced by King Udayana
The emperor treasured it
The gure was just like the one he had seen in his dream
He then ordered artisans to produce several copies
He placed these images on the Qingliang Terrace of the Southern Palace and at the Xianjieshouling Tomb near the Gaoyangmen Gate and worshiped them
Again on the wall at Boma Temple there is a picture of a thousand chariots and ten thousand men on horses surrounding the stupa 
The image is described in a number of records
Southern Wu Dynasty A golden image was discovered in a at area in the back garden of Jianye
An inquiry into its origin revealed that it was an image produced by King Aśoka that had been placed in this city near the Jiang River in the early years of the Zhou dynasty 
How was this known to be the case
From the time of the Qin dynasty through the subsequent Han and Wei dynasties Buddhism had not yet reached Southern China
How then could an image like this have been buried in this place
Sun Hao obtained this image but he lacked faith and did not particularly honor it
He placed it near a lavatory and left it covered up
On the eighth day of the fourth month Hao said in jest Today is the eighth day when the Buddha is bathed and he urinated on the head of the Buddha in the image
Some time later his body erupted in tumors and the condition was the most severe around his penis
He screamed uncontrollably from the extreme pain
The court astronomer conducted divination and said This is the result of an offense against a great divinity Immediately offerings were made to all the deities but they had no effect
A court lady who was a Buddhist said The Buddha is a great deity
You committed a polluting act in front of his image
Quickly ask for pardon now Hao believed her prostrated himself while laying in his sickbed and ardently apologized
After a while his condition began to improve
He then send a horsedrawn carriage to invite the monk Senghui to the palace and asked him to bathe the buddha image in fragrant water
The emperor repented deeply and performed a variety of meritorious deeds at temples in Jianye
The pain in his penis gradually disappeared Ji shenzhou sanbao gantong lu II T c ref
Gaoseng zhuan Ta Western Jin Dynasty In the rst year of the Jianxing period  during the reign of Emperor Min at the Hudu estuary of the Songjiang River in the Wu district of Wu Commandery some people were seen to be oating on the water
The local shermen suspected them to be ocean gods and they invited a medium and presented sacrices to welcome them
The wind and waves became more powerful however and in terror they retreated
Then some followers of the Way of the Five Pecks of Rice and the School of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi said These are our teachers and went into the ocean to welcome them
The wind and waves were still just as powerful
Layman Zhuying of the Wu district who worshiped the Buddha heard of this and said They must be the buddhas who have come down to us He puried himself and together with Boni of Dongling Temple and several other believers he went to the Hu estuary and bowed his head to the ground to welcome them
The wind and waves quieted and the two people oating on the river were carried by the tide into the bay
The closer they came the clearer they could be seen and the people realized that they were stone statues When the stone gures came to them without exerting effort the people tried to lift them
The gures rose up lightly and the people carried them back to Tongxuan Temple
They saw inscriptions on the back of the gures
one said Vipaśyin and the other Kāśyapa
It was not known under which emperors reign they had been produced but the writing was clear
The statues were seven feet tall
People prepared Dharma seats and placed the gures safely on them
Several dozens of people then could not move them Yet when people spoke to them requesting them to move they quickly rose 
The discovery was reported to the court and nine out of ten families both from within the aristocracy and from among the commoners paid respect to the gures
The monk Fakai who came from the Western Region said According to a scripture two stone gures and Aśoka stupas exist in the eastern region those who make offerings and worship them will have the sins they have accumulated through many world ages removed According to a different tradition twelve Indian monks sent the images to the commandery
The stone gures stood upon the water without sinking but did not advance further The matter was reported to the court and by imperial edict the gures were permitted to remain at Wu Commandery
Ji shenzhou sanbao gantong lu II T ca ref Gaoseng zhuan Tc Note
Stories about these images appear in the Gaoseng zhuan  the Jingyi ji  and elsewhere Some time in the past in the Yongjia period  political chaos erupted in Central China
At this time on the mountain where the monk Seng lang resided Langgong Temple in Jinyu Valley on Mount Tai had always been obscured by clouds
People marveled at this sign which predicted the failure of the government and his reputation as a monk who predicted political fortunes spread throughout the realm under heaven
This was the time when the ruler was killed and powerful gures assisted the young successor
The ruling families of seven states honored this monk
Many states rushed to donate bronze images and other gifts
Senglang received these gifts with proper decorum and each time auspicious signs appeared
At the present time these gifts are kept in one hall and the door and windows are always open yet birds stay away and unclean substances do not mar them
Both those who live near the place and those from afar equally marvel at this
The temple now has a history of three hundred and fty years Ji shenzhou sanbao gantong lu II Ta ref
Gaoseng zhuan Tb Xu gaoseng zhuan Tca Eastern Jin Dynasty During the Xianhe period the Governor of Danyang Gao Li while on his way to and from the palace saw a strange light on the beach at Marquis Zhangs bridge
He sent ofcials there and obtained a golden image in the ancient Indian style which lacked both the decorative halo and the base
Gao Li dismounted from his carriage and placed the image on it
When he came to the street leading to Changgan Temple the ox pulling the carriage stopped
Gao Li told the driver to let the ox go wherever it wanted and they ended up at Changgan Temple so he placed the image there
A large crowed gathered in the capital city of Yangdu to have a look at and pay respect to the image Many people were converted to Buddhism In the middle of the night the image always emitted light
Over a year later a sherman called Zhang Xishi who lived in the Linhai district saw in the ocean a copper image base decorated with lotus owers
The image base oated around emitting red light
The sherman quickly moved his boat to the spot and picked it up
The image base was sent to the court and when the emperor placed the images feet on it they t perfectly
Later ve monks from the Western Region visited Gao Li and told him In the past we traveled to India and obtained a buddha image made by King Aśoka When we came to the city of Ye in Northern China we ran into political and military disturbances
We hid the image on the bank of a river
When the kings roads became passable we looked for the image again but were not able to locate it
Recently we had a dream in which the image said I went to the region east of the Jiang River and was obtained by Gao Li
I am at the King Aśoka temple This is why we have made this long trip to come here
We wish to pay respect to the image Gao Li led the ve monks to the temple When the monks saw the image they cried aloud and wept
The image emitted light for them and the light illumined the hall and all around the monks
The monks said Originally there was a decorative halo
It is somewhere far away now but it will also arrive here soon In the rst year of the Xianan period Dong Zongzhi who was diving for pearls at Hepu in the Jiaozhou region in Nanhai saw on each dive a light at the bottom of the sea
The light radiated up to the surface He looked for the decorative halo of a buddha image and found it
He reported this discovery to the court
Emperor Jianwen ordered the halo to be restored to  image
The holes t the image and the halo also had an identical luster
In the course of over forty years auspicious miracles had occurred in places separated by great distances to restore the decorative halo and the base for the image
The base of the image decorated with owers had an inscription in an Indian script
While there were many visitors none was familiar with the script
Only Guṇavarman  master of all three categories of scriptures said This is written in an old Sanskrit script
This image was produced by the fourth daughter of King Aśoka At one time a monk at Waguan Temple called Huisui wanted to produce a copy of the image
The monk who was the administrative head of Temple feared that he might damage the golden color of the image and said to Huisui If you can cause the image to emit light and turn to the West the matter is beyond my control Huisui prayed ardently
In the middle of the night he heard a strange sound and when he opened the doors of the buddha hall he saw the image emitting bright light and it had turned to face west
Thereupon he was given permission to copy the image
He produced dozens of copies of the image which circulated widely and still exist
Emperor Wu of the Liang dynasty added images of seven deities and two bodhisattvas to the halo
In the second year of the Yongding period of the Chen dynasty Wang Lin encamped his soldiers on the shore of the Chang jiang River facing the capital city of Jinling
Emperor Wu ordered his soldiers to attack the encamped army
Just as the soldiers were about to leave the image moved and could not be stabilized
This strange development was reported to the court and the emperor examined the image himself and found the report to be true
Suddenly before the soldiers crossed swords Wang Lins army scattered and Wang Lin ed north by himself
Emperor Wus army followed him upstream and pacied the whole region
During the Tianjia period there was a rebellion in the southeastern region
When the emperor prayed in front of the image requesting that the rebels be repulsed the image shone and illumined the hall
Shortly after that the difculties in the region ceased
Monk Huixiao headed Changgan Temple
His spiritual inuences reached everywhere like the wind
He constructed a multistoried hall  it was painted with extraordinary patterns and from it the view reached as far as the eye can see
In the course of the ve dynasties from the Jin to the Chen  all rulers and ministers paid respect to the image
In times of drought they poured oil over the image and had it brought to the palace on the emperors carriage
While the image was en route to the palace rain would fall
Rumors spread regarding the future of the Chen dynasty and soon they came to be sung in vernacular songs
In the second year of Zhenming  CE  the image turned westward and even after people turned it to face the correct direction it again turned westward by itself
This was reported to the emperor who withdrew to the hall where he lived
He offered a vegetarian feast and engaged in other meritorious activities
The image originally had a crown of seven jewels decorated with pearls and jade and which weighed seven jin
A silken hat was placed above the crown
On the morning  the jeweled crown was hanging from the hand of the image although the silk hat was still on the head
The emperor burned incense and prayed saying If inauspicious things are to happen to the state  let the image take the jeweled crown off again as a sign of heavenly punishment He then placed the jeweled crown back on the head of the image
In the morning the jeweled crown was again hanging from the images hand as before
Both the emperor and the ministers were frightened
When Chen state was conquered by the state of Sui all the members of the ruling class were transported to the west their headgear was removed and their hands were bound behind their back
It was just as the image had symbolically predicted
Emperor Wen of the Sui dynasty heard about this and brought the image to the palace
Since it was a standing gure the emperor also stood and paid respect to it
He said I am old and unable to stand for a long time
The Ofce of the Right should be ordered to produce a sitting image with the same features The original standing image was sent to DaxingshanTemple
When the image reached the buddha hall  it was rst placed facing north to avoid exposure to the sun but in the morning it was found to be facing south
People were amazed and moved it to face the north again but the next morning it was again found turned toward the south 
Amazed the people realized that they had failed to pay proper respect to the image
The image still exists today there are many painted copies Ji shenzhou sanbao gantong lu II Tac ref
Gaoseng zhuan Tc On the eighth day of the fourth month of the third year of the Ningkang period under Emperor Xiaowu of the Eastern Chin dynasty  Monk Daoan of Tanqi Monastery in Xiangyang whose virtues were manifest and whose reputation was unrivaled anywhere forged a bronze gure of Amitābha Buddha eight zhang tall at the temple in the western suburb
In the last month of the following year the decoration was completed
When Hui Defense Command General of Jin and Regional Inspector of Yongzhou assumed his position in the Xiang region and supported the Buddhist teaching this image moved at night of its own accord and traveled around numerous mountains
Its footsteps became patterns on rocks
Monks and laypeople in villages rushed to see this
Marveling at the feat they brought the image back to the original temple and made offerings to it
Later in the evening the gure would again move from temple where it was housed
All the people were amazed Hui then changed the name of the temple to Golden Image Temple
On the eighth day of the fourth month of the third year of Putong  CE
 an edict was issued ordering that a bronze base  ve chi and nine cun tall and nine chi and eight cun wide decorated with owers be forged at Jingxing Garden
When it was properly decorated the base was shipped upstream to be placed under the gure
An inscription was made describing its remarkable power Liu Xiaoyi composed the text and Xiao Ziyun did the calligraphy
In the third year of the Jiande period  Wang Bing Duke of Taiyuan served as Regional Inspector of Xiangzhou
Assistant Commander Changsun Zhe was an unbeliever
He heard that the bronze statue had miraculous powers and he wished to destroy it
The laypeople in the villages and defrocked monks and nuns heard about his wish to destroy the image and their wailing lled the streets
When Zhe saw the monks nuns and laypeople mourning the decision he became even angrier and pressed his underlings to move quickly to carry out the demolition
He rst sent a hundred people who tied a rope around the gures neck and pulled but the image would not move
He then added three hundred more people
The gure still did not move
In increased fury he sent ve hundred more to pull and the gure then tumbled
The sound shook the earth and all the people were terried
Only Zhe was delighted and immediately ordered his men to melt down the bronze statue
Shouting triumphantly he rode his horse at a gallop to report to the Regional Inspector
Before they had gone a hundred steps however he suddenly fell off
Unable to speak staring blankly he could not raise any of his limbs and when evening came he died
The monks nuns and laypeople shouted in great delight
When Zhes people had pulled down the statue an inscription was discovered inside the robe under the arm of the gure which read
In the nineteenth year of the Taiyuan period of Jin  year jiawu rst month
second day monk Daoan produced in the western suburb of Xiangyang a golden statue eight zhang tall
After one hundred and eighty years when the sixtyyear cycle calendar has revolved three times this gure will be destroyed
Later people calculated the number of years and learned that the dates of the construction and destruction of the image matched this prediction perfectly
It is true that Master Daoan was a sage and never made untrue predictions
The temple where the gure used to be housed is now called Qifasi
The rocks on which the gure stepped have been cut out and placed in the temple
Toward the end of the Sui the empire had fallen apart but there were some who defended the old empire in certain locations
Royal Guardian of Xiangyang Du Lubao was in control of one area and followed Wang Shichong
At Qifa Temple there was a monk called Dharma Master Xian who was respected by a lay nobleman
This monk repeatedly advised Lord Du to submit to the Tang but Du did not follow this advice
Monk Xian and local noblemen sent a messenger and eventually armies were sent from the capital city to Xiangyang
Du defended his city rmly
Armies attacked three times but the city did not fall
Later Xians activity was exposed and he was killed in secret
When he was about to be killed Xian said to his disciple Su Fulou Your father and I saw Daoans gure destroyed
From then on the tradition has not been resumed
After I die you should remake the image In the fourth year of the Wude period  the government armys attack on the city intensied and Du surrendered
He then regretted not having followed Xians advice
How deplorable it is for someone to be killed for no crime
This prevents those who may wish to make a contribution to the state from speaking up
After the city had been conquered Fulou put on laymans clothes
He gathered the robes and other belongings of Xian and then wished to produce a copy of gure but he had no idea what to use as the model
Yet as soon as he melted the metal a perfect image formed
Fulou had a talent for business and became wealthy
He also produced a bronze gure of Maitreya over one zhang tall in his house
Later he had a dream in which the monk Xian appeared and ordered him to produce more buddha images
Thereupon Fulou produced the large statue at Fanyun Temple ftynine chi tall The story of this gure is told elsewhere
Some time earlier at the beginning of Sui rule Xiao who is known as the Prince of Qin was put in charge of the Xiang region
He heard that Master Daoans ancient gure had an extraordinary appearance
So he sent someone to make a drawing of it and produced a copy at Yanxing Temple in Changan
On the evening the casting began great miraculous signs appeared music was heard from heaven and owers fell down like rain
This gure still exists at Yanxing Temple
On the eighth day of the second month of the sixth year of the Yonghe period under Emperor Mu of the Eastern Jin an image appeared in the northern suburb of Jingzhou the year is calculated as the third year of the same period in the Universal Calendar System  CE
The statue was seven chi and ve cun in height and together with the halo and the base it reached one zhang and one chi Nobody had any idea where the gure had come from
Earlier in the fth year of the Yonghe period  a merchant ship was unloading its cargo in Guangzhou The work was almost nished when the boat became too light
In the middle of the night people had sensed that someone had come running on board Surprised they looked for the person but could not nd him
The load on the boat increased and no more cargo could be added
People were amazed but could not gure out what had caused this
The boat traveled under favorable conditions on its long journey and reached ports ahead of other ships
It soon reached Zhugong and docked at the harbor
At night people felt that a man had walked off the boat to the shore
The load on the boat again became very light
Then the gure appeared in the suburb of Jingzhou and people realized the meaning of these unusual signs
At that time Huan Wen was CommanderInChief in charge of the western Shan region and he came in person to pay respect to the gure
The discovery of the statue caused a great stir in the cities and villages and monks came rushing from all the temples attempting to bring the gure to their own temple but the gure stood rmly and could not be moved
In the second year of the Yonghe period  the governor of Changsha called Teng Jun donated his residence to be turned into a temple which was called by the name of the commandery 
Having heard that Dharma Master Daoan had taken charge of the monastic community in Xiangzhou Teng Jun asked him to send a monk to look after his temple in Changsha
Daoan said to his disciple Tanyi People in Jing and Chu have begun to be interested in the teaching You are the very person who will make their faith bloom
You must go there Tanyi traveled southward and organized the temple
Though monks had arrived and the temple buildings were ready there were no images
He frequently deplored this saying King Aśokas temples and images are spread about widely according to karmic conditions Yet the intensity of our devotion has not reached the peak
Why should we worry that an image will never descend to here When he heard that an image had arrived at Jingcheng he was delighted and sharing his joy with his colleagues he said This statue appeared in response to my earlier vow
It is destined to come to Changsha Temple
We must seek for it in the mind
It is difcult to bring it through physical force The people at the temple all said We will do as you say
You will soon be proven correct Tanyi burned incense and respectfully invited the image to his temple
He let three of his disciples raise the image which rose as lightly as the wind and was transported to the temple
Monks and laypeople joined in celebrating this event
In the second year of the Xianan period under Emperor Jianwen  CE
 a base decorated with owers was cast for the gure
During the Taiyuan period under the reign of Emperor Xiaowu of the Jin dynasty when Yin Zhongkan occupied the ofce of Regional Inspector the gure walked out of the western gate of the temple
The night watchman thought it was a man and asked who it was but the gure did not answer
When the night watchman struck it with a sword it made a metallic sound
He looked closely and found that it was the statue and on the chest where he had hit it a pattern had appeared
A Kashmiri monk Sengquenanduo  who was very learned came from Shu to Jing and entered the temple to worship this gure
He sighed and remained silent for a long time
Tanyi asked why he was so moved
Sengquenanduo answered This image disappeared from India recently
Why did it come to this distant land When they checked the year and month the two dates matched perfectly
The monk saw a Sanskrit inscription on the back of the image stating that the statue was made by King Aśoka
When they learned about this inscription people honored the gure with even greater respect
The statue proved the miraculous effect of Tanyis ardent request
When he became seriously ill the gures halo suddenly disappeared
Tanyi said Since the buddha is showing this sign my illness is incurable
The halo has gone elsewhere He performed further rites for the gure and after ten days Tanyi passed away
Monks later produced the existing halo modeled after the original one
During the reign of Emperor Xiaowu of the Song dynasty the gure emitted light and Buddhism prospered greatly in the region south and downstream of the Jiang River
Toward the end of the Taishi period  under the reign of Emperor Ming of the Song dynasty  the statue suddenly wept tears
Shortly after this Emperor Ming died
His successor was immoral and crazy thus causing the transfer of the mandate from the Song to the Qi dynasty 
Regional Inspector of Jingzhou Shen Youzhi originally did not follow the Buddhas teaching and persecuted monks and nuns
There were over one thousand monks in Changsha Temple alone and Shen Youzhi was about to disrobe several hundreds of them
The entire community was panicstricken and everyone both old and young cried in distress
The gure sweated for ve days without stop
News of this incident reached Shen Youzhis ear and Shen invited the great master of the temple Xuanyang and inquired about the cause of this event
Xuanyang said The Holy One is not far and everything reaches him
The buddhas of the past present and future are connected in the continuing thought of the Buddha
Can we think of all the buddhas without thinking of this present buddha
In order to reprimand you for your lack of faith the buddhas are giving this sign Shen asked for the scriptural source for this idea and was given the answer that it is found in the Wuliangshou jing 
Taking up the scripture and nding the passage Shen was delighted and immediately stopped the persecution
In the second year of the Yongyuan period of the Qi dynasty  Defense Commander Xiao Yingzhou and the founding emperor of the Liang dynasty collaborated with Baorong Prince of Nankang who was the Regional Inspector of Jingzhou to stage a successful coup dtat
The gure moved outside of the hall in which it was housed and looked as if it wished to go down the stairs
The two monks who saw this were taken aback and called the others
The statue then turned around and went inside the hall
In the third year of the same period Xiao Yingzhou died suddenly
Baorong who had been installed as the emperor was removed from the throne and instead the founding emperor of the Liang dynasty enjoyed good fortune
Toward the end of the Tianjian period  Abbot Daoyue cleared the weeds around a stupa with the help of a layman
When he opened the door of the stupa he saw the gure walking around the crypt
Daoyue worshiped the image quietly and did not mention this to anyone
Then he went to the hall where the gure was placed and opened wide the door The statue was again sitting on its base
When the Prince of Poyang was in charge of Jingzhou he frequently requested the gure to come into the city so that he could perform meritorious ceremonies
When he became ill he sent people to bring the statue with great care and respect More and more workers were employed to lift it but the statue could not be raised
After a few days the prince passed away
When the Founding Emperor Emperor Wu was once in the Jing and Shan region he sincerely and repeatedly invited the gure but in the end failed to cause it to come to him
In the third month of the fourth year of the Zhongdatong period  the emperor sent Sengjin of Boma Temple and the scribe He Si to offer from a distance incense and owers to the statue and express his sincere sentiments
At night the gure emitted light and looked as if it would go and accompany the messengers
When the messengers were brought to the image in the morning however the gure seemed to wish to stay
After repeated requests the statue consented to accompany the messengers
The congregation of the temple was greatly attached to the gure and they all went to give it a sendoff at the port situated on the Jiang River
On the twentythird day the image reached the capital city Jinling
The emperor traveled to a place eighteen miles away from the capital and greeted the statues arrival
The gure emitted light continuously without interruption when it came to the end of the route of its travels
Monks and laymen expressed pleasure over the auspicious event
The gure stayed at the palace for three days and received sincere worship and offerings The emperor hosted a major vegetarian feast open to everyone in the land
On the twentyseventh day the statue left the city through the Datong Gate and entered Tongtai Temple
During the night the gure emitted strong light
By imperial order a hall three jian long with two wings was built northeast of the great hall of Tongtai Temple and a curtained throne decorated with seven jewels was set up there for the miraculous image
Two bronze bodhisattva gures were also produced
An articial hill was constructed and a pond dug there were unusual trees and strange rocks and gracefully tall bridges balustrades connected the two staircases at the end of the hall
A pair of copper pots each large enough to contain thirty gallons was donated
Variously layered roofs formed beautiful patterns on three sides of the building
In the third month of the second year of the Zhongdatong period  the emperor visited Tongtai Temple setting up a banquet and arranging lectures
The emperor visited the many temple buildings one by one and dusk had set in when he arrived at the hall where the miraculous gure was housed
When the emperor went up the stairs of the hall the gure emitted a great deal of light and the bamboo trees and scenery around the hall all turned a golden color
This miraculous phenomenon lasted through half the night
There was a re at Tongtai Temple and all its buildings were burned down only the hall where the gure was housed was spared
In the second year of the Taiqing period the statue again sweated greatly
In the eleventh month of the same year Hou Jings rebellion occurred
In the third year of the Dabao period the rebels were pacied
The monk Fajing and others of Changsha Temple came and took the gure back to Jiang ling returning it to its original temple
In the seventh year of the Dading period of the Later Liang dynasty  CE  the statue sweated again
In the second month of the following year Emperor Zhongzong  died
In the third year of the Tianbao period   CE  a re in the neighborhood reached Changsha Temple
The entire temple became like a tunnel and smoke and ames poured in from the four directions
The people wanted to rescue the miraculous gure but they feared that they did not have the means to move it
In order to move this statue previously it had always taken one hundred men
On that day however six people were able to move it
On the fteenth year of the Tianbao period  in order to worship it and repent his sins before it miracles occurred
In the twentythird year Emperor Ming died
His successor Xiao Zong moved the gure to Renshou Palace The statue again sweated heavily
In the second year of the Guangyun period   CE  Liang state was terminated
In the seventh year of the Kaihuang period the monk Faqian and others of Changsha Temple brought the statue back to the temple
In the fteenth year of the Kaihuang period Tian Zongxian Regional Inspector of Qianzhou came to the temple to worship and the gure immediately emitted light
Ispired to follow the Buddhist path he constructed the Great Northern Hall which was thirteen jian long
The wood used for constructing the hall was cut in a place over ve thousand miles upstream along the Jiang River
People transported the lumber to the river and threw the logs into the water at random
The logs owed downstream and when they reached Jingzhou they spontaneously stopped at the riverbank and would not go any further even when buffeted by strong winds and waves In the end the people took the logs out of the river and constructed the building
The pillars were three feet in diameter and the foundation stones were eight feet wide
This basic structure would never require any repair work any time in the future
The great hall was planked with fragrant wood
Thirteen treasure curtains decorated with gold and jewels hung securely inside the hall
Garlands of decorative owers were hung on every beam crossbeam and from the painted ceiling
The two wings to the east and west served as the residence for the miraculous statue
These wings were planked with rosewood and there were decorative curtains and lamps with ower decorations all made of pure gold
This hall was foremost in the entire world in its spaciousness and beauty
In the twelfth year of the Daye period several drops of sweat appeared on the miraculous gure
In that year Zhu Can raided several regions
He arrived at the city of Jingzhou and camped inside the temple grounds The Great Hall stood high in the northern suburb of the city
Bandits climbed to the top of the hall and shot arrows at the defending army in the city
The defending army was troubled by this so at night they shot back with aming arrows and burned the temple down
The monks and laypeople in the city were greatly distressed by this mourning the destruction of the miraculous gure
During the night without alerting anyone outside the gure crossed over the city wall and stood outside the gate of Baoguan Temple
When morning came everyone in the city was delighted to see the statue standing there
After the bandits had left the townspeople inspected the place where the gure used to stand and discovered that nothing had burned there the ashes and cinders did not reach that place
A hall now stands there but it is not as impressive as the one that existed before this re
In the fth year of the Fengming period of the illegitimate Liang dynasty established by Xiao Xian  Yang Daosheng the illegitimate Prince of Song and others came to the temple to worship
The statue sweated heavily the moisture came down like rain and owed all over its head and torso and did not cease all day
In the ninth month of the same year Tang soldiers and horses advanced down along the river from the Shu area
On the twentieth day of the same month the monk Fatong of Temple believed that the empire was about to be unied by the Tang He circumambulated the gure requesting a miracle
That night the statue emitted light that lled the hall and the light remained until the twentyfth day when it began to dim slowly
On that day the soldiers and horses of the Prince of Zhaos commandery entered the city Because the gure wished to congratulate the arrival of the world of great harmony the light owed from it as an auspicious sign
During the months of drought there was always a response if the prime minister and the regional governor sincerely prayed to the gure
In the sixth month of the sixth year of the Zhenguan period there was a great drought
Wu Wa Duke Yingguo and the area commanderinchief sent for the statue to be brought to their quarters sponsored a vegetarian banquet and circumambulated the gure for seven days
Higherand lowerranking ofcials stood before the statue and concentrated their minds and rain poured down
That years harvest was excellent
The commanderinchief donated gold to repair the giltwork of the miraculous gure
Carriages banners owers and other decorations were also provided for the statue
At the present time the gure is in Changsha Temple in Jiangling
In that temple there is also a foreignmade copper image over seven feet in height
It is ancient and unusual but it has been neglected
This is the gure that was sent from Changan to Dharma Master Daoan who was at Mount Shicheng
He ordered a disciple to look for a piece of relic in its topknot
Light emanated from this gure Ji shenzhou sanbao gantong lu II T
Zhou Ji of the Eastern Jin styled Xuanpei was from Yangxian in Yixing
He was the second son of the General for the Pacication of the West Chu
He attained the rank of Governor of Wuxing
For generations his family had worshiped the Buddha and his daughter was particularly pious
Servants went shing and suddenly saw the river lled with golden light
Following the light upstream and dropping a net they obtained a golden gure over three feet tall
Austere in appearance it oated upright on the water
The people pulled and pushed but could not move it
They returned quickly to report the event to Zhou Ji
He spoke to his daughter and then ordered that his daughter be taken on a boat to welcome the image
Seeing the gure from a distance her heart was lled with joy She paid respect and then made a gesture of pulling the gure with her hand in this way she was able to bring the statue onto the boat
She brought it home and made offerings to it
At night she dreamed that the Buddha had an ache in his left knee
When she woke up she examined the statues knee and found a hole
She repaired the spot with gold metal from her hairpin
Later Zhou Ji arranged for his daughter to marry Zhang Cheng in Wu Commandery
The statue followed her by itself people said that it followed Lady Zhang
She later died and at that time she was seen on top of the city wall looking even more beautiful than usual
Many people both within and outside the city saw her
Suddenly a purple cloud came down to her and she went upward in the sky beyond the reach of the eye
The great grandson of Zhang Cheng took part in the military expedition to pacify Sun Ens rebellion
Religious matters had long been neglected at home and no one noticed that the gure had disappeared and only the halo was left behind
When they discovered this the entire family repented praying for the statues return
An old woman came and sold them an image offering it for a very low price
Realizing that it was the gure that used to be in the familys home they wished to employ the woman but she had disappeared
The statue eventually got lost and only the halo remains with the Zhang family
The wooden image at Lingbao Temple in Shanyin in Kuaiji was made by Dai Kui a critic of the state who refused to serve in government
Dai Kui thought that the images made in the recent past were almost all clumsy and failed to move the hearts of those who wished to honor them
He had always maintained spiritual purity and was also very clever
To produce a new design he compared a wide range of examples and thought it through very carefully and after many years he succeeded in producing this statue
None of the images that were produced in China matched the beauty of this gure
When they looked up and saw it the monks nuns and laypeople suddenly felt as if they had encountered the living Buddha
Chi Xibin of Gaoping picked up some incense and uttered a spell If life is permanent let me see the holy face of the living Buddha if impermanent I wish to meet him in Maitreyas presence The incense he had picked up spontaneously began to burn in his hand and the fragrant smoke rose straight up as far as the eye can see reaching the very edge of the clouds
The fragrance remained everywhere in the temple
The monks nuns and laypeople at that time were all inspired by this
At the present time the image is at Jiaxiang Temple in Yuezhou
In the second year of the Taiyuan period the monk Zhi Huihu made a golden ākya image six zhang tall at Shaoling Temple in Wu Commandery
He carved out a hole high up on the south side of the temple to serve as the mold for casting the gure He nished casting and was about to remove the statue from the hole
In the middle of the night the hole had become illuminated and six owers appeared
They were bright white in color and their petals uttered everywhere as they fell but before they reached the ground they gathered together and rose up
At dawn a white cloud like smoke came out of the hole
Inside the cloud a white dragon appeared
It was ten zhang long brilliantly colored and moved slowly around the hole
Every time it came before the gure it looked up at it and moved deliberately as if paying respect to the image
At that time there was a lull in the wind and the sun was shining yet a ne rain came down adding to the fragrance of the air
When the gure was placed on its seat the dragon rose up into the sky
In the rst year of the Yuanjia period Dai Yong a critic of the state who refused to serve in government disliked the old and clumsy style of the gure so he altered the hands and face to make it look like the living Buddha
He is said to have shortened the part above the shoulder by six inches and the part below the feet by one inch Ji shenzhou sanbao gantong lu II T ca
In the rst year of Yixi period of the Eastern Jin  Minister of Education Wang Mi was staying at the Dongye Gate
Someone at the ofce saw a vecolored light appearing on the ground to the east of the gate
Surprised he dug and found an oldfashioned copper plate and under the plate there was a golden gure four feet tall and both the halo and base were there
The statue was also like Sun Haos Aśoka image
Consequently the gure was brought inside the palace and worshiped
The founding ruler of the Song dynasty originally was quite unsympathetic to the Buddhist faith but when he obtained this statue he paid respect to it with great joy and himself performed rites for it
The gure was originally at Waguan Temple and was said to have been later moved to Longguang Temple
Ji shenzhou sanbao gantong lu II Ta ref Gaoseng zhuan Tb The story of the image of Mañjuśrī Bodhisattva at Mount Lu is as follows
Once there was a famous minister called Tao Kan styled Shixing
In Nanhai in Jiany
a sherman saw light near the seacoast and reported it to Tao Kan
Tao Kan sent someone to look for the light who saw a golden image suddenly come riding on the waves and it arrived at the side of the boat
When the inscription was examined it said that the image was of Mañjuśrī Bodhisattva and had been produced by King Aśoka
According to an ancient tradition when King Aśoka governed the Indian subcontinent he ordered a ghost king to set up a very cruel prison
Mañjuśrī appeared in the cauldron and even though the re was blazing the boiling water became clear and a blue lotus ower appeared
King Aśoka moved by this sight destroyed the hellish prison on that very day
He built eightyfour thousand stupas and produced the same number of images The image discovered by the sherman was one of those produced at that time
Although Tao Kan did not believe in the Buddhist teaching of karmic retribution he was greatly pleased with the discovery and sent the image to Hanqi Temple in Wuchang
Later Tao Kan was transferred to Jingzhou and sent for the image
Dozens of strong men could not move the image even though earlier it had taken only several people to lift it
More people were added and the image was dragged by a special carriage but as soon as the image was moved aboard the boat it capsized and sank
Tao Kans messenger related these events to him and he permitted the image to be returned to the temple
Two or three people could then move the image
The monk Huiyuan honored the image and with proper ceremony invited it to Mount Lu the image was moved there without any difculty
This was because of the miraculous spirit that had descended on Huiyuan
A popular saying resulted from this
Tao Kan is a hero of the sword
The image is marked by spirit The one soars like a cloud while the other dwells in mud
How great is the distance between them At the end of the Sui period rebels appeared and the monks of the community on Mount Lu were dispersed
An old monk whose name has now been lost went to the miraculous image to take his leave and the image spoke to him saying that the monk was old and that he should stay
The monk followed the order and stayed
When the rebel soldiers led by Dong Daochong attacked Jiangzhou some of the soldiers entered the temple to look for valuable objects
They caught the old monk and demanded objects made of gold
The monk refused to give anything to them so they were about to punish him by roasting him alive
The monk said I have lived seventy years and never disobeyed the Buddhas teaching
Wait until I enter the meditative state and stretch my neck and then you can let fall your sword The soldier agreed and when he saw the old monk stretch out his neck to receive the sword he lowered the sword but instead of cutting the monks neck the sword pierced the soldiers heart and its point penetrated through his back
The other soldiers ed in fright and went to Huiyuans grave
At that time the sky was clear and the sun was bright but suddenly clouds covered the sky and it darkened thunder roared lightning struck all around and six soldiers were killed
Many people in the Jiangzhou area had hidden their valuable household objects on the mountain but because of this incident the rebel soldiers did not dare to go into the mountains any more though they plundered mercilessly in the suburbs of Jiangzhou
At the present time the image is housed in a multistoried pavilion in Donglin Temple
During the Wude period a strong wind caused the building to lean toward the north
The usual methods for restoring the balance of the building were of no avail
The monks at the temple then requested the mountain deity to blow a strong wind that would correct the buildings balance
Shortly afterward a strong wind blew from the north and restored the original and correct form of the pavilion
Ji shenzhou sanbao gantong lu II Tbc ref Gaoseng zhuan Tc Wei Dynasty The story of the image that appeared on a mountain that opened in Liangzhou is as follows
In the rst year of the Taiyen period under Emperor Taiwu of the Northern Wei dynasty  a monk of Lishi Master Liu Sahe whose biography is found in the biographical collection traveled in the region south of the Jiang River and paid respect to the stupa in the Mao district
When he reached the capital city Jinling he discovered the relics distributed by King Aśoka
Having completed his work Liu Sahe traveled westward to a place one hundred and seventy miles west of Liangzhou east of the border of Fanhe Commandery
He looked toward the valley and mountain and bowed toward it from a distance
People did not understand the meaning of this act
Liu Sahe said An image of the Buddha will appear at this cliff
If the image is complete there will be peace in the world if some part is missing people will suffer from disorder in the world Eightyseven years later in the rst year of the Chengguang period  CE
 strong winds rainstorms and thunder shook the mountain and a stone image appeared one zhang and eight chi tall
Its appearance was appropriately aweinspiring but the head was missing
People selected an appropriate piece of rock and had a stonemason carve a separate head which they placed on top of the body of the stone gure but the head would always fall off
Buddhism declined steadily under the Northern Wei as predicted by Liu Sahe
In the rst year of Northern Zhou rule  in a creek seven li east of the city of Liangzhou a piece of rock emitted light and illumined both the dark and light areas around it
Those who saw this found it extraordinary
The rock was the head of Liu Sahes gure
When they placed it on the stone statue the head and the body matched perfectly
The gure stood without a head for over forty years and its head and the body were found over two hundred li apart
When the part of its form that had been missing was restored owing light appeared and the sound of bells was heard but nobody knew where they came from
In the rst year of the Baoding period a temple called Ruixiang was established at this site
During the Jiande period as the persecution of Buddhism was about to begin the head of the stone gure fell off again
Emperor Wu sent the Prince of Qi to conrm the sign
He placed the head back on the neck of the gure and stationed soldiers to guard it
When morning came the head had fallen off again
The sign predicting the persecution of the Dharma and the fall of the dynasty was thus received in this way
Details are found in Shi Daoans inscription
Even though the Northern Zhou persecuted the followers of the Buddhist teaching no harm came to this gure
During the Kaihuang period the teaching was promoted again and the temple was reestablished as it was before the persecution
In the fth year of the Daye period Emperor Yang led a military expedition to the west and he came to worship the gure and changed the name of the temple to Gantong Daochang
The stone gure still exists at the present time
Many people have attempted to draw it but its size changes constantly and its image cannot be captured in a copy
Ji shenzhou sanbao gantong lu II Tc ref Xu Gaoseng zhuan Tca Northern Liang Dynasty The story of the auspicious plaster image on a rock cliff in Liangzhou is as follows
At one time in the past in the rst year of the Longan period during the reign of Emperor An of the Jin dynasty Juqu Mengsun occupied the region around Liangzhou for more than thirty years
Among the ve kingdoms called Liang in the Longxi region his was the most powerful and the ruler devoted himself to meritmaking construction projects
City buildings temples and stupas do not last forever
Ancient palaces burn down in the end This is bound to be the outcome of building temples and palaces
Furthermore treasures of gold and jewels are stolen in the end
Thinking thus the king looked around him at the mountains that reached to the sky
One hundred li south of the city was a long line of cliffs running in an eastwest direction to points unknown
So Juqu Mengsun excavated caves and placed images some of rock and some of plaster of numerous different gures
Worshipers were astounded by these images
There were holy monks made of clay that looked human
They constantly practiced walking meditation never stopping to rest
If you saw them from a distance they looked as if they were walking but when observed up close they were stationary yet their faces looked as if they were walking
There were also stretches of ground where people looked for footsteps
When observers were at a distance from them the images walked on the grounds footsteps were clearly visible coming and going ceaselessly
These phenomena have now lasted for over a hundred years
This is what the local people reported
Mengsun Prince of Hexi built a stone gure six zhang tall at a mountain temple and worshiped it
In the sixth year of the Yuanxi period of the Song he sent his heir Xingguo to attack Fuhan but they suffered a massive defeat
When Xingguo was killed Mengsun directed his anger at Buddhism accusing it of having no spiritual efcacy
He ordered the destruction of temples and expelled monks
Mengsun later went to Mount Yangshu and many monks stood at the roadside 
Seeing the monks from a distance Mengsun became enraged and immediately slaughtered several of them At that time a soldier happened to enter the temple to worship the stone gure and saw it weeping shedding copious tears
Taken aback the soldier reported this
Hearing this Mengsun hurried over to see and when he reached the temple gate his body trembled in fear as if he was a criminal
He called his attendants to support him on both sides and proceeded
When he saw the gure weeping tears like a spring he bowed his head to the ground and asked for pardon admitting his great crimes
He immediately held a great banquet even more elaborate than those he had held before and invited the monks to resume their practice
If we observe Mengsuns faith we see that it did not reach very deep
He engaged in warfare and murder in order to annex territory
The Buddha prohibited such activities
Mengsun had to transform his nature but if left to his own devices he would not have stopped committing crimes He initially honored the Buddhist teaching and when Dharmakṣema translated the Great Nirvana Sutra he vowed to follow him in life and death but then he became angry over a minor matter and sent an assassin to murder Dharmakṣema Now he blamed the Buddha and the sangha for the failure of his military expedition destroying temples and persecuting monks Once excessive misconduct is committed even if one later abandons it and returns to moderate behavior he or she cannot entirely compensate for the sins of their former misconduct

Discouraged he prayed for its return diligently from early morning to late at night
Five years later at dawn he saw a light at the buddha images seat that reached to the ceiling beams
Shizhi then burned incense opened the curtain around the seat and saw the lost image gravely sitting there
In the twelfth year of the Yuanxi period  Liu Yuanzhi a man from Changshan in Dongyang whose family farmed potatoes was burning the ground to prepare it for planting
He noticed that every time he set the re the grass in one corner did not burn
After a while he became curious and stopped the work to clear the eld for planting
Later he carefully dug around and obtained a bronze sitting image over three cun tall
He looked up the history of the area it had not been a part of any city in the old days
He thus had no idea where the image had come from
In the fourteenth year of the Yuanxi period  Sun Yanzengs family had followed the Buddhist teaching for generations
His wife Wang Huicheng had been an ardent believer since she was young
Her faith strengthened as she grew up and she recited the Lotus Sutra
Once she saw a light of mixed colors at the beach and ordered the ground to be dug up there
Two feet deep in the ground she found a golden image which was two chi and one cun tall including its halo and base
The inscription on the base read Produced by Faxin and Sengxing both monks at an ofcial monastery in the sixteenth year of Jianwu cyclical designation gengzi   In the fteenth year of the Yuanxi period  when Luo Shun was the Arbiter General of the West he camped at Shangming
In the twelfth month he released a hunting eagle in the eld and his attendants saw the eagle catch a pheasant and both came down
Then a re started and burned everything in the eld but the re left untouched a spot three zhang long
When they examined the unburned spot they found a golden image of a sitting bodhisattva one chi tall including the base of exceptionally highquality craftsmanship
At that time the Director of Dingxiang said that it was something a thief must have hidden and he looked for a temple from which an image had been stolen but no temple had lost an image
Eventually he brought the image in and provided care for it
Ji shenzhou sanbao gantong lu II T When Prince Kang of Linquan of the Inner Guard was stationed in the city of Jingzhou he constructed a hall with three chambers to house images for worship
Graphic representations of bodhisattvas were painted on many of the walls in the hall
When Prince Wen of Hengyang replaced him in that ofce he turned the hall into sleeping quarters and the paintings were plastered over
When the plaster dried however the paintings appeared through the plaster in clear and bright colors
The plaster was reapplied but the result was the same
The prince who was not a follower of Buddhism said that it was merely an accident and ordered the plaster to be reapplied thickly once more yet the paintings came through clearly again
The prince then ordered the old wall to be destroyed and reconstructed thoroughly
Shortly afterward Prince Wen fell ill and as soon as he closed his eyes he saw the images standing crowded together everywhere
For this reason he gave up the idea of turning the buddha hall into his sleeping chamber and generously sponsored vegetarian feasts and lectures
During the Yuanxi period the younger sister of Zhang Seng ding who lived on a tributary of the Changjiang River in Jiangling honored the Buddhas teaching even as a young child and she wished to renounce the householders life
She constantly made offerings to a small golden image considering it the support on which she would rely in her future monastic life
The parents pressed her to marry but she remained rm in her resolve Nevertheless her parents secretly arranged for her to marry someone with the surname Bing
The daughter was at rst unaware of this arrangement but when the gifts of a lamb and a goose part of the ceremonial invitation for a new wife arrived she screamed in despair and refused to go
As she burned incense and prostrated herself on the ground saying that she would rather take her own life the image emitted golden light which increased in brightness to ll the entire village
Her father and elder brother were taken aback by this miracle and gave up their plan to marry her off
Both the Zhang and Bing families became great supporters of Buddhism
Because of this event Sengding became a monk
The Prince of Nanchun CounselorinChief under the Song who was based at Shan turned his residence into a temple for him
During the Taishi period He Jingshu of Tonghai who had honored the Buddhas teaching from his youth followed Liu Yun Regional Inspector of Xiangzhou to his assigned post to serve as a district supervisor
He accidentally came into possession of some sandalwood and had it carved into an image
The image was nearly completed but it lacked a halo
He looked hard for suitable material but could not nd it
As he sat leaning against a desk seemingly haven fallen asleep he saw a monk dressed in a monks robe of rags and holding a zinc staff who said Sandalwood is unobtainable and coarse wood is not suitable for this purpose
There is a shield made of paulownia wood in the He family residence behind the district ofce This can be used to make the halo
Though they will be unwilling to part with it if you are persistent you can obtain it When He Jingshu woke up he asked his attendants and learned that what the monk had said was true
So he offered to buy the paulowniawood shield
The head of the He family said We do have this shield which we love dearly
Out of fear of it being stolen we have never shown it to anyone
How did you learn about it and immediately come to buy it Jingshu told him the story
The head of the He family was delighted and offered the shield to be turned into the halo 
Later when Jingshu worked in the regional ofce of Xiangzhou the image appeared in the middle of the night in a dream and said A mouse bit my foot At dawn he returned home quickly and found that this had happened to the image
Qi Dynasty During the Jianyuan period the Piyeli Temple in Fanyu had an old stone image from the state of Funan 
Its origin was unknown and its appearance was quite unusual
Seventy or eighty people were needed to move it
This temple had a thatched roof
A re broke out and came near the temple which happened to be downwind 
The smoke and ames almost reached the temple
Over a dozen nuns at the temple looked at each other not knowing what to do
Among them were some who could not bear standing by helplessly and three or four of them attempted to lift the image
The image rose easily seeming to weigh less than the stone weight of the scale
After the image had been moved elsewhere the temple building burned down
The image often emitted light When the area was about to be invaded by soldiers the image would suddenly emit tears and sweat would ow all over its body
People in the Lingnan area took these signs as reliable oracles
Later Regional Inspector Liu Quan sent the image accompanied by a memorial to the capital city
The image likely is now in a temple in Jiangzhou or the former southern capital Jiankang
Song Dynasty Wang Zhongde Regional Inspector of Xuzhou built a golden image eight zhang tall at Songwang Temple in Pengcheng Its features were beautiful
This was one of the most marvelously crafted images in the region upstream of the Jiang River
At times when barbarous soldiers appeared along the northern border or when catastrophes aficted the monastic community the image would sweat The amount of sweat corresponded to the gravity of the difculty
People in the commandery relied on these signs of the image as oracles
In the beginning of the Jianyuan period of the Qi  CE  the image again sweated
In the winter of that year Wei soldiers appeared above the Huai River
At that time private armies were organized in several commanderies around Yanzhou and a very large number of soldiers gathered
Monks were also forced to participate in the war against the Wei army The Wei army destroyed their defenses and was about to wipe out the opposing army
In its report to the Wei court the Wei army criticized the monks for their role in assisting in the rebellion and the monks were soon to be executed
At that time the image sweated greatly and the oor of the image hall became damp
The Prince of Liang who was serving as the regional inspector of Xuzhou under the Wei was a pious Buddhist He came to the temple himself and ordered his attendant to wipe the image with a cloth
The sweat poured forth ceaselessly even as the image was being wiped
Even when several dozens of people joined in drying off the image the sweat still kept pouring forth
The prince then burned incense and taking up a piece of cloth said The monks are not guilty and I swear to protect them so that they will not be harmed
If there really is a miraculous response to this oath the sweat will cease when I wipe the image Having spoken the prince wiped the image and indeed as he touched the image with the cloth it became dry
The prince presented a detailed report of this to the court and the monks were all pardoned by imperial edict
Qi Dynasty At the beginning of the Jingyuan period  Wang Yan of Taiyuan still a young boy received the ve precepts from Dharma Master Xian at Jiaoji and was given a golden image of Avalokiteśvara to take care of
He took the image with him when he returned to the capital city Yangdu and stayed at Nanjian Temple
Yan took a nap and saw the image standing at the corner of its seat
Alarmed he ran quickly to it and brought it to his room
In the evening of that day over ten images were stolen from Nanjian Temple destined to be melted down and turned into coins
In the fall of the seventh year of the Daming period the image emitted light that reached beyond three feet
It shined brilliantly in golden color and everyone saw this
Later the image was kept at Duobao Temple
Yan went to the Jing and Chu areas and spent nearly ten years there
He did not know of the images location 
When he returned to Yangdu he dreamed he saw the image clearly among the small images in the eastern part of the buddha hall
Early the next morning he went to the temple and found the image in the place where he had seen it in his dream
This took place on the thirteenth day of the seventh month of the rst year of the Jianyuan period For this reason in the Authors Preface to the Mingxiang ji  Yan says
I myself take care of this image all the time forever as a guide
As I tell this story again I am deeply moved
Because of this miracle I compiled this record
In mirroring reality and making it accessible to ordinary emotions nothing surpasses the image
The source of image miracles can for the most part be attributed to this fact
The scripture says Molten or carved or drawn painted on silk the images that reproduce the form  all can move and emit light In the Western Region images of ākyamuni and Maitreya emit light miraculously Is it because they reproduce the Buddhas form
In China light gathers as a clear sign of cosmic responses
Furthermore in recent years people affected by cosmic responses have seen marvelous effects in wood and stone
These effects cannot necessarily be attributed to the appearances of the images
Thus when the heavy stone oated on deep  this marked the beginning of the Buddhist teaching in the Min and Wu areas
made of molten gold dust predicted calamities at Song Temple in Peng
There are numerous other examples Although it is difcult to discuss this in detail the main message may be reduced to this
The meaning of stupa miracles is also similar
The subjects differ but the message is consistent Therefore I appended them at the end 
Liang Dynasty On the eighth day of the rst month of the rst year of the Tianjian period  Emperor Wu founder of the Liang dynasty had a dream in which a sandalwood image entered his kingdom
As a consequence an announcement was made calling for volunteers to go on an expedition to seek for the image
According to the Fo you tianzhu ji and the twofascicle version of the Youtianwang jing  the Buddha ascended to the Heaven of the Thirtythree Gods and preached to his mother
King Udayana sent thirtytwo carpenters and some sandalwood and requested Mahāmaudgalyāyana to use his supernatural power to produce an image of the Buddha
Mahāmaudgalyāyana accomplished the mission and returned with a sitting image ve chi in height which was placed in Jetavana Temple and is still worshiped now
Emperor Wu wanted to bring this image to his kingdom
General He Qian Xie Wenhua and others altogether eighty people responded to the announcement calling for volunteers
When they arrived and presented the request the king of rāvastī said This is a heavenly image
It cannot be sent to a distant region He then ordered the thirtytwo carpenters to carve another image
The carvers and the image became one and the work that began at six oclock in the morning was completed by noon
All primary and secondary marks of the Buddha were there and the crown of the image emitted light
A ne rain came down and an extraordinary fragrance pervaded the air
The Fo you tianzhu ji says When the Buddha disappeared two images appeared one after another and widely and greatly beneted sentient beings He Qian and others brought the second image across tens of thousands of miles overcoming many difculties that are difcult to report in detail
Again they crossed the great ocean going through wind and waves Sometimes the waves were like mountains and their food supply was exhausted
Many of the people who had come to look for the image as well as those who were sent to accompany them died
Once they encountered ferocious beasts and they concentrated their minds on the Buddha
They then heard the sound of armor behind the image
They also heard the sound of a bell
There was a monk on the side of a rock sitting straight under a tree
Qian climbed up carrying the image and placed it before the monk
The monk rose and paid respect to the image
Qian and the others paid respect to the monk
The monk handed them a container of water and let them drink from it All were satised
The monk said This image is called the Correctly Enlightened One
King Kumbhīra will accompany it from here to the destination performing this service for this Buddha
That night everyone dreamed of a god and in the morning they all drew his picture together
On the fth day of the fourth month of the tenth year of the Tianjian period  He Qians group arrived at Yangdu
The emperor accompanied by a large number of ofcials traveled forty miles outside of the city and welcomed the image to Daijidian Hall in the palace
A vegetarian feast was held new monks were ordained and a large number of criminals were pardoned
Weapons were transformed into lotus ower decorations around stupas
The emperor ate only vegetarian meals
Emperor Wu passed away in the third year of the Taiqing period 
The Prince of Xiangdong reestablished the dynasty in Jiangling changing the era name to Chengsheng
The new emperor sent for the image in Yangdu and placed and worshiped it in Chengguangdian Hall in the new capital city of his dynasty Jingdu
In the eighth year of the Later Liang dynasty Daming Temple was built in the Jingling cemetery north of the city
The image was then sent there where it still exists
Many copies of this image are circulated in the capital city
At the beginning of the Tianjian period  when Emperor Wu of the Liang dynasty donated his residence to be turned into Guangzhai Temple he produced a golden image eight zhang in height
The drawing for the image was completed with correct measurements but when the casting was about to begin people feared that there would not be enough copper
They thought to present a request to the court when suddenly a messenger accompanied by fteen carriages lled with copper arrived saying that the emperor was presenting them to the temple
Immediately they melted the metal and the image was produced in one casting
It was the most marvelous in the entire kingdom but it seemed to grow larger
When the people measured it it was taller by two zhang and two chi
This was reported to the court
The casting had been done and the mold had not been changed
All the copper that was sent had been used
They measured the gures height again and it had increased by four chi
The edict read We did not sent any more copper How could this happen
The image must have miraculously shown its mysterious quality
Produce a base decorated with owers and record this miracle Thereupon the story of this miracle was composed and carved below the feet of the image
The inscription still exists today
Emperor Wu the founding ruler of the Liang dynasty also produced for his father the large image at Daaijing Temple on Mount Zhong
Supernatural signs appeared
Further details of the image are found elsewhere
Many image miracles occurred under the reign of the Liang dynasty
The large rock image in Shan district originated during the Song dynasty
It was produced by a prince
Earlier Meditation Master Tanguang had come from the north where he dwelled in seclusion following the mountains and rivers
He saw the beauty of the mountains and built a small grass hut on a peak
He heard heavenly music and a voice in the sky saying This place belongs to the Buddha
Why have you planted a kitchen garden here Tanguang then moved southward to Mount Tiantai
Later he began to carve a buddha image
He worked for many years but could not complete it
At one time Prince Jianan of the Liang became ill and he dreamed he was told that his illness would be cured if he completed carving the rock image in Shan district
Then Vinaya Master Sengyou was asked to carry out this work
He came to the mountain but was displeased with the earlier design of the image considering it to be crude
While he was still thinking about this at night the mountain suddenly collapsed burying over two hundred people An image appeared inside the mountain
The image was still buried inside the rock up to its chin but when a chisel was applied the pieces of rock over the image came off easily and eventually the body of the gure was uncovered
When all the pieces were removed all the images features were shown to be there
Thus the image must have existed all the time and had reappeared when the chisel was briey applied
Liu Xie Secretary to the Heir Apparent of the Liang composed the inscription in front of the image
After he ascended the throne Founding Emperor Wu of the Liang dynasty honored Buddhism and neglected Daoism frequently inviting eminent Buddhist monks to lecture on the profound teaching
He also produced two images in gold and silver and placed them in Chongyundian Hall worshiping them from morning to evening for over fty years
From winter to summer he kept up this practice at all times of the day
The pattern of his ten toes appeared on the places where his feet touched the stone
Even after he lost his throne usurped by Hou Jing he continued to make offerings to the images
DefenderinChief Wang Sengbian removed Hou Jing and repaired the capital city
At that time Emperor Yuan was conquered in Jiangling and the region south of the Jiang River was left without the ruler
Wang Sengbian then contacted the kingdom of Qi and brought the Marquis of Zhenyang Xiao Yuanming and made him emperor
At that time the region around the lower part of the Jiang River was unsettled and conicting powers sought advantages over each other
Wang Sengbian had a soninlaw Du Kan who guarded the palace gate
Du Kan was cruel in nature and was not concerned about future rebirths
He wanted to destroy the two images and turn them into sheet metal
He rst sent several dozens of people to climb the Sanxiu Pavilion and chisel at the base of the images necks
When they started pounding the chisel the two images simultaneously turned their heads to look at the workers
The workers arms fell to their sides and they could not raise them
They were dumbfounded and it was as if they were drunk Du Kan was also in the same condition
After a long while they woke up
They were then beaten up and their bodies were covered with bruises
They saw frightening guardian deities come rushing toward them to strike them
Screaming from pain they got up but their bodies had rotted
Pus and blood owed out through their skin and with their bones exposed they died
This was a recent occurrence known to monks and nuns as well as to laypeople
Yuan Wei dynasty In the Tianping period  Sun Jingde a volunteer soldier in Dingzhou produced a golden image of Avalokiteśvara while he was stationed at the garrison in Beichui
When his term of service ended he returned home but continued to worship the image
Later he was accused of extortion and imprisoned in the capital city He could not stand the torture and questioning and confessed to the false charge
He was immediately sentenced to death
The night before the execution he paid respect to the image shedding tears that poured down like rain
He said It must be because I have wronged others in previous lives that I am now unjustly punished
I vow to make amends for past sins and promise not to repeat them He is also said to have made the great vow and spoke many more words
A short while after he nished speaking he saw vaguely as if in a dream a monk who taught him to recite Avalokiteśvaras Salvation Scripture
If he recited the name of the buddha that appears in this scripture one thousand times he would be saved from suffering
Jinde suddenly woke up
Sitting up he recited without error the scripture and recited the buddhas name one hundred times before dawn broke
When the ofcials bound him up and took him to the marketplace he kept on reciting and by the time the execution was to take place he had completed reciting the name one thousand times
Just as the sword was lowered it broke into three pieces and did not harm his body
They got another sword and tried to behead him again
The sword had to be replaced three times but all of them broke just like the rst
Ofcials witnessing the execution marveled at this and reported the events to the court
Prime Minister Gao Huan presented the matter to the emperor who stayed the execution and ordered the scripture to be copied for transmission
The scripture is now known as the Avalokiteśvara Scripture of King Gao 
After his release Jinde hosted a vegetarian feast
He brought out the image he had made at the garrison and saw that there were three sword marks on it
His relatives and others from his village all saw this too and marveled at the miracle
This appears in the Gazetteer of Qi and other records such as the Presentation of Extraordinary Occurrences Chen Dynasty When Emperor Wu died his elder brothers son Chen Qian succeeded him
Chen Qian wished to conduct the funeral and had to make the vehicle on which the deceased emperor would be transported The reign had changed recently and it was not yet rmly established
Earlier Emperor Wu of the Liang dynasty had built Chongyundian Hall and the scriptures and images in this hall were decorated with rare treasures unparalleled in other states in their beauty
Although the mandate had shifted to the Chen dynasty the images were still in the hall
Qian wanted to use the curtains and other jewels presented to these two images for the funeral of the deceased emperor
Workers were found for the task and when they arrived at the hall from all four directions they saw clouds gather and circle around the buddha hall even though there were no clouds elsewhere
People found this very strange and came running to see it
Shortly after a heavy rain fell with thunder and lightning strikes
Smoke rose from the decorative tiles of the roof and lightning illumined the cloud
The light oated up and down like a ame
Suddenly people saw a vision of Chongyundian Hall and the two images rose up high along with the guardian deities and the treasure seat and ew up into the sky amid the smoke and re
The large gathering of people who saw this became believers
After the storm people went back to the site of the images and discovered that only their stone foundations remained
Several months later people came from Dongzhou and reported that on that day the gures were seen ying in the sky over the ocean
Sometimes people still see the images when they look across the ocean
It is also said that the pagoda of Yongning Temple in the Northern Wei capital rose one thousand chi above the ground and was shaken by gods
Roughly the same thing also happened to its image
Some people are said to have seen them in the Eastern Sea Ji shenzhou sanbao gantong lu II T
Northern Qi Dynasty Toward the end of the Northern Qi dynasty the monk Senghu of Lingshi Temple in Jinzhou was singleminded in following the Way but rather than cultivating the path of wisdom he made a vow to build a stone image eight zhang in height
The other monks all wondered how such a massive project could be carried out
Later in a valley to the north of his temple Senghu found a large rock eight zhang long He hired a stone carver who began the work of carving the image
The carver worked around the rock and nished roughly carving the front of the torso of the gure but the back was still uncarved and was sitting on the ground
The carver used six implements to try to lift the rock but he could not move it
Overnight the rock turned itself over
Seeing this in the morning Senghu was delighted
When the carving was nished he moved the image to the buddha hall
At the time that Jingzhou was about to fall  the image sweated and the water owed to the ground
The Zhou soldiers entered and burned down many Buddhist temples and this gure was also burned but its color did not change
Only two ngers of the gure were damaged
Soldiers later wanted to tear it down but even though more than sixty people and oxen pulled it would not move
Suddenly a strange monk appeared and built an uneven structure out of bricks and wood around the image
The monk completed the work quickly and then disappeared
The image later appeared in the dream of a pious layman and said I have pain in two ngers They realized what the gure meant and repaired the its damaged ngers
When the Sui dynasty came to power state support of Buddhism resumed
In the tenth year of the Kaihuang a thief stole the ag and parasol that decorated the image
The thief then dreamed that an eight zhangtall man came into his room and accused him Frightened the thief apologized for his crime
The gure still exists
Northern Zhou Dynasty In the third year of the Jiande period Emperor Wu r
 the realm under heaven
A man called Jiangming in Xuanzhou who was out patrolling at night saw light at the top of the mountain he was walking on located over one hundred li north of zhou
Puzzled he went to the source of the light and found a piece of rock shaped like a gure on the ground
He dug out the rock which turned out to be iron ore
It had resisted carving and therefore looked like a piece of ore three zhang tall and it could not be polished either
Jiangming dug further down and found an image base made of stone
The holes in the base tted the gure
He then gathered villagers to help raise the image which quickly oated up into the air and then came to rest on top of the base
People considered this to be a miracle and reported the discovery to the court
At that time the movement of heaven had reached the point where the calendar needed to be changed
So the name of the year was changed to the rst year of the Daxiang  period
The image was placed in Daxiang Temple
When the Sui dynasty renewed imperial support of Buddhism Jiangming renovated the temple and changed its name to Xianchusi
People went back to the place where the gure had originally been discovered and saw that neither large rocks nor metal ore existed in that remote location
It must have been the miraculous power of King Aśoka that had brought the image there
Consequently the name of the temple was kept by the great Tang dynasty 
Toward the end of the Zhenguan period a Daoist shrine called Yuhua was established west of the temple
The image was in its original location in a garden thirty li east of the temple
Emperor Taizong once went to worship the image but displeased by its lack of ornamentation he made donations to have it adorned
During the Yonghui period the Daoist shrine was turned into a Buddhist temple but its name was kept as Yuhua
At the present time the temple belongs to Fangzhou
At dusk in the evening miraculous light appears frequently
The monks and laypeople see this light all the time and are not surprised by it
The origin of the old wooden walking gure at Huayan Temple in Mount Xian in Xiangzhou is unknown
Its head is particularly beautiful and people never tire of gazing at it in admiration and worship
The image was over ve zhang tall
I will not repeat here the ancient stories of its miracles
During the persecution of Buddhism under the Northern Zhou someone removed and hid the head of the gure and it was brought out again when the proBuddhist Sui dynasty came into power
The head was adorned a sitting gure
was named Vairocana Buddha was constructed for it
Prayers were offered every year and where the gure stood became a place where people took refuge in Buddhism
Just before Emperor Wen of the Sui died the images nose started emitting mucus that ran down its chest gold leaf began to peel off and the owing mucus emitted light When people went to wipe away the mucus they could not nd any yet seen from a distance the mucus still appeared to be there
In the fourth month of the twentythird year of the Zhenguan period  CE
 the gures nose again started emitting mucus that ran down over its chest
The gure was about one chi wide and its shape was neither square nor circular
Emperor Taizong later died and then the people knew that the phenomenon had been an omen
In the sixth month the same thing occurred and everyone in the region was frightened not knowing what calamity was to follow
In the seventh month the Hanshui River ooded and the oodwaters came inside the city wall over one zhang deep many people drowned
The image is still in the original temple at the present time and many offer prayers to it
People in Xiangyang who have few children go to the image to pray thinking of a boy or a girl as they do so and there is a miraculous response Sui Dynasty During the Kaihuang period the buddha hall of Xing huang Temple in Jiangzhou burned down
In the hall were a large bronze gure  six zhang tall and facing south and two bodhisattva images both six zhang tall produced after Dai Yongs model
The re was so powerful that people watched helplessly crying out in grief The gure is melting away Suddenly the image rose up and took one step to the south just as the building collapsed
The gure was undamaged
Tiles and charred pieces of wood surrounded it on all sides at a distance of ve or six chi
Even though it had been touched by re the images golden color was unaffected
There was an inscription at the bottom of its base
The congregation marveled at this miracle and the sound of their vocal admiration of this lled the roads
The gure has now been moved to Baima Temple
Birds never alighted on it
In the second year of the Yonghui period under the Tang a thief attempted to steal the copper from the gure He sawed through the grille in the window and tried to pass through it but his arm got caught and he could not get through
In the morning the monks asked the thief what had happened and he said A person wearing a white robe grabbed my hand from inside the hall and however hard I tried I could not get free  The shadow image in the rock of Riyan Temple in the Sui capital city is octagonal in shape and the purple color of quartz
It is eight cun tall ve cun in diameter and transparent
In the past during the Taiqing period  CE  under the reign of Emperor Wu a monk from the Western Region had brought it
Then Hou Jings rebellion occurred and the rock was kept safely on top of the gure in Xilin Temple on Mount Lu in Jiangzhou
In the tenth year of the Kaihuang period  when the future Emperor Yang of the Sui dynasty was based in Yangzhou he sought widely for outstanding gures and images and gathered all written records in the region south of the Jiang River
He came across the account of this rock among miscellaneous records
Immediately he sent Wang Yanshou to the temple to search for it and obtained the rock
The prince frequently moved from place to place as his assignments changed and every time he traveled he always placed the rock in a black lacquered box and had it carried by horsemounted soldiers at the front of the traveling party
When the prince was appointed as crown prince he sent the rock to RiyanTemple in the capital city Changan under order to have it sealed so that outsiders would not be able to see it
Riyan Temple had been founded by the emperor
Toward the end of the Daye period the realm under heaven was in turmoil
Monks in the capital city frequently came to the temple to view the image was staying in the temple but he did not believe in its miraculous powers
Repeatedly he saw golden light shine inside the rock but it only vaguely looked like a buddha image to him
Then some eminent monks of different persuasions arrived and all said that they could clearly see the image in all its details and that the vision never disappeared
Daoxuan often deplored that he could not see any of this
He underwent a sevenday period of purication and confession and then went to look at the rock
First he saw a silver stupa and later he also saw a silver buddha
Monks nuns and laypeople who looked at the rock at the same time often saw different things in itsome saw buddhas stupas and bodhisattvas some saw monks sitting in rows some saw curtains parasols and banners some saw mountains forests and the eight kinds of beings some saw scenes of suffering in the three inferior realms of rebirth and some saw the reigns of seven ancient rulers rise and fall
When one observes the image sometimes it remains stable and sometimes it changes
While both evil and good visions appeared in mixed order good images predominated
Therefore those who came to pray in front of the rock all made a vow beforehand asking in what form and in what realm they would be reborn in their future rebirths
As they requested visions appeared and the people considered the rock to be a karmic mirror of the unknown dark realms of rebirths
In the seventh month of the sixth year of the Zhenguan period  by imperial edict the rock was brought to the palace and offerings were made to it
The story of the fourfaced buddha gure in the Shahe district temple in Xingzhou during the rule of the founding emperor of the Sui dynasty a man went into the mountains and saw a monk guarding a copper image over three chi tall When he asked the monk to give him the image the monk obliged him and then disappeared
Monks in many places who heard about this image tried to bring it down from the mountain but they could not lift it
When some monks of Shahe Temple pulled the image however it followed their hands and came to the temple
Later someone discovered a pile of gold near the temple the gold had the mark of two crows on it and an inscription that read For the purpose of plating the fourfaced image The gure was covered with gold and the crow marks appeared all over it
The image later disappeared suddenly
In the small stream running alongside the temple a shining light often appeared people looked for the source of the light and shed out of the stream
The last ruler of the Sui heard about the gure and sent metalworkers to make a copy of it but in the end they were unsuccessful
After working for over two hundred days they produced a copy but they later discovered aws in it and abandoned the project
Ji shenzhou sanbao gantong lu II T In the third year of the Kaihuang period the monk Faqing of Ningguan Temple began making a standing gure of ākyamuni one zhang and six chi tall
Faqing died before completing the image
On the same day another monk at Baochang Temple Dazhi also died
After three days Dazhi came back to life and reported to the monks in the temple Before King Yama I saw the monk Faqing who seemed to be very depressed
A little later I also saw the gure come before the king
The king ran down the steps with joined palms to pay respect to the image
The gure said to the king Faqing is creating me but the work is not yet complete
Why did you order him to die King Yama turned to an attendant and asked Is it time for Faqing to die The attendant answered His life should not end yet but the food has been exhausted Yama said Give him lotus leaves so that he can nish his meritorious work Suddenly everything disappeared After Dazhi had come back to life and related this story to the monks of his temple he then told them to go to Ningguan Temple to have a look
Shortly thereafter the monks saw Faqing come back to life
What he said matched perfectly with Dazhis story
After coming back to life Faqing always ate lotus leaves saying that this was delicious food
If he put any other type of food in his mouth he could not swallow it
He died several years after the gure was completed
Its features are perfect and it frequently emitted light
Although the temple has been abolished the gure still exists
Tang Dynasty During the Wude period a man called He Ji lived on the Ciwu River southwest of Fangzhou
This man had always been pious
He saw a group of deer on top of a mountain moving away but then coming back
Thinking this strange he dug under the spot where the deer had gathered and found a stone gure over one zhang and four chi tall
He Ji moved it down from the mountain to the village and the gure still exists at the present time
After it was moved the deer dispersed
According to the tradition passed on by the elders of the forty images hidden by the past Kāśyapa Buddha two have appeared but the others still remain hidden in the mountains
The shape of these gures is like that of the iron ore image found to the east of Yuhua Temple The iron ore gures should not be melted or cut apart
In the ninth month of the seventeenth year of the Zhenguan period  Li Xiyu CommanderinChief in Liangzhou was out on patrol and reached the border of the Changquan district southeast of the regional center
He found a carving on a rock altogether one hundred and ten characters which included phrases such as seven buddhas eight bodhisattvas and the buddha eld of superior fruits He reported the discovery to the court
An edict was issued to have it examined and the truth of Li Xiyus report was conrmed
One years tax income was returned to the local government in Liangzhou and prisoners were released
Twelve sets of buddhas footprints were discovered in the rocky mountains north of Xiangsi one hundred miles west of Yuzhou
The footprints were all more than three chi long one chi and one cun wide and nine cun deep
Inside them were sh patterns
They were located over ten steps north of the buddha hall and there were resident monks at the temple
Suddenly in the tenth month of the twentieth year of the Zhenguan period  lotus owers appeared inside the pool fed by a spring next to the temple The owers were bright red
The larger ones among them were three chi tall and faced each other and the stems looked as if they were weeping
When their tears reached the surface of the water they turned into owers
People oating back and forth on boats all marveled at the sight
The owers did not disappear for months
The name of the temple Xiangsi  was chosen because of this
According to one source this temple also existed in Fuzhou
The temple originally was impoverished but because of this miraculous gift it is now wealthy
In the past under the Qi dynasty brocade material appeared in the emperors well in Jingzhou
At that time people used this cloth in the same way as ordinary brocade
After months the material stopped appearing Thus the appearance of the lotus owers is not considered to be incredible
This story is found in the Qi chunqiu of Wu Jun and the Jingnan zhishuo of Xiao Cheng Thirty traces of buddha footprints were discovered in rock north of Lingkan Temple in Xingning Township located northeast of Xunzhou
The larger ones among them was less than ve chi long
Xunzhou was situated on a river two hundred miles in the eastwest direction and one hundred miles in the northsouth direction
The temple was very wealthy
There was a copper mine in the neighborhood
A kiln three chi square could produce over a hundred bronze pots with lids
They bore inscriptions that read Meritorious if given to temples calamities follow if given to secular establishments According to ancient local tradition during the Jin dynasty a northern monk lived on this mountain and while roaming across the great peaks he came to the site of the Buddhas footprints
There was a massive rock cave whose opening was covered thickly by beautiful owering plants bearing fruit
He spent the night there
The mountain deity appeared as a monster to frighten him but the monk was lofty and remained unmoved The deity said You cannot live here
Mountain ghosts come here frequently The monk looked far in the distance and saw a rocky mountain that reached the clouds and blocked the sun
When he went there and climbed it he saw that below it there was a cliff that was impossible to ascend from below
He returned to Xingning and told the people about the mountain
During the Song dynasty two monks who had heard that earlier attempts to reach the location had failed courageously embarked on a search for it
These monks recited the Lotus Sutra followed the precepts strictly and were capable of overpowering supernatural beings
A supernatural being appeared and accepted the precepts from them along with all the members of his clan
When they looked in the distance they saw an extraordinary light above a cliff
They were separated from it by a chasm over one zhang wide
The monks used a piece of wood to cross the chasm and found ten pieces of the miraculous Buddhas footprint in the color of human esh marked on the surface of the rock
In the third year of the Zhenguan period another footprint appeared which emitted light and bore the sign of a wheel
Those who have seen them disagreed on the number of pieces
Therefore shrines were built to house these miraculous objects
People visit the original sites
During the Song dynasty the royal family donated an orchard to be turned into a temple
This is now the old temple building that still stands at the site
Li Daan who was from the Longxi region was the older brother of Daliang who served as Minister of Works
During the Wude period Daliang was appointed Area CommanderinChief of Yuezhou
From the capital city Daan went out to investigate the area
Daliang sent several servants to accompany his brother
On the way back they reached Luqiao in Guzhou and stayed at a hostel
Among his servants was a man who plotted to murder Daan
This servant waited until Daan was deeply asleep after midnight and he pushed a dagger through Daans neck
The blade of the dagger touched the oor
The servant then ed without pulling the dagger out
Daan screamed calling out for his servants
Those among the servants who were not against him were about to pull the dagger out
Daan said As soon as you pull the dagger out I will die
I must rst write something on a piece of paper By the time he was nished writing the district ofcial had also arrived
So they pulled the dagger out cleansed the wound and applied medicine
Then Daan lost consciousness
Suddenly as if in a dream a creature over one chi long and four or ve cun wide shaped like a piece of pigs esh appeared
Floating over two chi above the ground it came in through the door and went to Daans bed
A voice was heard from within the creature saying Quickly return my esh Daan said I do not eat pork
Why would I owe anything to you Thereupon a voice was heard from outside the door There has been a mistake The creature then went out the door
Daan then saw a pond in the front yard
It was clear and shallow and very beautiful Above the western bank of the pond was a golden gure about ve cun tall
After a short while it slowly grew in size and turned into the form of a monk wearing a monastic robe which was quite fresh and clean
The monk gure said to Daan You have been injured
I will now take the pain away for you
When you have been restored go back to your home and practice the buddhaname recitation and other good deeds Then he rubbed Daans neck with his hand and the injury was removed
When Daan recovered he saw that the back of the monks robe had a red silken patch one cun square
The patch was very visible
Daan woke up and revived
The injury no longer caused him pain and he was able to sit up and eat
After a dozen or so days passed people from the residence in the capital city came and took him home
People in the residence relatives and old acquaintances all came to see him and Daan told them the circumstances of his injury and his experience encountering the image
One female servant sitting to the side heard this and said When I rst came to Daans family his wife sent me to a carver of buddha images to have an image made
When the gure was made it was clothed in a beautifully patterned silken robe but there was one red stain on the back of the gure and even though we asked the carver to remove it he would not agree
The appearance of this image has remained the same until now and it is just like the image the young master has described Thereupon Daan accompanied by his wife and others from the residence went to see the image
The gure was exactly like the one he had seen
The spot in the back was the same red patch on the gure Daan had seen
Marveling at this Daan was convinced of the efcacy of the holy teaching and became even more pious in following the Buddhas teaching
Honoring the teaching eagerly he lived a long life
All the stories of image miracles that occurred after Buddhism arrived in China cannot be told here
A selection of these stories have been given above
Over one hundred families lived inside Wuzhong Fort in the Yuyang district in Youzhou
In the fourth month during the summer of the second year of the Longshuo period  a re inside the fortress destroyed the gate and all of the residential buildings
Inside the two temples and a pagoda were buddha shrines that all had paper curtains and other objects
Only the buddha images were not burned in the re the ames did not touch them and the gures stood tall by themselves
Everyone who saw this marveled at it and believed that the Buddhas power protected the images
Yuling GentlemanAttendant of Zhongshan had already been appointed to that post
In addition his elder brother Yuqing was well acquainted with civil ofcials and military ofcers in Qi Commandery For these reasons Yuqing was sent to Yingzhou and he himself observed the event
He told Yuling about it
There was a mountain temple west of the city of Bingzhou called Dongzi Temple
It had a large sitting gure over one hundred and seventy chi tall
The emperor honored the Buddhist teaching and when he traveled to Bingzhou in the last year of the Xianqing period  he visited this temple with the empress
The emperor also visited Kaihua Temple on the northern side of the valley
Its gure was two hundred chi tall
Paying respect to this image the emperor marveled at it as he observed it
He presented a large gift of rare treasures expensive objects and clothing
Various princesses and other members of the inner palace also made donations
In addition the emperor ordered Dou Gui the leading ofcial of the region and others to quickly arrange to have the gure elaborately adorned
He also gave instructions to secure a large area in front of the shrines
On the day the emperor returned to the capital city which took place in the seventh month autumn of the second year of the Longshuo period  CE
 inner ofcials sent two monastic robes to the large gures in the two temples Dongzi Temple and Kaihua Temple
On the day when the robe was put on the gure at Dongzi Temple it emitted vecolored light from dawn to evening which shone on the caves in the rocky cliffs and illuminated mountains and rivers
The light also entered the southern shrine where a small buddha image was installed and brightly illuminated the hall
The monks and laymen who saw this occurrence numbered several millions
Among the noble and humble in the city who observed the event seven or eight out of ten converted 
Since everyone is familiar with this story I will not describe it in greater detail
Qingchan Temple in the western capital city once had an image made of pure gold one chi and four cun tall which weighed eighty liang
It had been produced by Emperor Wen of the Sui dynasty
In the fourteenth year of the Zhenguan period a bandit by the name of Sun Dexin fabricated a document with the imperial seal and sent a eunuch who claimed to have been sent by an imperial order to take away the gure
The monks at the temple hearing of the imperial order did not dare refuse to obey it
Overnight the truth became known but the body of the gure had already been melted down and only the head remained undamaged
Emperor Taizong was furious and ordered the most severe form of punishment
While awaiting death Dexins body began to rot and became covered by tumors
The monks at the temple added gold and had the gure recast properly
In the fourth year of the Xianqing period the regional inspector of Fuzhou surname Zu prayed for an end to drought but his prayers had no effect
In the mountains to the east someone saw a walking gure
No one knew where it came from but it had appeared suddenly because of the situation and would not go away
The news spread widely and many came from near and far to see it
A man from Tanzhou said that a gure that had disappeared from a temple there had reappeared here
When people examined the route that the gure had followed two footsteps each three chi long were found ve hundred li apart
Because the drought and heat had lasted for a long time the regional inspector immediately went to the gure and prayed to it
Local ofcials and civilians all presented incense and owers
They all walked over twenty li and explained the situation in tears
As their emotions intensied they sent three messengers to return the gure to the Tanzhou city temple The image rose easily and responded to the request
As the gure was returning to the city temple while still on the road the sky became covered by clouds and by the evening a heavy rainfall came down
The harvest that year was abundant
At the present time the gure is in Fuzhou
During the Yonghui period  to the east of Lantian in Yongzhou a temple called Wuzhen was situated on the western cliff of Langu Valley
It was a most beautifully constructed temple amid the beautiful mountains it stood majestically
Some monks wanted to build another building near the stream north of the temple but a huge rock there hampered their efforts
They set a re and released water to try to dislodge the rock but to no avail
Then they struck it with an iron hammer to break it up and found a gold gure within the rock
There were no seams on any of its sides and it appeared to have been miraculously produced in one piece
Its origins were unknown
The base was also there though it was not something made by carpenters
It was also unknown what sort of treasure the ve cuntall gure was
It is currently housed in the same mountain temple
In the same year in Yizhou one buddha image and two bodhisattva images appeared on a pillar in Guangming Temple
Even when the pillars were carved over the images reappeared
The images were rst placed in the Jiulong Buddha Hall but because of overcrowding Aide Zhang Xu moved them to Guangming Temple
The images are still there at the present time
At the Li Zhao bend west of the Fengshui River and east of E District in Yongzhou is a golden image three chi and six cun tall four chi tall with its halo
On several occasions the gure has emitted light
It bares its right arm and looks very fearsome
Having heard of this I went looking for it and found it
The following inscription appears on the base of the image The image was produced in a temple in Changan on the eighth day of the fourth month of twentieth year of the Jianyuan period of the Qin 
Queen Huishao moved by the Buddhas nirvana said I am fortunate to encounter the gure left to which one can entrust oneself
I will make a copy by casting on the basis of the divine mold
If I do so with sincerity there will denitely be responses
I vow to bring merit to beings in the ten directions This was the text of the inscription
When I asked about the circumstances under which the gure was obtained I was told the following
In the past when the two teachings of Buddhism and Daoism were persecuted this gure had been hidden inside the whirlpool at Luoren on the Fengshui River
Someone walking on the riverbank heard a voice from within the whirlpool and also saw light
He related this to the village elders who immediately went to the whirlpool and looked inside the clean sand there
Light appeared in the water and by digging at that place they obtained the previously hidden gure
This occurred during the Zhou dynasty
Village families hid the image and worshiped it among themselves
The image was placed in a closed room but it emitted light that illuminated it
The gure still exists in the village
In the second month in the spring of the third year of the Longshuo period  an image appeared in Qinzhou
Over sixty li north of the city on the cliffs at Changgu Valley on the border of the Mianshang district is an old buddha cave Inside the cave are three stone gures
The middle one frequently emitted light illuminating the forested valley
Villagers nding this extraordinary reported to the government ofce in the city and a report of the incident was sent from there to the court
The court then sent Xuanxiu a monk of Dacien Temple in the capital city along with a secular messenger to look into the matter
Upon arrival they saw the light which darted around endlessly like the ames of a re
Then a cloud came over the cave shrine and the light was obscured for a while
When the cloud moved away the light reappeared
The messengers quickly reported this
The court ordered a number of detailed drawings to be made and while this was being carried out the light appeared as before frequently on and off for three evenings
The drawings have been handed down to today and the light is still seen today
In the mountain forest in this beautiful location some places are covered in thick vegetation
There are many ancient remains of buddha gures in rock caves While their origins are unknown miraculous occurrences are frequently observed
In the painting of Kṣitigarbha Bodhisattva in Faju Temple outside the walled city of Yizhou the bodhisattva eight or nine cun tall is portrayed in a sitting position with one leg pendant from the seat
The original drawing was made by Zhang Sengyou
In the seventh month of the second year of the Linde period the monks of the temple obtained a copy of the drawing
Intermittently the drawing emitted light that looked like a golden ring
The light was just like that of the original painting
In this way as copies of the paintings were made they all emitted light
In the eighth month of the same year the court ordered to have a copy of the painting made and presented offerings to it in the palace
At the present time monks and laypeople in the capital city and elsewhere make copies of the painting and make offerings to them
All of these copies emit light
This shows convincingly that the power of the Buddha is beyond our understanding Note There is a copy in the household but I will not quote from its record The event described below occurred in the second year of the Linde period 
Mount Sanxue north of the Jinshui district in Jianzhou was originally governed by Yizhou
Huiyu a monk of the temple there is according to the provisional precedents currently allowed to live in Konghui Temple outside the city wall of Yizhou
In the rst year of the Linde period  CE
 he traveled from the city to Changsha Temple in Jingzhou where before the miraculous bronze image he prayed earnestly making a vow to have paintings of the gure made and to take care of them properly and make regular offerings
He obtained the service of master artist Zhang Jingyan
After undergoing purication based on the proper rules the artist had nished painting six copies without seeing any miracles but when he began working on the seventh painting the image emitted vecolored light that illuminated everywhere
People from near and far all saw it
After seven days the light began to fade
All the monks and laypeople were delighted but their reactions cannot be described in detail here
Huiyu took the painting to Changan but it had not yet been properly decorated
He also wished that the gures of bodhisattvas and holy monks that would be placed on both sides  as well as other shrine objects be painted into the picture
At that time all the skillful artists in the capital city had been ordered to gather at the palace
Under the supervision of various ofcials and scholars the artists were painting illustrations for the sixtyfascicle Gazetteer of Western Kingdoms which included forty fascicles of pictures
Since there were no good artists outside the palace Huiyu asked Fan Changshou at the palace to paint the features adorning the gure
The work was done inside the secretariat building at the court
On the seventh day of the sixth month in the third watch at night the gure began to emit vecolored light that illuminated the area outside the hall
Some guardians of the hall were staying outside and seeing the light appear above the hall they thought that a re had started inside the hall
Alarmed they ran around shouting
Ten ofcials and over thirty soldiers were staying inside the hall Because the weather was very hot they were sleeping in the nude
When the light shone people could see each others nakedness and taken aback they all got dressed
However there was one ofcial Shi Huaizang who until then lacked faith
He saw the light all around him but his own body was invisible
The light passed right through it When the light dimmed toward dawn Huaizang repented his lack of faith
He no longer saw the light around him but his body became visible again
Ofcials and soldiers from other branches of the court heard people shouting about the light and came to see it
They all converted and followed the prescribed way of life
All of these people obtained a copy of the painting and worshiped it at home
The monks and laypeople in the capital city all know about this Therefore I will not cite sources for this story here In the rst year of the Longshuo period  by imperial edict the monk Sengze of Huichang Temple was ordered to go to Mount Wutai and repair temples and stupas there
This mountain was under the charge of the Wutai district ofce in the Taizhou region
It had ve terraces among which the middle terrace was the highest
From there one could see as far as a thousand li and distant mountains and rivers looked as if they could rest in ones palm
On top of the terrace were thousands of stone stupas constructed out of layers of bricks and rocks
These had been built by Emperor Xiaowen of the Wei dynasty
On a rock to the north of the terrace were the footprints of humans and dogs
The patterns looked as if they were newly made
At the summit of the peak was a large lake called Taihua Spring
There were also smaller springs that were connected to each other
On both sides of the springs were two stupas within which were images of Mañjuśrī
According to the tradition Mañjuśrī accompanied by ve hundred holy men went to Mount Qingliang to preach the Dharma
The Flower Garland Sutra also states that Mañjuśrī preached the Dharma at Mount Qingliang
It is very cold on the mountain and no trees taller than a pine will grow forests of towering pines cover the valleys and peaks
The southern peak is called Qingliang Peak and at its foot is the ofce of Qingliang
The ruins of old and new buildings are preserved there
Over thirty li southeast of the terrace is the ancient Dafulingjiu Temple with its east and west training halls The resident monks attend to all matters necessary for following the Buddhist path
According to an ancient tradition the temple was established by Emperor Ming of the Han dynasty
To the south is a ower garden over two qing in size where unusual owers emit light dazzling beholders eyes
The gardens are surrounded by trees and when asked the elders admitted that they did not know the origins of the owers
Every year from early spring to late autumn different owers bloom one after another
From ancient days monks and laypeople loved these extraordinary owers that are not found elsewhere in the human world
They dug out their roots and planted them elsewhere but the roots never sprouted
They then transplanted some of the ower plants just outside of the trees that surround the gardens but again they failed to sprout
Only within the surrounded gardens would the owers grow spontaneously
This was a miraculous manifestation resulting from the presence of the great sage Mañjuśrī whose residence was located here
These extraordinary owers had not been planted by human beings
If those who have sincere faith enter this mountain they see the many buildings where holy monks reside
Some y in the sky while others live at the bottom of valleys
Some live on the precipitous peaks while others have their abodes in deep caves
Whether monks or laypeople they seem no different from ordinary and ignorant human beings
After having visited the location once visitors may look for it again but they will not be able to nd it
The temple and its monks appear and disappear unpredictably and only holy people can comprehend their secret
In the second year of the Longshuo period the emperor again ordered Sengze to go to Bingzhou to repair old temples with resources provided by local ofcials
Accompanied by the ofcial of Mount Wutai and more than twenty others Sengze immediately went up to the central terrace and saw a stone gure on the cliff move and wave its hand
When they reached the place where the gure had been seen there was only a stone
Disappointed the monk chastised himself for failing to see the true body 
He remained disconsolate for a long time
He had the workers repair the two stupas and the gure of Mañjuśrī
As he was lingering around the stupas Sengze suddenly heard the sound of a bell being rung over and over endlessly
An otherworldly fragrance also reached him in repeated waves
Both the monk and laymen marveled at this unprecedented occurrence
Sengze also went to the western terrace and saw from a distance a monk riding a horse galloping toward the east
Sengze and the others stood waiting for a long time for the monk to approach them but he never arrived
They then went to the place where they saw the monk earlier and the monk had turned into a stump
They could not get over their disappointment
However in miraculous responses images appear and disappear unexpectedly
On such occasions the sounds of bells are heard and one perceives fragrance in the air
This mountain range occupies a three hundred lisquare area
The southeastern stretch reaches to Mount Heng
The northwestern part goes to the Heavenly Pond
In the middle are Mount Foguang Mount Xianhua the princes stupa and six temples
The caves in which Meditation Master Jietuo and Meditation Master Sengming sat are also there
Even after many decades have passed their bodies have not decayed due to the power of their meditation
The attainments of such saintly gures are beyond our understanding
In the second month of the second year of the Qianfeng period  Vinaya Master Daoxuan of Ximing Temple seeking quietude had withdrawn to the Qinggong shrine formerly Jinye Temple located south of the capital and was cultivating the Way there
The Vinaya master had accumulated immense virtue and had long embraced simplicity
Suddenly a deity came to the Vinaya master and paying respect to him enquired about his wellbeing
The Vinaya master asked Where do you live
What is your name The deity answered My surname is Wang and my given name is Dang
I am the ofcial in charge of the palace library in the great kingdom of Wu
When Kang Senghui rst came to Jianye the ruler of the kingdom of the surname Sun did not accept his authority but after he was exposed to miraculous occurrences he built an extraordinary shrine
At that time all heavenly and earthly deities offered support and after twentyone days relics were obtained
When the ruler of Wu took the bronze jar in his hand and poured its contents onto a bronze plate the plate split apart as soon as the relics touched it
They then burned the relics and struck them with a hammer but they remained intact
People like Kan Ze and Zhang Yu were also protected by deities who entered their bodies kept their minds alert and enabled them to always give the appropriate answer
Now they are both in heaven charged with the task of protecting the Buddhist teaching
I am a messenger under General Wei ruler of the Southern Heaven
The general is charged with a great deal of work including the protection of the Buddhas teaching on three continents
If any conicts or other difculties arise within the community he himself comes to resolve it When I just now approached you the general had greatly wished to come himself but he is occupied with the matters with which he is involved
He should come in the near future
He ordered us to come and talk to you Shortly thereafter another deity came and said that his surname was Luo and that he was a man of Shu
In the Shu accent he spoke extensively on matters concerning monastic rules
When he rst saw the Vinaya master he greeted him according to secular custom
He discussed a number of topics in an orderly fashion and then suddenly disappeared
Then another deity appeared surnamed Fei and greeted Vinaya Master Daoxuan in the same way as the earlier ones
He said At the time of Kāśyapa Buddha I was born in the rst heaven under General Wei
All the gods were intoxicated with heavenly desires but due to the power of the vow I had made in my previous life I had nothing to do with heavenly desires and maintained pure conduct meticulously observing the Vinaya rules
Novices who serve General Wei devote themselves to religious practice and are not affected by heavenly desires
There are eight generals under one ruler
There are thirtytwo generals under four rulers and they go back and forth in the four realms under heaven guarding the monks and nuns who have renounced the householders life
Among the four realms under heaven in the continent under the Northern Heaven the Buddhas teaching hardly exists
In the three other realms under heaven the Buddhas teaching prospers
Yet monks and nuns who have renounced the householders life frequently violate the precepts and seldom live according to the teaching
In the realm under the Eastern and Western Heavens people are less cunning and crafty but it is difcult to teach them how to remove their delements
In the southern continent where offenses are frequently committed it is easier to teach people to turn to the good way of life and their minds are more easily tamed
At the time the Buddha entered nirvana I was personally entrusted with the task of guarding his teaching and preventing Māra from distracting people
If we do not guard and if we violate the precepts who will be left to provide instruction on my teaching Thus we must obey the Buddhas holy instruction
Even when I see those who violate prohibitions I still take pity on them and protect them
If I see them perform one good deed I forgive ten thousand faults
I overlook their aws and do not dwell on their past failures
However when the bad odor that pervades the human world goes up to the fragrant heaven forty thousand li away all the pure deities nd it unpleasant
Yet ever since the Buddha entrusted the task of protecting his teaching we still stay in the same realm as human beings
No deity would dare not to come
General Wei does more than any other among the thirtytwo generals to protect the teaching
Often the sons and daughters of Māra taunt monks and those whose spiritual powers are limited become confused
Thereupon the general comes quickly and removes the source of their confusion
Therefore when an important matter arises he always goes to the four rulers of the heavenly realms and when they see him they all rise
This is because General Wei observes the rules for novices and guards the right Dharma
By nature I take pleasure in observing precepts
I sat in the audience and heard and accepted all the monastic rules the Tathāgata established during his lifetime Having heard this Daoxuan asked about hidden meanings in the Vinaya literature and the deity answered uently
In the eastern land of China the Buddhist teaching of the Three Jewels frequently caused miraculous objects to appear in mountains oceans waters and among rocks
While these objects are worshiped no one knows their true origins
For this reason Daoxuan asked about them
The explanation was very mysterious so it is here summarized in intelligible terms
Without an extensive overview the matter could not have been put into words
Daoxuan asked When did the stone gure of Duobao Temple in Chengdu in Yizhou appear from the ground The deity answered The capital of Shu originally was on the summit of Mount Qingcheng
Presentday Chengdu was in the middle of the great ocean
The gure was made at the time of Kāśyapa Buddha at Xierhe
It is modeled after the entire body of Prabhūtaratna Buddha 
It used to be at Jiushan  Temple along the Xier River
Someone from Chengdu went there to trade and requested to take the image back with him
When he came to the place where the present Duobao Temple is the boat was capsized by the ocean god
Earlier the man who brought the image had seen a child of the ocean deity climb up onto the bank and walk around and mistaking it for a miraculous mountain mushroom he had killed the child
The ocean deity was angry and capsized the boat drowned both the man and the gure that were on it
This gure of Prabhūtaratna Buddha used to be at Jiutoushan  Temple
The ancient remains of the location still exist
There is also a stupa that constantly emits light
Traveling toward India past Langzhou and numerous larger and smaller towns after more than three thousand li one reaches the Xier River
The river is very widesometimes one hundred li and sometimes ve hundred li across In the middle of the river is a mountain where there is also an ancient temple
Scriptures and images are still there but no monks live there The scripture also mentions this temple
From time to time the sound of a bell is heard
The people there are wealthy and twice yearly they present offerings to the ancient stupa
The stupa is like an ordination platform consisting of three stone platforms
At the top are numerous potshaped structures
People there simply call it the grave of a deity and it frequently emits light
People make vegetarian offerings to seek benets
This land is located over two thousand li northwest of Suizhou
 Daoxuan asked Is the place not far from India
Do people frequently go there
The deity continued At the time of Jin dynasty a monk found an earthen grave at that location 
Every time he went there he removed some soil but he could not level it
Later he opened up the grave and found it very strange
He dug deeper for several zhang and obtained the gure and a human skeleton inside a boat
The skull and arm and leg bones were very large several times larger than those of human beings today
This is because at the time of Kāśyapa Buddha people lived until the age of twentythousand years in this Jambudvīpa world and these were the bones of people from that period
Now the world age has changed and people have shorter life spans and are smaller There is nothing wondrous about the size of the bones
When the gure was rst discovered it resisted being taken away
I then appeared in the form of an old man and directed the efforts to move the gure
Shortly thereafter the Northern Zhou persecution of Buddhism occurred and people hid the image for awhile
When the Sui dynasty resumed support of Buddhism the gure was brought out again
The people of Shu only know that this miraculous gure had sprung out of the ground but they have no idea of its origin
They saw in many places on its halo and base the word Duobao  and consequently gave it that name Daoxuan asked The characters for Duobao are written in the ancient li script which was invented under the Qin dynasty
How could the people who lived at the time of Kāśyapa Buddha already have had this Chinese script The deity answered The li script was adopted by Li Si in more recent times but it was widely used in the ages of ancient buddhas
It is used now in over one thousand continents on all four sides of our southern continent In over ten thousand one hundred kingdoms that adorn the Jambudvīpa world the same script and pronunciation as in our kingdom of Tang have been adopted
It is only because they are situated far away across the ocean of a hundred thousand li that they stubbornly preserve earlier practices
There is nothing strange about all this
Have you not heard of Gu Yewang of Liang
He was the great erudite of the National University
He investigated the etymology of characters extensively though he did not discuss all characters
In the preface to his work Yupian he says that he opened the grave of Lord Chun Shen and obtained the inscription
It was written in the li script
Chun Shen is a contemporary of King Wu of Zhou and the Six Kingdoms
The li script thus did not originate at the time of the unication of China
The origin of various ancient scripts in this country of China is not entirely clear
How can we know of the situation at the time of Kāśyapa Buddha
History is not conned to matters that can be conrmed by what the eye can see and the ear can hear  Question
On a hill to the west of todays Western Capital are the Gaosi earthen platforms
According to local lore these platforms were made by Cang Jie to serve as his writing table
How could it be that the li script existed at such an early time Answer
Cang Jie piled more soil on the platform and made it into his table
The story that he observed the marks made by birds feet and invented the writing system from them is true
Cang Jies background is hardly known here however
Some say he was a minister of the Yellow Emperor
Some say that he was an ancient ruler
The scripts based on the footprints of birds have evolved extensively over time and the original scripts are now lost
I would not take the trouble of speaking about things that are of no benet Another deity with the surname Lu and personal name Xuanchang appeared and after greeting the Vinaya master said I was once born as a god at the time of King Mu of the Zhou dynasty
Originally I am a deity from the time of Kāśyapa Buddha
Because I can appear in any time and place I appeared briey in the time of the Zhou
The Gaosi platform about which you asked was originally the place where Kāśyapa Buddha preached his third sermon and ordained people
At the time of King Mu Mañjuśrī and Maudgalyāyana came to teach there
King Mu obeyed them
The phantom men mentioned in the book Liezi refer to them
The phantom men indicated to King Mu that the Gaosi platform was the place where Kāśyapa Buddha had preached
Therefore the king established Third Sermon Temple there
At the time of Duke Mu of the Qin dynasty a cyclone deposited a stone gure
Duke Mu did not recognize its identity and placed it inside the stable where the image was soiled
The deity that protected the image was angered and caused the duke to fall ill
The duke had a dream in which he traveled up to heaven and was severely reprimanded by the Supreme Ruler
When he awoke he asked Attending Minister Youyu about the meaning of his dream
The minister answered that they had heard of the phantom man who came to this land at the time of King Mu of the Zhou dynasty
The gure must been the same Buddhist deity
Duke Mu believed him and built a heavenly platform at Mount Zhongnan that was over one thousand chi tall
Its foundation is still preserved
He also built a shrine at Cang Jies platform called Third Sermon Temple
Hearing that his illness had been caused by the Buddha the duke was frightened and said to Youyu Recently I obtained a gure made of stone
He wears a robe and crown that have not been produced in our time
I threw it in the stable
I wonder whether this was the Buddha deity Upon hearing this Youyu went there to inspect it and responded to Duke Mu It is the true Buddha deity
You should take the gure bathe it and place it safely in a clean place
The image then emitted light
The duke was again frightened fearing that the deity was angry
He made an offering of an ox a sheep and a boar
Various good deities took these sacrices away to distant places and discarded them
The duke was even more frightened and asked Youyu about this who answered I have heard that the Buddha deity lives a pure life and one should not offer wine or meat to him
The deity loves living creatures lives in the same way that we protect our own children
Offerings should be conned to burning incense
One may also present cakes and fruits Duke Mu was delighted
The duke also wanted to make an image of the Buddha but that was beyond the artisans abilities
He again asked Youyu about this who answered There should be suitable artisans living next to the temple that King Mu built in the distant past The duke found an old man in the village south of the Gaosi platform
His surname was Wang his personal name was An and he was one hundred and eighty years old
He said Once at Third Sermon Temple I observed someone make an image but I am now old and unable to make such a gure
Four brothers live north of my village They used to work in the temple
Please let them make the image together This suggestion was followed and a bronze gure was completed equipped with all marks of the Buddha
The duke was delighted and rewarded the workers generously
With the wealth thus acquired the brothers made another very meritorious act
On top of the earthen platform they built a multistoried building three hundred chi tall
Their contemporaries called it the Gaosi platform or Gaosi Tower
Their surname was Gao and the oldest among them had the personal name Si
Some say that the name of the building contains the expression si  because the four brothers collaborated to build it
Others say that the name of the oldest brother was incorporated into the name of the building
Thus the building was called Gaosi and it has been called by that name to today Question
Maudgalyāyana and āriputra ended their lives while the Buddha was still in this world
How could Maudgalyāyana have appeared again Answer
There are six people with the same name of Maudgalyāyana
This one is not the same Mahāmaudgalyāyana
At the time of the Northern Zhou dynasty of the Yuwen clan Mañjuśrī transformed himself into an Indian monk and came to this land of China saying I would worship at the place where Kāśyapa Buddha preached and also the place where Mañjuśrī lived called Mount Qingliang He asked the monks and laypeople everywhere he went but no one knew where these places were
At that time Dharma Master Zhimeng who had just turned eighteen years old returned the question to the Indian monk How do you know about the existence of these two holy locations The Indian monk answered Twenty li south of the Qin capital city is the writing platform built by Cang Jie
That is the location He also said  fty li south of the Sha River and forty li north of Mount Qing   asked
To what do the Sha River and Mount Qing refer Answer
They refer to the Weishui River and Mount Zhongnan
The Indian monk then went straight southward from the Weishui River and after walking a long distance he reached the Gaosi 
He then said This is the location where the ancient buddha preached At that time Dharma Master Zhimeng was accompanying the Indian monk and he worshiped the site
Shortly thereafter he could not tell where the Indian monk had gone
After he grew older Zhimeng told this story to the Chamberlain for Ceremonials Wei and asked him to establish a temple at the platform like the one that had existed originally
A memorial was presented to the ruler of the Northern Zhou and the temple was named Third Sermon Temple
During the Daye period of the Sui smaller temples were merged with larger ones and this temple was incorporated into Bodhi Temple
The head of the buddha gure at Bodhi Temple located east of the southern gate to the Pinggangfang section west of the eastern market in the present capital city is that of the buddha of Third Sermon Temple
Twelve years after he brought salvation to Mahākāśyapa ākya Tathāgata came to this platform
Under the platform are Kāśyapa Buddhas relics
King Mu traveled himself to the kingdom of Daxia
The Buddha told him that in the land of China there is an ancient stupa and that the king should return and worship it
The king asked about the location of the stupa
The Buddha answered that it was southeast of Hao Hill
There is a detailed account of this exchange in a Western record
In the previous year Changnian a Sri Lankan monk who had spent ninetynine years in the monastery and had attained the rank of nonreturner  heard of this superior site and visited and worshiped it
He also memorialized requesting permission to go to the place where Mañjuśrī Bodhisattva sat on Mount Qingliang in northern Daizhou
The emperor was delighted and ordered that he be supplied with a horse for transportation and a special messenger The monks disciples and government ofcials altogether over twenty people accompanied him to attend to his needs
These ofcials and disciples all rode government horses
From the time he was very young Changnian had diligently practiced austerities refusing to ride on any animals so he walked on foot
When they arrived at Mount Qingliang in Daizhou the monk crawled on his elbows and knees climbing to the buddha hall on the middle terrace
This buddha hall was the shrine for Mañjuśrī
The distance from the bottom to the top of the mountain was over thirty li
The rocks on the mountain were sharp and cut bonedeep into his esh but no blood owed from the wounds only milk
For seven days he lay on the ground in the worship position on his stomach with his limbs stretched out and he would not rise or eat
After seven days he suddenly jumped up and pointed in all directions in the sky
Everywhere Mañjuśrī Bodhisattva as a holy monk and arhat appeared and disappeared accompanied by several tens of monks and laypeople
A snake several li long came from the north straight toward Changnian who was delighted
After grasping Changnians leg in its mouth the snake turned into a monk
People were frightened and scattered to the four directions
Only Changnian remained calm
His various miraculous accomplishments cannot be described in detail here
Having fullled his vow he returned to the capital city
At the present time he resides at Huadu Temple
Sometimes he responds to requests for ordination in the inner palace
Sometimes he travels around various mountains Vinaya Master asked the deity According to an ancient tradition Mañjuśrī is at Mount Qingliang and as the leader of ve hundred holy ones he preaches the Dharma
The scriptures make clear however that Mañjuśrī is a bodhisattva who lives forever in the sahā world
Sahā refers to the whole worldsystem
How could his activity be conned to this small location of Mount Qingliang The deity answered Mañjuśrī is commanderinchief among all buddhas
He appears quickly in response to appropriate conditions and transforms himself in different ways
His achievement transcends the human realm
There is no point in speculating about his conduct
We should know enough to believe that for the most part he stays at the Five Terraces on Mount Qingliang which at the present time belongs to northern Daizhou
To the west is the government ofce of Qingliang in the Wutai district
From the time the Tang dynasty was established there is a story of a monk called Jietuo
He had died in a rock cave over thirty years ago but the esh of his body did not rot and he appeared only as if he had gone into an advanced meditative state in which all mental activities have ceased There was also a nun who entered a meditative state and stopped all movements
Both of them stayed in this state for many years
On this mountain there are many holy sites temples bodhisattvas and supernatural monks
People frequently see immortals and the owers of immortals
Detailed accounts are found in other works
How could one not believe them again asked Thirty li southeast of the Central Terrace of the present Mount Wutai is Dafulingjiu Temple
Its two halls are separated by a valley
To the south is a ower garden over two qing in size where owers of different colors bloom in all four seasons
The garden is surrounded by trees on all four sides
When people transplant the owers elsewhere they never take root
These owers can grow only inside the garden
People investigated the gardens origin but were unable to determine it
Some say it was established by Emperor Ming of the Han dynasty
Others say that the owers were planted by Emperor Xiaowen of the Wei dynasty
The stories that elders transmit do not agree with each other
What is the truth Answer
The garden was made by both emperors
As far back as the time of King Mu of the Zhou dynasty Buddhism already existed
The mountain where Mañjuśrī lived was a place lled with miracles
King Mu built a temple here to make offerings to him
King Aśoka also built a stupa
At the beginning of the reign of King Ming of the Han dynasty the arhat Mātaṅga saw the stupa with his divine eye and requested the emperor to build a temple
The shape of the mountain was like that of Mount Gṛdhrakūṭa
The phrase dafu in the name Dafulingjiu means faith The phrase is used here because the emperor had faith in Buddhism built a temple and recommended the teaching to others
Emperor Xiaowen of the Yuan Wei dynasty had his palace not far from the Northern Terrace of the mountain and came frequently to pay respect
The footprints of people and horses are clearly preserved there
These extraordinary facts can be proven Such miraculous facts are not conned to Mount Wutai
In all such famous mountains as Mount Zhongnan Mount Taibo Mount Taihua and the Five Peaks holy people live upholding the Buddhas teaching to ensure its survival If people make offerings to them they respond miraculously
Details are found in other works so I do not reproduce them here Daoxuan asked again In the Panhe district west of presentday Liangzhou the mountain split and a rock image appeared
Of what was the image made Answer
At the time of Kāśyapa Buddha Libin Bodhisattva observed that the people who lived on this mountain did not believe in the principle of karmic retribution and engaged in occupations that required killing creatures
At that time there were several tens of thousands of families in the inhabited part of this mountain but none among them honored the teaching of the Buddha
In order to bring salvation to them the bodhisattva built a temple
The divine king Great Brahmā fashioned the image with his own hands
When it was completed with his supernatural power Libin Bodhisattva turned the gure into a real buddha that walked around and preached the Dharma
Even though the people received this teaching they still did not believe in it
Then the bodhisattva performed a frightening gesture holding a huge piece of rock in his hand he threatened to throw it down on top of them
When Libin Bodhisattva gave this threat people quickly converted and believed in the Buddha
All the weapons and tools they used to kill creatures were transformed into lotus owers
The street corners were lled with these owers as if they had been planted there Other miraculous signs followed from here serving as a way of teaching people and demonstrating the supernatural powers of the Buddhas teaching
The bodhisattva also urged lay followers to build seven temples covering the land one hundred and forty li in the northsouth direction and eighty li in the eastwest direction
Over the mountains and valleys residences for monks and buddha halls were built
The work was completed in thirteen years
At that time twenty thousand people renounced the householders life simultaneously and they resided in the seven temples
After three hundred years they became very powerful because of the karma created in the present life
They willingly accepted in this life the consequences of the evil deeds they had committed in the past and they did not fall into hell
Those who had been harmed lived in inferior realms of existence and made the following vow
Those who harmed me have not yet become holy people
We must kill them now
If we do not harm them now their bad karma will soon be exhausted and we will not be able to exact revenge on them Together they spat out re and burned down the temple buildings
The villages were burned down at the same time Those who survived then drowned in a ood
Not one person survived
On that occasion before the temple building was destroyed the mountain deity took the gure and kept it high in the sky
After the temple had been destroyed he brought it back down and placed it safely inside a rock cave and looked after it
Many years and months later the rock grew and the cave disappeared
When Master Liu Sahe paid respect to the mountain he indicated that the gure would reemerge
In his previous life Sahe was Libin Bodhisattva
The head and the body of the gure were located in two different places The story of this image is also told in another record  Question
Concerning the miraculous image at Longguang Temple south of the Jiang River people say that it had been brought to China by Kumārajīva but others say that it had been obtained in Funan
How can we determine which account is correct Answer
Kumārajīva did not obtain this image rather it was obtained when Emperor Xiaowu went on an expedition to Funan
For a three hundredyear period after the Buddha disappeared a great arhat in North India called Youbozhina with his supernatural powers worked with the artisans
For three hundred years they carved out a buddha cave in a large rocky mountain
From bottom to top there were ve levels and the height of the cave was over three hundred chi Upon request Maitreya Bodhisattva directed the workers to build a sandalwood chamber inside the cave
According to Xuanzangs record the image is over one hundred chi tall
According to the Record of the Holy Traces the image is eight zhang tall and its feet and base are eight chi
On the six vegetarian feast days the image always emits light
At the time the image was made arhats led the artisans up to the heavens and the work was completed after they had gone up three times
The second gure is made of oxhead sandalwood the third one is of gold the fourth of jade and the fth of bronze
Ordinary people today can only see the one at the lowest level
The four levels above are closed
When they are inside the cave people can see through each others bodies to their internal organs
In the sixhundredth year after the Buddhas nirvana there was an arhat called Fuonazhe
His mother lived in the kingdom of Funan
Thinking of his mothers love he ascended to an upper level of the cave and brought down a small sandalwood gure and he let his mother make offerings to it
After the mother died she was reborn in Yangzhou and renouncing the householders life she resided at Xinxing Temple She attained the third fruit 
It was also due to the supernatural power of this arhat that Emperor Xiaowu of the Song was able to obtain this gure on his expedition to Funan
Fuonazhes mother is still alive and occasionally goes to Luofu and Tiantai and various places to the west
In the past Fasheng and Tan Wujie traveled to the west one after the other
There is a vefascicle record that briey describes this gure
How could one say suddenly that Dharma Master Kumārajīva brought this image on his back In this connection Master xuan asked Why is it that people particularly love the scriptures that Master Kumārajīva translated in his lifetime upholding them and circulating them Answer This man was very intelligent and understood the Great Vehicle clearly
Those who assisted him in his translation work were also superior they were jewels of their generation
Later efforts failed to attain the same level
For this reason the translations they produced show the highest degree of understanding and preserve the meaning of the teaching that the Buddha left behind Another question
Under pressure from Yao Xing of the  Kumārajīva violated a major precept
How could this be said to follow the meaning of the Buddhas teaching Answer
This is not something that ordinary people can understand from a remove
How could we pass critical judgment on it
Master Kumārajīvas virtues and conduct rank at the level of the three kinds of accomplished holy ones
He spread the teaching in the place he happened to be deleting repetitions and adding new material for missing sections
He wrote in a way that took account of his readers capacities
Thus the Great Treatise is divided into ten sections of which nine are presented in summary
The situation with other scriptures is also similar
miraculous responses occur This happens generation after generation
These occurrences enable us to understand and deeply appreciate the holy intentions  After all it is very rare that even a few of us can encounter the Buddha himself
Kumārajīva also received instruction from Mañjuśrī and then revised his translations
Kumārajīva was an extraordinary person different from those around him
We should not let criticism about the concubines disparage his attainments on the matter of mysterious metaphysics  Another question
When was the rock gure that appeared from the mountain near Xianji Temple in Fangzhou produced Answer
The image was made by Duke Mu of Qin 
The location where the image appeared is that of the temple established by King Mu of Zhou
After the Buddha left the world the fourth daughter of King Aśoka also made images and stupas and made offerings to them here
At that time there was one person who had attained the rst second or third fruits  whom Minister Youyu of Qin always honored
In the past at the time of the Kāśyapa Buddha a temple was built here
The monk Xianji built the temple and it was named after him  Another question
Today on the summit of the mountain near the Southern Platform Terrace of the Yuhua shrine there is a brick stupa
Each side is about forty steps long
The lowest level is decorated very elaborately
On all four sides are cave shrines
Broken bricks are found nearby and there are also over thirty brick kilns
Elders do not know when this stupa was built
Frequently the sound of a bell is heard Answer
This is King Mus temple called Mount Ling
At the time of King Aśoka the mountain deity was ordered by imperial edict to build a temple here
During the confusion toward the end of the Western Jin dynasty  made Changan his capital had several dreams
The buddha of this mountain appeared inside the brick stupa and in the sitting position said to Yao You must drink less and do not indulge in licentious behavior
Remove evil ministers and promote honest ones Yao did not obey this instruction
Later while in Luoyang he got drunk and fell off a horse and was captured by Shi Le
Yao realized the meaning of his dream and sent someone to the mountain looking for the buddha gure
The man found it sitting within a small stone stupa
This t the dream perfectly
Thereupon Yao destroyed the small stupa and built a big one consisting of nineteen levels
He also built a beautifully elaborate temple building and called it Fadeng
Three hundred monks were newly ordained and lived in the temple After Yao had died thirtytwo people who had attained the third fruit lived in the temple
Behind the present stupa the mountain deity built another temple and offered it to monks who had attained the second fruit 
The deity went to Mount Taibo and collected miraculous mushrooms and plants
He offered them to supernatural monks so that they could prolong their lives
The temple still exists today but ordinary people cannot see it
The sound of the bell you mentioned is that of the bell of this temple
As for the base of the stupa though it was laid by Liu Yao the location was that of the temple established by King Mu
It was also the location of Kāśyapa Tathāgatas ancient temple During the Zhenguan period in a mountain near the Ciwu River north of the Yuhua shrine a herd of deer was frequently seen
Even when they were chased away they returned again and again
Someone thought that this was strange and dug into the ground where the deer gathered
At the depth of one zhang he obtained a stone gure over one zhang long
Offerings are made to this image at the present time
Another question
The sandalwood image of the former Daming Temple in Jingzhou is said to have been made by King Udayana
According to the tradition a copy of the image was brought from there to China under the Liang dynasty
There is also a copy of the image in the present capital city 
Which one is the original Answer
The copy at Daming Temple is the original
When the founding emperor of the Liang dynasty died the gure was brought to the shores of Jingzhou
In the third year of the Chengsheng period under Emperor Yuan  the Zhou dynasty conquered the Liang dynasty
Afterward all treasures were taken by the Northern Zhou
As for the sandalwood image a Dharma master called Sengzhen hid it in his cell and by offering large bribes to the messenger he managed to keep the gure from being taken away with the other treasures In the ninth year of the Kaihuang period the founding emperor Wen of the Sui dynasty sent messenger Liu Guyan to bring the gure to the capital city
The monks of the temple again pleaded that the image should remain in the Jing and Chu areas
Guyan was originally from this area and agreed to this request He ordered another copy of the image carved from sandalwood and took the copy to the capital
At that time a brahman monk called Zhenda was hired as the woodworker and he produced the copy
This is the image that is in Xingshan Temple today
This gure also caused many miraculous occurrences
The original image stayed at Jingzhou
Monks there covered it in lacquered cloth and the features have become different from the authentic ones
The image originally reproduced the body of the Buddha seven days after birth Now the image represents the Buddha in adulthood Thus the present appearance of the gure differs greatly from the way it looked originally Daming is a place where ancient buddhas lived
For this reason the image refused to be moved north
Recently Dharma Master Yi of Changsha whom the gods praise secretly became inspired and removed the lacquered cloth
The true appearance of the image became visible again greatly increasing the piety of those who observe it
When people opened the cover and saw the miraculous image it was carved entirely from one piece of sandalwood no part of it is from a different piece of wood that has been attached to it
The halo and the base are remarkable
They are made of carved ivory and could not possibly have been made by humans
The body of the Xingshan gure is different from the original in many ways Another question
Near Xiangsi in Fuzhou are many ancient traces of the Buddhas activities
The traces are marked by inscriptions in ancient scripts but they do not describe their origins
What story lies behind them Answer
At the time of the Kāśyapa Buddha there was a mountain deity whose surname was Luo and personal name Ziming
He was a man of Shu
In the past he was a monk who observed precepts
Hating those who violated the precepts he made many evil vows including vowing to be reborn as a great evil demon to eat those who violated precepts
Because of this vow he was reborn as the mountain deity
He was accompanied by numerous followers and the territory he ruled over covered over ve thousand li in the eastwest direction and over two thousand li in the northsouth direction
Each year he consumed more than ten thousand people
This deity originally was an elder brother of Kāśyapa Buddha
Later he became his disciple
That buddha took pity on him and therefore came to teach him
Kāśyapa Buddha had to perform many miracles before he could convert him
He conferred the ve precepts and taught freely on his previous lives
For this reason the mountain deity stopped killing people
Fearing that he might change his mind later Kāśyapa Buddha left traces
King Aśoka built a stupa on of the summit of the mountain
The deity then hid inside the stone stupa
It was made of white jade
The deity still exists
The temple and the stupa outside of the city were also built by King Aśoka
These buildings are discussed in the Essay on Transmission Another question
Lingkan Temple inside the boundary of the Xingning district on a mountain north of Xunzhou in Nanhai has many miraculous traces Because the mountain deity committed many acts with negative karmic consequences Mañjuśrī the disciple of the Holy One took pity on him and came to instruct him
Having learned of karmic retribution the deity requested Mañjuśrī to leave some traces so that he could worship them and stay away from evil deeds
Mañjuśrī caused the traces to appear for him
These are the traces that we see today
In the third year of the Zhenguan period the life of the mountain deity ended and he was reborn in Tuṣita Heaven
Another ghost came to live here a relative of the previous deity
This new deity committed numerous evil deeds
The old deity who had been reborn in heaven took pity on him and came down to request Mañjuśrī to manifest minor traces in order to teach the deity who had come after him
This deity also became a follower of the right Dharma
For this reason there are major and minor traces on this mountain and these traces are not there for no reason
They are discussed in the Essay on Transmission Another question
The buddha gure in the rock cave in a mountain north of Qinzhou frequently emits light
Is the origin of this image recent or far in the past Answer
This cave existed at the time of both Kāśyapa Buddha and ākyamuni Buddha
A long time ago the second son of King Mu of Zhou built the gure of Kāśyapa Buddha Daoxuan lshi gantong lu T
Daoxuan also asked about Buddha Face Mountain and Seven Buddha Canyon on Mount Zhongnan in Weizhou
The deity answered This question is answered by the explanation given above
The Kugutian storehouse was built by Kāśyapa Buddha with his own hands
At the present time thirteen pratyekabuddhas live in the valley Another question
According to widely quoted traditions here in China the Buddha is attributed variously to different periods such as the time of the Yin dynasty King Shao of Zhou and Duke Zhuang of Lu
How can we determine the correct chronology Answer
Each theory has its own justication
I was born in heaven at the time of King Jie and observed in detail how the Buddha came down and taught
The Buddha has three bodies
Ordinary people do not see the Dharma body or the retribution body  and in these bodies he teaches beings who have reached the nal ten bodhisattva stages
Only in his transformation body does the Buddha cover the threefoldthousand worldsystems
Ten billion ākyamuni Buddhas appear in response to people at different points in time
It may be toward the end of the Yin dynasty or during the reign of Duke Zhuang of Lu Whatever the location and time the tradition reports the same teaching activity of the Buddha
He teaches differently according to the capacities of the recipients
How can we x the date of his activities
If we speak in terms of the Dharma body or the retribution body then he is constantly in quietude
There is no difculty that cannot be explained Another question
Many of the miraculous images found in China are said to have been produced by the fourth daughter of King Aśoka
The circumstances surrounding their origins are obscure and it is difcult to know whether this explanation is reliable
What were the circumstances Answer
There is no doubt about this matter
The fourth daughter of King Aśoka was not beautiful and could not be married for a long time She always hated her ugliness
Then she drew a picture of the Buddha with features that were just like her own
After drawing the picture she made a vow The Buddhas features are far superior than those of human beings
How could they be identical to mine  She made this request passionately
After years and months she felt that the Buddha appeared miraculously and suddenly her features changed
her father asked detailed questions about the cause
The daughter told him about her vow
The images at Yuhua Temple on this mountain Changsha Temple in Jingzhou Gao Lis temple in Yangdu and Chongjing Temple in the capital city were all made by the fourth daughter of King Aśoka
Some of these images have inscriptions on their halos and bases which are written in Sanskrit and few among the Chinese can read them
King Aśoka made gods and ghosts take these gures to many places miraculously responding to earnest requests
Those who look at these images see that they have female features
The grounds of Chongjing Temple were once a battleeld
Toward the end of the Western Jin dynasty ve barbarian groups were active and their soldiers killed each other Many of them died in this particular location
Human bones are still found today by people when they dig up the soil
Numerous innocent people were murdered cruelly here
Therefore the gods and ghosts brought the gure here to pacify their spirits and allow them to give rise to good thoughts
When the Northern Zhou dynasty persecuted Buddhism the gods took away the image
When the founder of the Sui dynasty restored support for Buddhism the gure was raised again Another question
Frequently among worldly people some journey to hell and return
Their spirits disappear and the bodies decay How could they be restored when they return
Some are gone for seven days and others for even longer yet when they return they are restored to their previous condition Answer
Human beings are endowed with seven consciousnesses
Each consciousness has a deity
The mind consciousness is the master
Even though the master moves away the other deities are left guarding what remains
This is not strange
In the case of the ve precepts each precept has ve deities
For ve precepts there are twentyve deities
If one precept is violated ve deities leave but the others remain
When a monk receives full ordination each precept has two hundred and fty deities
These two hundred and fty deities miraculously protect the monk
When one major precept is violated two hundred and fty deities leave but others remain Paying Respect to the Buddha Introduction The Name Location The Vision Karmic Causes and Scriptural Support It is the unwavering desire of living creatures to avoid pain and seek pleasure
This is a principle that living spiritual beings have followed in the past namely to abhor impurity and delight in purity
Conduct may be beautiful or evil the land may be crude or rened
In the sahā world lled with the ve kinds of impurities evil accumulates and forms hills and caves
In the Pure Land lled with the seven kinds of treasures good deeds are practiced and bloom into beautiful owers
Karmic causes dene the three main categories of birth retributions determine the nine subcategories
Because of superior thoughts treasure terraces and wonderful pavilions stand high
Due to good intentions jade marshes and jeweled ponds shine in purity
Lotus owers blooming together testify to the substantiality of fatherly compassion
In undulating waves the words of the teaching reach our ears
Through diligent work carried out with rm resolve and through the perfect realization of the necessary karmic causes we can follow the three ways of cultivating the mind ascend the Golden Terrace and by means of the ten thoughts ascend to the Land of Happiness
the world shines in cleanliness it is regarded as pure The location where the purity resides is called the land The She lun says In the land where resides there are none of the ve kinds of impurities
It is like crystal and gold and so is called the land of purity The Fahua lun Miaofa lianhuajing youbotishe Tc T
called the pure land There are four kinds of pure land The rst kind is the Dharmanature land so called because it takes true reality for its substance
Thus the Liang She lun says
The king of the lotus ower is the basis on which the Pure Land depends is a metaphor for the thusness of the Dharma realm The Pure Land depends on it as its substance
The second kind is the the land of real retribution According to the She lun 
The teaching of the two kinds of emptiness is the gate
The three kinds of wisdom form the entrance and exit
Cessation and contemplation constitute the vehicle
The fundamental nondiscriminatory wisdom is the function
These refer to the merit of retribution and describe how  the substance
The third kind is the phenomenal Pure Land This refers to the most beautiful seven jewels and the land manifested in terms of the ve kinds of sense objects
color  sound smell taste and touch
Thus the She lun says The Buddha resides in the place adorned by all pervading light and seven jewels The Huayan jing says The buddhas realms are variously decorated The Jingtu lun says  has many rare treasures and is decorated beautifully In addition the newly translated Pusazang jing  says
Even if in such a world a great re blazes if the Tathāgata is there whether walking around standing sitting or lying down the water of eight superior qualities will spring forth spontaneously from the ground
The fourth kind is the the Pure Land of transformation This means that the seven jewels and other objects of the ve senses produced by the Buddha have been miraculously transformed into the substance of the land
Thus the Niepan jing says
Because of the Buddhas supernatural powers the ground is soft and there are hills soil or pebbles 
it is like the Pure Land of Amitāyus Buddha in the West
The Da zhuangyan lun jing says Because his wisdom is free and realizes whatever it wishes it manifests the world of purity that is like crystals and beryl Furthermore the Weimo jing says By touching the ground with his toe the Buddha makes manifest the world of purity and other similar conditions Again the Shidi jing says As sentient beings wish to see them so do objects appear These scriptures and treatises all clarify how the Pure Land is produced through transformation
It exists because the Buddhas supernatural powers manifest it When this power is withdrawn the Pure Land no longer exists
For this reason it is called the land of transformation I have explained above the four kinds of pure lands but two of these are more important
rst the land of retribution and second the land of transformation
These two lands refer to the land on the level of principle and the land on the level of phenomena
The teaching of the land of retribution refers to the fact that as the Buddha Tathāgata appeared in the world the substance of all good deeds he performed is pure and is not conned to the three realms
Thus the Jingtu lun T
realms Also the Zhidu lun says The wondrous Pure Land is beyond the three realms
Wherever the Buddha resides he takes no location as location Thus he is beyond the worlds in the ten directions
Or with his Dharma body he abides securely in the Pure Land
The same treatise also says 
ākyamuni Buddha also has a pure world like the kingdom of Amitābha
Amitābha Buddha also has pure and impure worlds like ākyamuni Buddha
Also the Niepan jing Nirvana Sutra Tc Tc Again a verse in the Lotus Sutra says
I am always at Mount Gṛdhrakūṭa And at other locations When for sentient beings the world age comes to the end And the world burns up in massive re This land where I am is safe and secure Always lled with gods and humans Gardens forests and various buildings Are decorated with many different kinds of treasures Again the Huayan jing says
The Pure Land of the Tathāgata is located in the Tathāgatas jeweled crown or in his earring or in his necklace or inside the folded pattern of his robe or in a follicle of his hair
Thus a hair follicle can contain the entire world
From this we learn as it is said in the Shizhu lun Ta as grains of sand in the Ganges River These comments contribute to our understanding of this land
As for the land of transformation it is where the Buddha resides this land is not a specic separate location
It is dependent on the land of retribution it gives that land a more tangible though crude appearance
Sometimes it extends everywhere throughout the ten directions
Sometimes it is limited to one world
It guides sentient beings such as gods and human beings of the three vehicles just as Amitābha Buddha guided the ordinary beings in this world and led them to dwell in peace in the Kingdom of Purity
Sometimes the Tathāgata turns what is polluted into something pure as when he touches the ground and makes it pure comparable to a heavenly palace These examples illustrate 
To put it another way to sentient beings depending on the responses of their karmic seeds the common characteristics of the outside world appear differently as pure or polluted
Thus beings in six different realms of existence see the world differently
These differences are all due to the external perfuming by language
Consciousness forms the seeds and as these seeds respond to the external world images appear
These images fundamentally are the phenomenal aspect of the fundamental consciousness
The common characteristics and the seeds make the images appear
The consciousness that manifests images is the cause and condition
When the common characteristics are combined with the supplementary condition of inner karmic retribution because of this supplementary condition the common characteristics are perceived differently either as pain or pleasure
Ordinary beings and the followers of the two vehicles see Amitābha Buddha in the polluted world bodhisattvas see Amitābha Buddha in the Pure Land
These two statements indicate that the land of retribution is simply pure the land of response contains both impurity and purity
Thus the Jingtu lun says
There are ve kinds of lands
The rst is the simply pure land This is attributed only to the fruit of buddhahood
The second is the pure and impure land Here purity dominates impurity
This is attributed to bodhisattvas of the eighth stage and above
The third is the land of balance between purity and impurity This is attributed to bodhisattvas of the rst to seventh stages
The fourth is the impure and pure land Here impurity dominates purity This is attributed to beings at the stage of nature  which is lower than the bodhisattvas ten stages mentioned above
The fth is the impure land This is attributed to those who have not entered the stage of nature
Those in the fth land see this last land but do not see the rst four
Those in the fourth land see the last two lands but do not see the rst three
Those in the third land see the last three lands but do not see the rst two
Those in the second land see the last four but do not see the rst
The buddhas in the rst land know and see thoroughly all the ve lands above and below
Scriptures and treatises disagree with each other There are ten theories
According to some one practice leads to rebirth in the Pure Land
Thus the Nirvana Sutra says King Youde and the monk Juede are reborn in the Kingdom of the Immovable due to their efforts to guard the teaching Also the Weimo jing says
The straightforward mind is the bodhisattvas pure land
When the bodhisattva attains buddhahood he does not speak falsely and sentient beings are reborn in his buddha land
According to some two practices lead to rebirth in the Pure Land
According to the Liang She lun  Good dharmas that lead one beyond this world refer to the good roots produced by nondiscriminating knowledge and by subsequently obtained knowledge
They are named as the cause of good dharmas that lead one beyond this world
Sometimes meditation and wisdom are said to constitute the vehicle
According to some three practices lead to rebirth in the Pure Land
The Nirvana Sutra saysThinking in the three concentrations of emptiness noncontrivance and no characteristics leads to rebirth in the Pure Land The Guan wuliangshoufo jing says
For all future ordinary beings to be reborn in the Pure Land they must cultivate three works
First they must look after their parents with love serve their teacher avoid killing and practice the ten good deeds
Second they must receive the Three Refuges and the complete precepts for monks and nuns and not violate ritual rules
Third they must produce the mind of seeking enlightenment  and believing deeply in the relationship between causes and consequences and reciting Mahayana scriptures they must be diligent in practice
These three things are called the work of purity
According to some four practices lead to rebirth in the Pure Land
The Weimo jing says
The four limitlessly seless minds are the bodhisattvas pure land
When the bodhisattva attains buddhahood he lovingkindness compassion  empathetic joy and equanimity  and sentient beings are reborn in his buddha land
The four methods of guiding others are the bodhisattvas pure land
These are the bodhisattvas pure land
When the bodhisattva attains buddhahood he liberates the sentient beings under his guidance and they are reborn in his pure land
According to some ve practices lead to rebirth in the Pure Land
The Jingtu lun says The rst is worship the second is praise the third is making a vow the fourth is contemplation and the fth is redirecting merit According to some six practices lead to rebirth in the Pure Land
The Weimo jing says Giving is the bodhisattvas pure land
When the bodhisattva attains buddhahood he can make the gift of everything and sentient beings are reborn in his pure land The passage continues listing each of the six perfections and ends with the following
Wisdom is the bodhisattvas pure land
When the bodhisattva attains buddhahood he is endowed with every kind of wisdom and sentient beings are reborn in his pure land
According to some seven practices lead to rebirth in the Pure Land
The Weimo jing says
covered with the owers of seven purities and those who bathe there are free of impurities
First is the purity of precept second is the purity of meditation and third is the purity of insight
Fourth is the purity of being free from doubts about salvation fth is the purity of distinguishing the right path from the wrong path sixth is the purity of practice and seventh is the purity of the knowledge that leads to the destruction of bonds
The rst two refer to the path of expediency
The next three refer to the path of insight
The next refers to the path of practice
The last one refers to the path that transcends learning
Through these seven purities the four paths are realized
When the four paths are realized one dwells through karmic retribution in the Pure Land
According to some eight practices lead to rebirth in the Pure Land
The Weimo jing says
Which dharmas do bodhisattvas practice perfectly to be reborn in the Pure Land
Answer
Through realizing eight dharmas they are reborn in the Pure Land To benet sentient beings generously without expecting rewards to suffer various pains in place of other sentient beings
To donate all the merits that one has acquired
To treat others equally readily humbling oneself
To view all bodhisattvas as if they were buddhas
To be free of doubt when hearing scriptures that one has not heard before
Not to disagree with hearers 
Not to be envious of offerings given to others and to promote ones own gains to gain control over ones mind
To always reect on ones faults and not accuse others of their failings to always seek merit singlemindedly
According to some nine practices lead to rebirth in the Pure Land
The Wuliangshou jing says To speak in outline there are three categories to speak in detail there are nine levels  According to some ten practices lead to rebirth in the Pure Land
The Weimo jing says
The ten good deeds are the bodhisattvas pure land
When the bodhisattva attains buddhahood sentient beings who enjoy long lives are wealthy and who follow the path of purity who speak truthfully always with gentle words and who do not abandon their congregation who are good at resolving conicts and whose words always are benecial who are not jealous nor angry and who hold correct views will be born in his pure land
The Mile fawen jing says
Those who wish to be reborn in the Pure Land cultivate the ten thoughts that will enable them to be reborn there
To constantly maintain compassion for all sentient beings
To never disparage other peoples practices those who do so will never be reborn in the Pure Land
From the depth of their hearts to form the sentiment of lovingkindness toward all sentient beings and abandon the sentiment of cruelty
To produce the commitment to protect the teaching and to be willing to sacrice ones life for it to never revile any item of the teaching
In enduring to remain rmly convinced 
To keep ones mind deeply pure and not be deled by prots
To produce in ones mind the wisdom that knows everything in its particularity to constantly meditate and to never neglect meditation
To entertain toward all sentient beings the sentiment of honoring them and to abandon arrogance to be humble in speech
To never form attachment to conversation
The mind that is close to enlightenment produces a variety of conditions that form roots of goodness and does not produce disturbing and distracting thoughts
To contemplate the Buddha constantly in thought and remove all other objects that appear in the mind
You should know Maitreya that if one keeps these ten thoughts arising one after another one will certainly be reborn in the Pure Land
It is also said  The thirtyseven auxiliaries of enlightenment are the bodhisattvas pure land
When the bodhisattva attains buddhahood sentient beings who understand the four applications of mindfulness the four right efforts the four bases of psychic power the ve dominant faculties the ve powers the seven limbs of enlightenment and the eight limbs of the path  will be reborn in his Pure Land
Or as the Wuliangshou jing ref
Guan wuliangshoufo jing Tc Note The views presented above differ from each other in that some give detailed accounts while others are only summaries Yet through following one and the same teaching and being in accord with the mysterious principle every practitioner is able to be reborn in the Pure Land Verses from the Wuliangshou jing youbotishe say
Observing the universe I go beyond the three worlds The highest state is like empty space wide and limitless The correct path is lled with great compassion By renouncing the world planted the root of goodness that brings benets Accompanied by the light of purity he shines light like a mirror like the sun and the moon
In order to be reborn in the Pure Land on the basis of real retribution one must renounce the householders life and produce the correct cause that is undeled
Only when ones practice accords with the true principle will a person achieve rebirth in the Pure Land
If people in the lowest of the three categories of human beings who have never engaged in the correct practice accidentally perform one practice or on the day of their death entertain the thought of the Buddha ten times they are reborn in the provisionally manifested Pure Land but they are unable to see the retribution Pure Land Details of the methods of contemplation are found in the tenfascicle essay on Great and Small Vehicle methods of meditation
The Amituo guyinshengwang tuoluoni jing says
At that time the Worldhonored One told the monks At the present time a buddha has appeared in the Western World of Happiness
He is called Amitābha
If a member of the congregation correctly upholds the name of this buddha due to the merit produced by this when he faces death Amitābha accompanied by a large group of attendants will go to him and will enable to see him
When the person sees the Buddha and his attendants he will be lled with joy and his merit will double
Because of this development his rebirth will never take the deled form 
He will be spontaneously born in the pure and colorful location of a lotus ower decorated with jewels
Endowed with six supernatural powers and shining brilliantly Amitābha Buddha is accompanied by hearers
He is the Tathāgata One Worthy of Receiving Offerings  and has obtained universal wisdom

The Buddha told Maitreya Due to the name of Amitābha Buddha it will be easy even to pass through the middle of a ferocious re in the large cosmic system The Huayan jing says
At that time the bodhisattva mahāsattva Xinwang said to the other bodhisattvas Sons of the Buddha one world age in ākyamuni Buddhas land in this sahā world is one day and one night in Amitābha Buddhas land in the World of Happiness
One world age in the World of Happiness is one day and one night in the diamond buddha land in the Shengfuchuang world

This buddha land is lled with great bodhisattvas such as Samantabhadra Bodhisattva
The Amituofo jing says
The Buddha said to the community of monks  This Crown Prince Ajāta śatru and these sons of ve hundred wealthy householders after an innumerable number of world ages will all become buddhas comparable to Amitābha Buddha The Buddha continued This Crown Prince Ajātaśatru and these sons of ve hundred wealthy householders after having stayed on the bodhisattva path for an innumerable number of world ages and having made offerings to forty billion buddhas have now returned to make offerings to me
At the time of Kāśyapa Buddha in the previous age Crown Prince Ajātaśatru and these sons of ve hundred wealthy householders were my disciples
Mutual acquaintances are now gathered together Miracle Stories Song dynasty  Monk Senglian Layman Ge Jizhi Nun Huimu Wei Shizi Monk Tanyuan Liang dynasty  Monk Fayue Sui dynasty 
Fifty images of the fty bodhisattvas Monk Huihai Tang dynasty  Monk Daoang Monk Shangzhou Song Dynasty The monk Sengliang of Changsha Temple in Jiangling was passionate in his commitment and rm in his observation of the precepts
He wished to be reborn in the Western Pure Land and made a vow to produce a six zhangtall Amitābha image
He made immense efforts but even after many years he could not fulll the vow
He heard that the shrine at Mount Guqi in Xiangzhou had a great number of bronze vessels
He wanted to convert the deities and use the metal there to fulll his vow
The monk went to Regional Inspector Zhang Shao and explained the situation to him asking him to make available several boats and a hundred strong men
Zhang said This shrine has miraculous powers Those who violate it are killed immediately
Furthermore barbarians guard it It would be difcult to accomplish your goal
liang said I will share the benet with you my Lord
The death will be only mine Zhang then offered the monk the men and the boats
Even before the night had passed the deities learned of what was to take place
Strong winds shook the mountain and it became dark with heavy clouds Birds and animals made strange sounds
When liang arrived suddenly the mist cleared and the sun shone
As they approached the shrine they saw two large bronze vessels each several hundreds of hu in size about twenty steps in front of it
They saw a large snake over ten zhang long jump out of a vessel and stretch across their path
The hundred men accompanying the monk all retreated
liang straightened his robe and proceeded
Shaking his staff he said to the snake The karmic effects of your sins in previous lives caused you to be reborn as a snake
As you have not heard of the Three Treasures why did you pull yourself out of the vessel
I am making a six zhangtall Amitābha image and heard that this place has many bronze vessels So I have come from afar to visit it
Will you please not block the road and allow me to proceed The snake then raised its head looked at liang and withdrew
liang then led the men to remove all the vessels which they loaded onto handdrawn carriages
At the end of the hall there was one vessel four sheng in capacity which served as a spittoon
A lizard over two chi long was jumping in and out of it
This vessel was not taken
Of the vessels that were large and heavy fewer than one in ten was taken
They lled the boats with the small vessels of high quality and started back
The guardians of the shrine did not dare stand in their way
liang returned to the city and cast the image
The work was completed in the ninth year of the Yuanjia period 
Handsome and austere the image shone in dignity
The story of the miraculous circumstances around the miraculous production of the image spread widely to the capital city
Emperor Wen of the Song dynasty respectfully brought the image to the capital city and since it lacked the aming halo he ordered a gold leaf halo to be made for it
He wanted to house the image at Anle Temple but many recommended the pagoda at Pengcheng named after its location and placed in a prominent place near the gate
The image was sent there At the beginning of the reign of Emperor Ming the emperors previous residence was turned into a temple and a request was made to move the image there
Thus the image used to reside in the great hall of Xianggong Temple
This miracle story is from the Gaoseng zhuan Ta Ge Jizhi was a man from Jurong and a descendent of Zhichuan
His wife was from the Ji family of the same commandery
She was very elegant in appearance and possessed womanly virtues
Jizhi devoted his life to the study of immortals
His wife also did the same but her mind found delight in the Buddhas teaching
She never tired of constantly cultivating the virtue of sincerity
In the thirteenth year of the Yuanjia period  while she was working at her loom she realized that the clouds had suddenly dispersed and the sun was shining brightly The sky was clear
So she put down the handle of the loom and looked around in all directions
In the western direction she saw the true form of the Tathāgata while decorated canopies and banners glittered throughout the Milky Way
Delighted she said to herself This must be Amitābha Buddha of whom the scripture speaks She immediately lowered her head and paid respect to the Buddha
Seeing her pay respect in this way Jizhi went to her
His wife took his hand and pointed to where the Buddha was 
Jizhi could also see half of the Buddhas body and the banners and canopies
Suddenly the vision disappeared
The clouds and the sun shone brilliantly with vecolored light
Neighbors and relatives all saw the bright sky
After a while the light slowly disappeared
Many in this village took refuge in the Dharma
The surname of the nun Huimu was Fu
She renounced the householders life at age eleven and upheld the precepts of the Small Vehicle
She stayed at the temple in Zhuyi Village in Liang Commandery
When she began reading the Larger Perfection of Wisdom Scripture she read two fascicles each day
Her teacher Huichao once built a scripture hall
mu went there to pay respects and saw a monk in the northeastern corner inside the building
He was golden in color and wore a black robe His feet did not touch the ground
Again when she was reciting the scripture while lying down in the middle of the night she dreamed that she saw in the western direction lotus owers in a bathing pool
Beings who had reached there by transformation sat in these owers
There was one large ower the only ower in which no one was sitting
mu wanted to climb into the ower
As she pulled herself without thinking she began to recite the scripture
Her voice was loud and mus mother thinking that she was having a nightmare woke her up
mus mother was very old and had lost all her teeth
mu always chewed food for her mother to feed her
Because she had chewed food for her mother after midday she thought that she could not be entirely pure and even though she had reached the appropriate age she refused to accept the complete set of precepts for full ordination
After her mother passed away mu removed weeds from around the temple and opened the altar
She requested her master to confer on her the complete set of precepts Suddenly at the altar she saw heaven and earth appear in brilliant light Everything was golden in color
When she looked up and turned her head to the west she saw a deity wearing a manylayered silken robe
The color of the robe was reddishyellow The deity approached mu and then moved away and then disappeared after a while
She kept these miraculous visions to herself and did not speak of them to others
mus elder brother was a monk and having heard something of these visions he wanted to know the details
He provoked her You have been cultivating the Way for many years and yet nothing extraordinary has happened to you
You should now grow out your hair and leave the convent When she heard this mu was frightened thinking that he meant what he said
So she told him in rough outline about the visions
Only the nun Jingcheng had heard of mus attainments
cheng went to her and becoming friendly with her skillfully managed to ask questions about her visions
mu told her the story in detail
Later when mu was worshiping Amitābha Buddha in the company of her colleague she prostrated herself on the ground and did not get up again
Everyone thought she had fallen asleep
Her colleagues nudged her and asked her questions but mu did not answer
Jingcheng alone was distressed and asked persistently
mu said When I prostrated myself on the ground I dreamed I went to the Pure Land and saw the Buddha who preached to me the Shorter Perfection of Wisdom Scripture
When I had obtained the rst four fascicles I was nudged and awakened
I regret this greatly mu died in the fourteenth year of the Yuanjia period 
She was sixtynine years old
Wei Shizi was a man from Liang Commandery
He was diligent in serving the Dharma and his son and daughter also honored and cultivated it
Only his wife was misguided and did not believe in Buddhism
At the beginning of the Yuanjia period  Wei Shizis daughter who was fourteen years old died of illness but after seven days she revived and said Prepare a high seat and place on it a copy of the Wuliangshou jing Shizi immediately set up the scripture seat
The daughter rst puried herself and worshiped it
Even though she had never read Buddhist scriptures before she then sat on the seat and began to chant the scripture
Her voice was clear and beautiful
After coming down from the seat she said to her father As soon as I died I went to the Pure Land and saw that inside the pond there were already three large lotus owers for you my elder brother and myself
We will be reborn there later by transformation
Only a ower for my mother was missing
I could not bear this so I came back to report on this Having said this she lost consciousness again
Thereupon the mother began to honor the Dharma
Ho Tanyuan was a man from Lujiang
His father Wanshou served as Palace Aide to the CensorinChief
yuan served the Dharma most diligently and upheld the bodhisattva precepts
At the age of eighteen in the ninth year of the Yuanjia period  his father died and out of extreme grief Tanyuan became ill and almost died
In addition to the ritual shouting and dancing practiced on such occasions in his mind he took refuge in the Pure Land and prayed for a miraculous response
At that time yuan invited monks to his residence and several monks including his teacher Senghan were always there
yuan constantly expressed repentance for his past karma toward han fearing that these conditions would in the end prevent a miraculous response from happening
Every time Senghan urged him to practice diligently and not slacken in his efforts
On the sixteenth day of the tenth month the monks went to sleep after the scriptural recitation
During the fourth watch Tanyuan suddenly began to speak chanting verses
Senghan was taken aback and questioned him
yuan said I see the body of the Buddha golden in color and shaped like the walking image here
Golden light surrounds the body and shooting ames reach higher than nine zhang
Banners and owers are all around the Buddha lling the entire sky
It is beautiful beyond words At that time yuan was in the western anteroom
Saying that the Buddha comes from the West he turned toward the western direction and lingered there calling to the vision as it quickly receded
Tanyuan suffered chronically from asthma and had difculty breathing
Yet on that evening he was vigorous and moved about jauntily He then raised his hand doused it with perfume and taking owers from the garden he scattered them around the Buddha
His mother said to yuan If you go now will you not think of me yuan did not reply
Suddenly he took to bed
People in the household had been believers and when they heard about this miracle they were delighted They were not greatly distressed
At the fth watch yuan died
The residence was lled with a fragrance that lasted for several days
Liang Dynasty Fayue of Zhenjue Temple in the capital city was a monk who followed simple precepts
Toward the end of the Qi dynasty he was appointed head monk and stayed at Zhenjue Temple engaged in the work of building temples
All four divisions of the Buddhist community  followed him willingly
yue had heard of the eight zhangtall golden image at Songwang Temple in Pengcheng which had been produced by Wang Zhongde Chariot and Horse General and Regional Inspector of Xuzhou under the Song dynasty 
In the craftsmanship of its beautiful features the image stood out as the best in the region north of the Changjiang River
Whenever there were disturbances around the border of the region or irregularities in the monastic community the image sweated the amount of the precipitation corresponded to the severity of the catastrophes
At the beginning of the Taishi period under the Song dynasty Pengcheng belonged to the north
Barbarians tried to move the statue yet even ten thousand workers could not move it
At the beginning of the rule of the Qi dynasty several commanderies belonging to Yanzhou rebelled and joined the south and monks were forced to assist in the defense of a fortress
At that time the Duke of Lanling who led the barbarian troops conquered the fortress and took many monks as prisoners
He then proceeded to imprison all the monks in the two rebel regions and reported to the illegitimate court that they had abetted the rebellion
At that time the image sweated and the entire hall became wet
Qian the illegitimate prince of the Liang was in Pengcheng at the time
Not knowing whether to believe the report he went himself to the location of the statue and had it cleaned off but as people wiped the gure the sweat came pouring out and could not be stopped
The prince then burned incense and worshiping the image sincerely pledged The monks are innocent
I myself will protect them and not allow harm to come to them
If the miraculous power of the image is real let the sweat stop pouring out when I wipe it Thereupon he wiped the image with his own hand
As he did so the spot he touched became dry
The prince reported this in detail to the court and all the captured monks were released
yue took delight in seeing miraculous images and vowed to go to see this statue and worship it but it was sheltered in an inaccessible place and in the end he did not succeed in fullling this vow
Emperor Ming of the Song dynasty had previously tried to make a golden image eight zhang in height
After four unsuccessful attempts to cast the gure he reduced its height to four zhang
yue and Zhijing a monk at Baima Temple gathered supporters and wanted to recast the image as an eight zhangtall image of Amitābha
Having declared this intention they began collecting the metal
This was toward the end of the rule of the Qi dynasty when the world was in disorder
The project had to be abandoned
At the beginning of the succeeding Liang dynasty the project was presented to the court again and permission was granted
Assistance was offered as well for making the halo and the base of the image
Competent administrators and skilled artisans would be provided as needed
On the third day of the fth month of the eighth year of the Tianjian period at Xiaozhuangyan Temple a buddha image in the original size was cast
Forty thousand jin of copper were melted and used yet this did not ll the mold even to the height of the chest 
Many prominent families sent immeasurable amounts of copper which was melted down and poured but the mold was still not completely lled
The difculty encountered earlier appeared to have recurred
This was reported to the court
The emperor issued an edict to send three thousand jin of copper as a spiritual donation When they began to make the preparations for this gift at the court a beautiful carriage used at the palace appeared at the side of the furnace
The attendant brought the edict the copper was on the carriage The container of the copper ew up and as the metal was melted down the mold was lled at once
Both the carriage and its attendant soon disappeared
When the copper sent by the court arrived it became known that copper had been received earlier from a different source
This was truly a miraculous occurrence
Artisans danced in delight and monks nuns and laypeople uttered praises
When the mold was opened and the size of the image was measured the image had expanded to nine zhang tall yet the halo tted it perfectly
Two large coins which had not been melted down were found in the folds of the robe
Nobody could gure out how this could have happened
Forty thousand units of copper were rst calculated to be more than sufcient
The three thousand used later should not have been sufcient to cover the shortfall
Yet miraculous occurrences are not guided by designs of the mind
Thus the mysterious working of divine principles is beyond human comprehension
When the the material for the image was rst completed the monk Daoshao happened to be practicing repentance rites through the night
Suddenly where the material had been placed he saw a brilliant light
Looking at it closely and for a long time he realized that it was a miraculous manifestation of divine light
Three days after the casting took place when the mold had not yet been opened Meditation Master Daodu a noble and strict monk donated his sevenpiece robe to cover the cost of opening the mold around the crown on the head of the image
Suddenly he saw two monks kneeling down and opening the mold around the images hair knot
When he came closer to look at them they suddenly disappeared
When the monks yue and jing passed away one after the other the court issued an edict entrusting the care of the image to Sengyou of Dinglin Temple
On the twentysixth day of the ninth month of the same year the image was moved to Guangzhai Temple
There was no rain that month and dust was everywhere
On the night before the image was to be moved light clouds lled the sky above and a gentle rain provided moisture to the area
Sengyou was performing walking meditation at the place where the image was thinking of the weather
From a distance he saw the light of ames darting up and down around the image
The light looked like lamps or candles
He also heard voices uttering words urging repentance and worship
He entered through the door to investigate the matter closely Everything immediately disappeared
Jiang Xiaosun the guard of the temple also saw this at that time
That night merchants on the Huai River all heard voices from under a large ship urging that the bridges be repaired
Several hundreds of people seemed to have been there
Thus people realized that the image had miraculously become so heavy that it could not be moved by human beings
Later the halo and base were cast both of which were also extraordinary
This statue is the best of golden images east of the Cong River
This story about two miraculous images is from the Liang gaoseng zhuan Tba Sui Dynasty The images of Amitābha Buddha and fty bodhisattvas that existed at the time of Sui rule were miraculous images from the Western Region of India
According to tradition a bodhisattva of Kukkuṭārāma Temple who possessed ve supernatural powers went to the Pure Land and presented a request to Amitābha Buddha Sentient beings in the sahā world make vows to be reborn in the Pure Land but they do not have a representation of the Buddha as an image from which they might draw the power to uphold the vow
Please confer an image on them The Buddha said You should return rst the image will soon appear there When the bodhisattva returned the image was already there
one buddha and fty bodhisattvas each sitting on a lotus ower had appeared on a tree leaf
The bodhisattva took the leaf and copied what was on it These copies circulated widely
Emperor Ming of the Han had a miraculous dream and sent messengers in search of the proper way to pray to the deity the messengers successfully brought Kāśyapa and Mātaṅga to Luoyang
Later a son of Mātaṅgas sister who had become a monk brought this same miraculous image painting to China and had copies of it made
After a short while he took the image painting back to the West
The copies were preserved but not circulated widely
Many years passed through the times of the Wei and Jin dynasties 
During persecutions of the Buddhist teaching copies of scriptures and images were destroyed
Miraculous occurrences around this painted image almost disappeared
When Emperor Wen of the Sui dynasty restored support to Buddhism a monk called Mingxian obtained from Dharma Master Daochang of the Northern Qi dynasty a copy of a painting
The explanation of the origin of this painting agreed with the existing tradition 
Therefore he made copies of the painting and circulated them everywhere throughout the empire
At that time there was a Northern Qi painter called Cao Zhongda originally from the state of Cao who was good at applying colors and very skilled in the Indian style of painting
His copies of miraculous paintings of the West enjoyed a high reputation among people in the capital city Thus the painting on the southern wall of the present temple is an authentic copy of this painting
This story is from the Xiyu zhuanji  The monk Huihai of Anle Temple in Jiangdu whose secular surname was Zhang was from Wucheng in Qinghe Commandery
He studied scriptures and treatises extensively but specialized in Pure Land practices
His singleminded cultivation brought miraculous responses
Unexpectedly the monk Daoquan of Qizhou brought a Amitābha image saying This is the image that the bodhisattva of Kukkuṭārāma Temple who possessed ve supernatural powers and ew in the sky to the Pure Land drew of the buddha there
was always lled with a deep sense of piety and when it became dark he saw a supernatural light shine brightly and auspiciously as he had wished
Thereupon he diligently copied the image and made the vow for rebirth in the Pure Land his constant thought throughout his life
He would suddenly get up in the middle of the night prostrate and face the West as he always did then sit with crossed legs until dawn
He looked happy and austere as if the spirit dwelled within him
On the fth month of the fth year of the Daye period he became mildly ill but as usual he faced the West and sat with legs crossed When dawn came he passed away
He was sixtynine years old
Tang Dynasty Daoang of Hanling Mountain Temple in Xiangzhou  was a man from Wei Commandery
Firmly committed to the faith and upholding its principles he was penetratingly pure in spirit
Alone driven by unusual ambitions he stood nobly outside the world
He had cultivated wisdom and understanding but feared that they did not lead to awakening and so he formed the aspiration to be reborn in the Western Pure Land
Later he learned that his life was about to end and reported this in advance to his acquaintances
He was to leave at the beginning of the eighth month When the time came he was not at all ill
He asked whether it was time for the meal and when the sun was at the midpoint in the sky he ascended the high seat
There was something extraordinary about his appearance and the incense burner produced a strange fragrance
Calling members of the congregation toward him he conferred on them the bodhisattva precepts
His words were incisive and cut through to the hearts of the listeners
At that time the congregation surrounded him to receive his last instructions
ang raised his eyes looked up high and saw large numbers of deities everywhere performing on string and wind instruments
A mournfully beautiful tune was heard clearly from a distance
Gods spoke loudly to the monks gathered there Deities of Tuṣita Heaven playing music have come down to welcome him ang said Karmic retribution is the foundation of life and death This is not what I have sought all this time
I have always prayed for the Pure Land
Why is my wish not heard in spite of the sincerity of this practice When he nished speaking he saw the gods playing music rise up higher and they soon disappeared
Then he saw the western sky lled with incense owers and performers playing music
Like a cloud this vision ew over and circled above his head
All the monks saw it ang said Monks do not be alarmed
Now the spiritual beings from the West have come to welcome me
I should now go to them When he nished speaking the incense burner dropped from his hand and his life came to an end on the high seat
He died at Baoying Temple at the age sixtynine in the eighth month of the seventh year of the Zhenguan period 
Both monks and laymen lamented aloud a crowd as large as a mountain gathered to observe them
When the body was moved for temporary burial on the bottom of his feet characters such as hall of universal light had appeared
The body was sent back to Mount Hanling where a cave was carved in which to place it
After the spring the body had not decayed still sitting upright rmly just as when it was placed there
Furthermore once when Daoang was to give a lecture it was as usual dark in the hall since there was no lamp
He raised his hand high and it emitted a strange light illuminating the whole building
Seeing this the audience wondered where the light had come from
ang said This light is always inside my hand
What are you wondering about If his ways did not match the numinous models and his practice did not t those who are close to sagehood such miraculous occurrences could not have taken place
The monk Shanzhou of Jingying Temple in the Western Capital was from Yingzhou
He was learned in the scriptures and treatises and was particularly well versed in the Nirvana Sutra
He was foremost in the country in his ability to bring out enlightenment in informal discussion
When he was seventyone years old he became ill facing death he said to his disciples All my life I have followed the correct faith in my heart and I never took lightly the Buddhas teaching of principles
I expect to be reborn in the Pure Land He then ordered his chamber swept clean and burned incense solemnly waiting for the event
Many days had passed since he had become ill and he could not sit up in bed but suddenly he sat up by himself and said to his disciples Please let the Worldhonored One take a seat safely He uttered The Worldhonored One came
zhou must now repent This continued for a while and then he said The Worldhonored One is leaving He bowed as if sending someone off
Having lain down he said The person who just came was Amitābha Buddha
Did you not see him
I will soon depart When he had nished speaking these words he passed away
The above three stories are from the gaoseng zhuan compiled during the Tang Tc ac a c Paying Respect to the Buddha Introduction Receiving Precepts Praise Karmic Causes and Vows The Great Enlightened One the Hero of the World benets beings according to their capacities
He is skillful in manifesting the provisional teachings adapting them to circumstances in order to bring salvation in the light of future crises which are appearing quickly
The time has reached the last ages and our lives are like a ame exposed to wind
Nothing is more effective in seeking to benet beings than seeing a buddha
Therefore ākyamuni left the instruction those who cultivate his teaching are entrusted to Maitreya so that they will awaken and realize the result of the holy path
The Great Sage carefully made the arrangement the truth is naturally free of delusion
By thinking of Maitreya even once people are able to meet him and thus be forever separated from the four streams of mental delements  to form the supreme vow of appearing in the Flower Forest of Maitreyas preaching and to miraculously see Maitreyas face in Tuṣita Heaven in this way stimulating the mysterious mechanism of the coming together of cloud and dragon
Thus the Shangsheng jing says
These people have planted good roots in the Dharma
ākyamuni Buddha entrusted them to me Contemplate this one word it is indeed a rm ground for prayer
This scripture was transmitted to China toward the end of the Jin dynasty 
By the time of Song dynasty Maitreya gatherings clearly began to form images of a thousand chi were built taking the ten thousand rentall tree of enlightenment as a model a forest of the imperial palace was set up and a huge assembly gathered
Thereupon the fourfold assembly of the monastic community was delighted and respectfully engaged in the task of spreading the teaching
Every year on auspicious days three Maitreya gatherings were held without fail
From the Qi dynasty the calendar was brought under control and the fortune of the Dharma improved Emperor Wenxuan r  CE
 valued the teaching and supported it widely
Since then however the great gatherings have seldom taken place and practitioners have become rare
Even those who wish to cultivate the path do not have the teaching for pacifying the mind
Excerpts from various scriptures are collected here
It is hoped that those who cultivate in reliance on them will be led to the eightfold path and the fragrance will reach the Purple Palace that the effects of the teaching will include the teaching of the ten good deeds and the brightness of the light will reach Tuṣita Heaven and that the result will be the descent of Maitreya bringing the benet of the rst of his three sermons Comment
If a layperson who has not received the monastic precepts rst turns away from evil ways and takes the Threefold Refuge in each of the six periods of the day accepts and openly takes refuge in the Three Jewels and commits to never to turn away from them he will certainly be reborn in heaven
A member of the vefold monastic community who has received the monastic precepts needs only to keep their practice
They do not have to accept separate precepts
If they fail to obey the precepts and seek the empty thought of good deeds they will not be reborn there
Therefore the Dazhidu lun says
I Soandso take refuge in the Buddha take refuge in the Dharma and take refuge in the Sangha  I Soandso have taken refuge in the Buddha have taken refuge in the Dharma and have taken refuge in the Sangha 
The Chutai jing says The Buddha spoke to Maitreya in verse You who preach on three occasions
It is I who taught you earlier Ninetysix million people receive my teaching of the ve precepts  Then there are those who receive the Three Refuges Ninetytwo million in number They all praise the Buddha together And obtain the Buddhas path
Comment The Jingfu lun in three fascicles discusses the merits of the Three Refuges extensively
Once one has received the Three Refuges they then receive the precepts of the ten good deeds
If one does not perform the ten good deeds he or she is not certain to be reborn in the heavens
One should perform the proper ceremony
before a monk who has renounced the householders life disciplining ones mind sincerely repent
One then receives the precepts saying I Soandso throughout my life will not entertain the thought of murder against any sentient being high or low whether an ordinary person or a saint in this way up until the tenth I Soandso throughout my life will not entertain wrong views against any sentient being high or low whether an ordinary person or a saint 
The ten good deeds protect against the three bodily faults of murder theft and licentiousness the four faults of speech
lying using empty words divisive words and false words and the three faults of the mind
greed anger and wrong views 
These ten are the foundation of all good deeds
To stop these ten faults is good
To commit them is the source of the ten evil deeds
All catastrophes come from this
The Pusa benxing jing says
If someone taught an innite number of people to become pratyekabuddhas or if someone made offerings of the four provisions for over one hundred years the merit would be great
Yet this merit would not be as great as the merit of someone who delights in uttering the fourphrase praise of the Tathāgata who will acquire an innite amount of merits
The Shanjie jing says To offer the treasures of the four realms under heaven and to praise the Tathāgatathere is no difference between the merits acquired by these two Again the Dabei jing says Praising the Buddha even oncethe root of goodness from this enables one to enter nirvana
Its merits are inexhaustible Again the Dabei jing says
If with sincere mind one contemplates the Buddhas merits throwing one ower into the sky in a future world one will become a heavenly king or a king of the Brahmā heavens
The merits of this are inexhaustible and lead one ultimately to nirvana
The Niepan jing says
Kāśyapa praised the Buddha in verse The Great Compassionate One takes pity on sentient beings Therefore he lets me take refuge He skillfully removes the poisonous arrow Therefore he is called the Great Physician Those who have been treated by worldly physicians Though cured will be reborn again Those treated by the Tathāgata Will never again be reborn
The Worldhonored One takes the medicine of immortality And gives it to sentient beings Having taken it sentient beings will Neither die nor be reborn The Tathāgata now for me Has preached the great nirvana  Sentient beings having heard the secret teaching Immediately achieve the condition of neither coming into being nor going out of being The Dafangdeng tuoluoni jing says
At that time Puṣpajāta Bodhisattva praised the Buddha The color of the Worldhonored One is like that of the golden mountain
Like sunlight he illumines the world He removes all suffering Now I worship the great Dharma King The rulers of the world Dharma Kings are extremely rare But a marvelous Dharma like this is even more rare It is difcult to see hear or encounter Those who see it achieve true enlightenment At that time the asura praised the Buddha in verse
The face of the Worldhonored One is like the sun and moon It can destroy all kinds of darkness Now he has brought salvation to us We take refuge in the Honored One among gods The Wenshushili wen jing says
I worship all the buddhas Incomparable guides Six zhang in height a true Dharma body I also worship the buddhas stupas In the places of their births and where they attained enlightenment turned the Dharma wheel and in the places of nirvana In the places they walked stood sat and lied down In all these places I worship The buddhas transcend our thought The marvelous Dharma is also like that If you believe the fruit ripens This too is beyond thought Those who praise the Tathāgata with these verses Over billions of kalpas Will not fall into inferior realms of rebirth The Buddha said Mañjuśrī Well done
Well done
The tathāgatas are beyond thought Then he said in verse
The Buddha was born in the Ikṣvāku clan He disappeared and will not be reborn If people take refuge in him They need not fear suffering in hell The Huayan jing says
Rather than receiving all forms of pain It is better to be able to hear the Buddhas voice Not receiving all forms of happiness And not hearing the Buddhas name For this reason for an innite number of kalpas One receives this pain One cycles in the realm of births and deaths Due to not hearing the Buddhas name The Mile pusa sowen benyuan jing says
The Buddha said to nanda Maitreya is not alone in praising me in verse
In the past ten times an innite number of kalpas ago there was a buddha called Yanguangxiangzuo wang Tathāgata
There was a brahman householder called Xian xing 
He went to the Buddhas place and achieved recognition of the nonarising of dharmas
Brahman Xianxing from that time is the present Maitreya Bodhisattva nanda said to the Buddha If Maitreya achieved recognition of the truth about dharmas a long time ago why did he not quickly reach  the path of the unsurpassed truth and realize highest enlightenment The Buddha said to nanda A bodhisattva refrains from achieving true enlightenment for four reasons
What are the four
First to purify lands second to protect lands third to purify all and fourth to protect all
These are the four reasons
At the time Maitreya originally sought buddhahood he refrained from achieving buddhahood for these four reasons The Buddha said to nanda When I originally sought buddhahood these four reasons also existed
Maitreya gave rise to this intention  for fortytwo kalpas before I did
In this world age of the wise  with great effort skipping nine kalpas I achieved the unsurpassed truth and realized highest enlightenment The Buddha said to nanda It is for ten reasons that I realized highest enlightenment
What are the ten
First to not be attached to possessions second to wives third to children fourth to ones head and eyes fth to ones hands and feet sixth to territory seventh to rare jewels and treasures eighth to ones marrow and brain ninth to ones blood and esh and tenth to not be attached to life
For these ten reasons I quickly attained the Buddhas path
The Dabei jing says The Buddha said to nanda Observe that when the Tathāgata walks on a road he causes the raised places of the ground to become lower and the sunken places to rise
The risen and sunken places all become level
After the Tathāgata has passed by the ground returns to its original condition
All trees bend toward the Buddha
Tree deities appear and worship  lowering their heads
After the Tathāgata has passed the trees return to their original positions
All hills holes toilets lth bushes and broken bricks and tiles become level and swept clean
Strong fragrance lls the air and the ground is covered with owers
The Tathāgata steps on these owers as he walks
Even insentient things lean toward him
No sentient beings fail to pay respect to him
What is the reason for this
When I practiced earlier as a bodhisattva I bowed and paid respect before everyone
I took pure ne and agreeable objects and sincerely offered them to sentient beings with my own hands
As a karmic reward for all this wherever I as a tathāgata walk the ground becomes level and swept clean the broken tiles and bricks are removed
In the places of an innite number of saints as I walked on the road I swept it clean and I repaired buildings with mud with an equitable heart I removed raised and sunken spots and swept and puried 
At all times I sought to obtain wisdom and to benet other sentient beings
Due to these roots of good deeds wherever I as the Buddha walk and come to the beginning of a road the road spontaneously becomes clean and level like the palm of ones hand
The king of mountains Mount Sumeru eightyfour thousand yojanas in height the great ocean of equal depth and the Cakravāḍa mountain range one hundred and sixtyeight yojanas high and also as hard as diamond all bend lower themselves and worship at the time of the Buddhas nirvana
Because of praising the Buddhaāriputra heard others praise the Buddha in verse and obtained the fruit of the path
The Puyao jing says
The monk Aśvajit spoke with these verses
My teacher is the god among gods The highest in the three realms His body has marks and is six zhang tall With supernatural powers he travels through space His teaching enables us to transcend the ve skandhas And put an end to the twelve sensory realms Not seeking greedily the ranks of the gods The mind is puried and the Dharma gate opened
When āriputra heard this he was happy and delighted as if what was dark had become bright
He said Good
For a long time I have had doubts
I love learning and at the age of eight took a teacher by the time I was sixteen I had covered everything
I have traveled in sixteen major kingdoms and thought I had mastered learning but now I have heard that I was wrong
This is the unsurpassed truth and I have realized my original wish Because the Tathāgata in the past puried the mind freeing it of attachments and stopped harming other sentient beings wherever he walks his feet do not dele nor does he harm insects  The Chuchu jing says
The Buddha does not wear shoes for three reasons
First to reduce the desire of the one who walks second to make visible the wheel on the sole of his foot and third to bring delight to those who see this
When the Buddha walks his feet are four inches above the ground for three reasons
First he sees that insects live on the ground second grasses grow on the ground and third to make the supernatural  feet visible
The ground on which the Buddha walks becomes level for three reasons
First he practiced in his earlier lives the four minds of compassion  hoping to bring peace to all
Gods who live on the ground above or in the water and all the insects that happen to be under the Buddhas feetthey were all at peace and stabilized their minds
For this reason what is low becomes raised and what is high is lowered
Second gods and other supernatural beings perform meritorious deeds clearing the ground for the Buddha For this reason what is low is raised and what is high is lowered
Third when the Buddha was a bodhisattva he made roads and bridges passable for people
For this reason he obtained merits and thus what is low is raised and what is high is lowered
the Zhidu lun T
His skin is very thin dust and dirt do not attach to it
His body is like a lotus leaf which rejects dust and water
When the Buddha is on dry ground and walks around in the mountains his feet do not touch the ground
When a sudden gust comes up breaking up an earthen mound into dust even then not even a single particle of dust becomes attached to the Buddhas body
When the Bodhisattva puts food in his mouth from two spots in his mouth the dew of immortality comes out and mixes all the tastes
The new taste is pure and for that reason it is called the superior taste among all tastes
The Zengyi ahan jing says
Those who fail to pay respect to the Buddha will be reborn among dragons and snakes
Having been reborn there previously they still show lack of respect and mental alertness
The Sifen l
Those who respect the elders These people protect the Dharma In this world they attain fame and In the future they are reborn in superior realms of birth The Zan mile siliwen says
Taking refuge with sincere mind I worship the future Maitreya Buddha All the buddhas equally realize the unconstructed substance True suchness principle and reality fundamentally transcend conditions Guided by them the gods appear in Tuṣita Heaven Like a magician they produce many illusory forms Human beings and horses originally nonexistent are taken as existent The accomplished know that they are illusory and have never been as they appear The buddhas bodies are originally pure and like this
Those who are stupid failing to understand say that they are like ordinary beings When we know that the buddhas do not come we see the true buddhas In this way without fail we achieve eternal enjoyment Therefore I pay respect to Maitreya Buddha Wishing only that Maitreya the Compassionate One will bring salvation to sentient beings I vow that together with sentient beings I will be reborn in Tuṣita Heaven and respectfully see Maitreya Buddha
Taking refuge with sincere mind I worship the future Maitreya Buddha
The Buddha has supernatural power that is difcult to comprehend And is able to appear in the dust of many buddha lands Not to speak of appearing now in Tuṣita Hall Sitting crosslegged on the lion seat His body like incomparable gold And his marks shining brightly like jewels Bodhisattvas of supernatural powers innite in number Assist the Buddha in saving living beings Sentient beings can only worship with a sincere mind For him the karmic effects of sins from the beginningless past do not arise Therefore I pay respect to Maitreya Buddha Wishing only that Maitreya the Compassionate One will bring salvation to sentient beings I vow that together with sentient beings I will be reborn in Tuṣita Heaven and respectfully see Maitreya Buddha
Taking refuge with a sincere mind I worship the future Maitreya Buddha Maitreyas jeweled crown appears in many manifested buddhas Surpassing several hundred thousands in number
In this land and elsewhere in assemblies of bodhisattvas He manifests supernatural feats inside jeweled windows From the Buddhas body the rays of the white hair appear eighty thousand in number He preaches constantly and tirelessly turning the Dharma wheel By cultivating works of merit sentient beings In the instant it takes to stretch out ones arm encounter Maitreya the Compassionate One Buddhas as numerous as grains of sand in the Ganges River then appear Not to speak of my original teacher ākyamuni Therefore I pay respect to Maitreya Buddha Wishing only that the Compassionate One will bring salvation to sentient beings I vow that together with sentient beings I will be reborn in Tuṣita Heaven and respectfully see Maitreya Buddha
Taking refuge with sincere mind I worship the future Maitreya Buddha
All the buddhas reside in pure lands Receiving karmic rewards innite in quantity The physical eyes of ordinary beings have not been able to see The buddhas manifest a golden torso measuring one thousand feet So that sentient beings will never tire of seeing it And realize how the fruits of karma appear in Jambudvīpa Only by listening to scriptures and diligently reciting Traveling freely we reach the palace in Tuṣita Heaven
The three realms of inferior births will then be removed forever In the future we will all realize the one Dharma body Therefore I pay respect to Maitreya Buddha Wishing only that the Compassionate One will bring salvation to sentient beings I vow that together with sentient beings I will be reborn in Tuṣita Heaven and respectfully see Maitreya Buddha The Weizengyou jing says
For those of inferior capacities for one thoughtmoment for those of middle capacities for the period of one meal and for those of superior capacities for the period from dawn to noonif for these periods of time one entertains in ones mind thoughts of the ten good deeds and stops thoughts of the ten evil deeds one will be reborn in the Pure Land
Even foxes if they entertain thoughts of the ten good deeds and do not eat for seven days will also be reborn in Tuṣita Heaven
The Shangsheng jing says
After my parinirvāṇa those in the four divisions of the congregation and the eight groups of supernatural beings who wish to be reborn in the fourth Heaven should from the rst to the seventh day think of that heaven uphold the Buddhas prohibitions perform the ten good deeds and dedicate the merit toward rebirth before Maitreya Buddha
following their thoughts they will be reborn there The passage speaks of seven days to use familiar terms If one feels the effects of that heaven how would one not succeed in doing so through one whole life span Again the Shangsheng jing says
Worship of Maitreya Buddha removes the sins acquired through birth and death over a period of ten billion kalpas and then one is reborn in the future under the puṃnāga tree and can also meet the Buddha The Shangsheng jing also says
If after my parinirvāṇa those in the four divisions of the congregation and the eight groups of supernatural beings hear my name and worship after their lives end they will be reborn in Tuṣita Heaven
If those men and women who have violated the precepts and committed many evil deeds hear of this great bodhisattvas name of great compassion throw their bodies and limbs onto the ground and sincerely repent all their evil deeds will quickly be puried
If a person takes refuge in Maitreya Bodhisattva know that they achieve the stage of nonretrogression
After Maitreya has attained buddhahood by looking at the Buddhas halo one obtains the prediction of future enlightenment The Shangsheng jing also says
After the Buddhas parinirvāṇa if some people diligently cultivate various meritorious works do not lack in proper conduct specied in the Vinaya sweep the stupa and paint the ground offer owers and incense perform various samādhis and recite the scriptures such people even if they do not succeed in cutting off all karmic bondage and achieving the six kinds of supernatural powers should concentrate think of the image of the Buddha and recite Maitreyas name
If they accept even for a period of one thoughtmoment the purication of the eight precepts and cultivate various pure practices when their life ends they will be reborn on the lotus terrace in Tuṣita Heaven
Then they will see the light coming out of the Buddhas mark of the white hair which takes them beyond the sins of birth and death for a period of ten billion kalpas
According to the respective conditions of their previous lives the Buddha will preach the superior Dharma to them not letting them regress
Again the Zengyi ahan jing says
Sentient beings who have committed evil deeds of body speech or mind yet who at the moment of death think of the Tathāgatas merits will certainly avoid the three realms of inferior rebirth and be born in heaven
Even the most evil person can be reborn in heaven through meditation on the Buddha
Again the Daji jing says
If those who cultivate compassion see at the time of their death the buddhas of the ten directions rub their heads as the buddhas hands touch them their minds are pacied and lled with pleasure and shortly thereafter they will be reborn in the pure buddha land
Again the Puxianguan jing says
If during the six periods of the day and night one worships the buddhas of the ten directions recites Mahayana sutras and thinks of the ultimate and profound teaching of emptiness in the time it takes to snap ones ngers the sins of births and deaths acquired over as many kalpas as there are grains of sands in ten billion Ganges Rivers will be removed
Those who perform this teaching are the true children of the Buddha
They will follow all buddhas and the buddhas and bodhisattvas of the ten directions will be their upādhyāya teachers this is called the complete bodhisattva precepts
It does not require an ordination ceremony it happens naturally
They should then receive offerings from gods and people
The Fahua jing says
If a person receives recites correctly remembers and interprets the meaning  when that persons life comes to an end one thousand buddhas extend their hands to them to keep them away from fear and from being reborn in inferior realms of birth
That person will immediately be reborn in the place of Maitreya Bodhisattva in Tuṣita Heaven
Maitreya Bodhisattva has the thirtytwo marks and is surrounded by great bodhisattvas with hundreds of thousands of billions of heavenly maidens in attendance That person will be reborn in their midst
These are the merits
Therefore a wise person should singlemindedly copy this scripture himself or cause others to copy receive recite and memorize it and practice according to what is taught in it
The Zhidu lun says
If a good person practices the profound Perfection of Wisdom we should know that he will be reborn in the human realm or in Tuṣita Heaven
Why is this so
In the three inferior realms of rebirth sins and suffering are too strong and therefore it is impossible to practice the teaching of the Perfection of Wisdom
In the heavens of the realm of desire the gods are attached to the ve desires pure and subtle as they are and so their minds are deranged and they cannot practice Perfection of Wisdom
In the heavens in the realm of form the gods are deeply attached to meditative states and so it is impossible to practice it
In the heavens of the formless realm the gods are formless and therefore they cannot practice it
In Tuṣita Heaven there is always a bodhisattva who will be reborn as the future buddha
There the gods constantly preach and hear the Perfection of Wisdom
Even though the power of the ve desires is strong there the power of the Dharma is even stronger
For this reason it is said that these two realms are superior
Sentient beings come from other buddha lands and are reborn here
These are the realms that serve as turning points toward the good
Again the Chuchu jing says There are four reasons why Maitreya does not descend
First sometimes his merits assign him to Tuṣita Heaven
Second people here may be too coarse incapable of receiving scriptures
Third the merits are not sufcient
Fourth there are others who can preach the scriptures in this world
For these reasons Maitreya does not descend
There will still be ve billion seventy thousand and six hundred thousand years before Maitreya will decide to descend
At the time Maitreya descends all human eyes can see four thousand li in the distance This is because in previous lives established ten reasons
First he did not obscure the clarity of the human eye Second he did not damage the human eye
Third he did not cover the human eye
Fourth he did not hide the good deeds of other people
Fifth he did not witness murder
Sixth he did not witness theft
Seventh he did not witness licentious conduct
Eighth he did not look into peoples secrets and weaknesses
Ninth he did not witness any kinds of evil deeds
Tenth he lit lamps at temples
Again the Foshuo milelaishi jing says
The Buddha said When Maitreya Buddha is about to appear the grasses and trees on the ground and in the mountains of Jambudvīpa will all be dried out
At present the circumference of the ground of Jambudvīpa is six hundred thousand li
When Maitreya appears Jambudvīpa will be four hundred thousand li long from east and west and three hundred and twenty thousand li from north and south
Five kinds of fruits will grow on the ground and within the four seas there will be no hills or valleys the ground will be as level as a whetstone Trees will grow tall and people are free from the three evils of greed anger and ignorance
People live in many communities
In a city called Fanluonayi a brahman named Xufan lives
He will become Maitreyas father his mothers name is Moheyueti
Maitreya will be born as their son
All the marks of a buddha are present in him and he will be sixteen zhang tall
He will be born on the ground in the city His eyes will see as far as ten thousand li
The sun inside his head illuminates four thousand li
When Maitreya is enlightened and becomes a buddha he will be sitting under the puṃnāga  tree
The tree will be forty li tall and wide
According to the Da chengfo jing the owers and branches of this tree are shaped like a dragons head thus the tree is called the dragonower tree another tradition says that because it comes from the dragons palace the tree is called the dragonower tree On the eighth day of the fourth month when the morning star appears Maitreya will achieve enlightenment
Five hundred sixty million years after Buddha has withdrawn he will descend The Xiguoxing zhuang by Wang Xuance says
In the second year of the Xianqing period the imperial emissary Wang Xuance traveled to the western kingdoms and sent the Buddhas robe
Southwest of the kingdom of Nipoluo he came to the village of Poluodu
On the bottom of the low ground was a waterre pond
If someone puts re to the surface of this pond the ames rise above the water these ames come out of the water
If someone pours water to exterminate it the re becomes even more powerful
The Chinese messenger and members of his group cooked rice in a pot on it
The messenger asked the king of the country about this
The king answered the messenger Once people pierced a golden casket with a spear and pulled on it
The more they pulled the deeper the casket went
According to tradition this was the gold of the heavenly crown to be worn by Maitreya Buddha when he achieves enlightenment in the future
A re dragon protects it
The re of this pond is none other than the re of this re dragon The Zhidu lun says
When Maitreya Bodhisattva was a layman his teachers name was Bhāvarī
possessed three marks
rst the white hair between the eyebrows second a tongue that could cover his entire face and third the penis sheathed inside the body
Even though he was not yet a bodhisattva he had these marks Again the Xinposha lun says
It is heard that Venerable Mahākāśyapa entered Rājagṛha and begged for almsfood for the last time
Not long after he had eaten his meal he climbed Cocks Foot Mountain
The mountain has three peaks which make it look like a cocks foot The Venerable One went into the mountain sat crosslegged and made the following vow
I vow that this body along with my robe bowl and staff will remain intact until ftyseven koṭī and sixty hundred thousand years have passed Maitreya Tathāgata Arhat Allknowing One will appear in the world and do the things that buddhas do Having made this vow Kāśyapa entered parinirvāṇa
At that time the three peaks merged into one covering the Venerable One sitting in meditation
When Maitreya appears in the world he will be accompanied by an innumerable number of people and gods and they will all come to this mountain
He will say to the assembly Do you want to see Kāśyapa rst among ākyamunis great disciples whose dhūta practice produced a great deal of merit All the people will say We wish to see him Maitreya Tathāgata will then touch the top of Cocks Foot Mountain with his right hand and the mountain will break into three parts
Then Kāśyapa with his robe bowl and staff will emerge from within the mountain and rise up into the sky
Innite numbers of gods and people will observe this miracle marveling at this unprecedented occurrence
Their minds will be brought under control and as they hear the Worldhonored One Maitreya preach they will see the truth
If there is no possibility of the survival of the transformation body  how could such a thing be possible
Some say that this possibility exists
To those who hold this view the question is posed If this is the case why did the Worldhonored One not remain in his transformation body after nirvana and continue preaching
Answer What he had to do had already been done
Therefore all those whom the Buddha should have saved had already been saved
Those who were not saved were meant to be saved by the holy disciples
Some say that no such possibility exists
To those the question is posed If that is the case how could such an event as that attributed to Kāśyapa actually occur
Answer Faithful and respectful gods taught in this way
Some say that at that time Kāśyapa had not entered nirvana he enters nirvana only at the time of Maitreya Buddha
This is incoherent
Why saying that one cannot teach and not say that one remains silent for a long time
Thus to conclude teaching is possible
Therefore Mahākāśyapa has entered nirvana
The powers of ordinary beings are weak the evil deeds they are accustomed to committing are many
Because they live in the sahā world their minds are weak and fearful
Beginners on the path fear that the Dharma may decline and be destroyed and so they make the great vow to support this practice
Then even when their lives come to an end their minds are free of obstruction
Following the roots of good deeds they vow along with other sentient beings to be spontaneously reborn among the inner assembly of Mai treya and to be able to appear before the Buddha to remember and study and to realize the stage of nonretrogression
They do not vow to be born among the outer assembly fearing that attachment to the ve desires may prevent them from achieving salvation
The Zhidu lun says If someone who has cultivated a modest amount of merit hears of the auspicious place and constantly vows to be reborn there when their life comes to an end they will be reborn there The Da zhuangyan lun says
The buddha land is a largescale matter
If someone practices alone his merit will not be sufcient to accomplish the goal
The power of the vow is required
When a strong ox is pulling a carriage a driver is needed in order to reach the destination
The pure buddha land is realized through the vow
Because of the power of the vow its auspicious and meritorious features increase and are not lost or destroyed One sees the Buddha there all the time
Again the Shizhu lun says
For a person to give rise to the thought of following the path and seeking the Buddha ceaselessly
If someone were to hold on his nger the large cosmic system in the sky this would not be as difcult 
Such people who utter the vow aloud saying that they will become a buddha are rare
Why is this
It is because peoples minds are inferior and lack great ambition Again the Faputixin lun says
There are ten great vows that all should cultivate
and in the present body to all sentient beings so that they will turn to the Buddhas path
Let this vow of mine increase in strength from moment to moment let me not forget it in subsequent lives from one to the other and let the vow be always protected by a dhāraṇī
will encounter the Buddha and constantly make offerings to him and that I will not be born in a kingdom where there is no buddha
the left and the right sides just as a shadow accompanies an object
cause me to obtain the ve supernatural powers
circulate in the world understand ultimate truth and obtain the truth of Dharma wisdom they will open the door of understanding
all the worlds in the ten directions make offerings to the Buddha hear and accept the true Dharma and widely bring salvation to sentient beings
the capacities of the audience and that all sentient beings who listen to my Dharma or hear my name will immediately be able to abandon all delements
them pleasure giving up my life and wealth bearing the true teaching which produces benecial rewards
nothing in my mind that practices nor nothing that does not practice
I will teach widely to sentient beings not abandoning the correct vows
I vow that with these ten great vows I will widely teach sentient beings
These vows contain all vows as many as there are grains of sand in the Ganges River
If the number of sentient beings can be counted exhaustively my vows will be exhausted but as the realm of sentient beings is inexhaustible so too my great vows are also inexhaustible
In order to save sentient beings widely the good roots cultivated in an innite number of Dharma realms are all turned together toward ultimate enlightenment
Born before Maitreya Buddha and hearing the pure Dharma one realizes ultimate enlightenment
If one takes the good roots cultivated through ones life while walking standing sitting or lying down and along with sentient beings in the Dharma realm offers them to Maitreya Buddha one will quickly attain the stage of nonretrogression
Dharma Master Xuanzang said In the West monks and laypeople are engaged in the cult of Maitreya
Because Maitreya belongs to the same realm of desire as we do the work can easily prove successful
Both Mahayana and Hinayana teachers approve of this practice
For ordinary deled beings it is more difcult to make Amitābhas Pure Land work successfully
According to the old sutras and treatises bodhisattvas of the ten bhūmis can according to their capacities see the Pure Land of the reward body of Buddha
According to the teaching of the new treatises only bodhisattvas of the three bhūmis can see the Pure Land of the reward body of the Buddha How can sentient beings of lower ranks be reborn in the Pure Land
This is a teaching for a different time period
There is no consensus on this question yet thus in the West Mahayana teachers approve of this but Hinayana teachers do not
For this reason Dharma Master cultivated the cult of Maitreya all his life
At the time of his death he uttered the vow to be reborn and see Maitreya Buddha and asked the assembly to utter the following verses together
Datang Daciensi sanzangfashi Xuanzang zhuan Tc Ta Praise to Maitreya Tathāgata Arhat and Allknowing One Please show your compassionate face to sentient beings Praise to Maitreya Tathāgata Its inner assemblyhaving given up this life I wish to be born among them Miracle Stories Jin dynasty  Jiaoguo Dai Kui Monk Shi Daoan Song dynasty  Nun Shi Huiyu Liang dynasty  Monk Shi Senghu Sui dynasty  Monk Shi Linggan Tang dynasty  The appearance of the Most Superior One is incomparably marvelous
His gure has not been copied in direct light and naturally the features have not been transmitted
To produce the most perfect form with the ngers and nails of worldly beings is to take numbers as a metaphor like reducing ten thousand to one
It has been a thousand years since the parinirvāṇa and images made in the West have come to China
Figures were cast on the basis of scriptures and all efforts were made to produce a resemblance
Famous personages and extraordinary craftsmen competed with each other in this project
Yet the measurements were secret and no one has succeeded in producing perfect images
Jin Dynasty Under the reign of the Jin dynasty there lived a man called Jiaoguo Dai Kui styled Andao
He carried the air of purity and aspired to distant things Enjoying the life of a hermit he stayed away from worldly noise
Staying with principles he let his mind roam among the Buddhas teaching
Skillful and well versed he cleverly measured cosmic processes
Shadowing the characteristics of the Dharma and closely copying the response body of the Buddha he produced Amitābha Buddha and his two bodhisattva attendants
Based on close investigation it was made with great precision
He hid behind curtains and secretly listened to what others said and taking their criticisms into account he carefully rened the image
From thorough measurements of details through investigation of shades of light to its harmonizing coloration and carving techniques  was unsurpassed even by the people of Zhou who used all possible methods to get minute details and the guests of Song who used brushes  beautifully on paper
Dai Kui devoted his efforts for three years before completing the gure unparalleled in history
Everytime someone looked at the statue it appeared just like the Buddha himself
It was then brought to Lingbao Monastery in the Shangyin area
All the monks and laypeople who looked at the image made up their minds to seek wisdom
Chi Chao of Gaoping heard about the gure and came to worship it
He took a pinch of incense and made a vow If this is the eternal reality  let me see his face again 
If not let me see Maitreya Buddha The incense he held in his hand then began to burn by itself and the smoke rose straight up reaching the clouds in the sky
Its powerful fragrance lled the street
All who saw or heard about this miraculous event were lled with joy
The Xuanyan ji compiled by Prince Kang of Linchuan also records this event
Master Tai lived only a hundred steps or so away from Lingbao Monastery
Once Tai rose in the middle of the night and saw a light above the temple
It was extremely bright and he thought it was re
Alarmed he went running to the temple neighbors who heard also came rushing there
When they got to the temple gate however they saw that it was closed and everything was quiet The image was emitting the light
In the morning the monks heard people knocking on the gate and came out to observe
They all saw that the buddha hall was illumined in ames that rose up to the sky
All the observers straightened their postures and paid respect marveling at the innitely varied ways of the Buddhas teaching
Emperor Wen of the Song dynasty welcomed the statue and made offerings to it
It was installed in the back hall permanently
Emperor Gao of the Qi dynasty constructed Zhengjue Monastery
He wanted to have a superior miraculous image to pacify the temple buildings and he moved the statue there
So the gure stayed at Zhengjue Monastery
Kui also made ve walking images after an effort that lasted for ten years
These gures used to be at Waguan Monastery
The second son of Kui whose name was Yong styled Zhongruo had the habitual air of calmness and still water and he enjoyed life in his hermitage
Having inherited the ancestral life of quietude and the correct quest he also wished to continue his quest for artistic skills
Every time Kui crafted an image he carefully examined it with Yong
A childhood friend of Yong Jiang Yi of Jiyang once asked Yong to make an Avalokiteśvara image
Dai worked hard on it thinking of everything he wanted it to be most beautiful
Nevertheless the features were not perfect and the image was not completed for many years
Later someone told him in a dream Jiang Yi has no karmic connection with Avalokiteśvara
You should change the gure to that of Maitreya Dai immediately stopped work and wrote to Jiang to report this but before he had sent his letter a letter arrived from Jiang
Both men had had the same dream on the same evening The words spoken in their dreams matched
Delighted by this miracle Dai changed the gure to Maitreya
Thereupon wherever his hands touched remarkable effects resulted unlike anything he had expected
A perfect shining face suddenly appeared
When informed the people all marveled at this realizing that the prediction of the dream was realized without fail
This image used to be at the Longhua Monastery in Kuaiji
The gures made by the two Dai men are unparalleled in history
They produced many images that are found in many monasteries
It is difcult to record the stories of them all
At Wuji Monastery in Changan under the Jin dynasty there was a monk called Daoan
Though he was physically unimpressive he was unusually intelligent
At age seven he could read and after going over a text twice he could recite it from memory
At age thirteen he left the householders life
Everyday he recited ten thousand words without making a single mistake
His teacher marveled at him conferred on him the complete set of precepts and allowed him to travel for further study
Daoan came to Ye and in a temple he met Fotudeng
When deng saw Daoan he marveled at his exceptional qualities and talked with him all day
Because of this Daoan took deng as his teacher
Whenever deng gave a lecture an went over it in review
Many doubts and criticisms were raised but an answered them with ease
Contemporaries said The black lacquer monk surprised his neighbors Later an moved south to Xiangyang to escape disturbances
With his disciple Huiyuan and over four hundred others he crossed the Jiang River
They traveled at night encountering thunderous storms and lightning
The leading group came to a house
Inside the gate was a horse stable in which a food container large enough to contain one hu of grain for horses was hanging
an called out the name Lin Bosheng The master of the house was surprised and came running
His surname turned out to be Lin and his personal name was Bosheng
Seeing that this was a divine visitor the master treated him courteously
Then the disciples asked Daoan how he had known the mans name
an said Two trees make the character for forest  the container held one hundred sheng When he arrived at Xiangyang Daoan found a foreign bronze gure in an old and unusual style
People did not value it greatly but an said The features of this gure are very good
Only the shape of the beard is not perfect He ordered his disciples to repair the beard
a bright light appeared that lled the room
Looking closely inside the beard they found a piece of a relic
Everyone felt ashamed and was overcome
an said The image has miraculous power as it is Do not bother to change it and stopped the work
When informed the people all said an knew that there was a piece of relic
He deliberately brought it out to show it to the congregation At that time in Xiangyang there was a man called Xi Zuochi whose unparalleled debating skills had captured the attention of his contemporaries
He had heard of Daoans reputation and sent a letter to him which read
I have heard that you an arhat follow the correct path
The luminous nature is made manifest in your mind
Your compassionate teaching illumines monastics and lay followers equally
More than four centuries have passed since the great teaching came to the East
Although sometimes there were rulers in the border regions or private individuals who became devotees yet it was the ancient teachings of China that former generations practiced
The Way has moved and times have changed yet not everyone in the world understands the Buddhist teaching
Recently the prospering of Buddhist activities has been unparalleled
It is said that Prince Moonlight will appear in China and that the Buddhas almsbowl will come here
You Dharma Master took charge of the ancient teaching of the Great Model your teaching reaches all
Monks in China all look up to you with affection
As the auspicious cloud moves eastward maṇi jewels turn and shine and you ascend and sit upon the seat of seven jewels and immediately manifest the lamp of wisdom rain down the sweet dew of immortality on the ourishing grass and plant sandalwood on the banks of the Jiang River the teaching of the Tathāgata is again honored today and the profound waves and superior echoes will wash and purify this world
When Xi heard that an had come to stay  Xi came to pay respect to him
Sitting down he said  the four oceans learn from Zuochi an said All heavens the interpretation of Daoan Contemporaries considered this to be an excellent answer
an constantly wrote commentaries on scriptures yet feared that some of his views may not agree with truth
So he made a vow If what I say is not very far from truth let me see an auspicious sign Then in a dream he saw an Indian monk with white hair and long eyebrows who said Your commentaries on the scriptures quite agree with truth
I am not to enter nirvana and live in the Western Region
I will help you spread your teaching
From time to time set up an offering of a meal Later when the Sarvāstivādavinaya was brought to China Master Huiyuan realized that the monk Daoan had dreamed of was PiṇḍolaBharadvāja
So he set up a seat and offered food
This became the rule everywhere Beneting others was the principle of ans virtue His learning covered all three piṭakas 
He established the model of monastic behavior and the principle of the Buddhas teaching
It contained three items
the instructions for presenting incense preparing the seat presenting the scripture and giving the lecture the instructions for the practices at the six daily time periods and at times of eating drinking and chanting the instructions for upavasatha sending messengers and repentances
Temples everywhere came to follow these norms
With his disciple Fayu and others before the Maitreya gure an made a vow to be reborn in Tuṣita Heaven
Later on the twentyseventh day of the rst month of the twentyrst year of the Jianyuan period of the Qin dynasty a strange monk quite ordinary and rustic in appearance came to the temple and asked for lodging
Since the monastic quarters were already crowded he was housed in the lecture hall
At that time the temple administrators quarter faced this building and at night the administrator saw the monk go in and come out from the window
He quickly reported this to an
an taken aback came to pay respect to the monk and asked the reason for his visit
The monk answered I came to help you an said My sins are so deep How can I be saved The monk answered Certainly you can be saved
If you bathe holy monks soon you will denitely obtain what you seek The monk taught him the procedure for bathing in detail
an asked where he would be born in his next life
The monk then circled an area in the northwestern direction in the sky
Immediately the clouds cleared and an saw in detail the Tuṣita Heaven of superior karmic reward
That evening dozens of members of the assembly all saw this an later prepared bathing implements
He saw extraordinarily small children accompanied by dozens of people come to the monastery and after a while take a bath
This indeed was a miraculous response
On the eighth day of the second month of the same year he suddenly told the assembly I am about to depart On that day after the meal he died without illness
He was buried at Wuji Temple
The year was the tenth year of the Taiyuan period of Jin 
His age was seventytwo
Before he died an had heard that Kumārajīva was in a western kingdom He wanted to share in his lectures and discussions and repeatedly advised Jian to to go and invite him
Kumārajīva had also heard of an from afar saying that he was the eastern sage to whom he frequently used to pay respect from a distance
When an was born he had a piece of skin over one cun wide attached to his arm
It could be moved up and down but could not be removed from the hand
Because of this people called him Sealhand Bodhisattva Sixteen years after ans death Master Kumārajīva arrived
Kumārajīva was greatly disappointed not to be able to see him and deplored this fact endlessly
an greatly valued scriptures his ambition was to spread the Dharma
He invited the foreign monks Saṃghadeva Dharmānanda and Saṃghabhadra who translated numerous scriptures in over ten million words
With the monk Fahe he always checked the characters and examined the meaning of the translated text
The newly translated scriptures for this reason are reliable
Sun Chuo wrote the Essay on Virtuous Monks 
He described Daoan by saying Shi Daoan is versed in a wide range of topics and talented in interpreting the letters and underlying principles of scriptures He also praised him in verse
Widely bringing salvation to others He naturally was in charge of many people
Deep and quiet is Shi Daoan
He can double 
His reputation ies over the valleys and hills
His fame reaches the Huai River and the ocean
Though his body has undergone transformation It is as if he is still with us all the time
According to another record there was another Zhu Daoan in Hebei who shared the same name as Shi Daoan
Xi Zuochi is said to have sent his letter to this Zhu Daoan
When Daoan had rst become a student of his teacher he adopted the surname of Zhu later he changed it to Shi
Thus references to these two surnames exist Therefore it is a mistake to think that the men were two different people
The above two stories are from the Liang gaoseng zhuan Tc Song Dynasty The nun Shi Huiyu of Changan practiced diligently and was thoroughly informed in the teachings of the scriptures and vinayas
Once while she was staying at the temple of Minister Xue she saw a red and white light for over ten days
On the eighth day of the fourth month a monk of Liuchong Monastery came to this temple and at the place from where the light emerged he discovered a golden image of Maitreya over one chi tall
Later Huiyu moved south to Ying and lived at Lingshou Monastery
One evening in the tenth month of the fourteenth year of Yuanjia she saw a bright purple light in a tree east of the temple the light illuminated the entire forest
She told her fellow student Miaoguang and others but none of them could see the light
For over twenty days yu saw the light constantly
Later the head of the monastery Shi Fahong was building a place for meditation under the tree he looked up and found a golden seated image among the branches It is also said to have been over one chi tall
Liang Dynasty Shi Senghu at Mount Shicheng in Shan was originally from Shan in Kuaiji
He renounced the householders life at an early age and trained vigorously upholding the precepts with rigor
Later he moved to Yinyue Monastery at Mount Shicheng in Shan
There was a cliff of green rock north of the monastery
The cliff went straight up to a height of dozens of zhang
In the middle of the cliff was a pattern that looked like the ame and light of buddha images
There were bushes and trees on top of the cliff and their twisting trunks covered the cliff
In the course of his meditation Senghu frequently walked to the wall saw bright light illuminating it and heard instrumental music and songs of praise
He then held an incense burner up to it and made a vow to carve a stone image into the mountain cliff ten zhang tall
This image would represent the one thousand chitall Maitreya gure so that those with appropriate karmic afliations would gather to see this buddha preach on the three future occasions
During the Jianwu period of the Southern Qi dynasty Seng hu gathered monks and laymen to form a group to support this project and began carving the image
After several years when only the rough outline of the face of the image had been carved Senghu fell ill and died
Just before his death he made a vow that his project was not something that anyone could nish in one lifetime and that he would complete the project in his next incarnation
Later another monk called Sengshu resumed the project but lacking resources he was unable to bring it to completion
In the sixth year of the Tianjian period of the Liang dynasty Lu Xian of Wu Commandery the former director of Shifeng had left his assigned post and was returning to the capital
While he was spending the night near a stream in Shan the wind began to blow and it started to rain it became very dark Lu Xian was frightened
In a halfasleep state he had a dream Three monks came and said to him If your faith is correct and rm you will naturally be safe
The honorable one of Jianan is suffering from illness and is not yet cured
If you can arrange to have the stone image begun by Senghu brought to completion the prince will regain his health
Miraculous communication is not unreal
You should get started on the work Xian returned to the capital but after a year he forgot about this dream
Later when was departing out of a gate he saw a monk and invited him to give a lecture and stay overnight at his residence
The monk said Dont you remember the matter about the Prince of Jianan which I entrusted to you last year near the stream in Shan Frightened Xian said I dont remember The monk said laughing You should think about it carefully and took his leave
Xian realized that this was no ordinary monk and immediately went after him but after a hundred steps the monk disappeared
Xian suddenly understood the meaning of the monks statements and remembered his earlier dream
The monk was the third of those whom he had seen near the stream in Shan
Xian then went to the Prince of Jianan
The prince reported the story to the emperor
The emperor then ordered Vinaya Master Sengyou to take charge of the matter of completing the gure
Overjoyed the prince strengthened his faith made offerings and vowed to complete the work of carving the image
The day before Sengyou arrived a monk at Monastery had a dream in which a great deity wearing a black robe accompanied by an army of powerful soldiers stood at the site of the cave in which the gure was being carved discussing measurements
The next day Vinaya Master you arrived
Such was the miraculous nature of this event
The cave Senghu had carved for the image was too shallow and had to be excavated further to a length of ve zhang
Then the headdress was carved
After that the torso was carved and the polishing of the torso was about to be completed
In the middle of the night the place of the character wan changed its color to red and became raised
On the chest of the present gure the place of the character wan is still not covered with gold leaf and the red color remains
Work on the image began in the twelfth year of Tianjiang and ended in spring of the fteenth year of Tianjiang 
The gure is in a sitting position and is ve zhang tall standing up it would be ten zhang tall
In front of the cave where the gure was carved a threestory platform was built a temple gate and other buildings were also constructed and a community of monks was established for the purpose of attending the image
Laypeople came from great distances in all directions to offer incense and owers
Stories about donations accumulated
After the image was completed the Prince of Jianans illness slowly abated
The prince was given a different territory than the present Nanping
This story appears in the Liang gaoseng zhuan Ta b Sui Dynasty Shi Linggan secular surname Li of Dachanding daozhan in the Western Capital was a foreign monk from Jincheng
Firm in his commitment he diligently and constantly cultivated practices of purity
Following the Huayan jing he carried out contemplation of the ocean of the world of the lotus ower storehouse as well as that of Maitreyas heavenly palace
In the seventeenth year of the Kaihuang period he became violently ill and suffered greatly
His heart was still warm so people did not dare put him in a cofn
He later awoke and related the following story
First I saw two people who held documents in their hands standing in front of the door
They said the government ofcial must see you
In a moment I was going with them as if I was walking in the sky My feet did not touch anything
I came to a large garden with trees of seven jewels lined up as if in a painting
When we arrived there the two people who had brought me took leave and withdrew
By myself I went into the garden
It was most beautiful everywhere I saw only forests elds mountains and ponds all made of rare jewels so colorful and bright I could not gaze long at them
Under each tree was a seat
People were sitting on some of the seats while others were not occupied
Suddenly I heard a man calling me gan have you come here As I looked for the source of the voice it was Dharma Master Huiyuan
I greeted him and asked What is this place He answered This is Tuṣita Heaven
Both myself and Sengxiu were born here
The one sitting next to me toward the south is Dharma Master xiu The bodies of yuan and xiu were not their original ones
They had heavenly crowns on their heads and were wearing red and purple robes the light  was unworldly
Only their voices remained like those of their previous lives and could be recognized also said to gan You and other disciples of mine are reborn here after death then woke up
He intensied the practices he had been doing previously engaged in meditation and rejected all contact with others
In the third year of Daye Chanding Monastery was completed
By imperial edict gan was called to serve as the head monk of the monastery
The monastery was populated with monks and the work of salvation began
In the eighth year gans illness had become serious and he was in his monastic cell about to die
The pupils of his eyes were turned upward they did not face out
After a while his pupils turned downward and his face looked as it used to look
Having seen this the monk Dongzhen asked about his illness
gan said to zhen I saw two youths wearing blue robes had come to take me
I followed them to outside of the heavenly palace in Tuṣita
Before entering the city I stood on tiptoe and looked in but I only saw the umbrellas of jewel trees forming a at surface and I could not see anything underneath within the city The monk who was attending gan in his illness said You raised your eyes at that time zhen said If you are reborn there you would have realized the original vow gan said The pleasures in heaven do not last forever
Eventually you fall back into the cycle of rebirth
What I aim at is the ocean of the lotus ower storehouse After a while gan lost consciousness
Quickly Dongzhen asked again What do you see gan said I see a great body of water lled with owers like the wheel of a chariot
I am sitting upon it My original vow is fullled Shortly thereafter he passed away
Dharma Master Dongzhen was the abbot of Western Dachanding Monastery He died in the beginning of the Wude period  Linggan died on the twentyninth day of the rst month of the eighth year of Daye at his temple at the age of seventyeight
Tang Dynasty Shi Shanzhou of Jingying Monastery in the Western Capital of the Tang dynasty secular surname Huai was from Yingzhou
He was very intelligent and quick in understanding He was quiet yet engaged in sharp discussion
His debating skills reected the nature of his mind His reputation reached far
Toward the end of the Renshou period under imperial order he established a relic stupa
He took the relics to Hualin Monastery on Mount Niutou in Zizhou
When the heavily guarded carriage was about to reach its destination eight wild pigs miraculously went under the carriage then quickly ran out from underneath went to the government ofce and then came right back
As the carriage came closer four black bees ferocious in appearance followed the carriage circling around it After going around it several times they ew away
After the carriage had nally arrived at the ofce building at night emitted a bright light which penetrated the roof and appeared as if ery ames were shooting up
After a while the light disappeared
When they dug to a depth of over one zhang to lay the stupa foundation at the exact place the relic box was to be placed they found an ancient jar
It had no cover but contained clear and fragrant water
So they placed the jar inside the box
The monastery had a ninestory stupa
A light appeared from the second story at the southwest corner and illuminated the wheels on top making them look like a veshi jar
The color of the light was yellowishred like a ame
After a while the light disappeared
Inside the temple building the gure of Maitreya Buddha also emitted purple light from between its eyebrows
The two attendant bodhisattvas also emitted red light These lights illuminated the temple everywhere
They appeared seven times and many saw them except those who had not come to the temple
In the eighth month of the third year of Wude Shanzhou died at his temple at the age of seventyone The above two stories appear in the Tang gaoseng zhuan T Paying Respect to the Buddha VI
Miracle Stories of Samantabhadra We have entered the latter age of the Dharma and visualization of this bodhisattva is seldom practiced Therefore we do not record scriptural passages here There are four miracle stories Song dynasty  Consort Dowager Lu Shao Monk Daowen Monk Daojing Qi dynasty  Monk Puming
Song Dynasty In the fourth year of the Daming period Consort Dowager Lu Shao produced an image of Samantabhadra sitting upon a jeweled seat on a white elephant
She placed it in the meditation chamber of Zhongxing Monastery
On that occasion she held a lecture retreat at the monastery
The retreat was concluded on the eighth day of the tenth month of the same year
Two hundred monks attended This took place when the temple building had just been built and the emperor paid a great deal of attention to it visiting it as many as four times over a tenday period
The monks were disciplined and orderly the imperial guards were aweinspiring
On the day of the lecture the names of the attending monks were determined and they took their seats accordingly
After a while a monk appeared and was about to join the ranks of the other monks
This monks appearance was striking and everyone in the gathering took notice
He exchanged over one hundred words with the host of the feast 
Suddenly the monk disappeared
All the participants saw this and realized that the monk was a supernatural person
During the Daming period of the Song the monk Daowen an abbot who resided in the Moling district had an audience with the Empress Dowager 
The empress was a mirror of deep wisdom in harmony with the profound truth that nourishes all having cleansed her thoughts in a place of purity and polished her mind in a realm of highest attainment consequently her reputation was widespread both in China and India
Daowen produced an image representing Samantabhadras arrival
When the lecture and feast commemorating the installation of the image which was decorated with remarkable jewels of extraordinary beauty was completed on the eighth day of the present month  the ceremony of conferring gifts to monks was held
The list of monks to be honored had been established ahead of time and they took their seats following the xed order The number of monks who attended tallied perfectly with the list
While the scriptures were recited at noon a strange monk appeared in the area where the monks were seated
His appearance and conduct were impressive and there was a general air of superior qualities about him
Everyone took note of him but no one recognized him
The host of the feast asked him What is your name He answered My name is Huiming In which monastery do you reside I came from Tianan Monastery While this exchange was taking place the monk suddenly disappeared
Everyone in the hall was astounded and awestruck considering this to be an auspicious sign
The purple mountains were seen and lotus ower pedestals appeared not far away
It is said that sincere devotion can cause landscapes to shift location and a puried mind can cause a spring to issue forth from a stone
The emperors virtue nourishes the universe benevolence governs over distant countries and the principle reaches obscure places
Therefore the kingly hero chose the Daming reign era court in which to manifest his remarkable form appearing in the chamber from which the dragon ies up
His intention was for the lamp of the emperors wisdom to illumine all corners of the ocean and shine like the owerlike sun and moon
For this reason the monk was named Huiming 
For transmitting heavens will causing the ruling house to prosper and its laws to be strong the monastery was named Tianan  The dynastys divine foundation goes far back and the effects of its moral government will soon be realized
The nine regions of the country will be at peace and myriad residences will be lled with joy
Announcements have been made in districts under the dynastys rule in praise of heaven
the entry for Daowen in the Gaoseng zhuan Tba The monk Daojing was from Haozhi in Fufeng
His original surname was Ma
He was singleminded in studying the unmixed truth and became widely known at an early age
In the ninth month of the second year of Yuanxi  CE  he was at Luoyang and performed the Samantabhadra ceremony in which more than forty people some monastics and others lay followers participated
After seven days at the time of the midday meal a person wearing riding pants suddenly entered the precinct on horseback and dismounting from the horse at the front of the hall he paid respect to the Buddha
Not thinking of him as anyone unusual Daojing failed to pay special attention and greet him with proper decorum
The man then mounted the horse and spurring it on he suddenly disappeared
People saw a ray of bright red light reaching up to heaven
After a while the light disappeared
Later in the twelfth month of the third year Daojing again held a Samantabhadra ceremony at a lay supporters residence
On the day of the ceremony as it was about to be concluded two ordinarily dressed monks appeared to pay respect to the Buddha
Participants thought that they were ordinary monks and did not treat them with proper respect
They casually asked the monks where they lived
The monks answered that they lived in a nearby village
At that point a layman called Zhang Dao sensed something extraordinary in the monks and earnestly paid respect to them
The monks departed from the temple gate and after a few dozen steps they suddenly shot up straight to heaven People tried to catch sight of them but they quickly disappeared
In the seventh year Daojing went to the capital city with some fellow students
At that time the Minister of Works He Shangzhi had just nished the construction of Nanjian Temple
Daojing was staying there temporarily
Suddenly in the middle of the night he saw four people riding in a new carriage enter the room and call out to him telling him to join them on the carriage
Surprised Daojing was so confused he was unable to speak
He could not see in the darkness and got into the carriage without realizing it
He was quickly taken to Shen Bridge behind the government ofce building
He saw a nobleman wearing a silk cap and a singlelayered coat of nely woven cloth sitting on a stool under an umbrella
The umbrella was shaped like the emperors ower umbrella and there were several hundred guards lined up all wearing yellow robes
Seeing Daojing the nobleman was surprised and said Practitioner of the buddhavision meditation  I have sincerely paid respect to you from a distance
I only wished to know where you were
They should not have brought you here The man immediately ordered that Daojing be taken back to his room
When Daojing reached the outer gate of his monastery the person who had accompanied him there suddenly disappeared
The gate was closed as usual
He knocked and shouted loudly for a long time
The monks inside were amazed when Daojing told them who he was
They opened the gate and let him in
Then they checked his chamber the door was locked from inside as usual
Qi Dynasty The surname of the monk Puming of Upper Dinglin Monastery was Zhang he was from Linwei
He left the householders life as a youth Puming was gifted and dedicated to a life of purity taking only simple vegetarian meals and wearing plain clothes
He specialized in repentance rituals and recited the Lotus Sutra and the Vimalakīrti Sutra
When reciting scriptures he sat on a separate seat wearing a special robe to keep impurities away
Every time he came to the chapter The Encouragements of Universally Worthy Bodhisattva he saw before him Samantabhadra riding on an elephant
When he recited the Vimalakīrti Sutra he heard chanting and music in the sky
He was also skilled in magical spells everyone he tried to help was cured
The wife of the villager Wang Daozhen became ill
The villager asked Puming to come and perform the spell cure
As Puming entered through the gate the villagers wife lost consciousness
Suddenly a creature that looked like a raccoon several feet long appeared and left through a hole in the wall  The villagers wife then was cured
Once Puming walked by a shrine near the water
The medium said to himself When gods see him they all run away Puming died during the Xiaojian period at the age eightyve
Miracle Stories of Avalokiteśvara Qin dynasty  Imperial Secretary Xu Yi Layman Bi Lan Jin dynasty  Monk Zhu Fayi Monk Zhu Fachun Monk Shi Kaida Layman Guo Xuanzhi Layman Pan Daoxiu Layman Luan Xun Monk Shi Fazhi Nangong Ziao Monk Daotai Layman Sun Daode Layman Liu Du Layman Dou Zhuan Monk Zhu Fachun Song dynasty  Layman Zhang Xing Layman Wang Yan Wei dynasty  Monk Shi Daotai Layman Sun Jingde Monk Shi Fali

In a dream a person said to him Things are happening quickly
It is no time for sleep Xu Yi taken aback got up and saw that the guards were all tired and asleep
He then tried to move
His hair had already been untied and his feet were also free

Jin Dynasty Zhu Fayi lived on Mount Shining
He became a monk during the Xingning period 
He read widely through many scriptures but was especially familiar with the Lotus Sutra
He always had more than a hundred students studying under him
In the second year of Xianan he became ill
He meditated on Avalokiteśvara continuously and had a dream in which a person opened up his belly and washed his intestines
When he woke up he was cured
Fu Liang used to say My father used to travel with Master yi and heard him say that whether major or minor Avalokiteśvaras miracles are aweinspiring The monk Zhu Fachun was the abbot of Xianyi Monastery in Shanyin Commandery
During the Jin Yuanxing period he traveled to Lanzhu to purchase building materials for the construction of temple walls
The route included a part crossing over a lake
The owner of the materials was a woman and she agreed to accompany him to the place where the materials were found
Having agreed on the price they traveled together on a boat
As the boat set out on the great lake the sun set and a violent wind arose driving waves as high as a mountain
Fachuns boat was small and began to take on water
His life seemed about to come to an end
He reected that his conduct had lacked merit and as a consequence he had unexpectedly encountered this catastrophe
In addition he was traveling with a woman For these reasons he was frightened and singlemindedly recited the Avalokiteśvara Scripture
Suddenly a large ship approached Fachuns boat
By then it was nighttime and no one else was traveling
Fachun thought to himself There should not be such a ship on the water now
This must be a  supernatural power When they boarded the larger ship the small boat immediately sank
The large ship traveled through high waves and they were able to get to the other shore
In the second year of Longan the monk Shi Kaida climbed a hill to collect herbs and was captured by Qiang barbarians
This was during the year of great famine and the Qiang and Hu people were cannibalizing each other
They put Kaida inside a cage planning to kill and eat him
There were more than ten other people inside the cage and the Qiang barbarians said We will have a feast in the evening only Kaida was left 
Since his capture Kaida continuously recited the Avalokiteśvara Scripture without a break
He was to be killed the next day
When morning broke a large tiger suddenly appeared blocking the way to Kaidas cage howling angrily at the Qiang barbarians
They were frightened and ed
The tiger then chewed at the bars of the cage making a small hole just big enough to allow a person to crawl through then the animal left
At rst when Kaida saw the tiger chewing on the cage he was sure that he would be harmed
When the tiger did not come into the cage he was puzzled
Kaida attributed this to Avalokiteśvaras power and assuming that the barbarians would eventually return he crawled through the hole in the cage and ed
He walked at night and hid during the day In this way he was able to escape unharmed
Guo Xuanzhi was from Taiyuan
In the fourth year of Yixi  CE  he served as a garrison commander at Liangzhou under Yang Siping
Yang was killed and Fan Yuanzhi and others were put on trial Guo Xuanzhi was imprisoned
He singlemindedly prayed to Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva
Later in the evening when he was about to fall asleep he suddenly saw the bodhisattva and light lled the prison Seeing the bodhisattva Guo Xuanzhi paid respect to him made a request and offered a vow
After awhile the light disappeared
Guo Xuanzhi alone was then released
After his release he made an image of the bodhisattva just as he had seen in the vision
He also established a temple
He later served as an ofcer in Lingling and Hengyang
Pan Daoxiu was from Wu Commandery
When he was some twenty years old he went on an expedition to the north due to a military disturbance
His army was small and Daoxiu lost the battle
He tried to escape alone but was captured
In several places in foreign lands he served as a slave
He wished to return home but he could not nd a way 
From his youth he had honored Buddhism He constantly meditated on Avalokiteśvara
He often had a dream in which he saw an Avalokiteśvara image
He later ed toward the south but lost his way
Deep in the mountains he suddenly saw the deity himself  who looked just like the walking image known today
Daoxiu paid respect to him and after he had nished the deity suddenly disappeared
Daoxiu then found his way and returned home
After this he practiced even more diligently
He died shortly before reaching the age of sixty
Luan Xuns origins are unknown
From his youth he honored Buddhism
He once served as the acting director of Fufuping
Earlier on an expedition to conquer Lu Xun he had run into difculties
A re was destroying the boat and enemies were pressing close
Right in the middle of the Jiang River he saw only erce winds and tall waves
Terried Xun recited the name of Avalokiteśvara
Suddenly he saw a person standing upright in the middle of the river all alone and the water reached the level of his waist
Xun realized that this was in response to his prayer
As the threatening re came closer he jumped into the water
His body oated and his feet touched the bottom
The main army soon sent boats to pick up the defeated soldiers Luan Xun was thus able to survive
Once when the monk Shi Fazhi was still a layman he was walking through a large marshland when a re broke out simultaneously in all four directions
All paths of escape were cut off so he earnestly worshiped Avalokiteśvara and recited his name
Quickly the re passed over
Every blade of grass on the eld had been completely burned but at the place where Fazhi stood a space large enough for his body was left untouched
After this incident he began to honor the great teaching
Later as a commander under Yao Xing he took part in an expedition to the north
When the army was in retreat he fell off his horse inside the enemy camp
He hid near the ditches and in a nearby bush covering his head he meditated on Avalokiteśvara very intensely
Someone across the ditch called out to the enemy army instructing them to kill Fazhi but when soldiers came to look for him they could not nd him
In this way Fazhi escaped
Later he renounced the householders life
Nangong Ziao was from Shiping
While garrisoned in Xinping City he was defeated by the barbarian Qifus son the Prince of Changle 
Altogether several thousand people inside the city were executed
Ziao was separated from them but was slated to die
He meditated earnestly on Avalokiteśvara
When the time for his execution came and the executioners lowered their swords some from high up and some from lower they suddenly were overcome by exhaustion and could not move their limbs
The Prince of Changle present at the execution was taken aback and questioned Ziao
Afraid Ziao said I can serve as a horse saddle  The prince then released him
Ziao also did not know what made him give this answer
He later became a hermit
He made a small image  and placed it in an incense box
Whenever he walked about he carried this box on top of his head
Shi Daotai was a monk at Hengtang Monastery in Changshan
During the Yixi period of Jin he had a dream in which a man said Your life will end in six or seven years At that time Daotai was fortytwo years old
He subsequently became very ill
Fearing that he could not be saved he donated almsbowls and robes to the monastery and instructed others to recite Avalokiteśvaras name
The diligent recitation continued without abating for four days and nights
There was a curtain in front of the bed on which Daotai was sitting
Suddenly from under the curtain he saw someone cross the doors threshold and enter the room
His foot was golden in color and the light from the gure illumined the room
Daotai raised the curtain to take a peek
Suddenly the man disappeared
Daotai was surprised and delighted
He sweated a great deal and after that his body felt light and the disease was cured
Sun Daode was from Yizhou He was a follower of Daoism and served as a libationer
He was over fty years old and yet still did not have a son
He lived near a Buddhist temple
During the Jingping period  earnestly recite Avalokiteśvaras name and by doing so he could hope for a positive outcome
Thereupon Daode stopped following Daoism and singlemindedly took refuge in Avalokiteśvara
After a few days he had a dream
Then his wife became pregnant and gave birth to a son
Liu Du was from Liaocheng in Taiyuan
The village had over a thousand households and all honored the great teaching creating images and making offerings to monks and nuns
At the time when Muwei ruled over the barbarians a prisoner from the district escaped
Angered Muwei was about to exterminate everyone in the city and they feared that all the villagers as well as criminals would be killed
Liu Du underwent purication and led the multitude to take refuge in Avalokiteśvara
After a while wei saw something descend from the sky and go around the pillar inside the building where he was staying Surprised they looked closely it was the Avalokiteśvara Sutra
Muwei instructed someone to recite it
Delighted he then stopped the massacre
The entire city thus escaped harm
Layman Dou Zhuan was from Henei
During the Yonghe period  CE
 the Regional Inspector of Bingzhou Gao Chang and the Regional Inspector of Jizhou L Hu established private armies and threatened each other
Dou Zhuan served as an ofcial for Gao Chang
Hu sent cavalry to capture him
He was shackled to the six or seven people who were with him and put into a jail cell in heavy shackles and fetters
The date of his execution was xed
At that time the monk Zhi Daoshan was staying in the camp
He was acquainted with Dou Zhuan and hearing of his imprisonment he came to see him in jail
They spoke through a door
Dou Zhuan said Today I am in a great difculty and my life will come to an end in a matter of hours
How can I get out of this Zhi Daoshan said If you earnestly pray there should be a response Dou Zhuan had often heard of Avalokiteśvara and after hearing Zhi Daoshans suggestion he wholeheartedly meditated on the bodhisattva
For three days and three nights he earnestly took refuge in Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva
When he looked at the shackles and fetters he felt that they had became looser Something extraordinary seemed to be happening
As he tentatively pushed at them the shackles fell open and his body was free
Dou Zhuan then earnestly implored Thanks to Avalokiteśvaras compassionate assistance the fetters broke apart on their own
But there are still many companions and I do not intend to leave them behind
Avalokiteśvaras supernatural power saves all
Please let all be released As he said this he pulled others away from their shackles and fetters which fell away as if they had been cut off
Freed they opened the door and ran through the area under heavy security
No one detected their escape right away and together the prisoners passed beyond the city limit
They traveled through the night and covered a distance of four or ve li before dawn
When it became light they did not proceed further but together hid under a tree
Soon the prisoners escape was discovered
Mounted soldiers were dispatched in all four directions to recapture them
Search parties were everywhere burning grasslands and walking through the forests but no one came to the small patch of land where Dou Zhuan was hiding he was thus able to escape and return home
He became extraordinarily passionate in his faith in Avalokiteśvara
Later Zhi Daoshan came across the Jiang River and told this story to the layman Xie Fu
The monk Zhu Fachun was at Xianyi Monastery in the Shanyin district
His origins are unknown except that he had renounced the householders life as a youth and went to stay at Xianyi Monastery
He specialized in austerities and was skilled at reciting the earlier translation of the Vimalakīrti Sutra
During the Yuanxing period of the Jin dynasty he served as the head of the monastery and he went to Lanzhu and bought an old building
He was on his way back at sunset traveling in a boat across a lake when suddenly a wind came up and the boat was about to capsize Zhu Fachun singlemindedly sought help from Avalokiteśvara reciting the bodhisattvas name incessantly
Suddenly a large ship appeared
He got on the ship and was saved
When he reached shore he looked for the ships captain everywhere but could not nd him on the ship and after a short while the large ship disappeared
Everyone monastic or layperson marveled at this miracle Nothing is known of the circumstances of his death
This story  appears in the Liang gaoseng zhuan Tc Song Dynasty Layman Zhang Xing from Xinxing was a strong believer in the Buddhist teaching
At one time he followed the monks Sengrong and Tanyi and received the eight precepts
Zhang Xing was once arrested he managed to escape but his wife was kept in prison and was beaten and whipped for many days
At that time a re broke out at the district ofce and prisoners were taken outside to the road
Sengrong and Tanyi happened to pass by the captives
Surprised Zhang Xings wife called out to them Teachers what brought you here to rescue me Sengrong answered I do not have the power to rescue you
Just pray diligently to Avalokiteśvara
You should then be able to escape The wife prayed day and night
After more than ten days she had a dream in which a monk stepped on her saying Get up Taken aback she got up and her shackles and fetters fell open
She ran toward the door but it was locked and guarded securely
She could not get out
Fearing that someone might wake up she went back and put the restraints back on
She soon fell asleep again and had another dream
The same monk appeared and said The door is now open Zhang Xings wife woke up again and ran out
The guards were both fast asleep and she then walked quietly past them and left
The night was very dark and after walking several li she ran into a person
Frightened she fell down on the ground
The two people asked each other who they were The man she had run into turned out to be her husband Zhang Xing
Overwhelmed by joy the couple went to the monk Tanyi in the middle of the night and he hid them
In this way they managed to escape
This event took place at the beginning of the Yuanxi period 
As a child Wang Yan visited Jiaozhi where Dharma Master Xian a virtuous monk lived
Yan received the ve precepts from this monk and was given a golden image of Avalokiteśvara to worship
Neither contemporary nor ancient in appearance the image had been cast during the Yuanjia period 
It was of superior craftsmanship and showed a remarkable likeness to the deity
Wang Yan brought the image back to the capital city
When he was at the age of losing ones milk teeth he and his two younger brothers practiced Buddhism diligently
Later while his residence was being repaired Yan could not nd a suitable place to keep the image and took it to Nanjian Monastery in the capital city
At this time people were rushing to mint coins and some stole buddha images to melt them down for metal
After the Avalokiteśvara image had been at the monastery for several months Yan dreamed during a nap that the image was standing at the edge of its base
Puzzled after sunset Yan went to bring the image back from the monastery
That same day later in the evening more than ten images were stolen from Nanjian Monastery
A long while later at dusk near sunset Yans image emitted light that illuminated the area around it to a distance of over three chi
The light was beautiful and ravishingly bright
Yan and his brothers and servants altogether more than ten people saw it
At that time he was still young and did not record this incident and by the time he got around to recording the incident he had forgotten the exact date
It was sometime in the autumn of the seventh year of the Daming period 
Toward the end of the Taishi period Yan moved to Wuyi
He arranged to have a monk look after the image and the monk placed it temporarily at Duobao Monastery
While Yan was staying for a while in Jiangdu the monk left for the Jing and Chu areas Yan thus lost track of the gure
The location of the image remained unknown for almost ten years and Yan feared that he had lost the karmic bond with this divine treasure
Toward the end of the Shengming period  while traveling in the Three Gorges area Yan passed through the Jiangling district 
There he saw the monk to whom he had entrusted the image and learned that the gure was 
The same year Yan returned to the capital city and immediately went to Duobao Monastery
The head of the monastery Master Ai said No such image has been entrusted here Yan returned home thinking that the monks inattention had led to the loss of the image and he was deeply distressed
That night he dreamed that someone appeared and said The image is at the monastery
Master Ai just forgot
I will nd it for you He saw the man arrive at the monastery and open the door of the buddha hall with his own hand
Yan saw the image vividly and clearly standing among the smaller images placed on the eastern side of the hall
Early on the next morning Yan went back to the monastery He reported in detail what he had seen in his dream and requested Master Ai to look for it again
Master Ai then opened the buddha hall for him and indeed they found the image on the eastern side of the hall just as he had seen in the dream
He was thus able to recover the gure
This was on the thirteenth day of the seventh month in Jianyuan   I take care of this image myself all the time forever as a guide
As I tell this story again I am deeply moved
Because of this miracle I compiled this record
In mirroring reality and making it accessible to ordinary emotions nothing surpasses the image
The source of image miracles can for the most part be attributed to this fact
The scripture says Molten or carved or drawn painted on silk the images that reproduce the form all can move and emit light In the Western Region images of ākyamuni and Maitreya emit light miraculously Is it because they reproduce the Buddhas form
In China light gathers in a clear sign of cosmic responses
Furthermore in recent years people affected by cosmic responses have seen marvelous effects in wood and stone
These effects cannot necessarily be attributed to the appearances of the images
Thus when the heavy stone oated on the surface of the deep  this marked the advent of the Buddhist teaching in the Min and Wu areas
made of molten gold dust predicted calamities at Song Temple in Peng
There are numerous other examples Though difcult to discuss in detail their main message may be reduced to this
The meaning of stupa miracles is also similar
The subjects differ but the message is consistent
Therefore I appended them at the end
Wei Dynasty The monk Daotai of Hengtang Monastery on Mount Changshan lived during the last years of the Yuan Wei dynasty 
In a dream he heard someone predict that he Daotai would die in suchandsuch year at the age of fortytwo
Upon waking Daotai was afraid
When that year came and he became ill he was greatly distressed and donated everything he owned to accumulate merit
A friend told him Making offerings to sixtytwo myriad bodhisattvas produces no more merit than reciting Avalokiteśvaras name just once
Why dont you singlemindedly take refuge in this bodhisattva
You could then prolong your life Daotai realized the truth of this advice and for four days and nights he recited the name of Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva without a break
Suddenly from under the curtain surrounding his seat he saw light come in from outside the door
He then saw bright and golden light emitting from the base of the Avalokiteśvara image
The image said to Daotai Are you reciting the name of Avalokiteśvara When Daotai opened the curtain the light was no longer there
Greatly moved Daotai sweated profusely then he felt his body become lighter as the illness was cured and his life span was prolonged This was due to the effect of the power of the holy being
During the Tianping period the militiaman Sun Jingde of Jingzhou produced an image of Avalokiteśvara and worshiped it himself
He was later captured by rebels unable to withstand torture he confessed 
Consequently he was sentenced to be executed
In a dream a monk told him to recite the Lifesaving Avalokiteśvara Sutra if he recited it one thousand times he would escape execution
The ofcials bound him and took him to the marketplace He kept reciting the scripture
The number of recitations reached one thousand just at the moment he was to be executed
When the sword fell on him it broke spontaneously into three pieces and he was not harmed
The executioner changed his sword three times but they all broke in the same way
People then found the three traces of sword strikes on the head of the image
This was reported to the court and Prime Minister Gao Huan memorialized the granting of Sun Jingdes pardon the court ordered the scripture to be copied and circulated widely
This is the Gaowang guanshiyin jing
From the Jin through the Song Liang Chen Qin and Zhao periods the country was divided among sixteen states
During this period innumerable people recited the names of Avalokiteśvara Kṣitigarbha Maitreya and Amitābha and achieved salvation
Since the details are found in various biographies and records they are not reproduced here
During the Last Years of the Wei Dynasty The origins of the monk Shi Fali of Lu Commandery is unknown
His ambition was to build temple buildings He wished to build a temple in Lu Commandery but did not have enough lumber
With the novice Mingchen he went to Shanggu to ask for a supply of hemp
Having loaded the cart with the material they started on their way back
While traveling through a vacant marsh they encountered wildre
Since the cart was downwind  they were afraid they wouldnt be able to escape
Fali was exhausted and fell asleep
When he woke up the re was very close
He raised his voice and asked Avalokiteśvara for help
As soon as he recited the bodhisattvas name as if responding to his voice the wind shifted and the re died down
They were able to safely return to the monastery
There is also the case of the monk Fazhi
While still a layman he was traveling alone through a large marshland when a erce re appeared on all four sides simultaneously
He realized that he was going to die and bowing his head to the ground he kept on reciting the name of Avalokiteśvara
Puzzled that he was not burned by the re he raised his head
The grasses of the marshland were all completely burned only a small area enough to accommodate Fazhis body was left untouched
Moved by this miracle he renounced the householders life and became a monk
The monk Daoji was captured by bandits while traveling through Xishan in Shouyang
They bound him to a tree with a rope and were about to kill him
He kept on reciting Avalokiteśvaras name determined to continue without stopping until death
The swords they wielded all broke and he could not be harmed
The bandits were frightened and ed and Daoji escaped
While traveling through the mountains the monk Fachan encountered some thieves
Fearing that he was to be killed he kept on reciting the name of Avalokiteśvara
The bandits drew their bows and shot arrows at him but they all missed
The bandits were then converted and threw their weapons on the ground
Recognizing him as a man of spiritual power they ed
The above three stories are from the Tang gaoseng zhuan Tc verses say ref Zhi Daolins Verses in Praise of ākyamuni Buddha Guang hongming ji Tb ākyamunis teaching is benevolent
He observes the capacities of sentient beings and descends from heaven Superior to all saintly beings He is truly the guide of rulers He nourishes all in happiness Beautiful and pure drawing from the deep source He compassionately teaches sentient beings and Guides them to the profound teaching of the Middle  He kindly spreads the lamp of wisdom Illuminating ones progress in the darkness His teaching adapts to circumstances Who recognizes reality in darkness From a distance it looks like rising mist It is the ferry across the clouds attaches to physical forms But it also rises up high above them in spirit The teaching of the three vehicles has spread widely Among the two śāla trees he left his physical body The nirvana was also provisional designation The true teaching is the permanent reality Paying Respect to the Dharma  Listening to the Dharma Seeking the Dharma Meritorious Response Dharma Masters The Sin of Reviling  It has been heard
While remains in quietude and is unmoving and there is no form or speech yet because he responds and communicates he uses names and teaching It is difcult to hear the fourfold formulation 
one easily entering into re in three thousand 
In the cold and quiet night during a long evening with a bright moon one may sit alone in an open and restful space and chant scriptures
As the melody comes and goes following the correct notes the words become clear and the speech beautiful
Words and music match and please peoples minds
Their benets are sufcient to delight mysterious spirits
After study and practice the meaning of the sentences is clear
As one recites with a respectful heart miraculous responses appear
One truly knows that upholding one verse brings a great deal of benet copying one word produces merit greater than the practices of many kalpas
For this reason Kāśyapa willingly offered his skin to be ayed  and in delight Sadāprarudita happily shed blood 
This is the rst gate of the sweet dew of immortality it is the ultimate virtue that results from entering the Way
The Fufazang jing says
The Buddha said Any sentient being who wishes to escape from the great ocean of life and death in the three realms must rely on the boat of the Dharma salvation is possible only by this
The Dharma is cool and removes the heat of desires
The Dharma is the marvelous medicine that can cure the illness of bondage
The Dharma is the truly good friend of sentient beings it brings great benets and transports them over all suffering
The reasoning behind this may be explained as follows
Sentient beings lack stability in their inner orientation and are affected by circumstances
Under circumstances that are good they become good
Under circumstances that are bad they become bad
When they are near evil friends they commit evil deeds going from births to deaths endlessly
When they are near good friends they develop faith and a respectful mind listening to the marvelous Dharma they will without fail escape from the three realms of suffering and from the merit acquired in this way they will come to enjoy utmost happiness
The king of Kapilavastu owned a white elephant which destroyed his enemies criminals were brought before the elephant and trampled by it
Later a re burned the elephants stable down
The animal was moved near a Buddhist temple where it heard a monk recite a verse of Dharma
Good deeds lead to rebirths in heavens evil deeds to rebirths in  When the elephant heard these words of Dharma its heart became gentle and it developed a feeling of compassion
After this whenever criminals were brought before the elephant it would only sniff at them with its trunk and lick them with its tongue then it would move away refusing to kill them
Seeing this the king became frightened and called his ministers together to discuss the matter
One wise minister said to the king Having been brought near the temple the elephant must have heard the marvelous Dharma and that has led to this result
It should now be taken near a slaughterhouse The king adopted his advice
When the elephant saw the domestic animals being slaughtered evil sentiments ared up ercely and it became even more violent and cruel than before
We should take this as a conrmation of the fact that sentient beings lack stability in their inner orientation
Even an animal on hearing the Dharma develops the feeling of compassion while witnessing slaughter increases its harmful mental states
How much more would this be the case with human beings How could they not be affected by their circumstances
For this reason wise ones should know to abandon evil when they see it and approach good when they perceive it
They should diligently listen to the Dharma scriptures
One time a brahman carrying a large number of human skulls came to Kapilavastu and went all over the city trying to sell them but even after a long time no one would buy them
The brahman became angry and shouted The people in this city are stupid and ignorant
If they dont buy these skulls from me I will spread a bad reputation about them Several upāsakas heard this and fearing that they would be reviled and abused they brought money to buy the skulls
They piercing them with a copper chopstick if the chopstick passed through they offered a lot of money
If it went in halfway they offered a small amount of money
If it did not go in at all they did not offer any money for them
The brahman said These skulls are all the same
Why are you offering different payments for them The upāsakas answered If the chopstick passes through it shows that while he was alive that person heard and accepted the marvelous Dharma and his wisdom was superior
Because he valued the Dharma so much we are willing offer a lot of money for his skull
If the chopstick goes through only halfway it means that even though that person heard a Dharma scripture he did not understand and appreciate it
For this reason we offer only a small amount
If the chopstick does not go in at all that person did not hear the Dharma at all therefore we offer no money for it The upāsakas then took the skulls outside the city built stupas  and made offerings to them
When their own lives came to an end they were all reborn in heaven
This story illustrates the great deal of merit the marvelous Dharma possesses
The upāsakas took the skulls of those who had listened to the Dharma built stupas for them and worshiped them and for these acts they were reborn in heaven
How much better would the reward be for those who listen to the Dharma scriptures worship them and respectfully carry the scriptures with them
The reward for meritorious deeds is indeed unlimited
In a future life one will achieve the supreme path
Therefore if a wise person wishes to obtain supreme peace and happiness he or she must listen to the Dharma scriptures with utmost sincerity
The Xianyu jing says
In the past while the Buddha was in this world there was an elder whose name was Anāthapiṇḍada living in the kingdom of rāvastī
He had faith in the Buddhas Dharma and honored it
Serving the Buddhas community as a donor he provided for all the monks needs
In Anāthapiṇḍadas house there were two parrots the rst was named Lti and the second Shelti
They were very intelligent and understood human speech
When they saw a monk arrive they told those in the house to come out to welcome him
Some time later nanda came to the elders house
He saw the parrots and preached to them the Four Noble Truths of suffering the cause of suffering the cessation of suffering and the path
There was a tree in front of the gate and when the birds heard the Dharma they ew up to the top of the tree delightedly reciting the teaching
They stayed around the tree at night and were eaten by wild foxes
For this reason they were reborn in the heaven of the four heavenly kings after their life span there ended they were reborn in Trāyastriṃśa Heaven after their life span in Trāyastriṃśa Heaven ended they were reborn in Yama Heaven after their life span in Yama Heaven ended they were reborn in Tuṣita Heaven after their life span in Tuṣita Heaven ended they were reborn in Nirmāṇarati Heaven after their life span in Nirmāṇarati Heaven ended they were reborn in Paranirmitavaśavartin Heaven after their life span in Paranirmitavaśavartin Heaven ended they were again reborn in Nirmāṇarati Heaven
In this way they came down to the heaven of the four heavenly kings After their life span in the heaven of the four heavenly kings ended they went up and were again reborn in Paranirmitavaśavartin Heaven
In this way they went up and down among the six heavens of the realm of desire seven times
They enjoyed pleasure at their will and reached the utmost limit of life spans in heaven never experiencing untimely deaths
After this when their lives came to the end they were reborn among humans
They left the householders life and became pratyekabuddhas one named Tanmo and the other Xiutanmo
The Xianyu jing says Once while the Buddha was in this world a monk recited scriptures very beautifully in the forest
At that time a bird which loved hearing the Dharma was in a tree and listened to the monks recitation
The bird was later shot by a hunter and died
Because of the good karmic cause  the bird was reborn in Trāyastriṃśa Heaven
He was handsome and beautiful endowed with a halo he was incomparable
He knew his own former lives
Realizing that because he had heard a monk recite a scripture he had been reborn in that heaven he brought heavenly owers to the monk
He paid respect to the monk asking about his wellbeing and made an offering of heavenly incense and owers
The monk having questioned and learned the details of the story asked the god to sit and then preached the Dharma to him which made the god attain the status of streamwinner 
Having attained this status the god returned to heaven
If even a bird who hears the Dharma can obtain such boundless merits how could a human being who believes and listens to the Dharma not receive good rewards The Shanjianl
In the past when the Buddha was still in the world he preached in the Campā kingdom near Gargarā Pond
At that time a frog in the pond heard the voice of the Buddha preaching at the side of the pond
The frog immediately came out of the pond and running through the grass it came to listen to the Buddhas sermon
At that time a man herding a cow with a stick nearby saw the Buddha sitting down preaching to an assembly
The man wanted to go to where the Buddha was right away to hear the Dharma
He stuck his stick into the ground and hit the frogs head by accident
The frog died immediately and was reborn in Trāyastriṃśa Heaven
As the reward for the merits accumulated earlier his palace was twenty yojanas long and wide and he enjoyed pleasures with heavenly women
Then riding upon the palace as a vehicle he came to the Buddhas place and paid respect to him bowing his head to the Buddhas feet
The Buddha knew his circumstances and asked  Who are you
You suddenly come to pay respect to me
Surrounded by miraculous light your features are incomparably beautiful
The light illumines everywhere here The frog deity answered in verse Once I had a frogs body I looked for food in water
Hearing the voice of the Buddha preaching the Dharma I came out and was among the roots of the grasses A man herding a cow came with his stick to listen to the Buddha With the stick he struck my head and I died and was reborn in heaven The Buddha used the verse the frog deity had uttered and preached to the fourfold assembly
At that time eightyfour thousand people in the assembly obtained the Way
The frog deity attained the status of streamwinner and with palms joined he departed
The Zabaozang jing says
There was once a woman who was very intelligent and deeply committed to the Three Jewels
She used to invite two monks at a time following the monastic ranking to her house to offer them a meal
Later one monk had his turn and came to her house he was old dumb and quite ignorant
When the meal was over the woman earnestly asked the monk to preach a sermon
She spread a mat for the preacher and sat quietly with her eyes closed in front of it
The monk knew that he could not preach
As soon as the womans eyes were closed he ran from her house and returned to the monastery
Nevertheless the woman earnestly meditated that all constructed entities are impermanent and ultimately lead to suffering they are empty and do not exist on their own Contemplating this deeply she achieved the status of streamwinner
Having achieved this status she went to the monastery looking for the monk in order to thank him for his kindness
The old monk admitting his ignorance left her and ed
He became even more ashamed and continued to hide from her
Still the woman looked for him ceaselessly
When he nally came out of hiding she saw him and told to him in detail how thanks to him she had obtained the spiritual status  and offered him a meal to repay his kindness
The old monk was greatly embarrassed and due to his selfreproach he too obtained the status of streamwinner
This illustrates how practitioners should earnestly and diligently seek the Dharma
Those who earnestly seek the Dharma will attain the goal without fail
The Dapanniepan jing says
The Buddha said I remember that in the past I was a brahman cultivating bodhisattva practices in the Himalayas
At that time there was no buddha present in the world nor was there any Dharma taught in scriptures
Then the god akra saw a bodhisattva practicing austerities alone in the mountains and immediately came down to test him
The god changed his form into that of a truly terrifying rākṣasa stood before the bodhisattva and uttered the following halfverse
All dharmas are impermanent This is the truth of samsara of coming into being and going out of being Having uttered this verse the rākṣasa looked around everywhere in the four directions
When the bodhisattva heard this verse he was delighted
He rose from his seat and holding his hair in his hand looked around in the four directions He saw no other human beings he saw only the rākṣasa
He then approached the rākṣasa and asked him Great being where did you obtain the verse
The correct way of the buddhas of the three ages  is expressed in this halfverse The rākṣasa answered Do not ask
I have not eaten for many days
I have looked everywhere for food but could not get any
Hungry and thirsty my mind became disturbed and I spoke the wrong words
These words are not what I know in my own mind The bodhisattva said If you complete the verse for me I will become your disciple for the rest of my life The rākṣasa answered Your wisdom is too great
I worry about my body and cannot think of anything else
Right now I am so hungry that indeed I cannot even speak properly The bodhisattva said What do you eat The rākṣasa answered I only eat warm human esh and drink hot human blood As soon as the bodhisattva heard this he said to the rākṣasa If you will complete this verse I will offer you my body  The rākṣasa answered Who could believe you
You would offer the body you cherish for the eight characters of the remaining verse The bodhisattva answered I will call witnesses
The gods Brahmā akra the four heavenly kings and all the buddhas and bodhisattvas will be my witnesses When he heard this the rākṣasa agreed
The bodhisattva was delighted He slipped out of his robe and laid it down to serve as the preachers seat
The bodhisattva said Master please sit here and preach the Dharma for me Then the rākṣasa said When the samsara of coming into and going out of being ceases there will be the happiness of nirvana When the rest of the verse was uttered the bodhisattva fell into deep thought
He wrote the verse on the surfaces of rock and trees then climbed up a tall tree and threw himself from it
Before he hit the ground however he heard voices in midair
At that moment the rākṣasa changed his form back to that of the god akra caught the bodhisattva and placed him safely on the ground
akra repented apologized and after having made his greetings departed
Because  give up his body for a halfverse  after twelve kalpas he will achieve the supreme Way before Maitreya Buddha The Dapanniepan jing says
The Buddha said I remember that incalculable numbers of thousands of kalpas ago a buddha called ākyamuni appeared in this sahā world and for the benet of sentient beings he preached the Great Nirvana Sutra
At that time I was at a good friends place and heard the Buddhas Great Nirvana Sutra recited
I was delighted and immediately wished to make offerings but I was poor and had nothing to offer
So I offered my body for sale but due to lack of merit I could not nd a buyer
On my way home I saw someone on the roadside and said to him I want to sell my body
Will you buy it The man answered There is something that the servants in my house are not able to do
I have a bad disease for which a good doctor prescribed medicine
I must take three liang of human esh everyday
If you agree to provide me with three liang of your esh every day I will give you ve pieces of gold Hearing this I was delighted and said Give me seven days to take care of my affairs
I will then return and get to work The man said I will give you one day I then took the coins went to the Buddha paid respect to him and presented the gold to him
Then I listened to this scripture earnestly
I am ignorant and stupid and could memorize only one verse The Tathāgata realized nirvana stopping the cycle of birth and death forever If a person listens earnestly he will achieve unlimited happiness Having received this verse I went to the house of the ill man
I gave three liang of esh every day but because I thought of this one verse I did not experience any pain
I did this every day without fail and after a month the mans illness was completely cured I then saw that my own body had also been restored to its original form
Thereupon I made the vow to seek enlightenment and achieve buddhahood in a future life I also vowed that at that time I would also be called ākyamuni
This is the story behind my present attainment of the buddhahood The Ji yiqiefude sanmei jing says
In the past incalculable numbers of kalpas ago a holy man called Zuisheng lived in a forest
He possessed the ve supernatural powers and was constantly practicing compassion
Later he thought Compassion by itself cannot save sentient beings
Only those who have learned widely can destroy the impure desires and wrong views of sentient beings and lead them to the correct view Having thought this he traveled around the cities and villages seeking everywhere for a teacher who could teach the Dharma
At that time the god Māra appeared to the holy man and said I have here a verse uttered by the Buddha
Now if you are willing to write the verse down peeling skin off your body to serve as paper drawing blood as ink and using your own bone as the pen I will tell you the verse When he heard this the holy man Zuisheng thought In the course of an uncountable number of thousands of kalpas I constantly cut myself for the benet of others
I have experienced suffering beyond measure yet without any benets
I will now give up this impermanent body in exchange for the permanent and real Dharma He was delighted with this thought and with a sharp knife peeled off some skin to use as paper drew blood to use as ink and broke off a bone to use as a pen
With palms joined he turned to the god and asked for the verse
Seeing this the god Māra became depressed and fatigued and quietly disappeared
When the holy man saw this he said I now am happy to offer parts of my body for the sake of the Dharma peeling off my skin to use as paper drawing blood to use as ink and breaking off a bone to use as a pen
With my mind utterly sincere free from any falsehood I pray that if in any other world a being is present who can preach the Dharma let him appear right before me As soon as these words were spoken from a buddha land called Puwukou  thirtytwo buddha lands east of here a buddha called Jingmingwang suddenly appeared before him and cast a bright light over Zui shengs body
His pain was immediately removed and his body was restored to its original condition
Buddha then preached the samādhi of gathering all merits and virtues
When he heard this Zuisheng acquired the ability to speak eloquently without hindrance
Having given this sermon the Buddha disappeared
The holy man Zuisheng who had acquired the ability to speak eloquently without hindrance preached the superior Dharma widely to sentient beings and caused an incalculable number of sentient beings to dwell on the path of the three vehicles
One thousand years later his life ended and he was reborn in the Puwukou buddha land of Jingmingwang Buddha
Because he had honored the Dharma he was then able to achieve buddhahood
Buddha said to Jingwei  I myself was Zuisheng in the distant past From this we know that if someone honors and seeks the Dharma for the benet of that person the Buddha does not enter nirvana and the Dharma does not disappear
Such a person will be able to see the Buddha face to face even if in a different land and obtain the correct Dharma
The Puyao jing says
If a wise person listens to this scripture and with palms joined takes refuge in it he will abandon the eight conditions that constitute the foundation of laziness and will realize the eight virtues
What are the eight virtues
First becoming handsome in appearance second becoming powerful and prosperous third increasing the number of attendant relatives fourth becoming innitely eloquent fth learning quickly and renouncing the householders life sixth being able to keep ones practice pure seventh achieving samādhi in meditation and eighth acquiring the wisdom that illumines everything
If a Dharma master sits on a mat and recites this scripture he will obtain eight seats of merits
What are the eight
First obtaining the elders seat second obtaining the seat of a cakravartin  third obtaining the seat of the heavenly ruler fourth obtaining Maheśvaras seat fth obtaining the seat of an arhat sixth obtaining the seat of a bodhisattva seventh obtaining the seat of a tathāgata and eighth obtaining the seat for turning the Dharma wheel and leading all sentient beings to liberation
If a Dharma master announces this Dharma widely and receives the response of praise he will obtain eight pure conducts
What are the eight
First his words and conduct will match without any discrepancies second his speech will be utterly sincere and free of any falsehood third he will speak only truth and no lies will be uttered in an assembly fourth people will have faith in his speech and not neglect or distance themselves from it fth his speech will be gentle with nothing crude in it from the beginning sixth his voice will be melancholic like the cry of a sorrowful phoenix seventh his body and mind will be in tune with the proper time his speech will sound like the voice of the god Brahmā and no one in the assembly will refuse to accept his instruction and eighth his speech will sound like the voice of the Buddha agreeable to the minds of sentient beings
A person who studies this scripture will secure eight great storehouses 
What are the eight
First the storehouse of the meaning that never is wrongly abandoned second the storehouse of the receptive mind that understands everything and makes proper distinctions in the scriptural teachings third the storehouse of the past and the future with which one understands the teachings of all buddhas fourth the storehouse of dhāraṇīs with which one remembers everything that one has heard fth the storehouse of eloquence with which one propagates the scriptures among sentient beings who accept it with delight sixth the storehouse of the profound Dharma in which the teaching of the Three Jewels will never be lost and eighth the storehouse of honoring the Dharma which leads immediately to the insight of the truth of nonarising
The Huayan jing says
Good friends even with as much ink as the great ocean and as many pens that together would form Mount Sumeru it would still not be possible to exhaustively copy this scripture covering each chapter each teaching each story of skillful means each teaching of all that rises and the meaning of each phrase
The Dasheng zhuangyan lun says
There are ten kinds of correct practices for bodhisattvas with regard to the Mahayana teaching copying  making offerings to it circulating it listening to it reading it teaching it to others reciting it interpreting it reecting carefully on it and cultivating it
These ten correct practices produce incalculable merit
The Zhongbian fenbie lun says
There are ten ways of cultivation in the Mahayana
copying  making offerings to it giving gifts to others listening singlemindedly to what others recite reading oneself choosing the right expressions and meanings that accord with the truth explaining clearly the spiritual truth and meanings of its expression listening to recitation with the correct mental attitude reecting truthfully on the teaching of emptiness and having understood the teaching practicing it so as not to regress
The Pusazang jing says
Furthermore āriputra these good men and women receive this scripture respectfully listen to it recite it understand its meaning and preach it widely to others
You should know that these people gain ten kinds of meritorious and praiseworthy benets
What are the ten
First achieving the wisdom of quickness of wit second achieving eloquent wisdom third achieving sharp wisdom fourth achieving the wisdom that works rapidly fth achieving the wisdom that is broad in scope sixth achieving the wisdom of profound depth seventh achieving the wisdom that penetrates all phenomena eighth achieving the wisdom of nonattachment ninth constantly seeing the Tathāgata before oneself and having seen him praising him with beautiful verses and tenth being able to ask the Tathāgata intelligent questions and being able to explain and resolve doubts and criticism
āriputra this is called gaining ten kinds of meritorious and praiseworthy benets
Furthermore āriputra these good men and women receive this scripture recite it understand its meaning and preach it widely to others
You should know that these people gain another ten kinds of meritorious and praiseworthy benets
What are these ten
First to take pleasure in always avoiding unwholesome friends second to take pleasure in always being close to wholesome friends third to be able to loosen all bondage to Māra fourth to destroy Māras army fth to be able to effectively reject all delements sixth to maintain in all practices the constant attitude of giving seventh to turn away from all teachings that lead to rebirth in inferior realms eighth to turn toward all teachings that lead to nirvana ninth to preach well about all pure deeds of giving that lead beyond life and death and tenth to skillfully study and follow all the rules that bodhisattvas should follow and to honor the commands of all the buddhas
These are called the ten kinds of meritorious and praiseworthy benets
The Niepan jing Nirvana Sutra T  ref Dafangbian fobaoen jing Tb says The Dharma is the mother of the Buddha
The Buddha is born from the Dharma All tathāgatas of the three ages worship the Dharma The Duwujiji jing says
There was once a monk who diligently practiced and guarded the Dharma
The scripture he could recite was the Perfection of Wisdom
Everyone who heard him recite was lled with joy
A young boy seven years old who was herding sheep outside the city heard from a great distance the sound of the monk reciting the scripture
The boy immediately came to the temple paid respect and listened to the words of the scripture
When the teaching on the emptiness of form was given he immediately understood it
The boy asked the monk a question but the monk could not answer
The boy then explained the meaning of the teaching to the monk This was a teaching that was heard only rarely and in the distant past
The monk was puzzled by the extraordinary wisdom of the small boy
The boy then left but while herding an ox in the mountains he came across a tiger and was killed
The boy was then reborn in an elders family
When the elders wife became pregnant she could recite aloud the Perfection of Wisdom and continued to do so ceaselessly from morning to evening
People in the elders household became suspicious saying that the wife suffered from an illness caused by possession by a ghost
A monk then came to the house and delighted by the elders wifes voice said This is not a case of ghost possession
She is reciting a scripture The wife came out and paid respect to the monk and then preached to him
She was able to resolve all doubts and difculties and explain everything completely
The monks present were delighted
When the time came the wife gave birth to a boy
At birth he knelt with palms joined and preached the Perfection of Wisdom
After giving birth the wife recovered to how she was before she became pregnant
The monk said This child is truly a disciple of the Buddha
Raise him with great care
The child will later become a great teacher for all people
We will all follow him and receive his instruction By the time the boy was seven years old he had mastered all the teachings of the Way standing high above all others his wisdom was limitless
Where mistakes had occurred in the copies of scriptures he corrected and established the correct edition
Wherever the boy went he converted and taught people
At the house of the elder ve hundred people young and old all learned from the child
Eightyfour thousand people decided to seek the unsurpassed and true Way
Five hundred monks heard the sermon given by the boy and having removed deling desires achieved liberating understanding
They were determined to seek the Great Vehicle and obtain the purity of the Dharma eye
The boy at that time was none other than myself
The monk was Kāśyapa Buddha
The Shelifu chutai jing says While the mother was pregnant with āriputra she also became intelligent The Gaoseng zhuan says
While his mother was pregnant with Kumārajīva she became intelligent
She recite one thousand verses
After she became pregnant she acquired two thousand verses each day
She rst achieved the status of streamwinner later she became a oncereturner
The Shengtianwang jing says
The place where a Dharma teacher circulates this teaching is the place where the Tathāgata walks
One should mentally treat that Dharma teacher as a good spiritual friend honoring him as if he were the Buddha If you see this Dharma teacher joyfully pay respect to him honor and praise him
Even if I lived in the world for one world age or nearly one world age not be able to describe exhaustively the merits of the Dharma teacher who circulates this scripture
Even if a good man or woman shedding blood on the ground where this Dharma teacher walks so that dust does not arise this would not be adequate to honor him
It is so difcult to receive and practice the Tathāgatas Dharma wheel 
The Huayan jing says
Take the garuḍa king in comparison The bird ies around the empty sky and stays safely there
He observes with eyes of purity the great palace of the dragon king of the ocean
He powerfully moves his two wings and divides the water of the ocean water into two parts
He knows which of the male and female dragons is about to die and snatches them away
The Tathāgata Arhat and Correctly Enlightened One compared with the garuḍa king is also like this
He safely stays in the empty sky and observes with eyes of purity all the sentient beings inside the palaces within Dharma realms to see whether there are sentient beings whose good karmic roots have reached maturity
Powerfully mobilizing his ten powers and with the two wings of cessation and contemplation divides the water of the great ocean of the desires and in accordance with the needs of these sentient beings leads them out of the ocean of birth and death establishing securely the Tathāgatas unobstructed path
The Niepan jing Nirvana Sutra Tc b b A man or woman of a good family who hears the name of this scripture will never be reborn in any of the four lower evil realms of birth
If this scripture enters the ear of a sentient being then all evil Avīci Hell karma is removed
If this scripture enters the ear of a sentient being then for the period of seven world ages that sentient being will not be reborn in a lower evil realm of birth
If one learns that the Tathāgata is eternal and does not undergo change or if the sound of the two characters for eternity enters ones ear even once one will be reborn in heaven
After liberation he or she can achieve realization of the truth of the Tathāgatas eternity and immutability
The Huayan jing says Hearing one phrase of the rarely heard Dharma is superior to receiving the rare jewels of the trichiliocosm universes
If a bodhisattva hears one verse of the correct Dharma he gives rise to the thought of the superior possession and obtains a superior rank to that of a universal monarch
The Fahua jing says
If a man or woman of good family receives and practices this Lotus Sutra reading it reciting it explaining its meaning and copying it that person will obtain eight hundred kinds of merit of the eyes one thousand two hundred kinds of merit of the ears eight hundred kinds of merit of the nose one thousand two hundred kinds of merit of the tongue eight hundred kinds of merit of the body and one thousand two hundred kinds of merit of the mind
The Niepan jing Nirvana Sutra Ta ca T
After I entered nirvana if people hear this wonderful Mahayana scripture and believe and honor it they will not be reborn in the lower evil realms in future for a hundred thousand myriad world ages
Even if one decides to seek the path under buddhas as numerous as the grains of sand in the Ganges River thereafter never reviles the Dharma in evil worlds and loves and delights in this scripture that person cannot teach it clearly and extensively to others
Even if one decides to seek the path under buddhas as numerous as twice the number of grains of sand in the Ganges River thereafter never reviles the Dharma in evil worlds and understands believes practices and recites the scripture that person still cannot teach it extensively
Even if one decides to seek the path under buddhas as numerous as three times the number of grains of sand in the Ganges River thereafter never reviles the Dharma in evil worlds 
and copies the scripture in scrolls even then that person would not be able to explain to others the deep meanings they do not understand
If one decides to seek the path under buddhas as numerous as four times the number of grains of sand in the Ganges River thereafter never reviles the Dharma in evil worlds 
and copies the scripture in scrolls that person will be able to teach others onesixteenth of the meaning of the scripture
If one decides to seek the path under buddhas as numerous as ve times the number of grains of sand in the Ganges River 
in the evil world that person will be able to teach others eight of the sixteen parts of the meaning of the scripture
If one decides to seek the path under buddhas as numerous as six times the number of grains of sand in the Ganges River 
in the evil world that person will be able to teach others twelve of the sixteen parts of the meaning of the scripture
If one decides to seek the path under buddhas as numerous as seven times the number of grains of sand in the Ganges River 
in the evil world that person will be able to teach others fourteen of the sixteen parts of the meaning of the scripture
If one decides to seek the path under buddhas as numerous as eight times the number of grains of sand in the Ganges River 
in the evil world copies the scripture in scrolls and encourages others to copy it listens to the Dharma and encourages others to listen and practice accordingly that person will be able to understand fully the complete meaning of the scripture
We now in the age of decline The Dharma follows human corruption
Religion is adulterated by worldly concerns
The transmission has diverted from the truth
Different kinds of teachings are mixed up and practiced simultaneously
People do not study the Buddhist scriptures but concentrate exclusively on worldly books
Even when they copy scriptures their hearts are not in it
They do not observe the rules of purity and also make many mistakes
They place scriptures in domestic residences
Sometimes the scriptures are placed near the entrance
People are not concerned even if the scriptures are damaged by wind rain and insects
Consequently the scriptures lose their miraculous powers Even when people recite them the scriptures do not bring the benets of relieving suffering
This is because our hearts are not in what we do and because people grow increasingly more arrogant
The Jingfu jing says
The instruction for students scriptures is that they cannot reverse the order of two characters or duplicate dots 
If they do so they will fall into realms of delusion for ve hundred lives and not be able to hear the correct Dharma
The Daji jing says
If sentient beings commit evil deeds damaging the Dharma reviling holy beings place obstructions in the path of those who teach the Dharma skip characters in copying scriptures destroy other peoples teachings or hide other peoples scriptures for these deeds they will be reborn blind
The Dabanruo jing  says
The Buddha said Good men and women if when you are copying the profound sutra of the Perfection of Wisdom if you yawn frequently and laugh uncontrollably despise others become unsettled and irritable both physically and mentally mix up the order of phrases and get confused about the teaching fail to get the meaning or unexpected interruptions occur and the copying is not completed you should know that Māra is causing this for the bodhisattva The Dasheng lianhuazang jing says
If one has received the Buddhas precepts and fails to protect them in the future claims to be a  this person will be in the Mahayana just as when someone tries to nd his way in the dark of the night
If claims I have gotten the Buddhas teaching will undergo suffering beyond description in the hell of steel spears
After coming out of that hell the person will be dumb and blind and will not be able to encounter the correct Dharma
The Anan qing jiel lun says
If while reading sutra vinaya and Abhidharma texts monks nuns and lay followers handle the rolls of the scripture while talking in the calculation of the number of years in the Heaven of the Thirtythree they will have committed a grave duṣkṛta offense and will receive the punishment of rebirth as an animal for the period of two myriad years
They will be reborn among deer they will be dragged around and whipped the pain will be unbearable
If they touch the scripture sutra vinaya or Abhidharma while joking harmlessly they will receive the same punishment as above
If they place a scripture sutra vinaya or Abhidharma under the awning outside the scripture and image hall they will have committed the grave duṣkṛta offenses for a period of eight hundred years in the calculation of the Heaven of the Thirtythree  and will receive the punishment of rebirth as an animal for a period of two myriad years They will be reborn among pigs and dogs
Even if they are reborn as a human for a period of myriad years they will live among refuse and will not be free
The Daping jing Greater Perfection of Wisdom Scripture Tc These people spoke disparagingly about the omniscience of the buddhas of the three ages
The karmic effects of damaging the Dharma created causes and conditions and they fell into great hells for incalculable numbers of years
These destroyers of the Dharma are moved from one great hell to another
If a kalpa re breaks out they are reborn in a great hell in another world and move from one great hell to another there
If a kalpa re breaks out there they are reborn in a great hell in yet another world and move from one great hell to another there
In this way they travel through hells everywhere
When a kalpa re breaks out they die but because their karmic causes and conditions are not yet exhausted they are reborn in a great hell in another world where they move from one great hell to another receiving an incalculable amount of suffering
When the kalpa re breaks out they are taken to a different land elsewhere and are born among animals
They are punished for the crime of destroying the Dharma there as in the hells described above
As the gravity of sin lessens they are sometimes reborn in human bodies or in a household of blind people or in a caṇḍāla family or in the families of various kinds of lowly people such as lavatory cleaners or carriers of corpses
They are born with no eyes or with one eye or blind they may be without a tongue without ears or without arms
Where they are born there will be no buddha no Buddhas Dharma nor disciples of the Buddha
This is because by committing the destruction of the Dharma they accumulated heavy karma
The Niepan jing says
Those who do not have faith in this scripture will suffer incalculably from illnesses in this life and frequently be abused by other sentient beings
After death others will despise them
Their facial features will be ugly
They will have a hard time securing livelihood
Even the little that they get will be of very poor quality
They will be reborn in poor and lowly families that revile the correct Dharma
At the moment of death they will encounter political disturbances
Armed groups will compete with each other and rulers will be tyrannical and violent
Vengeful enemies will invade
Even if they have good friends they wont be able to see them
What they need of livelihood they wont be able to obtain
Even if they manage to get some gains they will still constantly suffer from hunger and thirst
These people will only be known among the lowest
Kings and ministers will not include them in their lists of 
Even if they hear any teaching they will not accept its truth
These people will be like birds whose wings are broken and are unable to y
Similarly these people will not be reborn in the future in the benevolent realms of human beings or gods
If people believe the Mahayana sutras even if they were originally born with an ugly appearance due to the merit of the sutras they will become handsome
Their appearance will improve day by day and eventually they will become that human beings and gods will take pleasure in seeing them
People and gods will pay respect to them become attracted to them and will nd it difcult to leave them
Kings and ministers and members of their family will all love to hear what they teach and respectfully accept it
If any of my hearer disciples wishes to carry out the foremost and rare practice they should widely teach these Mahayana scriptures
People of good families the fog may be so encompassing that one may think that it will not allow the light of the sun to come through yet when the sun comes out the fog dissipates completely
People of good families the evil karma of sentient beings is like this
It may be so powerful that it seems impossible to see the great sun of nirvana through it
Yet when the sun comes out it will remove all evil karma
The Fahua jing says
While the Buddha is in this world or after his extinction if one reviles this scripture or on seeing those who recite copy and practice it they despise hate or hold grudges against them the sin of that person is as follows
When the person dies he will be reborn in Avīci Hell for the period of one world age
When the world age ends that person will be reborn and in this way will undergoes lives through an innite number of world ages
When they come out of hell they will fall to the realm of animals
In rebirths through an innumerable number of world ages they will be born deaf and dumb without any sense organs
said to āriputra If I were to speak of the sins of those who revile this scripture I would not be able to exhaust the topic for  one world age Concluding verses say The teaching is transmitted in the three storehouses Teaches compassionately the eight causes It reaches widely all sentient beings In showing the mysterious path to those with the capacity for enlightenment It displays its power like the summers heat or Gently like the warmth of spring After days of decay and drying up Its luster is pleasant Rolled up holds auspiciousness within Extended it presents wisdom As one thinks of its content ceaselessly The content expands and renews itself We truly call it our kind father and Skillfully title it Capable of Benevolence  How could the teachings of Confucius and Laozi Match it as a way of governing the world Just as a potter shapes pots on a wheel Miracle Stories Miracles in the Han fa neizhuan jing Jin dynasty

Emperor Ming of the Han sent Cai Yin Qin Jing Wang Zun and others altogether eighteen people to India and they brought back Mateng and Falan as well as Buddhist scriptures and buddha images
The emperor asked If a Dharma King appeared in the world why did the inuence of his teaching fail to reach here Mātaṇga answered The kingdom of Kapilavastu in India is the center around which ten billion suns and moons of the threefoldthousand great cosmic systems turn
The buddhas of the past present and future all rst appear there
Among the gods dragons human beings and ghosts all those who are capable of making vows will be born there and receive the correct teaching of the Buddha and attain enlightenment
Beings in other places lack the proper karmic conditions to be affected by the Buddhas teaching The Buddha therefore does not go to those places
Even though the Buddha does not go his halos  reach these places and after ve hundred years or one thousand years or more than a thousand years holy beings will transmit the Buddhas teaching in all these places and carry out conversions The emperor was delighted 
On the rst day of the rst month of Yongping  of Han six hundred and ninety Daoist monks of the Five Peaks presented a memorial to the court
they petitioned that a public debate with Buddhist monks from the Western Region be held to determine the relative superiority of teachings
The court ordered the Director of Imperial Secretariat Song Xiang to call the parties in and announce the following
on the fteenth day of the same month there would be a large gathering at the southern gate of Baima Monastery Three altars would be set up
Daoist monks of the Five Peaks and the Eight Mountains would bring three hundred and sixtynine rolls and place them on the western altar
Works of the twentyseven philosophers three hundred and thirtyve philosophical works would be placed on the central altar
Food offered to one hundred deities would be on the eastern altar
Emperor Ming set up a temporary residence west of the road leading to the monastery and placed there relics of the Buddha and scriptures
The Daoist monks burned branches and twigs around their altar
They wept tears in front of the scriptures saying The ruler has placed his faith in wrong teachings and the inuence of the profound Daoist teaching has been lost
We challenge this by spreading our scriptures on the altar and setting re to them to prove their authenticity They then set re  The texts turned into ashes
The Daoist monks turned to each other in embarrassment
Wishing either to y up to heaven or to disappear into the ground they tried a variety of magical tricks but none worked
They were greatly humiliated
Grand Mentor Zhang Yan said You could not demonstrate anything today
You should follow the Buddhist teaching of the Western Region and shave your head The followers of nonBuddhist teachings Chu Shanxin and others had no answer
The Daoist monks of Nanyue Fei Shucai and others died of rancor
The relics of the Buddha emitted vecolored light that covered the sky like an umbrella over the sun and illumined all who were gathered
Mātaṅga ew up high into the sky and performed miraculous deeds
Then heaven rained down owers miraculously
Dharma Master Dharmaratna preached to the assembly carrying out conversions on an unprecedented scale
Minister of Works Liu Jun Lady Yin of the Inner Palace in the capital city the Daoist monk of the Four Mountains L Huitong and others altogether over a thousand people chose to renounce the householders life 
The emperor approved their requests and established ten monasteries
seven monasteries outside the city wall for monks and three monasteries inside the city wall for nuns
After this the Buddhist teaching was promoted widely and many monasteries continue to be established to the present time
The above passage is found in the Han faben neizhuan Jin Dynasty A person from Jiyin with the surname Ding and the personal name of Dezhen served as Director of Ningyin during the Jianan period Jianyuan outside to collect water from a well
A foreigner with a long nose and deepset eyes passed by the well and asked the woman for a drink of water
As soon as he drank the water he disappeared
The woman was attacked by stomach pain and her body twisted as she screamed in pain
After a while she suddenly sat up and began to give instruction in a foreign language
People from dozens of families in the village saw this
The woman asked for paper and pen wishing to write down what she wanted
Given a pen she produced writing in a foreign script
It was written horizontally some letters looked like the character yi and others looked like the character si
She lled ve sheets and then threw the papers on the ground ordering people to read them
Nobody in the village could read them
A boy over ten years old was there
The woman pointed to the boy and said that he could read what she had written
When people gave the papers to the boy he immediately read them in the foreign language
Those who saw this were taken aback and did not know what to say
The woman told the boy to get up and dance
The boy immediately stood up and raised his legs and clapped hands along with them
After a while he stopped
People reported this right away to Dezhen who then called on the woman and the boy to inquire about it
By then they did not remember anything
Dezhen wished to test the validity of this miraculous turn of events so he sent the document to a monastery where it was shown to an old foreign monk
The foreign monk was amazed saying There is a missing section in a Buddhist scripture
Because I brought it from such a long distance I was distressed that we wouldnt be able to recover it
Even though we recite the scripture the recitation remains imperfect
This document is the original text  He kept and copied it
Zhou Min was from Runan and served as ProtectorGeneral of Jin
His family honored Buddhism over many generations
At the time Su Jun rebelled  CE  people in the cities and villages ed in all directions
Mins family owned a copy of the Larger Perfection of Wisdom Scripture
It was written on a sheet of silk halflength in width and eight zhang long
There were several bags containing other scriptures as well and the copy of the Larger Perfection of Wisdom Scripture was mixed in among them
When the time came for him to ee he was alone and could not carry all the bags with him
Zhou Min particularly valued the Larger Perfection of Wisdom Scripture but he did not know which of the bags contained it
The man in charge of the storehouse also had to leave and he refused to look for it
As Zhou Min looked in the bags in distress suddenly the Larger Perfection of Wisdom Scripture appeared outside of the bags
Bin was delighted and took it with him
The Zhou clan subsequently treated the scripture as its family treasure and it is said to still exist
According to one tradition the wife of Zhou Song of the Humu clan owned a copy of the Perfection of Wisdom Scripture written on silk
The piece of silk was ve cun wide and the entire Larger Perfection of Wisdom Scripture was written on it
She also owned a piece of a relic contained in a silver jar
Both were sealed inside a deep box
When the disturbances of the Yongjia period occurred the Humu woman tried to ee southward to escape the invading soldiers
Both the scripture and the relic spontaneously came out from the box 
She took them and crossed over to the eastern side of the Jiang River
Later there was a re She did not have time to get the scripture out and the house completely burned down yet she found the scripture beneath the ashes in exactly the same condition as before
The Prince of Kuaiji Daozi is said to have asked Song  his copy of the scripture so that the prince could worship it
Later it is said to have been kept at Xinzhu Monastery
Liu Jingshu said I myself once saw this scripture
It was written very neatly and legibly in small characters the size of ax seeds Xinzhu Monastery is the present Tianan Monastery
A copy of this scripture was made by the monk Shi Huize
According to one tradition this scripture was once at Jianjing Monastery and the nun Jingshou recited from it
Dong Ji was from Yuqian
For three generations his family had honored the Buddhist teaching and Ji was particularly diligent in practice
Always careful in thought and conduct he recited the Shoulengyan jing ūraṃgamasutra T
Whenever there was sickness in the village Ji was asked to read the scripture and many of the ill were cured
He Guang of the same district was also one who honored the Buddhist teaching
In the Xianhe period he suddenly became ill from mountain poison and was in distress
Guangs elder brother came quickly to Ji to ask for help
The distance between Dong s house and that of He was sixty to seventy li and a large mountain valley also lay between them
Heavy rain fell during the fth month
The water had not yet reached the valley when Guangs elder brother crossed it
Ji agreed and came around the time of the midday meal but a massive volume of water was rushing down violently and they could not cross the valley
Unable to swim Ji paced about sighing
He sat on the riverbank for a long time wanting to go on but not daring to cross the river
Ji was a man of strong faith determined to get to the destination
Taking pity on the ill he made a vow In coming to rescue the acute suffering of others I do not care about my own life
I sincerely wish that the great being Tathāgata will truly protect me Then he took his clothes off wrapped the scripture in the clothing placed the bundle on his head and walked into water
Measuring its depth the water should have come up to his neck but when Ji actually entered the stream and began to cross it it reached only to his knees
When he got to the other side of the river he realized that he had lost the wrapped scripture
Greatly distressed he went on to Guangs house
Expressing repentance to heaven earth and human beings he wept blaming himself
Then he looked up and saw the bundle containing the scriptures on a high seat
Torn between sorrow and joy Ji took it and looked the bag was wet but when he opened it the scripture inside was dry
Everyone in the village then chose to honor the Dharma
Northwest where Ji lived there was a tall peak many monsters lived there and harmed the villagers
Ji decided to vanquish them through the power of the scripture and the precepts
At a place on the side of the mountain four or ve mu in size Ji built a hut cutting down trees for lumber with his own hands
He set up a high seat where he recited the Shoulengyan jing
For over a hundred days he sat in quietude no sound was heard
The harm to the villagers stopped
Later several people came to Jis place and were talking among themselves for a long while
Ji thought that the people were not hermits and wondered why they had come to this remote spot on the mountain
Suspecting that they might be ghosts Ji said to them Are you the ghosts who live here They answered Yes having heard about the purity and loftiness of your virtue and conduct we came to see you
There is also one thing that we wanted to propose to you
We have had this mountain entrusted to us over generations
Since you came here however we have been worried about running into conict with you and cannot live in peace
We now want to divide the territory and mark the boundaries by felling some trees Ji said I enjoy the quietude of this place and read scriptures
I shall not commit offenses against you
I shall be a friend to you and offer my help The ghosts said We will count on your promise to not attack us So saying they left
Overnight the trees on all four sides of the eld of grass died It was as if they had been burned in a forest re
Ji died at the age of eightyseven
Zhou Dang was from Shan in Kuaiji
His family had honored the Dharma for generations
As soon as he reached the age of sixteen Dang became a vegetarian and took all his meals before noon  He chanted the Chengju 
At one time he arranged for the reading of scriptures
When the long period of retreat in the rst month of the year ended he invited the monks to a meal
He went to the monastery in town and extended an invitation to his teachers Zhu Fomi and Zhi Fajie
Zhu Fomi had a copy of the Shorter Perfection of Wisdom Scripture brought out for the abbreviated reading on the day of the feast
When the day arrived three monks came to the meal but they forgot to bring the copy of the Shorter Perfection of Wisdom Scripture with them
They realized this only when the meal was nished and they were about to start reading
was despondent
Zhous house was located in Fanyi village thirty li from the monastery
It was not possible to send someone to fetch the scripture
By the time people offered incense everyone in the household was unhappy and Zhu Fomi was in even greater distress
Then someone knocked on the gate saying that he had brought the Shorter Perfection of Wisdom Scripture
Zhou Dang was amazed and delighted
Opening the gate he saw a youth dressed in singlelayered clothes and a cap
He did not recognize him and it was not a time when people typically walked about
Suspecting a miraculous visitation Zhou Dang kneeled and received the scripture
He urged the youth to sit in the front row but the youth would not proceed to the front his young age
He promised that he would come back in the evening to listen to the recitation of the scripture
When this young man of the Way went out of the gate he suddenly became invisible
Fragrance lled the entire residence
Upon closer examination the copy of the scripture that he had brought proved to be Zhu Fomis own copy
Everyone both monks and laypeople were surprised and delighted
This copy of the scripture had been locked up in the kitchen 
When the monks returned they found the lock untouched
As a consequence all the families in the village more than ten altogether came to honor the Buddhas teaching and love Zhou Dang
Zhou Dang eventually left the householders life and took the monastic name Tanni
He chanted numerous scriptures twenty thousand characters in all
Xie Fu personal name Jingxu was a man from Shanyin in Kuaiji
He was the son of elder brother General You
From his youth he had a spiritual temperament and sequestered himself in the eastern mountains
Possessing strong faith in the great teaching he was diligent and tireless in religious life
A copy of the Shoulengyan jing that he had copied with his own hand was in Baima Monastery
A re destroyed everything in the monastery including copies of other scriptures yet only the cover and edges of this copy of the scripture were burned
The writing was not damaged at all
When Fu died his friends were skeptical about his spiritual attainments but when they heard about this miraculous scripture they all marveled
In Yuanxi  there was a massive re in the city of Pufan in the Hetong region
The re crossed the Yellow River and nothing escaped destruction
The residences of local barbarians were all burned down only the monasteries and stupas remained untouched by re
Many small buildings in the villages that housed scriptures and images also escaped the re
Sometimes intact pages of the scripture were recovered from among the ashes of destroyed buildings 
Everyone in the city marveled at this and joined together in paying respect to the teaching
Eastern Jin Dynasty Before the reign of Emperor Xiaowu the monk Daoan of Changshan ed to Xiangyang to avoid the disturbances caused by the Shi clan of Chao
There he wrote commentaries altogether over twenty rolls on the Perfection Wisdom scriptures the Daoxing  and the Miji jingang  resolving doubtful points and explaining the meaning 
Fearing that he may have departed from the truth he made an oath If what I have said does not deviate from the truth let there be an auspicious sign He then had a dream in which a foreign monk with white hair and a long beard told Daoan Your commentaries agree with the truth of the Way
Not being able to enter nirvana I remain in the Western Region Let us work together to spread the teaching
You should set down food for me at specied times Later the Sarvāstivādavinaya was brought to China and Huiyuan said The monk our teacher saw in his dream a long time ago was PiṇḍolaBharadvāja Because of this Huiyuan set up a seat and served food to Piṇḍola

Everyone in the country marveled
Shixing was immediately allowed to travel eastward to China
This was the Fangguang jing 
Zhu Shixing passed away at the age eighty
His corpse was committed to re but did not burn Monks nuns and lay supporters were all amazed
They pronounced a spell If has truly attained the Way let the corpse break up As soon as the spell was uttered the corpse began breaking apart
The pieces were collected and a stupa was raised

Before the summer was over toward the end of the sixth month his beard grew out and he acquired a masculine appearance
This was reported to the court and the emperor respectfully assigned important duties 
Everyone in the country paid respect to the Huayan scripture
Song Dynasty Shi Huiyan was a monk at Dongan Monastery in the capital city
He disliked the verbosity of the Great Nirvana Sutra and produced an abbreviated version in several rolls and prepared two or three copies to show to likeminded friends
Then while asleep he saw a man over two zhang tall who had a powerful presence the man said to him The Nirvana Sutra is the source of canonical scriptures
Why did you casually revise it according to your petty understanding Huiyan was despondent but did not fully understand
He was still committed to his project and sought learned scholars
The next evening he went to sleep and again saw the man from the previous night
The man was very angry and said to Yan If you make a mistake but correct it when you realize that does not count as a mistake
I told you about your fault last evening but you still have not stopped
The truth is no longer in this scripture
Calamities will come to you soon Huiyan was alarmed realizing his mistake and before dawn arrived he quickly sent out messengers requesting the return of the manuscripts
He burned all of the returned manuscripts
The monk Daoyan of Chenwai Monastery recollected and told this story in detail
The nun Shi Zhitong was a nun at Jianjing Nunnery
She was young and attractive and not rmly committed in faith and practice
When her teacher died in Yuanxi  she left the nunnery
She married Yuan Xifu of Wei Commandery and gave birth to one son
The boy grew up to the age of seven years old The family was very poor and there was nothing that could be used to make clothing for the boy
Zhitong several rolls of silk on which the Pure Land Lotus and other sutras had been written
She turned these rolls into clothing for her son
After a year the boy became ill
He was in a strange mental state and his pulse was irregular
His body was covered with ulcers like burns
Small white worms came out more than a sheng each day
The boy screamed day and night from extreme pain
A voice was heard in the sky For destroying scriptures to make clothing receiving this extreme suffering as punishment More than ten days later the boy died
The monk Shi Huiqing was from Guangling
After renouncing the householders life he stayed at the monastery on Mount Lu
He studied the sutras and vinayas and maintained purity following the precepts
He could recite the Lotus Daśabhūmika Siyi and Vimalakīrti sutras
He would chant them every evening and the sound of snapping ngers and voices of praise were often heard in the darkness
Once while traveling on water he encountered wind and waves
Huiqing just continued reciting a sutra without a break
He felt as if someone was pulling the boat through the waves and suddenly it reached the shore
Thereafter he continued practicing Buddhism even more diligently
Huiqing died at the end of the Yuanjia period  at the age of sixtytwo
Qi Dynasty The family background of the monk Shi Huibao of Taiyuan is unknown
He recited two hundred rolls of scriptures
His virtues were superior to those who preceded him and he was widely known in his time
In Wuping   while traveling from Pingzhou to Ye he lost his way at Aizhou
Looking for a path he went into a mountainous area and spent the night under a rock ledge
It looked as if someone lived in the cave but he did not see anyone in the whole area
Huibao sat in front of the cave and looked up into a pine tree
He saw the musical instrument qing hanging down from a branch more than a zhang high above the ground
In the second watch of the evening a man clothed in grass came in from outside saying Why is there worldly air here Huibao immediately spoke up and paid respect and they talked together
asked Huibao Which clan is in power today Huibao answered The Gao clan
The dynasty is called Qi Huibao asked When did you Honored Teacher come to reside on the mountain answered I came during the time of the Later Han
What scriptural practice have you acquired Huibao could recite extensively and he was very proud of this accomplishment
The mountain monk said The cultivation of the Way should not be like this
Which scripture do you want me to recite Huibao said I take pleasure in listening to the Huayan scripture The monk recited it for a short time
The melody of his chanting was otherworldly
Huibao asked him to recite other sutras and the chanting was similarly extraordinary
Huibao marveled at this and asked How do you manage to recite lengthy scriptures so quickly The monk answered Mentally you try to do something
Mentally I do not try to do anything
If you forget yourself in the middle of the myriad things both object and subject materialize spontaneously Huibao realized that this was a supernatural monk and requested permission to stay 
The mountain monk said You are attracted by the material comforts of the world How can achieve spiritual peace
You have not let go of emotional bonds
Staying here wont help you At dawn Huibao left returning the way he had come He did not know where the place was located
He reproached himself for his shortcomings
Later he reached Ye and told this story The above two stories appear in the Liang gaoseng zhuan ref Xu gaoseng zhuan Tab
Liang Dynasty The following story is about He Gui of Nanhai Commandery in Guang zhou
The planet Jupiter was in the Xieqia constellation and the moon was in position matching the huangzhong musical note
On the twentythird day of the tenth month of Tianjian   He Gui was collecting herbs on Mount Huyi in Yuzhang
Fortunately he was not a rejected son or an expelled minister but was among those who sought the immortals or hermits
He climbed and visited the hamlets around the ten peaks
Suddenly he felt that he had come to the right place
Following a winding path he came to a creek in a valley
The water seemed to be stopped in a pool
Then there was a clear stream and he began to cross it raising up the bottom of his clothing
Before he nished crossing an elderly appeared suddenly and unexpectedly at the western corner of the valley and told Gui not to cross
Gui stopped
The mans face was green he was barefooted eighty or ninety years old and his face was deeply wrinkled
His beard was ve or six cun long and his moustache was half the length of his beard His ears stood higher than his eyebrows
The brows two or three cun long turned downward and owed in the wind
His lips were bright red and his voice clear
His hands and nails were yellow and the hair on his ngers was two to three cun long
He was wearing red clothes under his upper garment The monk took up a book in one roll and threw it from a good distance to Gui
Gui held the book and paid respect toward the man
The man told Gui Give this book to Jianan naming the prince by surname and style Anyone who receives this scripture should prepare a twentyone day feast
Those not familiar with the ritual for the feast should ask Master Fu of Xialin Temple
Dharma Master Fu observes the precepts rigorously dwells in quietude and nonaction has let go of preferences and desires and treats the powerful and humble equally
Fully satised with eating vegetables he is diligent in practicing meditation After saying this the elder left after he had walked ten steps or so he suddenly disappeared
Gui opened the scroll
It bore the title Sutra of the Wisdom Seal The message of the sutra was that the essence of the ultimate Dharma body is formlessness
The principle is derived from one hundred negations The meaning transcends names and forms
Quietude is the form of the Dharma The subtle reality is true thusness
One calls this wisdom illumination
This principle has the wholeness seal The mind mysteriously coalesces in quietude
This is the reason the teaching is called samādhi This story is found in the Hongming ji of Vinaya Master Sengyou of the Liang dynasty ref
Chu sansang ji ji Tc Zhou Dynasty The ruler of the Zhou  persecuted Buddhism and burned Buddhist scriptures
Later ve or six bundled objects were spotted in the sky
They were ying through the sky and were nearly invisible
They joined together and oated up and down in the wind
Members of the court watched them but had no idea what they were
Eventually they descended and fell onto a mud wall
Upon inspection they turned out to be the thirteenth roll of the Greater Perfection of Wisdom Sutra
Chen Dynasty Yan Gong of Yangzhou was originally from Quanzhou and from a wealthy family
He did not have a brother and his parents loved him dearly granting all his wishes
At the beginning of the Taijian period of the Chen dynasty  at the age of twenty Gong asked for fty thousand pieces of coin to trade in Yangzhou
His parents agreed
Gong lled a boat with merchandise and went down the Jiang River
At a place several tens of li from Yangzhou he encountered a boat lled with turtles that were to be sold at market in Yangzhou
Gong realized that the turtles were about to die and wanted to redeem them
He said to the owner of the turtles I have fty thousand pieces of coin
Let me purchase the turtles with it The owner was delighted took the money gave Gong the turtles and left
Gong released all the turtles into the Jiang River and took the nowempty boat to Yangzhou
After taking leave of Gong the owner of the turtles had traveled over ten li when his boat sank and he drowned
On that day Gongs parents were at home
Toward the evening fty people dressed in black visited them requesting permission to stay overnight
They also handed over fty thousand pieces of coin to Gongs parents saying Your son entrusted this money to be returned
Please count it and accept it The father feared that his son might have died and questioned the people for details
They said Your son is ne
It is only that he did not need the money so he is sending it back Gongs father accepted the money He recognized that it was the very same coins he had given Gong
The coins were all slightly wet
The father invited the guests to stay and prepared a meal
The guests left the next morning
One day in the following month Gong returned home
His parents were overjoyed
When he was settled they asked him about the money they had entrusted to him
Gong said that he did not have it
The parents described the guests appearance and when the money had been returned
It was the same day that Gong had saved the turtles
From this they learned that the fty guests were the redeemed turtles
Father and son were amazed
Together they went to Yangzhou and set up a temple and singlemindedly copied the Lotus Sutra
Eventually the whole family moved to Yangzhou and became very wealthy
They constructed a large building setting it up as a hall for copying scripture
The hall was beautifully adorned clean and richly provided for
There were always over ten scribes there
Monks nuns and lay Buddhists in Yangzhou honored the hall and called it Yan Fahua 
Once a close acquaintance borrowed a thousand pieces of coin from the scripture fund
Gong reluctantly gave it
The borrower placed the money on a boat for its return trip
On the way the boat capsized and the borrowed money fell into the water
The boat sank but no one drowned
On that day Gong went into the treasury and found a thousand pieces of coin
They were all wet as if just taken out of water
Gong found this very strange
Later he saw the man to whom he had loaned the money and realized that the wet pieces of coin were what he had given the man
Again a merchant went to Gongting Lake and offered wine food and other gifts
That night in a dream a deity returned these gifts saying Take this money that you gave to me to Yan Fahua and offer it for his use Then the deity placed everything that the merchant had offered earlier in front of him
The merchant found this extraordinary and sent the gifts to Gongs place doubling the amount
Later Gong went to a market to buy paper but he did not have enough money
Suddenly he encountered a person who gave him the three thousand pieces of coin he had in his hand saying To assist you in buying paper Having said this the person disappeared but the money remained
There were many such miracles
Gong died at the end of the Kaihuang period but his descendants continued his work 
At the end of the Sui dynasty bandits reached Jiangdu but they made an agreement among themselves and they would not enter Yan Fahuas village
Consequently the villagers escaped harm
Copying of the sutras continues even now
People all see it
This is also well known among prominent people in the capital city The above story comes from the Mingbao ji Tbc ref
Ji shenzhou sanbao gantong lu Ta Sui Dynasty At the beginning of the Kaihuang period of the Sui dynasty A monk in Yangzhou whose name is unknown made reciting the Nirvana Sutra his personal practice
At a village at the foot of a mountain in Qizhou a novice monk recited the Avalokiteśvara Sutra
Both died violent deaths
While the area under their hearts was still warm they were both taken to King Yama
The novice monk was placed on a golden high seat and treated with utmost respect
The monk who recited the Nirvana Sutra was placed on a silver seat and received less respect
They were questioned and both were found to still be alive and they were released
The Nirvana Sutrareciting monk who took pride in the larger amount that he could recite  was lled with resentment 
He asked where the novice monk lived
Then the two were returned to their respective homes and were brought back to life
The Nirvana Sutra monk then came from the south to Qizhou
He visited the novice monk and questioned him in detail seeking the reasons for his special treatment
The novice monk said When I recite the Avalokiteśvara Sutra I rst change my clothing and in a special place offer incense utter a vow and then recite  I adhere to this procedure rigorously
There is no other special method The other monk thanked him saying My sins go deep
In reciting the Nirvana Sutra I have not followed the proper ceremonial procedure
My body and mouth are impure my recitation is nothing more than rote memory
There is an ancient saying
Better to be good in doing something small than to be poor at doing a lot I now see the proof for this Full of regret the monk returned home
The monk Shi Huiyi of Jinggong Monastery in Xiangzhou secular surname Li was from Linyuan
He traveled south and at Mount Xiancheng he shared the same teacher as Huiming
He sought the essence of the teaching and concentrated on the practice of meditation
Later he stayed at Jinggong Monastery and meditated in the old hall of Master cong ref Xu gaoseng zhuan Tba
Even without the use of candles the hall was well lit day and night
A local gure who did not believe in Buddhism invited Huiyi to set up a meditation chamber and perform a onehundred day rite
Every night the nonbeliever went there secretly to observe
Everyone in the family saw that the meditation chamber was brightly illumined
The local nonbeliever converted and along with others accepted the Buddhist precepts
Huiyi knew the time of his death beforehand and died toward the end of the Kaihuang period 
There was also Meditation Master Fayong of Kaihuang Monastery in Xiang yang
When his life was about to end music and an extraordinary fragrance lled the monastery for seven days and seven nights
He died while sitting upright 
The body was taken to Mount Sangai and placed in the sitting position out in the open air
Vinaya Master Quan of the same monastery said to the corpse I request that you retain your spirit for seven days After seven days Quanl
His corpse was placed next to that of yong
Yongs corpse crumbled when exposed to the elements
The ācārya Cen whose surname was Yang was also from Linyuan
He built a sutra recitation hall west of the monastery next to the spring on Mount Sangai
Every time he recited the Golden Light Sutra the four heavenly kings miraculously came and listened
He later read canonical scriptures and memorized them all
Altogether he could recite more than three thousand rolls
He wore simple linen clothes and begged for almsfood
He fed the mice in his monastic cell what was left in the bowl and tamed over one hundred of them They would run around him
If a mouse got sick Master Cen would rub its head and the mouse was healed every time
He was close to Zhixiao a monk of the same monastery who gathered a community of meditation practitioners
This monk taught laypeople providing instruction for the study of meditation
Knowing the date of his own death quickly called Meditation Master Tai to entrust the teaching to him
He went up to the buddha hall and took leave of all the monks in the monastery requesting them to rejoice 
When the great communal feast at Chanju Monastery ended told Cen I am going to Tuṣita Heaven to listen to the Perfection of Wisdom Cen said You younger brother go rst
I will follow you seven days later In the third watch at night Zhixiao died in the sitting position
In the fourth watch spirit went to Bianxue Monastery  ten li away from Zhixiaos monastery and appeared at Meditation Master Tais bed The place became as light as during the daytime
The spirit said I Zhixiao am about to go far away
So I came to take leave
I cannot stay long Master Tai said goodbye to him outside of the threestoried gate
After the spirit departed Tai returned to his chamber and sat on the bed
Suddenly it became very dark
Tai called the attendant disciple and said I heard the master speak with someone He took a lamp and checked everywhere
The three gates  were all closed
He realized that spirits could enter even when no doorway was open
He then sent someone to inquire He was told that Master Zhixiao had departed
Seven days later Cen died in the sitting position
There were no seams on his skull
Thus we know that when saintly and ordinary beings live together it is not possible to distinguish the two The above two stories are from the Tang gaoseng zhuan ref Xu gaoseng zhuan Tb bc
In observing the precepts the monk Fazang of Baoshi Monastery in Zheng zhou was pure and sincere
In Kaiyuan  he built a monastery in Weichuan City in the Luojiao district
The buddha hall was exquisite and the residence for monks was magnicent
Many banners and owers were offered to the images
In Daye  the government merged monasteries stupas were sent to major temple in the regional capital
Some stupas were damaged
Master zang repaired them and placed them in a newly constructed hall
He also produced a copy of the canon in eight hundred rolls
Good scribes and paper and brushes were not available in the region so he had the copying done at the former Yueai Monastery in the capital city
In the intercalary second month of Wude  Fazang became ill
After twentysome days he saw a person dressed in a beautiful green robe above a tall building
The man was holding a scroll of scripture saying Ever since you became an adult you have acquired a great deal of merit which is wonderful but you appropriated a small amount of the property that belonged to the Three Jewels and committed an immeasurably great sin
What I hold here is the Diamond Perfection of Wisdom Sutra
If you copy it in one roll your sins of appropriating the property of the Three Jewels will be completely removed Master Fazang responded I will copy the scripture
I have copied other scriptures but not the Diamond Perfection of Wisdom
I wish to recover from the illness and will not disobey the order
When I wake up I will keep only my three robes water pot almsbowl and saṃghāṭī and donate everything else to great monks and their disciples He copied the Diamond Perfection of Wisdom Sutra producing altogether one hundred rolls
Within fteen days  when he was about to die Fazang saw Amitābha Buddha come to welcome him
Due to the power of copying scriptures he was reborn in the Western Pure Land and avoided falling into the three inferior realms after death During the Daye period 
A visitor came to the shrine at Mount Tai and requested permission to spend the night there
The shrine ofcial said We do not have a separate hostel
You may spend the night under the shrines corridor but someone who stayed there recently died The monk said No problem Having no other option he followed instructions and set up his bed under the corridor
At night the monk recited sutras
Around the rst watch he heard the sound of a belt of jewels
Shortly thereafter a deity appeared and paid respect to the monk
The monk said I hear that those who stay overnight here often die but how could you a patron of the monastery have harmed them
Please protect me The deity said Those who die hear my voice and die out of fear
I do not kill them
The master should not fear The monk asked the deity to sit down and they talked as if sharing a meal together
The monk soon asked I have heard it said that the realm of the ghosts of the dead is at Mount Tai
Is this true The deity answered I am of little merit but that is true
Do you wish to see someone who has died The monk said A couple of my fellow students have died
Could I see them The deity asked their names and then said One has already been reborn as a human being
The other is in hell
His sins are so grave that I cannot recall him
But the master can go and see him Hearing this the monk was delighted
He got up and went out and at a place not far away he saw many shrine hell chambers burning bright
The deity led the monk into one hall
In the distance the monk saw a man inside the re screaming indescribably his shape changed beyond recognition
The smell of burning blood and esh was unbearable
This is the man
Master do you not wish to see all the scenes of hells torture The monk was distressed and asked to be allowed to leave
Immediately he was back in the shrine sitting with the deity
The monk then asked Is there any point in asking that my fellow student be saved The deity answered Yes
Have the Lotus Sutra copied for his sake and he will then be released As dawn approached the deity took leave and the monk went into the hall
The shrine ofcial seeing that the monk was still alive was mystied
So the monk explained to him
The monk had a copy of the Lotus Sutra made
After the sutra was nished and decorated the monk took it to the shrine and again spent the night there
That night the deity appeared as before
Delighted he paid respect to the monk and asked what was the purpose of his visit
The monk explained the matter
The deity said The disciple knew that you Master had copied the sutra for him
As soon as the title of the sutra was inscribed he was released
He now lives among human beings
This place is impure and unsuitable for keeping the sutra
Please send it to a monastery After he said this after a long while toward dawn the deity took leave and departed
The monk sent the sutra to a monastery
Zhang Deyan Administrative Aide of the Hangzhou region formerly held an ofce in Yanzhou and learned of this incident
Tang Dynasty The monk Shi Zhiyuan of Youzhou was advanced in practice and welllearned
During the Daye period of Sui he decided to carve the entire canon into stone in preparation for the approaching period of the destruction of the Dharma
He carved out a cave in a mountain west of Youzhou polished its four walls and copied the scripture on them
He also took square pieces of rock polished them copied scriptures onto them and stored them in a rock chamber
Each chamber when lled was sealed with a rock
Zhiyuan then melted iron and sealed the cave
At that time Emperor Yangdi of the Sui dynasty traveled to Zhuo Commandery 
Vice Director of the Royal Secretariat Xiao Yu was the younger brother of the empress
A pious Buddhist he told the empress about project and she donated one thousand pi of silk and additional funds to support it
Yu donated ve hundred pi of silk
Court ofcials and people outside the court heard about this and rushed to give donations
For this reason yuans project succeeded
Many  some monastics and some laypeople arrived and rushed 
Zhiyuan wished to build a wooden buddha hall a dining room and sleeping chambers in front of the cave but wood and tiles were difcult to secure
He was afraid of wasting funds that had been donated for copying sutras With this thought he hesitated to embark on the project
One night a violent thunderstorm shook the mountain
The next morning the sky cleared and people saw below the mountain thousands of massive pine and cedar tree trunks oating on the water and piled up along the road
Wooden construction material is scarce in Shandong pine and cedar are particularly rare
People were amazed They could not determine where the lumber had come from and followed the trail that the logs had left
A long distance to the west a mountain cliff had collapsed and the trees  had oated over 
Everyone far and near marveled at this
The power of merit must have inclined the gods to provide miraculous assistance
Zhiyuan instructed the carpenters to choose  the rest was distributed among local communities
The people of those communities were delighted and helped in the construction of the buildings
The work was soon completed fullling original wishes
The stone scriptural tablets Zhiyuan produced lled seven chambers
He died in Zhenyuan  
Disciples continued his work
Palace Counselor Li Xuangjiang and Chamberlain of Law Enforcement Cai Xuanming are said to have told this story
In Zhenguan  Tang Lin traveled to Youzhou and personally asked the local people about it They all conrmed the events

He recited the entire Nirvana Sutra always putting on a clean robe and bathing rst
Compassionate toward all helping everyone his faith was deepseated
He died in the fth month
Even though it was extremely hot the corpse did not rot or smell
After more than one hundred days the body was sitting upright exactly as it was at the beginning
Everyone marveled at this and gave praise Ji shenzhou sanbao gantong lu Tc Datang neidian lu Tc ref
Xu gaoseng zhuan Tc The monastery afliation of Shi Daosu is unknown
He wandered around the mountains and elds of Liquan recitation of the Lotus Sutra was his practice
He had recited it thousands of times
In the year of Zhenguan  CE  he became ill and died
He had told his friend Meditation Master Huikuo I have constantly been reciting the sutra and I would like to see the miraculous efcacy of this practice
If someone lives a life of goodness the tongue does not rot Bury and exhume it after ten years
If the tongue has rotted away we will know that my recitation did not accomplish anything
If the tongue has kept its original condition build a stupa and worship it Having said this he died
In the eleventh year  the tomb was opened
The esh of the body had all rotted away but the tongue was not affected
Everyone in the district marveled
The tongue was placed inside a box and a stupa for it was built above the Gangu cliff
Shi village was situated south of Fushui in the Southern Suburb
Shi Heshi recited the Lotus Sutra
His personal name was Chong
As a clerk he traveled on foot and never rode on a horse
This was because the sutra spoke of having compassion for all sentient beings
He became ill and died in his native village
Fragrance lled the entire village and everyone was puzzled
No one could understand the reason
Ten years after his death his wife also died and the grave was opened for a joint burial
His tongue was seen to be in its original condition
The burial was properly carried out and many commemorative stones were set up
In Zhenguan  Gu Yuangui Magistrate of the Baxi district of Longzhou a pious Buddhist wished to copy the Lotus Diamond Perfection of Wisdom and Nirvana sutras
Because he could not investigate himself he requested the meditation master elsewhere to do so
Shangkang then went to a monastery and having undergone proper purication copied the sutras wrapped them and returned to his hermitage in Qizhou
The sutras were kept there in the same location as the copy of the vethousandcharacter book of Laozi
Unexpectedly embers from a re outside the hermitage drifted onto the thatchroofed building and burned it down completely
At that time Gu Yuangui was magistrate of the Pingyi district
Family members searched for and found a metal tube container in the ashes
When they cleared off the ashes and opened the container the sutras exactly as they were originally
The color of the paper had not changed
Only the box and cloth in which they had been placed had burned to ashes
They also looked for the book of Laozi but it had been destroyed in the re
People from villages near and far who heard of this all marveled 
The title of the Diamond Perfection of Wisdom Sutra in one roll had been charred black
asked what had caused this
the calligraphy of the title had been written by a district ofcial who did not observe a vegetarian diet and in his haste he had not observed the rules of purity
He wrote the title while standing and then departed
For this reason the color of the title inscribed by him burned
That person is still alive and the auspicious sutra is preserved
The administrative head of Ximing Monastery in the capital city the monk Shenji witnessed this himself and testied to its existence
Meditation Master Shi Tanyun was from Dingzhou and traveled to Xizhou he died at the age of seventy
During the disturbances toward the end of the Sui dynasty he hid on Mount Qian north of Lishi
His regular practice was recitation of the Lotus Sutra
He had wanted to produce a copy of the sutra but could not nd a likeminded companion and he let many years pass
Unexpectedly and for no reason a student arrived saying that he could help Tanyun carry out his wish of copying the sutra after performing the purication rites
The next morning after the meal they bathed put on fresh clothes and received the eight precepts
They then entered the chamber placed sandalwood incense in their mouths burned incense set up banners and carried out the scripture copying in silence
They came out of the chamber in the evening and returned the next morning
Never tiring they completed copying the sutra
After the gift was presented according to the proper rules the monk accompanied the scribe to the gate and the student quickly disappeared
then arranged the copy  and piously kept and recited from it The sutra was wrapped seven times
He would wash his hands in fragrant water when opening each layer of the cover
He did not neglect at rst but later during a barbarian disturbance he put the sutra in a box and placed it high up on a cliff
Years later when the disturbance calmed down he went looking for the sutra
He looked everywhere and eventually found the box under the cliff
The box and coverings had rotted away but he saw that the sutra itself was as fresh as it was originally
Vinaya Master Daoxuan of Ximingsi in the capital city visited the region in Zhenguan  and saw the sutra with his own eyes  Wangli village was situated forty li west of the Xinfan district northwest of Yizhou
A student surname Xun taught there
He was skilled in calligraphy but he was a secretive person
People wanted his calligraphy but he wouldnt agree to produce any
They pursued him but he still wouldnt produce calligraphy for them He then took a pen and at a place east of the village he inscribed the Diamond Perfection of Wisdom Sutra in the sky in all four directions
After several days he said he had nished
He also said that the sutra was intended for the gods to read
People at rst did not realize its supernatural character
Later there was a sudden downpour of rain and lightning
A boy cowherd was staying at the place where the sutra was written and did not get drenched by the rain and the ground remained dry for an area of more than one zhang  The water owed around that area
When the weather cleared the villagers marveled at this
Since then every time it rained the boy returned to the place and his clothes never became wet
In the year of Wude an unusual monk came and told the villagers In this place the Diamond Perfection of Wisdom Sutra is written in the sky
Villagers should not dele it
Gods placed an umbrella over it
Do not debase the place For this reason a railing was set up around the place and people and animals were not allowed in
Even now when it rains the place remains dry
During festivals villagers from distant places in all directions come and set up offerings
Heavenly music is constantly heard lling the place with the beautiful sounds of voices and bells
The wife of Duke Dachen of the Dou family herself from the Doulu clan was an elder sister of Guan Duke Rui
The lady was a believer and frequently recited the Diamond Perfection of Wisdom Sutra
she did not nish the roll one sheet remained and it would take a while to recite so she stopped The next day toward evening her head ached and she did not feel well all through her body
That night she went to bed but her illness worsened
The lady thought she was about to die Thinking that she would not be able to nish the sutra she was about to get up and recite but the light in the hall had gone out
She ordered the maidservant to light the lamp
Soon the maid returned there was no live re in the kitchen opened the gate and to get embers from the main home
She was in distress
Suddenly she saw in the kitchen a lit candle which then came up the stairs into the hall and then straight to her bedside standing about three chi from the ground even though no one was holding it
The light was as bright as daylight
The lady was delighted her headache had also gone
She took up the sutra and began reciting it
After a while the servants started a new re and brought a lamp into the hall
The light of the candle then disappeared
The lady was able to nish reciting that night
From that time on she made it a regular daily practice to recite the sutra ve times
Later when Duke Rui was about to die the lady went to see him
The duke told his sister Because of the merit of reciting sutras you will live one hundred years and be reborn in the Pure Land The lady died in her residence at the age of eighty
Mingbao ji Tbc Ji shenzhou sanbao gantong lu Tb During the Wude period Commissioner of Waterways Su Chang served as the Prefect of Bazhou
Chang took his family with him when he traveled to the place of his appointment
As the boat was crossing the Jialing River a storm arose and the boat sank midstream
More than sixty men and women drowned
One maidservant who regularly read the Lotus Sutra held the box containing the sutra on her head as the water came in vowing to die with the sutra
She did not drown but oated over the waves
Shortly thereafter she reached the shore
When she took the sutra out of the box it was dry and unsoiled
This sutra text still exists in Yangzhou
The maid married and became even more pious
In Daye  of the Sui dynasty Liu Jian Adjutant of Xingzhou was appointed Supervisor of Qiyang Palace
In Yining  he was captured by Li Mi and imprisoned in Dalisi prison
Jian recited the Diamond Perfection of Wisdom Sutra
He had two more sheets to recite but he fell asleep
In a dream he saw a brahman monk who said If you nish reciting the sutra you will be released Jian quickly woke up and continued the recitation tirelessly
Two days passed
At noon he was unexpectedly called to court and was released
He was taken to a government ofce and freed according to an imperial order
On a different occasion Jian was reciting a sutra outside of a house on a quiet evening
Toward the third watch he unexpectedly sensed an extraordinary fragrance
He noted the fragrance and asked the people in the house about it
He looked for the incense but could not nd it
He recited the sutra ceaselessly day and night and completed more than ve thousand rounds of recitation by the time he died
In Zhenguan  Zhao Wenxin of Suizhou unexpectedly died but then returned to life three days later
He recounted the following story
On the day he died he had been forcibly escorted
There were ten companions and they all went together to the place of King Yama
There was a monk among them and King rst called him
The king asked Master since you were born what meritorious deeds have you performed The master answered Since birth I have recited only the Diamond Perfection of Wisdom As soon as the king heard these words he was taken aback and stood up and with palms joined he praised the monk How marvelous
The master is procient in reciting the Perfection of Wisdom
You should have risen up to heaven and left this world
Why have you come here Before the king nished speaking a god clothed in a heavenly robe suddenly descended and took the master up to heaven
The king then called forward the man from Suizhou
Since you were born what meritorious deeds have you performed Zhao Wenxin replied to the king Since I was born I have not cultivated Buddhist sutras
loved Yu Xins writings and collected records The king said Yu Xin is a great sinner and is now undergoing great suffering here
Are you personally acquainted with Yu Xin The man replied Although I have read his writings I am not personally acquainted with him The king then sent someone to bring Yu Xin before the man
then saw a multipleheaded turtle
Shortly after the turtle left a man appeared
He said I am Yu Xin
When I lived I loved writing
I cited Buddhist sutras fallaciously and mixed citations with material from worldly books I reviled the Buddhas Dharma saying that it is inferior to the teachings of Confucius and Laozi
I am now receiving the punishment of suffering in the body of a turtle After coming back to life Zhao Wenxin told the story directly to me 
Many people in Suizhou loved hunting and shing but all those from near or far who heard this story made a vow to give up killing
They became pious and practiced the Perfection of Wisdom teaching
This situation continues until the present time
In Zhenguan  Liu Bi Aide in the Yilong district of Pengzhou while in an earlier appointment as Commandant of the Jiangnan district suddenly heard a bird singing in a tree in front of his residence
Locals said this was the inauspicious sound of an evil bird and that after encountering the bird the head of the family will without doubt be killed
Hearing this Liu Bi was frightened
He thought of cultivating merit in order to remove the curse but he did not know what meritorious act would sufce
At night he dreamed that a monk praised the Diamond Perfection of Wisdom Sutra and ordered him to recite it one hundred times He obeyed and recited it
When he nished reciting the sutra one hundred times a sudden gust of wind from the northeast uprooted the tree on which the bird perched and blew it far away from the residence
A one zhang and ve chisquare hole was left where the tree had stood
After the wind passed it was seen that in the place from where the wind came small branches and long grasses twisted around following the wind
When the wind stopped it was as if nothing had happened
The power the Diamond Perfection of Wisdom Sutra is beyond our understanding
Gu Daoxian of Luoyang was broadly learned and he was particularly fond of Buddhist scriptures
In Zhenguan  he served as Revenue Management Administrator of Qingzhou
The ofcial residence was small and lacked space for keeping sutras
So he attached ropes to the two legs of a desk and suspended it upside down from the ceiling
He placed sixty rolls of sutras on it
He would sit or lie under it and read tirelessly
After a long time the ropes rotted and one broke yet the desk did not fall nor even tilt to one side
It stayed like this for a long time before people took it down
The son of Dao xian became Revenue Manager of Xizhou and is said to have reported this
Lu Huaisus family lived in the Wu Commandery
In Zhenguan  a re destroyed all the buildings including the hut 
Only the Diamond Perfection of Wisdom Sutra kept in a box was preserved
The box the cover and the shaft of the roll were all burned but the  the sutra did not
People were amazed
Huaisu was the brother of the previous wife of Xu Renze of Gaoyang
Renze saw this at that time and later spoke of it
Qiaoqing Former Rectier of Judicial Review and Adjutant of Henei was pious by nature and inclined to religious practice
During the Yonghui period he served in the Revenue Section of the Yangzhou regional government
His mother died and he was deep in intense mourning
He drew blood from his heart with which he copied the Diamond Perfection of Wisdom Sutra in one roll
Shortly thereafter two stalks of grass appeared above the temporary hut at the grave
In nine days they grew to the height of nine cun
The stalks were green and covered in red at the top and the plants produced one sheng of juice each day
Bystanders tasted it it was sweet like honey
When the stalks were removed they grew back again
This was repeated four times
Qiaoqing had several colleagues and they all told Yu Ling
Many people came to know about this
During the Xianqing period a man in Pingzhou surname Sun and personal name Shou was hunting on a beach
He saw a ercely burning wildre that had destroyed all the trees and plants but one bush was untouched by the re
Suspecting that an animal might be hiding inside the bush he to set re to it but the re would not catch
Shou was mystied and looked inside the bush
He saw a golden box containing the Diamond Perfection of Wisdom Sutra and next to it was a deceased monk
The monks face had not changed the re had not burned his body
Because of this Sun Shou came to believe that sutras and images are beyond human comprehension
Sun Shou himself related this story
Li Qianguan presently lives in Zhengzhou
In Xianqing  his father died
He drew his own blood with which to copy the Diamond Perfection of Wisdom Sutra and the Heart Sutra each in one roll and the Suiyuan wangsheng jing in one roll
After going out he would bathe before entering 
Later an extraordinary fragrance appeared in the courtyard The fragrance was very strong
The neighbors all perceived and marveled at it
Yu Ling Court Gentleman of Zhongshan once passed through Zhengzhou and saw his close friend who told him this story in detail
There was a temple in a village twenty li west of the Jiyin district in Caozhou
In Longshuo   the tenth month in winter a eld re broke out it was very powerful and threatened to reach the temple and go further
The grassthatched monastic residence of the temple burned down completely but the Diamond Perfection of Wisdom Sutra in one roll  remained unchanged
Xi Wenli Administrator of Caozhou related this story
Paying Respect to the Sangha Introduction Scriptural Support Benets of Paying Respect and Damages for Disparaging 
Now I will discuss the Sangha Jewel 
observe the precepts and adopt an otherworldly appearance and demeanor they aim at beyond this world and decide to seek them they reject worldly and follow the Dharma they remain unaffected by ofcial honors their families cannot fathom their thoughts they spread the Way and repay their four kinds of debts  they nourish virtue to enrich the three modes of existence realms of desire form and formlessness they aim higher than rebirth as human beings or gods and they value things greater than gold and jade
Such people are called monks
Thus we know that the benet of the Sangha Jewel is beyond recording
Therefore a scripture says that whether monastics observe the precepts or violate them and whether they rank as senior or junior we must all pay deep respect to them and not despise them
If we do not follow this teaching we take on a grave sin If we wait until another Taigongwang L
Shang the great sagely minster who assisted King Wen of Zhou in ancient times appears before appointing a minister then there will be no minister for a thousand years
If you need Kumārajīva as your teacher there wont be Kumārajīva in ten thousand generations
Why should the failure of one monk affect our treatment of the Buddhist school
Nor should the failure of one person in observing the precepts cause us to make light of a superior teaching
We should not destroy people because of the Way  is the teacher of the people 
ākyamuni and other buddhas constitute the true Buddha Jewel the teaching spoken by the Buddhas golden mouth constitutes the true Dharma Jewel worldrenunciants who have attained the spiritual fruit constitute the true Sangha Jewel
If we see a worldrenunciant and pay respect even once ten thousand bondage melt away forever like ice
If we offer praise even once a thousand calamities disappear like mist
If for lack of good fortune we fail to encounter the right Dharma we rely on the traces left of it and take shade beneath it
With gold sandalwood silk lacquer and linen colored red and green we make images of the Holy One and call them the Buddha Jewel
Writing down the profound speech  on paper silk cloth and bamboo we call it the Dharma Jewel
Those who shave their hair dye their robes and carry an almsbowl we call the Sangha Jewel
These three though temporary in their embodiment give expression to the true appearance 
If we respect them we put an end forever to the long ow 
If we dishonor them we invite the retribution of suffering
Even if a piece of wood is not ones own mother paying respect to it brings responses that last more than a thousand years
Even if ordinary are not holy monks paying respect to them brings luminous effects that go beyond ten thousand generations
Thus we learn that once this wind is fanned both the near and the far bend to it honoring it accordingly
mysteriously benet sentient beings It is difcult to fathom  spiritual efcacy
Falling short in places we commit great sins
Having renounced the householders life reform worldly practices in accordance with the true principle
the Song dynasty lacked knowledge and rst believed in evil and deluded teachings and they disturbed the order of things The people both monastic and lay were alarmed
Later they came to understand  animal sacrice and turned to the practice of paying respect
Consequently the house of Song was able to rule over the southern barbarians the small groups that live in a narrow area and the mountainous land of Yangzi and the Han River region
How much more powerful the effect of proper rites would be in a large kingdom under the rule of a Buddhist golden wheelturning monarch  The Record of Rites on the other hand says Soldiers wearing armor do not paying respect 
This should not be taken simply as the failure to observe the rites
monastics who have renounced the world wear the armor of the Buddhist virtue of forbearance
They may seem to violate laypeoples moral principles but monastics stand far above these principles
The Three Jewels are identical  We should pay respect to or worship them equally
It is wrong to onesidedly honor the Buddha and Dharma and reject monks and nuns 
The Dharma does not spread itself its dissemination depends on human beings
Because it is human beings who spread the Way we should respect them 
The Fanwang jing says
The Dharma of renunciants is that they should not pay respect to a king their parents and the six categories of relatives
They also should not pay respect to ghosts
The Nirvana Sutra says Those who have renounced the householders life should not pay respect to their family members
The Fourpart Vinaya says The Buddha ordered the monks to honor each other according to seniority
They should not pay honor to any layperson The Fo benxing jing says
King uddhodana and his retinue of one hundred ofcials paid honor to the Buddha one by one
The Buddha said You should now pay honor to the monk Upāli and the other monks When the king heard the Buddhas instruction he rose and bowing his head to the ground paid respect to the ve hundred monks who had renounced the householders life
He paid respect to each monk one by one
The Sazhe niqian jing says
If one reviles the teaching for śrāvakas or pratyekabuddhas or the Mahayana teaching and places obstructions in the way of their practice one commits a root offense
If monks and nuns follow the Small and Great Vehicle sutras and do not pay respect to rulers and parents this would constitute honoring the Buddhas teaching If they disobey the Buddhas teaching and make kneel and pay respect to laypeople  this mean not believing the Buddhas words Therefore this constitutes a root offense The Shunzhenglilun says
Heavenly gods do not dare receive worship from those who have received the ve precepts just as the rulers of kingdoms do not seek worship from monks
This is for fear that will cause a loss of the merits and shorten lives
The Nirvana Sutra says
The Buddha said to Kāśyapa If someone is to advocate and protect the right Dharma such a person must from express  sacrice himself as an offering
As I taught in a Mahayana sutra If someone knows the Dharma whether old or young we must make offerings to them and reverently worship them in the way the brahmans serve re
If someone knows the Dharma whether old or young we must make offerings to them and reverently worship them in the way the heavenly gods serve akra Kāśyapa said to the Buddha If a senior who has observed precepts for a long time receives from a junior something of  that he has not heard  should pay respect to the junior monk
If pays respect  then we could not call that observing the precepts
If a junior monk who observes the precepts hears from someone who has violated precepts in the past something of the Dharma that he has not heard  should the junior monk pay respect to that person
If a renunciant received from a layperson an instruction on something he has not heard  should the monk pay respect to that layman To the contrary
according to the Vinaya a renunciant should not pay respect to a layperson
In the Buddha Dharma a junior monk should pay respect to an elder monk
Because the elder monk had previously received the complete set of the precepts and mastered the proper manner of conduct the junior monk should pay respect and present offerings to the elder monk The Zhong ahan jing says
What is superior  Monks know that there are two kinds of people those who have faith and those who dont
Those who have faith are superior those who dont are inferior
Among those who have faith there are two kinds those who often go to see monks and those who dont
Those who often go to see monks are superior those who dont are inferior
Among those who often go to see monks there are two kinds those who pay respect to monks and those who dont
Those who pay respect to monks are superior those who dont are inferior
Among those who pay respect to monks there are two kinds those who ask about sutras and those who dont ask about sutras
Those who ask about sutras are superior those who dont are inferior
The Jiu zapiyu jing says
Once there was a king who went hunting
Every time he saw a monk he dismounted from the carriage and paid respect to him The monk would say Great king stop
You do not have to come down from the carriage The king would say I go up and do not come down
The reason I say I go up is that if I pay respect to a monk now after death I will go up to heaven
That is why I say I go up but do not come down The Shanjianl
King uddhodana paid respect to the Buddha and said Three times I paid respect by bowing to the Tathāgatas feet
First when the Buddha was born Asita predicted that if the child remained a householder he would become a wheelturning monarch  but if he left the householders life he would surely become a buddha
At that time the ground quaked
I recognized the supernatural powers  and immediately paid respect to him
Second I went out for an excursion in the middle of a cultivated eld and saw the Bodhisattva sitting under a jambū tree
In the afternoon when the sun had moved the trees shadow did not move and still shaded the Bodhisattvas body
I recognized his supernatural powers and immediately paid respect to him
Third I just now welcomed the Buddha to my kingdom
The Buddha ascended into the sky and performed eighteen miraculous demonstrations conquering nonBuddhist teachers
I recognized his supernatural powers and immediately paid respect to him The Zhong ahan jing Za ahan jing Tab c  At that time the Buddha said to monks At one time in the past the god akra wanted to go to the garden and ordered the charioteer to ready a chariot a thousand horses
The charioteer prepared the carriage and addressed akra Kauśika the carriage is ready Having been informed akra then came down from Vaijayanta Hall  and facing east with palms joined paid respect to the Buddha
When the charioteer saw this he was frightened his hair stood on end and he dropped his driving whip to the ground
The god akra saw this and said in verse
Which ghost frightened you the horsewhip onto the ground The charioteer answered akra in verse I see the king of gods akra The husband of the Sujā I was frightened and Dropped my horsewhip to the ground 
All beings of the earth Greater and smaller kings human and divine And the Four Guardian Rulers The gods of the Thirtythree Heavens They all pay respect to akra Where is there anyone who is worthy of greater respect now turns facing east With palms joined paying respect Then akra answered in verse
I am indeed the most honorable among all kings Of the world greater and smaller The Four Guardian Rulers and The gods of the Thirtythree Heavens Therefore they all come to pay respect  Yet there is also in this world the perfect supreme enlightenment  He is called the perfect great teacher Therefore I pay respect  The charioteer responded again
This must be the most superior in the world Therefore Heavenly King akra Pays respect with palms joined I should now pay respect To the being to whom the heavenly king pays respect The Buddha told the monks The heavenly deity akra is a supernatural king yet he still pays respect to the Buddha and Dharma
Monks who have renounced the householders life and study the Way should also pay respect to the Buddha in the same manner
akra who is the husband of Sujā pays respect to the Dharma and Sangha and also praises the Dharma and Sangha
You who have correct faith having renounced the householders life and studied the Way should also praise the Dharma and Sangha Then akra came down from Vaijayanta Hall and with palms joined paid respect in all directions
At that time the charioteer saw akra come down from Vaijayanta Hall and in the middle of the courtyard  with palms joined pay respect in all directions
Seeing this he was frightened and dropped the horsewhip to the ground
Then he said in verse
Why Kauśika do you value the one who has renounced the householders life Please explain this to me who hungers and thirsts to hear  Then the heavenly deity akra answered in verse I pay respect to those who have renounced the householders life  They travel freely everywhere without calculating where to go and where to stop
In cities villages and lands nothing troubles their mind They do not accumulate material goods And only practice meditation free of desire Wherever they go they do not seek anything For them only nonaction is pleasure When they speak they speak of meditation as good When they refrain from speaking they remain in quiet meditation People have conicts among themselves each differing from others Only those who have renounced the householders life Are free from conict even in the midst of conict Among all sentient beings they give up swords and sticks In the midst of material goods they transcend them They do not become intoxicated nor belligerent They keep away from all evils For this reason I pay respect to them Then the charioteer again said in verse
Those to whom Heavenly King pays respect Must be superior in the world Therefore from today onward We should pay respect to them The Pudawang jing says
The king of the Bhoga kingdom called Samantadatta ruled over many kingdoms and received tributes from everywhere
The king himself honored the Buddhas Dharma and never deviated from it
Always compassionate he took pity on ignorant subjects who did not know of the Three Jewels
Every time a vegetarian feast was held he ascended up a tall building burned incense and lowered his head to the ground to worship 
Ministers and subjects of the kingdom wondered about the kings behavior They argued among themselves saying The king is the most honorable among the ten thousand subjects
People both far and near pay respect to him prostrating themselves When the king speaks people obey
What emotions and desires have caused him to debase and humiliate himself departing from dignied conduct and bowing his head to the ground Ministers often discussed like this among themselves but no one dared to remonstrate the king directly
The king ordered the carriage prepared for departure and then left the palace accompanied by thousands of ministers and subjects Before long they unexpectedly encountered a monk
The king descended from his carriage rejected the cover of decorative umbrellas and joined the crowd that was following him He then lowered his head to the ground and worshiped the monk The king did not complete his journey but quickly returned to prepare a meal 
Thereupon his ministers reprimanded him Great king worthy of the greatest honor why on encountering a monk on almsround should you lower your head to the ground
Everyone in the world treats his or her head as the most valuable 
In addition you are a king not like ordinary people The king then ordered his ministers to look for a human head as well as the heads of a cow horse pig and sheep
The ministers looked everywhere and after several days found all the heads
They reported to the king saying that the heads of a corpse and the six animal heads they had been ordered to look for had been obtained
The king said Go to the market and sell them The ministers then sent someone to sell them
The heads of the cow horse pig and sheep were all sold but no one would buy the human head
The king said Lower the price and try to sell it
If it still doesnt sell give it away to a beggar Even following these instructions the human head had not been sold after several days
Beggars also refused to take it
The corpse head became bloated and smelled so badly that people would not come close to it
The king angrily remonstrated the ministers Earlier you criticized me saying that a human head is the most valuable that I should not humiliate myself by bowing my head to the ground
Now all six animal heads have been sold yet a beggar would not take the human head The king then ordered his ministers to prepare a carriage to go outside the city to the marsh eld
The ministers who received the order were all frightened
The king said to his ministers Do you remember the young boy who during the time of the previous king always held an umbrella for him
The ministers answered Yes such a person indeed existed The king said Where is that young boy They answered He died seventeen years ago The king said What was the moral conduct of this boy like They answered
We saw him serve the previous king
He observed the rules of purity reverently and maintained his faith
He did not say anything against the Dharma The king told his ministers If you saw the clothes that the boy wore while he was alive would you recognize them The ministers said Though it has been a long time we would recognize them The king ordered his attendant to go to the inner storehouse and bring the clothes of the deceased boy which soon arrived
Are these the clothes Yes these are indeed the clothes The king said If you saw the boys body now would you recognize it The ministers all fell silent and did not reply
After a while they said Our sight is inferior and we wouldnt be able to recognize it The king was about to begin telling the story of his earlier birth when the monk whom they saw earlier appeared
The king was delighted and bowed his head to the ground to worship the monk
All the ministers were delighted
The monk then took a seat
The king held his palms together and explained what had happened
He then said Now you have come to tell us a story of karmic rebirths
Would you please tell the story to the ministers and subjects of his kingdom in order to enlighten these ignorant people The monk then told the ministers the story of the previous life of King 
If you wish to know who the king is in an earlier life he was the young boy who held the umbrella and followed the previous king everywhere the king went
He never violated the precepts even for one day
Later he left the world and his spirit was reborn as the son of the king
It is because of his conduct in the previous life that he is now greatly honored The ministers both higher ranking and minor without exception said We are fortunate to have met this monk
Please take pity on us and accept us as your disciples The monk said My teacher is the Buddha endowed with all the primary and secondary physical marks 
He walks alone in the three realms and what he teaches is not in vain
The Buddha is now six thousand miles away Quickly while he was speaking the monk ew to the kingdom of rāvastī and addressed the Buddha The people of this kingdom are pitiable
They now all wish to see the Buddha
Will you show great compassion and teach the true Way to them The Buddha agreed
The next day the Buddha came to the kingdom of Bogha and taught the king and his subjects
The Buddha asked them Do you wish to hear how the story of King Samantadatta and this monk began nanda answered  They do In the past at the time of Mohewen Buddha there lived the son of a great family
His father worshiped the Three Jewels
The father ordered his son to offer incense 
The fathers attendant at that time was contemptuous and did not give the incense 
Due to the karmic consequences died young and was driven around for a period of time yet he continued to honor the Dharma and kept himself free of delusion and he has now become the present king
This monk was the who did not get the incense from the attendant at that time
Though he did not receive the incense he did not resent that and made a vow that if he attained the Way he would bring salvation to this man 
This auspicious vow is fullled and he came to save the king and his subjects When the king heard this story he understood its meaning  and he attained the spiritual status of streamwinner
People in the kingdom heard this sutra received the ve precepts and practiced the ten good deeds regularly The Ayuwang jing says
Once in the past King Aśoka met a seventeenyearold novice The king went into a screened area and paid respect to the novice
The king said to him Do not tell others that I paid respect to you At that time there was a water bottle in that place
The novice went into the bottle and then came out again saying The king should not tell others that I went inside the bottle and then came out The king said I must tell others 
I should not hide it For this reason sutras all say Novices even young are not to be made light of
Sons of kings even young sons of dragons even young are not to be made light of
Novices even young can save people
Sons of kings even young can kill people
Sons of dragons even young can raise clouds
From rising clouds come rain thunder and lightning
These respond even to those who are young who are not to be made light of The Fufazang yinyuan jing Tc c c In the past one hundred years after the Buddhas parinirvāṇa King Aśoka who had faith in the Three Jewels held a veyear feast 
On the day of the feast the king bathed in fragrant water put on fresh clothes ascended a tall tower paid respect in the four directions and extended invitations to the community of monks
Holy monks over twenty myriads altogether came ying there
The kings faith was profound beyond ordinary measure
Seeing the monks some young some old some of ordinary rank and others of advanced saintly rank the king welcomed them all paying respect and worshiping them
At that time there was a minister called Yaśas who forcefully advocated nonBuddhist views and lacked faith and a respectful attitude
Seeing the king pay respect  he said The king is extremely ignorant
He compromises his own nobility and virtues by paying respect to young children When the king heard this he gave an order to his ministers
each of them was to look for an animal that had died of natural causes and bring its head to the king
the king instructed Yaśas alone to look for a human head
When they had secured the heads the king instructed each minister to go to the market and sell the head he had obtained
heads were all sold but when people saw the head Yaśsa brought they hated it and no one would buy it
After several days the head began to smell
People saw it and recoiled saying If you are not a caṇḍāla you a yakṣa or rākṣasa
Why have you taken a dead mans head and are trying to sell it After he was so reviled Yaśas came to the king and said I am offering a human head for sale but revile me
No one wants to even see it why would anyone buy it The king replied If no one buys it then give it away free Yaśas followed the instruction and again brought the head to the market saying If you dont have the money to buy this head I will give it to you for free When the people in the market heard this they abused him even more and no one would agree to take it
Yaśas ashamed returned to the king
With palms joined he said to the king This head is difcult to sell Even when I offer it for free people wont take it instead they abuse me
No one will buy it The king asked Yaśas What is most valuable Yaśas answered Human beings are the most valuable The king said If they are so valuable why does this not sell Yaśas answered Even though a human being is valuable alive his remains when dead are vile The king asked Yaśas If I were dead would my head be base just like this one Yaśas was frightened and dared not to reply
The king said Dont be afraid
Give the true answer Frightened Yaśas looked up at the king and answered If dead the kings head would be as base as this one The king said to Yaśas If my head when dead like this one why did you nd it strange when I paid respect to the monks 
If you were a true friend you might have advised me to exchange the fragile head with the solid head 
Why do you today stop worshiping  When he heard the kings words Yaśas repented
He reformed by turning away from evil nonBuddhist teachings to the true Buddhist teaching and he took refuge in the Three Jewels
For this reason sentient beings who hear this story should reverently pay respect to and worship the Three Jewels when they see them
The Fourpart Vinaya says
The arhat Piṇḍola was originally a minister of King Udayana
In view of his diligent practice and austerities the king allowed him to renounce the householders life and Piṇḍola attained arhatship
Later the king frequently traveled from the city to worship him
His monastery was twenty miles outside of the city
A misguided minister seeing that Piṇḍola did not rise  maliciously reprimanded the king
The king later heeded the ministers reprimand and was about to murder Piṇḍola
When Piṇḍola saw the king come through the gate  he came down from his seat and walked seven steps to greet him
The king angrily said In the past you Great Virtue would not move
Now you leave your seat to welcome me
Why Piṇḍola answered Earlier you came with good intentions so I did not rise to greet you
Now you have evil intentions
If I did not rise to welcome you I would have been killed The king was moved and said Good
I a disciple stupidly and wrongly accepted malicious words
I failed to distinguish the saintly from the ordinary The king asked for the permission to repent his wrongdoing
Even though the king avoided going to hell Piṇḍola predicted that he would certainly lose the throne within seven days and this prediction proved correct
A neighboring state attacked and the king was captured
He spent twelve years chained in prison
Comment
For these reasons it is particularly important that we pay respect 
We should not be arrogant which will bring about negative consequences
Worldly people when given modest appointments often lack faith and arrogantly abuse monks and nuns and humiliate them
Sometimes they stand in court placing themselves on high seats and sending ofcials to drag monks and nuns  and then they impose unreasonable and shameful punishments 
Nowhere else is goodness defeated and evil increases 
Even if we were to violate the kings law we must still follow the true principle
Even if we follow the law externally we would have something of which to be ashamed internally
Either monastic or lay we live within the three realms 
Not having reached the saintly ranks who is free of faults
Those who have renounced the householders life may internally lack real practice yet they shave their beards and hair and put on the monastic robes
This appearance produces goodness and those who see it reverently show respect
Even monks and nuns who have violated precepts may still sit on seat and teach in a variety of ways to benet sentient beings
People who hear cultivate the six perfections and further teach others
If they cultivate good deeds in the future they will be reborn as humans or gods at least and they may even achieve the holy ranks 
If they achieve holiness they will further continue to benet endlessly
This is just as one lamp may be transferred to a hundred thousand other lamps and increase endlessly
To estimate this inexhaustible  it is all due to the teaching mentioned above of a monk or nun who has violated the precepts That resulted in this great benet
Since there is such benet everyone should be careful
Even if we manage to deceive a hundred thousand myriads of people who have renounced the householders life  that would achieve not even a hairs weight of benets
We would only spread the bad reputation across the four oceans
In future rebirths we will repeatedly be punished
A scripture says The evil of one moment of thought can open the gate of ve evil acts This will be discussed further below
The Zabaozang jing says
The king of Yuezhi named Kaniṣka heard that an honorable arhat in Kaśmīra called Qiyeduo was famous and wanted to meet him
With his ministers he went to that kingdom and on his way there he thought to himself I am now the king and rule over all people
None of them fail to pay respect to me Only the virtuous deserve my worship He proceeded thinking in this way
The people of that country said to the honorable one The king of Yuezhi and his ministers are coming from a great distance to see you
Please straighten your clothing and welcome them
The honorable one said I heard the Buddha say that for people who have renounced the householders life the Way is to be honored rather than mere worldly appearance
Virtue is their only concern
Why should I come out to meet with proper clothing He sat quietly and did not go out
The king of Yuezhi came to the residence and saw the honorable Qiyeduo
On seeing the monks powerful presence the king doubled his respect and after greeting the monk by bowing his head he sat to one side
The honorable one needed to spit and the king without thinking came forward and placed the spittoon before him
Then the honorable one said to the king At the present time I am not worthy of becoming a eld of merit for the king
Why did you go to the trouble of traveling here in person The king was greatly ashamed he had thought before and the monk knew his thoughts
How could the monk do this if he did not possess supernatural powers
The monk preached to the king briey saying The road was good when the king came
It will be the same on his way back as when he came Hearing this the king started his return journey to his country
In the middle of the journey the ministers complained We traveled such a long distance to that country and it seems that we are returning without having received any teaching The king answered The honorable one preached to me The road was good when the king came
It will be the same on his way back as when he came Did you not understand this
Because in the past I planted the seeds of kingship by upholding precepts giving and cultivating various meritorious deeds I now enjoy this throne
If I again accumulate good deeds I will again receive good fortune in a future world
Therefore instructed me by saying The road was good when the king came
It will be the same on his way back as when he came When the ministers heard this they bowed their heads to the ground and apologized We are lowly and ignorant and misunderstood the situation on our own
The great king possesses supernatural powers and deciphered the mysterious meaning 
enjoys his throne because of the virtuous seeds he planted After speaking the ministers were delighted and withdrew
The Shisong l Tbc says
At that time the Worldhonored One told the monks the story of one of his previous lives
Once in a past world near the foot of the Himalayas three a bird and animals lived together
a parrot a monkey and an elephant
At rst these three animals despised each other showing no respect they all thought Why do we not show respect to each other
We should make offerings and honor the one born rst teach us The parrot and the monkey asked the elephant What do you remember of the past Nearby was a large biba tree
The elephant said When I was small this tree t under my belly and I could pass over it The elephant and the parrot asked the monkey What do you remember The monkey answered When I was small I could sit on the ground and grab the top of this tree and pull it down to touch the ground The elephant said to the monkey You are older than I am
I should pay respect to you
Teach the Dharma to me The elephant and the monkey asked the parrot What do you remember The parrot answered There used to be a large biba tree 
I ate its fruit and excreted the seed here
The seed then became this tree growing tall like this
This is what I remember The monkey said to the parrot You are older than I am
I should make offerings to you
You should teach the Dharma to me Then the elephant paid respect to the monkey heard his instruction on the Dharma and taught other elephants
The monkey paid respect to the parrot heard his instruction on the Dharma and taught the Dharma to other monkeys The parrot taught other parrots the Dharma According to the Sifen l the bird rode on the monkey and the monkey on top of the elephant
They traveled everywhere and taught the Dharma These three a bird a monkey and an elephant at rst enjoyed killing stealing licentiousness and lying but they later stopped  and after their lives they were reborn in heaven
At that time people seeing animals performing good deeds and not attacking and killing human beings said to each other Even animals pay respect  how much more should we Then people paid respect to each other and upheld the ve precepts
After death they all were reborn in heaven
The Buddha said to the monks The parrot at that time was I myself the monkey was āriputra and the elephant was Maudgalyāyana The Buddha said Animals are stupid and yet they still can pay respect  beneting themselves and others
How much more so is this true for you who have faith and left the householders life
And yet now you fail to show respect to each other Then the Buddha spoke in verse
If people fail to show respect to the Buddha and the Buddhas disciples In this life they will be reviled and after death they will fall into evil realms of rebirth If people know enough to show respect to the Buddha and the Buddhas disciples In this life they will be praised by others and after death they will be reborn in heaven
After relating various stories praising the practice of paying respect the Buddha said to the monks From now on the monk who received the complete set of precepts rst even if only by a very short period of time will sit down and receive water and food rst before 
Respect The Baoxinglun Dasheng yizhang Tb ref Baoxinglun Tc says
There are six ways in which one should pay respect to the Three Jewels 
First the are rare
They can be compared to worldly jewels that poor people cannot obtain
The Three Jewels are like this
Sentient beings with little merit cannot encounter them even over a period of one hundred thousand myriad births
That is why are called jewels
Second they are free of delements
They can be compared to the fact that authentic worldly jewels are free of blemishes
The Three Jewels are like this
They are completely separated from delements
That is why are called jewels
Third they have power
They can be compared to worldly rare jewels that have the power of removing poverty and getting rid of poisons
The Three Jewels are like this
They are endowed with six supernatural powers that are beyond understanding
That is why they are treated as jewels
Fourth they are used for adornment
They can be compared with worldly rare jewels that can be worn around the neck to make one attractive
The Jewels are like this
They adorn the practitioners body by making it pure
That is why they are treated as jewels
Fifth they are most superior
They can be compared to worldly rare jewels they are most superior among all things
The Three Jewels are like this
They are the most superior among all things in all worlds
That is why they are treated as jewels
Sixth they do not change
They can be compared to worldly gold even if the metal is heated and pounded or polished it does not change 
The Three Jewels are like this
The eight categories of worldly matters  cannot change them
For this reason they are treated as jewels
One must pay respect to the Three Jewels for six reasons
First the Buddha teaches that the Dharma is good medicine Monks transmit and benet us
In order to repay this debt we pay respect 
Second during the evil period of the last age it is not easy to transmit  it needs protection
For this reason we pay respect 
Third in order to encourage people to have faith we pay respect to 
Fourth teaching the proper ritual procedure for paying respect to monks and nuns
Fifth in order to let people take delight in making offerings and cause the Dharma to remain forever we pay respect 
Sixth as a way of showing superior manners we pay respect
The Chengshi lun says The Three Jewels are most auspicious
Therefore I place them at the beginning of this sutra The Xiangfa jueyi jing says
And all laypeople noble or humble  hould not hit slaves and animals the Three Jewels nor accept the worship of Three Jewels slaves 
This would lead to disasters
The Sazhe niqian jing says
If one destroys stupas and monasteries or steals property that belongs to the Buddha or allows to commit these offenses and take delight in them or if one imprisons beats defrocks or kills monks wearing dyed robes regardless of whether they uphold the precepts or violate them if one commits these fundamental and grave sins he or she will certainly fall into hell and endure uninterrupted suffering
If a king carries out such evils inside his kingdom the immortals and saints will leave the kingdom and go away
Powerful deities will not protect that kingdom
Conicts among ministers will arise everywhere
There will be irregular oods and drought the winds and rains will come at wrong times
People will starve and bandits will roam everywhere
Those who die from epidemics will be innumerable
Yet will not know that have caused this and will blame the gods
The Renwang jing says
Claiming themselves to be noble kings and ministers will destroy my Dharma
They will set up laws to control my disciples not allowing them to leave the householders life and not allowing them to make buddha images
They will set up government ofces  making records of monks
Monks will be made to stand on the ground while laypeople sit on high chairs
Kings and princes make arbitrary rules and regulations failing to heed the causes and conditions the Buddhas teaching and the causes and conditions that disturb the harmony of the monastic order government ofcers control monks and ofcials keep records of monastic registration
The suffering is upheld and the Buddhas Dharma will not survive for long
The Daji jing says
The Buddha said All sentient beings in the present world or in future worlds should deeply believe in the Buddha Dharma and Sangha
These sentient beings will receive wondrous karmic fruits and soon enter the City of Fearlessness
Similarly if someone makes offerings to a person who left the householders life for my sake or if a person who following my  has shaved his beard and hair and put on a monks robe but does not accept the precepts and if one makes offerings to this person the donor acquires merit enters the City of Fearlessness
For this reason I now teach that if someone renounces the householders life shaves their beard and hair and puts on the monks robe they do not uphold the preceptsit is against the Dharma to trouble such a person
would amount to destroying the Dharma body and reward body of the buddhas of the three ages and will lead to lling the three inferior realms of rebirth 
The Buddha said the following If sentient beings renounce the householders life shave their beards and hair and put on a monks robe even if they do not uphold the precepts they are all stamped with the seal of nirvana
It is against the Dharma to trouble a renunciant who does not uphold the precepts to abuse hurt beat or cut them with ones sts swords or sticks or to take away their robe almsbowl or other means of sustenance
Anyone who does this destroys the true reward body of the buddhas of the three ages and gouges out the eyes of all gods and human beings
This is so because such a person would bury and cause to disappear the seeds of the Three Jewels of the true Dharma of the buddhas such a person would prevent the gods and human beings from obtaining benets and allow them to fall into hell they would cause the three realms of inferior rebirth to expand and be lled Then the lord of this sahā world Great Brahmā said to the Buddha Suppose there is someone who for the sake of the Buddha renounced the householders life shaved his beard and hair and put on a monks robe did not receive the precepts or violated them after receiving them
If a kṣatriya king were to trouble revile beat or bind that monk how much sin would that constitute The Buddha said Great Brahmā I will now explain this briey
Suppose someone in ten thousand myriads of buddha lands causes the buddhas bodies to bleed how would that be
Would that person acquire a great deal of sin Great Brahmā answered If someone causes even one buddhas body to bleed he or she acquires the sin of the the Hell of Uninterrupted Suffering
Their sin would be so great that it is beyond calculation
They will fall into Avīci Hell
How much greater the sins of someone who caused ten thousand myriads of buddhas bodies to bleed
No one but a tathāgata could fully enumerate that persons sins and punishments The Buddha said If someone were to trouble revile beat and bind a person who for my sake had shaved his beard and hair and put on a monks robe and who either did not receive the precepts or violated them after receiving them the resulting sin would be even greater
Because the person can still show the path to nirvana to gods and other human beings
He would have pay respect to the Three Jewels  superior to any of the ninetyve paths
Such a person can quickly enter nirvana
He is superior to all lay householders except for householders who have attained the stage of patience
Gods and human beings should make offering to such a person
It goes without saying that they should also do so for those who uphold the precepts in all their acts 
When kings and ministers who issue judgments at court see a person who following my Dharma has left the householders life and yet committed grave sins such as murder theft deling spiritual practice lying and other immoral deeds they should expel that person from the country
They should not allow him to stay in a monastery and work with other monks
But they should not whip them nor abuse or humiliate them verbally for their sins
If a king or a minister deviates from the Dharma and imposes such punishments that king or minister will be excluded from salvation will be reborn in inferior realms and will be kept at a distance from the good realms of gods and human beings
will necessarily go to Avīci Hell
It goes without saying that should not whip those who have left the householders life for the sake of the Buddha and who uphold the precepts
The Shilun jing says
The Buddha said Sons of noble families there are four kinds of monks
What are the four
First the monks of the primary truth second the monks of purity third the sheeplike dumb monks fourth unrepentant monks
Who are those called the monks of the primary truth
The buddhas bodhisattvas pratyekabuddhas and those who have attained the four fruits these seven kinds of people are called monks of the primary truth
Laypeople who attain holy fruits are also called monks of the primary truth
Who are the monks of purity
Those who uphold the complete set of precepts are called monks of purity
Who are the sheeplike dumb monks
Those who dont know the difference between violating or not violating the precepts between minor and grave offenses and how to repent offenses those who are ignorant and lack good spiritual friends and are unable to ask about the profound truth about what is good and what is not goodsuch are called sheeplike dumb monks
Who are the unrepentant monks
Those who come to join the Buddhas Dharma only to secure a means of livelihood and commit all kinds of violations destroy the harmony of the sangha do not fear future rebirths and indulge in the six kinds of emotions and are attached to the ve kinds of desires such people are called unrepentant monks
One should still pay respect to all four kinds of monks The Dabei jing says
The Buddha said to nanda In my Dharma there are those who by status are monks and yet dele monastic practice
They call themselves monks and they physically look like monks
In the world age of the wise  led by Maitreya and with Vairocana at the end
Once they put on the monastic robes those monks are like these one thousand buddhas
In the realm of nirvana without remainder these buddhas one by one those monks will be able to enter nirvana without remainder
Why is this
If those monks praise the name of the Buddha or give rise to faith even once the merit will never be in vain
nanda I have the Buddhas wisdom that knows the Dharma realm
There is nothing I do not know
nanda all white karma gains white rewards
All black karma results in black retributions
If sentient beings with a pure mind say I pay respect to the Buddha due to this good karmic root he or she certainly comes close to nirvana
If someone meets the Buddha and personally makes offerings to him that person denitely comes even closer to nirvana The Shilun jing says
The Buddha said If monks have renounced the householders life in accordance with the Buddhas Dharma all gods human beings and demons must make offerings to them
One must not impose punishment on monks who observe the precepts imprisoning cutting off their arms and legs or depriving them of life
There should be no exception
Monks who have violated the precepts are like ulcers
They do not practice the correct path but say that they do
They fall from the holy path and are deprived of its fruits
They are destroyed by the bondage of desire
Yet they still can teach the valuable treasure house of immeasurable merits to dragons  human beings and nonhumans
For this reason I dont permit kings and ministers to punish any of those who followed me and renounced the householders life whether they uphold or violate the precepts by imprisoning them beating them with sticks and whips cutting off their arms and legs or depriving them of their lives
In cases of other lesser offenses such as violating minor rules of proper conduct this is even more obviously the case
Monks who have violated the precepts are like dead people yet the precepts remain powerful
They are like gorocanā  Even though the cow has died people still take 
It is also like stone incense which becomes useful after death and benets all sentient beings greatly
Even though evil monks have violated the precepts the power of their precepts still and benets an innite number of gods and human beings
This can be compared to burning incense
The substance of the incense is destroyed but it makes other objects fragrant
Monks who have violated the precepts are like this
They themselves fall into evil rebirths but they can still allow others to nourish their good karmic roots
For this reason whiterobed laypeople should never attack or despise monks who have violated the precepts Laypeople should protect honor and make offerings even to monks who have violated the precepts
They are not permitted to impose punishment on them imprison them cut off their arms and legs or deprive them of their life Then the Worldhonored One spoke in verse
The owers of grapevines even wilted are superior to all other owers Monks who have violated the precepts are still superior to nonBuddhist teachers The Daji jing says with a shaven head and wearing a monks robe
Whether upholding the precepts or violating them Gods and humans should make offerings to them and Not leave them lacking  make offerings to them in this way Make offerings to me  pays respect to the Dharma and Takes refuge in it shaves his hair Wears the monastic robe on his body say that such a person is my son Even if a has damaged the precepts He still resides at the stage of nonretrogression If beats him That person beats my body If abuses and humiliates him That person abuses and humiliates me In the mind of this one desires are extinguished The true Dharma is a great bright lamp  ght with other for the sake of material goods Kṣatriyas all equally give rise to anger The Shilun jing says
For example there was once a king called Fude 
Someone committed a crime and was bound and fettered but the king did not wish to take his life so he gave him over to a crazed elephant
When the crazed elephant raised his two legs and was just about to crush the prisoner on the ground he saw that the man wore the dyed robes 
So the elephant put his legs gently back down on the ground He would not harm the man
He squatted before the monk touching and licking his foot with his nose and tongue showing compassion
Sons of a noble family an elephant is a mere animal
Even so seeing someone wearing the monks dyed robe he would not entertain evil thoughts and harm him
In the future a caṇḍāla king may see someone who has renounced the householders life through my Dharma who while capable of becoming a vessel of the Dharma still fails to become one
If the king oppresses this monk or takes his life that king after his own death will certainly fall into Avīci Hell

Walking in meditation under the trees in a forest will to seek the Way is rm Possessing supernatural powers Carrying a walking staff the monk travels far riding on smoke Starting with the four universal vows Such a person reaches the ultimate goal of the path before anyone else He does not covet a long life of many kalpas Not to speak of extending the years  Miracle Stories Wei dynasty  Monk Shi Tanshi Jin Dynasty  Monk Shi Daokai Eastern Jin dynasty  Minister of Works He Chong Jin dynasty  Monk Shi Faxiang Monk Shi Faan Song dynasty  Monk Shi Huiquan Qi dynasty

He emerged from among the crowd and sat on a seat  remaining silent
Everyone in the hall found this strange and said there must be some mistake

Jin Dynasty The seven peaks of Mount Lu meet in the east and form a lofty escarpment
No one could climb the extraordinarily sharp cliffs
During the Taiyuan period Fanning Governor of Yuzhang planned to build a school and sent people to harvest wood 
A man wearing a monks robe was seen on a cliff
He went straight up and on reaching the peak he turned around and appeared to be squatting on the summit of the peak
After a while a cloud formed and he disappeared into it
At that time several people who were collecting herbs saw this and contemporary writers wrote poetry about the event
The monk Shi Tandis fu verses on Mount Lu say An arhat went above the clouds and squatted at the peakVery small and disappearing in the scenery this is someone who had entered the dark mystery  The monk Zhu Senglang was strict in observing the precepts and both Chinese people and foreigners respected and marveled at him
Once he traveled with several others to attend a lecture on the Dharma
On the way he suddenly told his companions It appears that someone stole the robes and other things that you left at the monastery The others immediately returned and indeed the items had been stolen
During the Taiyuan period Senglang built a stupa and a temple in Jinxing Valley in the Qinyu district and he produced images 
Fu Qian persecuted monks toward the end of his rule but he honored Langs community alone as an exception and did not dare cause harm to it
At that time both monastics and lay followers had faith in the community and presented offerings to it
Every time people were coming to visit Senglang knew the number of people the day before their arrival and let the monastery know so that his disciples could prepare properly for the visit
Without exception his words proved correct
There were many tigers in Jinxing Valley that used to harm people
After the monastery was established there the tigers all became  like domestic animals
Murong De of the Xianbei group donated the taxes from two districts to Senglangs community
To the present day the valley is called Master Langs Valley ref

He saw a man clothed in black wearing a military crown who told him to open the casket

Later he crossed the Yangzi River and stayed at Yuecheng Monastery
All of a sudden he abandoned all conventions and began behaving like a comic actor
Once he appeared naked and taunted the court nobles
Sima Tian DefenderGeneral of the North disliked Faxiangs unruly behavior and invited him in order to try to poison him
Even after emptying the cup with the poisoned liquid three times he was unaffected and looked just the same
Faxiang died at the age of eightynine toward the end of the Yuanxing period

b Shi Faan a monk of Mount Lu was a disciple of Dharma Master Huiyuan
Toward the end of the Yixi period violent incidents involving a tiger occurred frequently in the Yangxin district
A shrine had been built under a massive tree and more than one hundred residents lived in a nearby 
Every evening one or two of the villagers encountered the tiger and were killed
Faan came upon Yangxin in his travels and at the village
Fearing the tiger the villagers had locked the village gate early in the day and as they were not acquainted with Faan they refused to let him in
Faan then went to the tree straightaway and sat in meditation under it all night
Toward dawn the tiger carrying a human corpse came by
The tiger dropped the corpse on the northern side of the tree and delighted to see Faan it came leaping over and lay down in front of him
Faan preached to the tiger and conferred the precepts while the tiger remained crouched on the ground and did not move
After a while it left
In the morning villagers looking for the dead man came to the tree and they were amazed to see Faan sitting under it
They said that the tiger did not harm him because he was a holy man
From then on all the villagers troubles with the tiger ceased
People honored Faan even more
Everyone in the district became a follower of the Dharma
Later Faan wished to paint a image on a rock wall on the side of a mountain
He did not have any blue pigment for painting the sky and wanted to use copper but he did not have any copper either
At night a man appeared next to his bed in a dream saying There are two bells 
You should take them In the morning Faan dug up the copper bells and eventually he was able to complete the painting
Later when Dharma Master Huiyuan produced a metal image Faan sent one of the bells to assist with the project
As for the other bell Xiong Wuhuan Governor of Wuchang borrowed it and kept it with him
Song Dynasty During the reign of Emperor Xiaowu the monk Huiyuan of Changsha Monastery in Jiangling whose secular name was Huang Qian was a disciple of Meditation Master Huiyin
Huiyin practiced meditation and obtained visions
Huiyuan had been Huiyins former teacher
Even though was only a servant Huiyin chose him to ordain as his disciple
stayed at the Yang family residence and practiced panzhou meditation
Practicing diligently for over a year he frequently achieved miraculous responses
On a single day people saw Huiyuan in ten ritual sessions 
Yet at the place where he was performing the panzhou meditation nothing unusual occurred
He foresaw the day of his death and when the time came he died
After a long while he appeared at Duobao Monastery and told the monk Tanxuan Next year on the twentythird day of the second month I will come to welcome you with heavenly beings Then he disappeared
Tanxun held a large gathering performing the feast of giving up ones body
On that day he did not feel well and realized that his life was about to end
At the third watch Tanxuan heard music in the sky and miraculous fragrant smoke appeared
He said The promise of Master Huiyuan is realized Shortly thereafter he left the world mysteriously Ji shenzhou sanbao gantong lu Tab ref
Gaoseng zhuan Tc The monk Shi Huiquan was a meditation monk from Liangzhou
He opened a school there and had ve hundred students
One disciple had a rough and violent temperament
Huiquan would usually not have anything to do with him
Suddenly the monk claimed that he had attained the third fruit of the Way but because that monks practice was inadequate Huiquan refused to conrm his attainment
Huiquan later became ill
The disciple came to him at night to ask after him and the door remained closed as usual
Huiquan was amazed and wanted to test the disciples supernatural powers so he told him to come again the next evening
The window and the door were secretly sealed and additional locks were installed
In the middle of the night the disciple arrived
Quickly coming before the bed he said to Huiquan cārya you can now see that I actually came He continued cārya after this life you will be reborn in a brahman household Huiquan said I have done a lot of sitting in Buddhist meditation
How could I be reborn in such circumstances The disciple said Your faith ācārya is insufcient
You also have not completely given up nonBuddhist learning
Even though you have accumulated merit you cannot escape this world
If you offer a feast for all and one holy person you will attain the fruit of the spiritual path Thereupon Huiquan set up the feast
The disciple had also said Make a donation of a saṃghāṭī robe
If someone asks for the robe whatever their monastic standing may be donate the robe to the monastery as soon as the feast is over A novice asked Huiquan to give him a robe
Huiquan thought that the novice was one of his own disciples and said I plan to offer this robe to a holy monk
How can I give it to you Then he remembered the earlier instruction that he was not to choose to whom to give the robe and then donated it gladly
Later on another day he saw the same novice and asked him Is the robe I gave you the other day not big enough for you The novice said For some good reason I did not get the robe
I also had another engagement and could not take part in the feast Huiquan then realized that the novice he had seen earlier was the phantom appearance of the holy being
Much later the disciple passed away
No miraculous signs appeared at the time but a white light was seen at the four sides of the tomb
In Yuanxi  Huiquan was still alive
He resided in Jiuquan Qi Dynasty Shi Huiming was at Mount Chicheng in Shifeng
His surname was Kang and he was from Kangju 
His ancestors had ed from there and settled in eastern Wu
He stayed in a cave in Mount Chicheng where he practiced meditation and recitation a driedup piece of wood when his life came to end
Later while in meditation he saw a female deity who called herself Old Woman and said that she would guard him at all times
At one time white monkeys white deer white snakes and white tigers all played before the steps  acting as if they were tame rolling around on the ground
People were not afraid of them
The Qi dynasty Prince Wenxuan of Jingling heard of Huiming and paid respect
Three times he sent messengers to extend an invitation so Huiming left the mountain for a short while and came to the capital city
Wenxuan respectfully treated him with the rites for a teacher
After a while Huiming took his leave and returned to the mountain
earnestly urged him to stay but the did not consent
So provisions were offered to send back with the monk
died in the mountains toward the end of the Jianwu period 
If we look on the shores of the ocean and in the mountains in China for the monasteries springs rocks and caves where people of the Way engaged in spiritual cultivation and dwelled in holy temples there would be numerous examples
We can describe only several cases for the record
Others are not mentioned because it is impossible to give an exhaustive account
In the past at the beginning of the Taiyuan period of the Jin dynasty  sat in meditation and was strong in his determination and diligent in practice
When he traveled to Mount Chicheng in the Shan district in Kuaiji a group of tigers came to him and Tanyou preached the Dharma to them
When one tiger fell asleep he took his staff and hit it on the head
A snake encircled him tenfold yet he showed no fear
The mountain deity offered its residence to him turning it into a temple
It is also said that Tanyou went to Mount Chicheng to sit in meditation
This mountain was part of the same mountain range as Mount Tiantai with its waterfall and the Siming Mountains
According to local elders there was a holy monastery on Mount Tiantai and Tanyou set out to look for it
There was a stone bridge over a valley slippery with green moss and difcult to cross a rock had been placed on it blocking the road It was impossible to get through
Tanyou spent the night in front of the bridge and heard the voice of someone walking about chanting
He underwent purication and was eager to proceed
Suddenly he saw the rock that had blocked the crossing over the valley had been moved
Tanyou could then cross the bridge and was shown a monastery 
Supernatural monks burned incense there
After the midday meal the monk told him to come back after ten years had passed 
Yuantong of Lower Dazhuangyan Monastery in Ye encountered a supernatural monk who was attending a lecture during the summer retreat
At the end of the retreat and on the last day the monk took his leave saying that he resided at Zhulin Monastery
He earnestly urged Yuantong to come there Yuantong asked how to get there in detail and a year later he traveled there
On the eastern side of the mountain situated northwest of Ye the supernatural monk welcomed him
They saw the door of the monastery open revealing beautiful buildings Tall trees rose high up into the sky
Yuantong stayed overnight visiting everywhere in the monastery
He found it perfect and thought of staying there for the rest of his life
The supernatural monk asked the abbot but he could not get his permission Yuantong took the same route to return home
After traveling three li he looked back but he could not see the monastery
Later others went there but they could not locate the monastery
Recently  there was a monk called Daoqin in Dengzhou
There was a rocky mountain north of the city went there and saw everything on the mountain
It was indeed a residential monastery fully equipped with everything necessary yet he did not see any people there After coming down he asked about the right way to return but could not nd it
There are cave chambers at rest spots along the way that one can visit instead
At Holding Belly Rock on Jieshan southeast of Fenzhou monks who live on the mountain repeatedly saw a monk ying in the sky going back and forth
There are also cliff caves south of Liangzhou which were constructed by Juqu Mensun The inscription remains
Holy monks lived there constantly engaged in walking practice
When people came they stopped and after the visitors left they resumed walking
There are visible footprints still on the side of the road but the inhabitants of the monastery are nowhere to be seen  Comment
The Mingseng zhuan in thirty fascicles the Liang gaoseng zhuan in fteen fascicles the Tang gaoseng zhuan in forty fascicles and historical records by many authors records of ordinary or holy monks of great virtue numbering over one thousand Their merits are of diverse kinds Both monastics and lay Buddhist practitioners admire them
Some appear scattered in different parts  Some are very long and have not been included here A limited number of examples are given to illustrate the virtues of these monks Worship Introduction Efcacy Paying Respect Widely Names Comparative Explanation The Sitting Mat and The Ritual Manual for Ceremony Holy beings are compassionate and the Perfected Ones benet others
They desire to lead the four kinds of living beings to the treasure place and transport sentient beings in the three realms in the great carriage
Teachers and disciples follow different roads but share the same end
Monastics and laypeople travel on different paths but they arrive at the same goal
We establish images to give expression to the truth and teach with unchanging rules to regulate worldly practices
We use a nger to point at the moon and eternal norms to give expression to the Way
Yet in being attached to the illusions of ones own self and others selves people fall into the stream of illusion
Floating along the working out of karma they do not think of reforming themselves
In this way caught in delusions over many world ages people do not recognize the Three Honorable Ones
Ignorant and stubborn they seldom meet the Ten Holy Beings
For this reason life is like the ame of a candle in the wind difcult to preserve
Our body is like the spark of a intstone How could it be longlasting
As the ve delements invade everywhere and the four snakes  constantly oppress how could these people nd peace living in this world of illusion
Therefore the Great Holy One out of pity and compassion taught and guided them
Of all essential deeds nothing is more important than the practice of repentance
Thus in the Shizhu lun Nāgārjuna says
Bodhisattvas day and night are each divided into three periods
During each of these six periods of time worship the buddhas of the ten directions repenting requesting delighting and transferring merit
The bodhisattva will then reach the stage of nonretrogression 
This practice quickly produces the result of nonretrogression
Sentient beings meditate on Good Virtue Buddha of the eastern direction or on the buddhas of the ten directions
Thanks to the power of the Buddhas original vow if a sentient being had previously planted good roots in a buddhas place he or she hears the name of that buddha they are able to accept him in faith They then turn to seek nonretrogressive wisdom
If even ignorant ones used to hearing evil voices now suddenly hear  and call the Buddhas name they are lled with delight Their sins are destroyed and merits are produced
Therefore a sutra says If you worship this buddha you remove the grave sins in one hundred myriad previous births and deaths It is also said You remove the grave sins in births and deaths over a thousand world ages If you do not follow these steps of practice and instead activate worldly thoughts then you pay for the sins you have committed by suffering over many world ages
Upon hearing the Buddhas name we all dance with joy Because of what sins are we unable to see the true appearance  We shed streams of tears and singlemindedly join the palms  Because of what good deeds am I able to hear the Buddhas name We are delighted and worship the Buddha with increasing intensity
We look up at the holy face and yearn for him endlessly
Because of these sorrowful and joyful reactions our faith deepens day by day
Through such emotional communication our minds become free of entanglements and we pay respect to and take refuge 
As for monastics and laypeople today whenever they hear and chant the name of the Buddha even as they perform the rite with their bodies their minds remain attached to external objects
Even if they stumble in the middle they show no sign of regret
Such a shameful lack of faith is demonstrated by this
Sometimes monastics and lay followers worship in private
rise or lower oneself they are lazy both in body and mind and they fail to express alarm or fear 
The sin of disrespect increases
Sometimes monastics and laypeople worship together in a congregation
A thousand monastics and ten thousand laypeople loudly chant together The congregation moves quickly through the rite of worship but the monks and laypeople fail to physically bow down and mentally they lack respectful thought
This is just as during roll call the presence of some soldiers is recorded even when they are not there
People go up and down like a pestle but the effort does not produce any benet
Such sloppy practices should not escape blame
Practitioners seek fame and wealth yet sincerity and respect are missing
Through faith one enters the path which produces wisdom
If faith is lacking there is nothing on which to rely upon entering the path
Below I list ve points which are all based on the holy teaching They demonstrate the difference between what is authentic and what is false
I request that you remove delusions and turn to truth so that you may attain the nal goal
I look up and think of the compassion of the Great Enlightened One the Ultimate Sage
Due to the help from previous lives and good fortune this mysterious cosmic response occurs
we are able to hear the name and worship him and our meritorious karma quickly begins 
The mind undergoes transformation and the marvelous outcome is achieved in the course of a vastly long period
The sound of the ftythree buddhas gathers strength before the ne dust 
The light of the three thousand Perfected Ones is bright behind the sands of the Ganges River
The accomplishments of the twentyve buddhas bring rescue from suffering
A donation of the seven jewels of this sahā world does not measure up to the benets of one act of worship
The cause of palms appears to work slowly yet the reward of the king of trees steadily arrives
Therefore we know that worshiping and praising are not empty practices
Worshiping with humble sincerity mysteriously brings about benets
The Zhidu lun says
A bodhisattva who has not realized the truth of the Dharma keeps away from the Buddha Dharma destroys good karmic roots and in the midst of afictions cannot save even themselves How could they save others
Therefore you should not keep away from the buddhas just as a baby should not be separated from its mother or as one should not lack food when traveling on the road or as one should not lack a cool wind in the heat or as one should not lack a warming re in cold weather or as one should not lack a solid boat when crossing water or as one should not lack a good physician when ill
The reason the bodhisattva should never be separated from the Buddha is that ones parents and friends or the gods cannot help us cross over the ocean of suffering
Only the Buddha helps us escape from suffering
For this reason always be concerned not to become separated from the Buddha The Yaowang yaoshang jing says
ākyamuni Buddha said to the assembly An incalculable number of world ages ago in the period of the decline of the Dharma of Miaoguang Buddha I renounced the householders life and studied the path
I heard the names of the ftythree buddhas and after hearing them I joined my palms and experienced joy I also taught others to hear and uphold the names
After hearing the names the others in turn taught still others to the point that the worshipers numbered three thousand
These three thousand individuals all pronounced the buddhas names singlemindedly worshiped them and due to the power of the merit acquired in this way they overcame the sins acquired through births and deaths in innumerable world ages
The rst thousand of them from Huaguang Buddha through Viśubhabhū Buddha achieved buddhahood during the world age of adornment
These are the one thousand past buddhas
The one thousand buddhas of the present world age begin with Krakucchanda and end with Ruci Buddha
They achieve buddhahood one by one during the world age of the wise
The one thousand buddhas of the future begin with Riguang Buddha and end with Xumixiang Buddha
They will achieve buddhahood in the world ages of the lunar stations
The present buddhas in the ten directions such as Shande Tathāgata also heard the names of these ftythree buddhas and thus achieved buddhahood in their respective worlds in the ten directions
If men and women of good families as well as all other sentient beings hear the names of these ftythree buddhas they will avoid falling into inferior realms of birth for a hundred thousand myriads of innumerable world ages
Furthermore those who hear these names of the ftythree buddhas will meet the buddhas of the ten directions in the places where they are born
People sincerely worshiping the names of the ftythree buddhas will become puried of except for the four grave sins the ve offenses and the sin of reviling Mahayana sutras
This is due to the original vows of these buddhas
From moment to moment these sins are removed except for those listed above The names of the three thousand buddhas appear in the Zhufo jijie jing 
The buddhas names clan afliations and lands are listed in the Xianjie jing 
Among the one thousand buddhas ākyamuni is the fourth to achieve buddhahood The Jueding pini jing says If a person sincerely worships the thirtyve buddhas the merit that he or she acquires will be incalculable and innite The Foming jing says
If men and women of good families hear these names of the twentyve buddhas and they sincerely accept recite and respectfully worship them they will escape the suffering of the three inferior realms of hell hungry ghosts and animals
They will become free of anger and ignorance and destroy the grave sins they committed over one hundred world ages
They will always be reborn in the pure lands of the buddhas in the ten directions
Even if someone were to ll the universe with the seven jewels and used these jewels to offer donations throughout a lifetime of a hundred years the merit acquired by this would not even reach the onethousandth of the merit of receiving and worshiping the names of the twentyve buddhas
These merits will be beyond calculation or comparison through suitable metaphors
Why is this
Sentient beings with few good karmic roots are unable to hear the names of these buddhas
If sentient beings hear the names of these buddhas then they had planted good karmic roots not just in one or ten buddha lands but in one hundred thousand myriads of buddha lands
Only then are they able to hear the names of these buddhas
These people attain buddhahood before a buddha after fortyeight world ages
People who do not believe in the merit of the names of these twentyve buddhas will be reborn in Avīci Hell and spend the entirety of one hundred world ages there
āriputra when monks nuns laymen and laywomen repent their sins they should bathe put on fresh clothes and clean their chambers set up a high seat and place an image hang twentyve banners offer various owers and incense and recite the names of the twentyve buddhas For a period of twentyve days through the six periods of practice throughout the day and night they should repent
This will remove such sins as the four and eight grave offenses
This also applies to śikṣamāṇās novice monks and nuns
The Wenshushili wen jing gives verses of praise for the Buddha
I worship all the buddhas unparalleled charioteer The true Dharma body one zhang and six chi in height I also worship the Buddhas stupa At the place of his birth where he attained the Way Turned the Dharma wheel and entered nirvana The places where he walked stood sat and lay down At all these places I worship The buddhas are beyond our understanding The marvelous Dharmas are also thus Having faith we receive the fruit This too is beyond our understanding Those who with these verses Praise the tathāgatas During a period of a thousand myriads of world ages Will not descend to evil realms of rebirth The Pusa benxing jing says
If an incalculable number of myriads of people were to become pratyekabuddhas and if someone was to offer these pratyekabuddhas the four kinds of for a hundred years the merit would be very great yet it would not equal the innite amount of merit one acquires by reciting a single fourphrase verse of praise to the Tathāgata
The Shangsheng jing says
To make the offering to the Tathāgata of treasures of the four realms under heaven and to praise the Tathāgata sincerelythere is no difference between the merits of these two
The Dabei jing says The merits acquired by reciting the Buddhas name even once to enter nirvana This merit is inexhaustible Comment
We now know that in the holy teaching  the merits worshiping the Buddha are beyond understanding
Therefore practitioners should always be careful and should not fail
The fear is that death comes suddenly it is not possible to perform the rite of worshiping the Buddha
A mouse driven into a corner has nowhere to which to escape
For this reason according to a scripture the Worldhonored One taught in verse
Life is like a lamp exposed to wind We do not know when it will go out Whether today or tomorrow Death quickly arrives when we are not aware in darkness following the effects of our karma We do not know in what realm we will be reborn The Shangsheng jing says
One who worships Maitreya Buddha is cleared of the sins  a hundred myriad lives and in a future birth will be able to see the Buddha under the dragonower tree Also
After my extinction if a member of the fourfold community or one of the eight kinds of supernatural beings hears my name and pays respect when that persons life comes to the end they will be reborn in Tuṣita Heaven
If men and women who have violated precepts and committed many evil deeds hear the name of this bodhisattva of great compassion and they throw their bodies to the ground to worship and sincerely repent all their sins will quickly be cleansed
If someone takes refuge in Maitreya Bodhisattva you should know that they will attain the stage of nonretrogression
When Maitreya achieves buddhahood that person will see the light of buddha and will receive the prediction of their future attainment of buddhahood The Zengyi ahan jing says
The Buddha has ve merits rst attractiveness Note
When see the marks they look up to him second possessing a good voice Note When see the Buddha they spontaneously say three times Namas Tathāgata Arhat Enlightened One third having material wealth Note Because worship by offering owers incense and lamps according to their ability fourth having been born in a noble setting Note When see him their minds are free of delement and they kneel on their right knees and with joined palms worship him fth rebirth in heaven
The Jingang sanmei jing says
If someone hears the Buddhas superior wisdom even briey and they sincerely nd joy in it and do not revile it that person will not fall into inferior realms of rebirth for as long as a hundred thousand world ages and at the place of rebirth they will meet the Buddha
The merit  meditating on the Buddhas Dharma body is unlimited
The Puxianguan jing says
If one worships the buddhas of the ten directions in the six periods of worship throughout the day and night recites Mahayana sutras and meditates on the rst teaching on the profound Dharma of emptiness in as brief a moment as it takes to snap ones ngers all of their sins acquired through lives and deaths of as many world ages as there are grains of sand in one hundred myriad nayutas of Ganges Rivers will be removed
Those who practice like this are true sons of the Buddha
They are born from the Buddha and take the buddhas and bodhisattvas of the ten directions as their preceptor 
They are called those who are fully ordained in the bodhisattva precepts
They do not require the formal karman ritual  Their ordination is achieved spontaneously and are to receive offerings from all people and gods
The Niepan jing Nirvana Sutra Ta b Tb If a person offers to the Buddha and Dharma one piece of incense or a lamp or presents one ower then that person will be reborn in the Kingdom of the Immovable
If a person guards property that belongs to the Buddha or the sangha or sweeps and decorates the ground around a buddha image or a monastery or even a buddha image or a stupa a thumb and they experience joy  that person will also be reborn in the Kingdom of the Immovable
This is a pure land of the Buddha always adorned and never affected by the three calamities
The Dharma body is without form and yet manifests itself throughout the ten directions namely the four cardinal directions the four secondary directions  and above and below
The teachings of worldly Confucians all focus on this world  but there are other continents outside of this world
These worlds are never discussed in Confucian sources either in the past or at present Buddhist scriptures exhaustively discuss all of the worlds without limit vertically and horizontally covering all foreign worlds
Our sahā world in the Buddhist teaching is a worldsystem that contains ten thousand myriads of suns and moons and is surrounded on all four sides
This is called a buddha land and it is the realm over which ākyamuni Tathāgata rules
The Huayan jing says
The land over which Vairocana Buddhas reward body rules is even greater than this in number
It covers all the worlds in the ten directions and  beyond what ordinary beings can comprehend
The Fanwang jing says
I Vairocana Am about to sit upon the lotus ower seat Above the one thousand owers surrounding it Again appear one thousand ākyamuni Buddhas Each ower a hundred myriads of kingdoms In each kingdom one ākyamuni Sits under a bodhi tree All simultaneously attaining buddhahood
The scripture speaks of one thousand owers and one thousand buddhas Here one petal is counted as one ower
So one ower has a thousand petals the one thousand buddhas who appear in the world
The Puxianguan jing says
The land in which Vairocana Tathāgata dwells pervades everywhere
the place in which the Buddha dwells is called Eternal Light of Quietude
This refers to the dwelling of no dwelling to which all look up and worship with an empty mind
If we speak in terms of ultimate truth however there is no place of dwelling
Thus the buddha tathāgatas in an innite number of worlds in the ten directions never cease to teach
Throughout the past present and future teach that come into being and go out of being
In terms of reality the holy teaching pervades everything and in effect it is identical to the Dharma realm 
It is not possible to limit the discussion to one specic area or to in the three periods of time 
Now we speak in terms of the present manifestation of the one life of ākyamuni
So provisionally his conception and the eight stages of his life that culminated in enlightenment
For the benet of those of limited capacity the Buddha taught the great teaching in gradual stages
Even his parents relatives and other worldly nobles worshiped the Tathāgata
How then could inferior beings fail to worship him
The Foshuo shierming shenzhou chuzhang miezui jing  says
At that time the Worldhonored One said to Maitreya Bodhisattva Maitreya to the east of this buddha realm ten times an incomprehensible number of buddha lands as many as a hundred myriads of dust particles
Beyond these buddha lands is the buddha land called World of the Lord of Liberation
In that world is a buddha called King of the Dharma Realm of Unobstructed Release from Life Empty Space Whose Pure Merits are as Numerous as Minute Particles of Dust Whose Eyes are Handsome a Feature of True Merit Emitting the Flower of Light of the Padma Lotus Flowers Lapis Lazuli Light to Whom Offering is Made with Fragrance of the Essence of Jewels Fragrances of Highest Quality and Who is Adorned Variously with the Hair Knot on the Crown of the Head Emitting the Unlimited Light of the Sun and Moon Adorned with the Power of Vows and Adorned with Transformations Tathāgata
If a man or a woman of a good family commits the four grave offenses or the ve crimes or he or she has reviled the Three Jewels or committed one of the pārājika s that persons sin would be serious
Suppose the ground of this Jambudvīpa world is turned into minute dust particles and each dust particle  would form one world age
that person has sins through several world ages if he or she says the name of this buddha a single time or worships the Buddha even once all their sins will be removed
If a person upholds recites and recalls without forgetting  that persons merit would be beyond our comprehension
In the world of that buddha is a bodhisattva called King Incomparably Free of Obstructions
The Buddha confers on that bodhisattva the prediction of attaining buddhahood in the future
He will become a buddha called King with the rṇā Flame of the Sun and Moonlight the Jeweled Lotus Flower  with a Body as Firm as Vajra Who is Like Vairocana Illumining with Unobstructed Eyes the Ten Directions and Shedding Light on All Buddha Lands Tathāgata
To the east is the buddha whose name is Pure Light Adorning All Tathāgata
To the south is the buddha whose name is Eloquent Jewel Necklace of Thought Tathāgata
To the west is the buddha whose name is King Form of the Pure Moon 
To the north is the buddha whose name is Flower Decoration Turned into Light Tathāgata
To the southeast is the buddha whose name is One Who Makes Lamps Tathāgata
To the southwest is the buddha whose name is Form Superior to Jewels Tathāgata
To the northwest is the buddha whose name is Contemplation of Fearlessness Tathāgata
To the northeast is the buddha whose name is Fearless and Unafraid Completely Calm Tathāgata
In the direction below is the buddha whose name is Root of Lions Resolve Tathāgata
In the direction above is the buddha whose name is One Who Resembles the Powerful King of Golden Light Tathāgata At that time the Buddha said to Maitreya When men and women of good families of correct faith call the names of these twelve buddhas they should repent all sins for ten days and take delight in the merit possessed by all sentient beings
They should request all the buddhas to remain in the world forever and dedicate all good deeds to the Dharma realm
Then all sins will be immediately destroyed and all karmic obstructions will be puried
They will immediately attain full success  and adorn all buddha lands
They will have fearlessness
They will have the bodily marks 
They will be surrounded by bodhisattvas as attendants They will have innite  samādhis
They will freely adorn the buddha land activate supreme wisdom and receive delightful physical features Then the Buddha said in verse
If men of good families Or women of good families Uphold the names of these buddhas In the series of lives in succeeding worlds They will be beloved of others The power of light will be great will be respected by others in the places where they are born And they will later realize buddhahood The Shijialuoyue liuxiangbai jing says
While the Buddha was in this world there was a son of an elder whose name was iṅgālaka who rose early bathed put on clothes and worshiped four times facing each of the six directions
The Buddha came into Rājagṛha and saw this from a distance
The Buddha came to this mans house and asked Why do you worship the six directions
On which teaching is this based iṅgālaka said My father taught me while he was alive
I do not know why I am supposed to worship in the six directions The Buddha said The rite your father taught you is not bodily worship iṅgālaka kneeled and said Would the Buddha explain to me the meaning of these six practices The Buddha said Listen to this
If an elder who is intelligent observes the four precepts and does not violate them they will be loved by people in this life and later be reborn in heaven
rst do not kill second do not steal third do not desire other peoples women fourth do not tell lies
If someone who is greedy angry and stupid fails to control himself with these four such a person is called moons darknesshe is like a waning moon that is about to disappear
its light is very dim
If a person controls his evil intentions  he is like waxing moon that has just reappeared the light of which begins to shine brightly
On the fteenth day the moonlight is brightest The Buddha said Worshiping facing east is about how a child should serve his or her parents There are ve items
rst the child should think of their livelihood second the child should get up early and let the servants prepare food  third one should not increase their parents distress fourth the child should think of the gravity of their debt to their parents fth when the parents are ill the child should be concerned and seek a physicians help
There are also ve items regarding the way parents view their child
First the parent should constantly think of keeping the child away from evil and turning toward the good
Second the parent should teach the child arithmetic and writing
Third the parent should teach the child to observe the sutras and the precepts
Fourth the parent should arrange for a son to have a wife
Fifth the parent should give the child everything that belongs to the household
Worshiping facing south is about how a student should serve his or her teacher
There are ve items
First the student should pay respect to and praise the teacher
Second the student should think of their debt to the teacher
Third the student should follow what the teacher has taught
Fourth the student should think of the teacher tirelessly
Fifth the student should follow the teacher and praise him
In teaching the student the teacher should be mindful of ve things
First the teacher should work so that the student learns quickly and does not forget 
Second the teacher should the student to be superior to other peoples students
Third the teacher should not let the student forget what they have learned
Fourth the teacher should explain fully whatever the student has doubts about and is difcult to understand
Fifth the teacher should let the students wisdom be superior to the teachers
Worshiping facing west is about how a wife should serve her husband
There are ve items
First when the husband returns home from outside the wife should rise and welcome him
Second when the husband is out and away from home the wife should cook and clean and wait for him
Third the wife should not entertain any licentious thoughts outside the home

It is because of these practices that your father while alive in this world taught you to worship the six directions
Why worry about not being rich Hearing this iṅgālaka immediately accepted the ve precepts paid respect  and departed
The Way and the world are opposed
Name and reality diverge 
Attainment consists in meeting the truth in mysterious darkness
Why is this so
Whereas in worldly discourse it is not permitted to spell out the names of deceased ancestors the Buddhist scriptures name the buddhas
If we praise and worship them we will obtain innite merit
The buddhas and tathāgatas have great compassion and take pity on beings  letting their spirits descend to the world and giving priority to the task of bringing salvation If someone sincerely looks up to the buddhas he or she will receive benets without fail
Saying the name  aloud  meditating on the name  and physical acts of worship if one worships in these three ways  the three poisons will be puried and cooled one will gradually uproot oneself from this world and become free of its bondage Praising these Great Virtuous Ones  we acquire merit
Those who follow the worldly stream are different they spend their whole lives hiding and shunning these names
How can one reach distant ancestors and later generations if we hide and shun their names
Zhengzai illustrates this point
In treatises different buddhas are named and assigned different categories Each appears to have their own distinctive capacity Let me illustrate briey with the names of the buddhas
The buddha called ākya in the West is called Nengren here  but how could any one buddha not be capable of humaneness
The buddha called Amitābha in the western direction is called Wuliangshou here but how could any buddha not have a long life span
Similarly regarding Shangde of the eastern direction and Guangzhongde in the direction below how could any buddha not possess good virtue or have broad and many virtues
The same entity is named differently
In terms of their merit power and usefulness they are all the same
If we can only conceive in our mind the name of a single buddha see with our eyes his golden appearance and worship him with faith we will acquire an innite amount of merit
A verse praising the Buddha in the Shizhu piposha lun Ta A person who hears the names And pronounces these names of the buddhas Will immediately attain innite merit This the Buddha explained to Ratnacandra As I worship these buddhas They now appear in the ten directions Those who pronounce their names Immediately attain the stage of nonretrogression Comment
Establish the practice of reverently paying respect to all 
yi means reaching universally
Qie means beyond all limits
Gong means obediently looking up
Jing means having no other thought in mind
If we do not chant these characters our mind scatters in different directions
So as we control our emotions and reverently pay respect the correct meditation actually appears before us
Respectfully worship the eternal Three Jewels
the Nirvana Sutra says that if someone hears the twocharacter phrase changzhu that person will never fall into the three evil realms of rebirth  through successive births
The Dharma body is xed and unchanging so it is eternal 
The response body is continuous and unbroken so it is eternal
The functioning of the transformation body is ceaseless so it is unchanging
Furthermore the buddha body is one in substance and yet we speak of three in different contexts
Therefore ākyamuni says This body of mine is no other than the Dharma body As the basis for upholding this Dharma body we make a sacred image out of wood and clay
If we pay respect and worship it we will obtain innite merit
If we make light of it and abuse it we will have committed sins and will receive punishment
After making the image we offer incense and owers and mentally perform worship of the Buddha everywhere
Whether the Buddha appears or not all sentient beings must in equal measure make offerings of incense owers clothing food and drink music and so on
They must never allow these offerings to be stopped
In the Huayan jing bodhisattvas perform offerings as one sees a large mountain a large cloud a large ower or a large re so one visualizes a fragrant mountain a fragrant cloud water of eight superior qualities seven pure and beautiful owers
As one mentally forms the thought everything is realized
Similarly for verdant forests and fruit trees one practices accordingly
Worshiping the Buddha
In accordance with proper rituals worship the buddhas of the ten directions the twentyve buddhas the thirtyve buddhas the ftythree buddhas the one thousand buddhas of the world age of the wise the ten thousand and ve thousand buddhas and so on The practice of reciting their names and the mental discipline has been described above Repentance
For all acts of repentance whether of grave or minor sins as one repents or teaches others to repent take delight in seeing it performed
The truth must be exposed and thus one repents former offensesin distress with regret and sorrow lling ones eyes
If one fails to be instructed they necessarily undergo long suffering and death
Details of the instruction appear in the chapter on repentance below
Requesting the Buddha to teach
In utmost sincerity we present the request
The buddhas see sentient beings not discriminating between the great and the lesser and wish to fulll their requests they do not abandon their present life 
They vow to remain for many world ages and bring salvation to sentient beings
One gives rise to the feeling of joy when others acquire merit
Redirecting karmic merit
This means dedicating all the merit one has acquired toward realization of the supreme path
Making the vow
Vow incites practice and activates it
If one has made a vow but there is no action then the vow is empty
If there is action but no vow then the action is abandoned
Because there is an action the vow is not empty
When vow and action assist each other the fruit of realization will not be empty 
Therefore even in repenting a sin one makes a vow or wish that for certain one will not be reborn in inferior realms
These are the universal features 
Beyond these it is necessary to take into consideration the circumstances in putting these teachings into practice Explanation Comment 
I describe here the appearances of ritual which vary according to locality and time
We practice in accordance with the custom of the country while maintaining a spirit of reverence as the foundation
Beginners do not understand this practice without studying it
So I explain it here in detail in order to make clear what they have not yet heard
Learned virtuous people naturally would not ask for this
However the practice of paying respect in Central India differs from that in China
There people worship less and understand more
Here people worship more and understand less
There people show reverence by wearing robes that expose their shoulders and going barefooted
Here people pay respect with their bodies covered by clothes and wearing shoes
The different appearances of monastics and laypeople  can be compared to the extraordinary show of magicians 
One knows the ritual in detail but applies it in accordance with circumstances
In ceremonies at court we are most diligent in the three aspects bodily verbal and mental of ritual performance
When time is limited we abbreviate some of the actions the four limbs
What matters is the core essence
Wisdom emerges without thinking
Expressing reverence and extreme sorrow this is what is common between ritual practice as done in India and in China
The Chuyao jing says
The ritual for laymen the ritual for renunciants the ritual for greater people of the Way the ritual for lesser people of the Waythese are the foundations of the practice in which good deeds lead to rebirths 
Through such acts one is reborn in superior realms
This passage clearly shows that faith and proper ritual are the beginning of the path
This teaching should not be hidden
I therefore offer a preface prescribing it
Among secular writings the Rites of Zhou speak of nine categories of worship or greeting 
This is from the section on the ofce of tazhu 
This is not a Buddhist teaching
Nonetheless in ritual the noble practice comes out of worldly customs
The rst is called jishoubai  with which subjects greet their ruler
They bow their heads the ground for a short while
The second is called dunshoubai  with which princes that have gathered to make peace with their enemies greet each other
They bow their heads but do not let them touch the ground
The third is called kongshoubai  with which the ruler responds to his subjects
He bows his head to the level of his hands 
This is called hand worship
The fourth is called zhendongbai  in which grave respect is expressed in trembling movements
The fth is called jibai  in which one greets and then bows the forehead the ground 
This applies to the cases below qishuai and buzhang 
It is called ji but it was the xiongbai of Yin dynasty
Under the Zhou dynasty because of its similarity with the practice of dunshou which is auspicious it is called ji 
One rst performs jishoubai  and then jisang
Sang means forehead If the forehead touches the ground then one has deviated from the proper rite
The sixth is called xiongbai 
One rst performs jisang and then dunshou
This is the worship of those engaged in the threeyear mourning period
The seventh is called qibai 
One bends ones knees
It is todays yabai 
According to one theory this is the greeting the ruler gives once when he answers a subject
The eighth is called baobai 
Bao means to return Returning a greeting means greeting twice
It is also said that baobai is the greeting used by todays imperial messengers
They greet twice both the deity and his medium
The ninth is called subai 
One only looks down at ones own hands
It is called yi today
It is also a womens greeting
Subai may be repeated up to three times
Kongshoubai and qibai are performed only once
Others may be repeated twice
The above is taken from the scriptural accounts of worldly rites
Zheng Kangcheng explained them in this way on the basis of the status 
In the Buddhist teaching the rite of jing is given rst
There are two broad categories namely body and mind
The Buddhas teaching considers the mind as fundamental and the body as secondary
Therefore when  Subhūti sat in a quiet room and the Tathāgata praised him saying that Subhūti worshiped by seeing the Dharma body
When the nun Utpalavarṇā came to the jeweled staircase earlier the Tathāgata criticized her as worshiping the transformation body
For this reason we learn that by meditating in a quiet place we walk the path in every moment of thought
Observing forms and projecting appearances as in a mirror changing again and again belongs to the worldly
Unable to transcend the distinction between subject and object which appear simultaneously in seeing the wrong view of the self appears
This obstructs the Way
Therefore the Buddha made a distinction between bodily and mental acts of worship
One should identify forms as conditioned arising from emptiness and contemplate the realm of objects as the creation of mind which arises chaotically and always pollutes the fundamental purity 
In our worldly knowing and consciousness deluded thoughts remain impure
When thoughts are shown to be empty these conditioned thoughts cease
Wherever one may reside now exert utmost effort in controlling  In this way deluded thought may be stopped
Then from moment to moment the thought that arises gradually becomes pure spontaneously
One should always practice two kinds of contemplation  and never practice one of them alone These are as follows
in knowing that  objects there is no realm of objects this constitutes gradually departing from worldly  in knowing that when we have consciousness there is no mind this constitutes gradually turning toward absolute 
If one cultivates in this way for a long time everything will become clear and all that one practices over three asaṃkhyeya kalpas  will be accomplished
The Daci jing says
The Buddha said to nanda Salutation to the Buddha nanwu fo Skt
namo stu buddhāya is the vocal sound that is denitively to the names of the buddhas
For this reason we recite Salutation to the Buddhas In the past there was a great merchant 
When a massive makara sh was about to swallow a merchants boat he recited the salutation to the Buddhas name and they all escaped the calamity
When the sh heard the Buddhas name it entertained good thoughts and gave up its body In a later rebirth the makara sh renounced the householders life and become a follower of the Buddhist path
If a person hears the Buddhas name listens to his preaching of the true Dharma and personally plants good karmic roots at the Buddhas place he or she will necessarily receive benets
The Shisong l
The Buddha said to Upāli One says  worship verbally and if one bends ones back that is designated as mental purity
When a monk gives a greeting he rises from his seat bares the right shoulder removes his shoes kneels with the right knee touching the ground and with both hands gently touches the feet of the person seated above and greets him Comment
The passage speaks of vande which is a Sanskrit word
sometimes rendered as namo or ponan
These are not correct
The original correct form is pandanvande in Chinese I worship  Some render it as guili
Gui is ones true feeling
Li is the ultimate aim of reverence 
Some give guiming  its meaning is same as nanwunamas
When li and shi agree with each other the expression of feeling is fully realized
When worldly people value namas and neglect jing and li  they show ignorance of the relationship between the original terms and their translations Why then should one add 
The buddhas will become confused and they will burst out laughing
Nanwunamas is translated in the Shanjianl
as entrusting one's life to the Enlightened One and as paying respect to great elders Henan is translated in the Zhuyao yili as paying respect reverently in the Shanjianl
it is translated as that brings salvation to oneself
To speak on the basis of these explanations since paying respect reverently and acknowledging that brings salvation to one would apply broadly to holy and worldly beings how could henan be conned only to the venerable teacher
It should be used broadly for all saintly ones that rescue living beings
In the scripture when one comes to the Buddha one gives a salutation to the One Who is Free From All Attachment Arhat who has achieved supreme enlightenment
Here one praises verbally the Tathāgatas virtues
Comment The sutras and vinayas do not speak of using a sitting mat 
They speak only of taking off ones footwear and paying respect to feet Here I examine the use of the sitting mat in light of concrete practical needs and in accordance with the principle 
The Sifen l
says To protect the body the robe and the monks bedding permitted possession of a sitting mat  Here it is made clear that is permitted for the benet of keeping ones body and robes neat and clean
The sitting mat is originally a tool used when one sits 
Therefore for worshiping one does not spread it out 
When the Tathāgata is about to sit down a mat is always spread out 
Following this practice a monk also spreads his own mat himself when he sits  He must not allow others to spread the sitting mat for him
We now see that when Indian monks arrive to worship before a buddha  they shift the lower part of the robe kneel with one knee to the ground and then kneel completely with joined palms
They verbally praise the Buddha and then perform dingli 
This is the ancient practice that still survives
We should reverently practice worship according to this model
Today when monks and nuns come before a buddha  they allow others to spread their sitting mats 
This is arrogant and falls short of reverently expressing respect
Waiting before the buddha until ones seat is set up and only then performing worshipthis too is not allowed
To rst sit down on a chair and then worshipthis also shows lack of respect
When one sees an honored elder one should quickly greet him
How could one rst look for a seat 
When seeing a king one should worship him
How could one do so while in a chair
Human kings are generally honored but do not stand high as objects of reverence
How can they be compared to a Dharma King
Even if one makes an excessive gesture of worshiping him in the end such gestures become an expression either of arrogance or laziness
Therefore the Sanqianyi jing says One should not pay respect while sitting on a seat  for Ceremony Comment
This section treats ve rituals
First I explain  removing ones footwear
This expresses extreme reverence
In this land when ministers take part in the morning audience at the court they gather in the inner courtyard and do not take off their footwear
However on certain specic occasions when they ascend and enter the palace building they remove both their swords and their footwear
This is the ancient practice not a recent invention
In India the land is large and the weather is hot
They make footwear out of leather and wear it according to regulations
When one meets a superior one takes off ones footwear
In other cold countries following this practice people wear footwear and during ceremonies they take it off to show respect
Laypeople wear shoes when they come to worship
Inside the temple precinct they do not take them off but when they come into the buddha hall they remove their footwear
Second I explain exposing one side 
The Vinaya instructs that monks should expose their right shoulder or that they should expose one shoulder or that they should expose one arm The word tan refers to exposing ones upper body
indicates that in following the study one also engages in labor
In everyday life people say If you roll up your sleeves  everything is taken care of peacefully This refers to the same thing
Today monks expose one shoulder but still wear an undershirt
This does not accord with the teaching of exposing a shoulder
The Da zhuangyan lun mentions that the right shoulders of Buddhist monks are black This refers to the practice in question
NonBuddhist are black all over their body
renunciants expose the right 
Herein lies the difference
The Vinaya allows only three robes They are all worn over the shoulders
When one sees an elder one exposes one side
To cover with clothing and still speak of exposing a shoulderthis is laughable
Thus one should know that one exposes the skin of the shoulder
This is the extreme form of paying respect
In performing ceremonies one must consider who is present
When one engages in a repentance rite or worship before the Buddha or monastic teachers one must expose ones right shoulder as an expression of reverence
If one is outside of the monastery walking through the streets one should cover the shoulder with the robe and not expose the skin
The climate of the Western Region is very hot and humid so the practice is not strange but this country is a cold place and people will laugh at monks 
Therefore the Wufenl
says In other places where in my words proves to be impure it is not a fault if one does not observe it Third I explain the gesture of showing reverence
The Vinaya says Concentrate the mind hold the ten ngers and the palms of ones hands together and worship the Lion of the ākya Clan  It also says When placing the hands together as one addresses the Buddha one forms an expression of reverence and controls the mind and does not allow it to be distracted
It is difcult to prevent the mind from becoming attached to desires  so one presses ones palms together in order to concentrate the mind Today people worship the Buddha often by holding the ngers together but they fail to hold the palms together or they hold the palms together but leave the ngers apart
This causes the mind to become arrogant and unfocused
It is better to keep the ngers apart but hold the palms together
Do not hold the ngers together while keeping the palms apart
seeking merit to the contrary you invite the fault of arrogance
Having mastered the rite of concentrating the mind and holding the palms together one must worship by touching the ground with the ve wheels of ones body 
The Dichilun says One should make the ve wheels touch the ground and worship The Ahan jing says
The two elbows and the two knees and the crown constitute the ve wheels
Wheels are round and these ve places are all round
They enable to move up and down and turn around performing meritorious deeds
Because they turn a lot they are called wheels
Today when Western monks worship they lift  to expose their knees and then touch the ground rst with their elbows
They hold their palms upward in the gesture of touching feet
Today we observe that push against the ground with two hands and place both legs behind them
The head does not touch the ground
This too constitutes arrogance
After mastering the rite of touching the ground with the ve wheels  one must learn the practice of kneeling on the right knee in the foreign style 
Scriptures often describe kneeling in the foreign style
The expressions hugui and zhangchi both refer to the Indian rite of paying respect There is nothing mysterious about them
They describe the posture of kneeling with either ones right or left knee touching the ground
This is the rite for presenting requests or expressing repentance
Fourth I explain the rite of paying respect
The Shenglun speaks of pannamei  it refers to what is called li in China
The Dazhidu lun says
There are three kinds of li 
One is called verbal greeting Note it entails simply saying henan  this is the lowest form of ceremonial greeting The second entails bending the knees but not touching the ground Note this is the middle form of ceremonial greeting The third entails touching the ground with ones head Note this is the highest form of ceremonial greeting The lowest is bending
The middle is kneeling
The highest is lowering the head to the ground
There are three ways in which bodhisattva greets the Buddha
One is discussed in the chapter on repentance the second in the chapter on joyfully redirecting merit and the third in the chapter on requesting the Buddha 
Question Is ceremonial greeting only an activity of the body or is it an activity that includes all three types of acts 
Answer It involves all three types of acts
Placing the ve wheels  on the ground is not performed well without physical action
Promoting the name and singing hymns are not performed well without the act of speech
Entertaining thoughts in the mind as if they are reected in a mirror placed in front of oneself is not performed well without mental activity
For the Buddhas eyes physical worship of the body is needed
For the gods ears verbal chanting through speech is needed
For other beings minds the mental action of thinking is needed
From the verbal activity of chanting wisdom attained through hearing is realized
From the mental activity of thinking wisdom attained through reection is realized
From the physical activity of worship wisdom attained through spiritual cultivation is realized
From the physical activity of worship the study of precepts is realized
From the mental activity of thinking the study of meditation is realized
From the verbal activity of chanting the study of wisdom is realized
In this way can be neatly explained 
Generally speaking the three kinds of study  are subsumed under the three kinds of activities
Fifth I explain distinguishing the correct and incorrect forms of worship 
The origin of this teaching on worship goes back to the beginning of the Qi period
An Indian monk called Lena observed that ordinary people here  those who live in a peripheral land are not skilled in rites and their emotions are no different from those of monkeys and horses
With compassion welling from his heart he compiled an essay on the seven kinds of worship
The text of the essay was extensive so I summarize it here
The discussion moves from the coarse to the ne treating the coarse as the incorrect form of worship and the ne as the correct
So seven levels are distinguished the emphasis is on the last three
The rst level is called the worship of an arrogant self
It is based on ones rank and lacks a sense of reverence and respect
The person is condent of his virtue and does not have the feeling of looking up to the teacher
He feels ashamed if he has to ask questions of an inferior and does not accept advice
Mentally he does not depend on the Dharma and even when he performs an act of worship his mind is preoccupied with external things moving around like a pestle going up and down without gaining anything
He performs the form but his mind does not focus on any object 
Failing to take life seriously and making light of the path his efforts are in vain
Externally he appears to be reverent but he is increasingly arrogant and deluded within
Like a man made of wood emotion is neglected
The wheels do not take part in the ritual action and the three aspects of ritual action are scattered
This is called the worship of one who is arrogant
The second level is the worship of chanting for reputation
Even though this is free of arrogance there is nothing pure in the persons thought
While roughly correct in his ritual deportment both his body and mind are deceitful in pretending to be reverent
In public he appears to be busily performing worship but when other people have gone away his body becomes lazy and his mind tired
He appears to be reverent and may offer very limited assistance but acquires little merit from this worship This is not a true offering of respect
Because it involves a combination of verbal chanting and distracted mind it is called the worship of chimingin chanting
The third level is worship with a reverent and respectful body and mind
hears and chants the Buddhas name and visualizes the Buddhas body as if the Buddha was standing in front of him endowed with all the primary and secondary marks adorned and emitting bright light
When the mental image is complete the practitioner thanks the Buddha who then rubs the crown of his head to remove sins
With this both body and mind express reverence and respect
Free of other thoughts the practitioner respectfully presents offerings His feeling of reverence knows no limit
The appears before one as a mental vision and focuses on removing ignorance
The highest and supreme goal of this form of worship is to guide gods and humans 
Its merit is great but it still falls short of realizing wisdom
often later retrogress
This is called the worship of body and mind
The fourth level is worship that produces wisdom and purity
Because it reaches the realm of the buddhas the mind of wisdom is clear and sharp and brings about deep knowledge of the Dharma realm 
Fundamentally there is no obstruction
Yet one has followed worldly conventions from the innitely distant beginning and for that reason one thinks of as existing though there is no existence and thinks of obstruction though there is no obstruction
Now one has reached the realization that ones own mind is empty and there is no obstruction
When one practices worship of the Buddha one freely achieves clear insight
To worship one Buddha is to worship all the buddhas
All the buddhas are identical with one Buddha
Because the Buddha and the Dharma body are one reality merged perfectly together to worship one buddha is to worship the entire Dharma realm
The same can be said about offerings of incense owers and other things
In worshiping the Dharma and the Sangha  one acts in the same way
In spite of the distinction between the three  in essence there is no difference
Therefore the names of the three vehicles differ but their essence which is liberation is the same So one worship is all worship all worship is one worship
Realizing access to the Three Jewels in this way all sentient beings in the three spheres the six realms of birth and the four types of birth equally form the thought of the Buddha make offerings and worship the Buddha
If one puries body and mind one is free of obstruction anywhere
As one meditates on the Buddhas realm the mind becomes clearer
If one treats each ritual gesture of greeting and rising as an act that expresses respect and recognizes the superiority  then the effect of that ritual action will be endless the karmic rewards will be unlimited
This is called worship that produces wisdom
The fth level is worship that enters everywhere in the Dharma realm
The practitioner meditates and visualizes his own body and mind as being equal to the Dharma  from the innitely distant beginning they have never been separated from the Dharma realm
He is located neither outside or inside of the Buddhas body nor outside or within himself
His essential nature is ultimately nonexistent free of increase and decrease
When he worships one Buddha now he reaches all the buddhas
His body reaches all pure stages of the three vehicles
His body pervades everywhere just as the Buddha pervades everywhere
The Dharma realm has two aspects empty and existent there are two kinds of karmic consequences primary and secondary
One presents offerings for adornment regardless of expense and as extensively as is appropriate for the circumstances
He does not leave the Dharma realm and follow his mind without obstruction
He presents both  offerings and joyfully performs the worship of bowing his head to the ground
Suppose there is a room lled with ten thousand mirrors and someone looks into one of the mirrors The image will appear in all the mirrors in that room
The body of the Buddha is more pure  than a mirror
As different gures appear one after another the mirror always reects them all and their images always appear in the mirror These images are then captured in all the other mirrors
As different images appear in the mirrors they are all separate
One body is reected everywhere in this way the same applies to the bodies of ordinary and saintly beings in all Dharma realms
Each object that is offered all contributes to the delight  and equally offered
Those who have eyes see those who dont fail to observe
If one practices and studies in this way the ritual teaching of the Dharma realm will prove greatly benecial
Therefore the Dichilun speaks of making offerings in the presence of the Buddha and making offerings without the presence of the Buddha
Making offerings without the presence of the Buddha is superior to making offerings in the presence of the Buddha because it is harder to perform successfully
Knowing that my body is contained within the Buddhas body how can I in confusion and out of delusion commit evil deeds without feeling shame
The powers and efcacy of the buddhas are equal and their names are the same
Whatever name is recited all names are recited
For example if one recites the name ākya and worships him one invites all the buddhas without exception
In India they say ākya here  we say Nengren 
How could there be any buddha who is not capable of benevolence
In India they say Amitābha here we say Wuliangshou 
How could there be any buddha who does not have a long life span
In India they say Maitreya here we say Cishi 
How could there be a buddha whose surname is not compassionate
The Dazhidu lun says The power of one buddha is equal to the power of all the buddhas
The power of all buddhas is equal to the power of one buddha 
Even if all the buddhas except for one buddha failed to teach sentient beings due to the exception of that one buddha the power and efcacy of his teaching will reach everywhere in the Dharma realm
This is called worship that enters everywhere in the Dharma realm
The sixth level is called worship of correct contemplation and sincere cultivation
This makes clear that one worships onself as the Buddha
One does not depend on another reality or another self to worship the Buddha
Why is this so
All sentient beings inherently have buddhanature namely the original enlightenment that does not make distinctions
In accordance with the Dharma realm the mechanism of dependent origination ourishes
It is through delusion that one worships only other selves 
Ones self is buddhanature but one mistakenly perceives it as evil
If one practices mistakenly in this way one turns the point of the practice upside down
Believing that ones self is extremely evil and has nothing to do with buddhanature one mistakenly worships other peoples selves and no benet will result in the end
Sentient beings are deluded even when minute amounts of goodness are activated they turn the Dharma realm and instruments of offering into the worship of other selves
From the innitely distant beginning not even one lamp one piece of incense one greeting or one meal is offered to the buddhanature of oneself
If one reects on ones own original enlightenment liberation will follow for certain
Therefore the Vimalakīrti Sutra says As you contemplate oneself as the reality contemplate the Buddha in the same way Also
Do not contemplate the Buddha do not contemplate the Dharma do not contemplate the Sangha  because one should view oneself and other selves as the same as the true essence of dharmas
Because ones mind is pure ones selfnature dwells in buddhanature
To exert power to cultivate illumination means bringing out the buddhanature  Attaining the perfect fruit through three innitely long asaṃkhyeya kalpas means attaining the perfect fruit namely buddhanature
The attainment of the marvelous goal is limited to great saintly beings yet still ordinary beings that have not mastered the sudden cultivation must understand that when traveling over long distances one must depend upon oneself
If one wishes to see buddhanature one must contemplate the Buddha of oneself the same applies to the Dharma and the Sangha The essence is one and nondual
This is called the worship of correct contemplation
The seventh level is worship of true reality beyond distinctions
In broad outline it does not differ from the previous one which still reies worship and contemplation It distinguishes self and others
Now in this worship there is no distinction between self and other
Ordinary and saintly beings are one suchness
They are the same in essence and their activities merge together into suchness that is free of distinctions
There is no difference between the ancient and the present
Seeing a buddha one honors and worships him
Seeing ordinary beings one despises and treats them arrogantly
If you think in this way you suffer from onesided attachment
Thus the Perfection of Wisdom Scripture says
The Dharma is free of distinctions The distinction between high and low is absent
This is called anuttarā samyaksaṃbodhi 
Because true reality is separate from thought it is not possible to grasp it with the mind
It is not proper to seek for it as appearance
It is not proper to worship it
It is not proper to despise it one should go beyond high and low and transcend honoring and despising
Quietude and agitation share a common source reverence and negligence are rmly equal One pacies ones mind with this understandingthis is called worship free of distinctions
The Wenshu liwen ref Rulai zhuangyan zhihui guangming ru yiqiefo jingjie jing Tc says  do not come into being nor go out of being
For this reason in worship there is no contemplation  When ordinary people shallow in understanding hear of this one worship they react by reviling it
People with superior wisdom practice freedom from distinction internally while following the cultivation of worship externally
The internal and the external t together
This is called worship of freedom from distinctions
The Zengyi ahan jing says in verse 
If one wishes to worship the Buddha of the past of the future or Even of the present one should contemplate him in the light of the emptiness of the Dharma If one wishes to worship the Buddha of the past of the future or of the present and worship many buddhas One should think in the light of the absence of self First among good deeds is worship At the beginning there were no faults empty then there is no teaching of liberation This is the meaning of worshiping the Buddha If one wishes to worship the Buddha of the future of the past One should contemplate the emptiness and inexistence of dharmas This is called the meaning of Buddha worship verses say
I worship the Three Jewels and Take refuge in the ten directions I look up and honor them This increases good fortune and removes misfortune The path of the working is unusual But in his compassion invites all to the fragrant  Both the manifest and the hidden are activated And the effects of his teaching reach everywhere Even if one is born in this land One is miraculously invited to go to the remarkable land  One receives the audience of the Buddha and attains joy and happiness
Ones fortunes are increasingly expanded The nature of the Dharma transcends dual distinctions What effect should arbitrary distinctions make When one worships once reverently and sincerely The effect pervades everywhere over an incalculably wide area Miracle Story In the Tang dynasty  Li Shanlong Li Shanlong of Pingyi Commander of the Palace Guard of the Left died suddenly during the Wude period 
The area above his heart did not turn cold but remained warm like the palm of a hand
His family did not dare bury him
After seven days he revived and told the following story
When he died he was arrested by an ofcer of the realm of the dead and taken to a government ofce
The building was very large and there were thousands of prisoners in the courtyard
Some were put in the pillory and chained others were handcuffed and shackled
They all stood facing north and they lled the courtyard
The ofcer brought Shanlong to the lower end of the court
A heavenly ofcial sat in a high chair
Guards stood by him as if he was a king
Shanlong asked the ofcer where he was and the ofcer answered This is the king  Shanlong proceeded to the bottom of the staircase
The king asked What meritorious deeds did you do while you were alive Shanlong answered Every time villagers held a vegetarian feast and a lecture I always made donations The king said What did you do yourself Shanlong answered I recite two rolls of the Lotus Sutra The king said Excellent
You may ascend the staircase Shanlong went up
At the northeastern end of the room was a high seat which looked like a lecturers seat
The king pointed to it and told Shanlong to sit on the high seat and recite the scripture
As Shanlong obediently approached the seat the king stood up and declared I request the Dharma master to come up and sit upon the seat Shanglong went up and sat
The king then sat down facing him
Shanlong opened the scripture and said The Sutra of the Lotus Blossom of the Fine Dharma roll  Introduction The king said Please come down from the seat Shanlong came down and again stood at the bottom of the staircase
As he looked back he saw that none of the prisoners remained in the courtyard
The king told Shanlong The merit of your recitation of the sutra did not only benet you
All the prisoners in the courtyard heard it and have been pardoned
How could this not be good
Now you are released and may return Shanlong bowed and took leave but after a dozen steps the king called him back saying to the ofcer Let this person visit all the hells one after another The ofcer then led Shanlong eastward
After a hundred steps or so he saw a massive iron fort
A roof covered the fort
On the side wall were numerous windows of different sizes some shaped like ullambana bowls
Shanlong saw men and women y up from the ground and go in through the windows and they did not come back out
Shanlong was puzzled and asked about this
The ofcer said This is the Great Hell
There are different sections inside corresponding to different sin
In accordance with his or her original karma each person goes to a different hell and receives punishment Hearing this Shanlong was distressed and said Praise to the Buddha  He asked the ofcer to lead him outside
At the gate of the complex he saw a large cauldron with re ablaze and boiling water
Next to it two people sat dozing
When Shanlong asked about it the two explained As our retribution we entered this boiling water
Thanks to your saying Praise to the Buddha all sinners in this hell have been given a day for rest and sleep Shanlong again said Praise to the Buddha The ofcial said There are several different government ofces which take turns carrying out government business
Now the king has released you
You had better ask the king for a note
Otherwise those in the other ofces not knowing of the pardon might arrest you again Shanlong immediately went to see the king and requested a note conrming his pardon
The king ordered a sheet of paper to be brought and he wrote a line on it
He gave it to the ofcer saying Get signatures from the the ve realms of rebirth Following this order the ofcer took Shanlong to two government sections
Each building was guarded in the same way
The ofcer sent by the king got the signatures from these government ofces
The staff at each ofce wrote one line and gave the document to Shanlong
Shanlong brought the note to the gate
Three people said to Shanlong The king released you
Would you leave something large or small for us Before Shanlong said anything the ofcer  told him This is not a condition for the kings release but these three are the messengers that arrested you before
One is master of ropes
He bound you with a red rope
One is the master of sticks
He hit your head with a stick
One is a master of bags
He sucks out your qi with a bag
Seeing that you have been released they are begging for gifts Shanlong frightened said to the three I dont know you
Please let me prepare the gifts when I return home
Only I dont know where to send them The three said Burn them under a tree near a body of water Shanlong agreed
The ofcer then took him home
Shanlong saw his relatives crying and arranging funerary implements He went into the chamber and reentered the corpse and then came back to life
Some days later he cut up paper in the shapes of money food and wine and took them himself to a place near water where he burned them
Suddenly the three people came to thank him saying We are obliged that you did not betray our trust and sent us these gifts We are grateful After saying this they disappeared
Shanlong himself told this story to the head of Zongchi Monastery who in turn related it to Tang Ling
This story comes from the Mingbao ji  Tcb ref
Ji shenzhou sanbao gantong lu Ta The Field of Merit Introduction Superiority or Inferiority and Equality From the one who attained great enlightenment and who entered nirvana  merits come to all sages Bodhisattvas and arhats promote the teachings of the latter days
They all y to numerous lands and edify  They assist and lead according to the law of conditions
If potential for receiving the teaching differs from are extremely far away from each other even if they are in the same room
If the sages salvic activities t are just as if they were face to face even if they are in different places from each other
Therefore if you follow and pay respects to a Buddhist monk your ve pure eyes will be open
If you follow and make even a small donation to  your the six pāramitās will be inexhaustible
Inferiority Just as it is said in the Youposai jie jing 
The Buddha said There are altogether three kinds of elds of merit in the world
The rst is the eld of repaying ones indebtedness the second is the eld of producing meritorious virtue and the third is the eld of giving things to the poor
The eld of repaying ones indebtedness refers to what we call parents upādhyāyas and virtuous saints 
The eld of producing meritorious virtue refers to those who have attained the Dharma of warmth up to those who have attained highest perfect enlightenment 
The eld of giving things to the poor refers to all people who suffer from poverty and are in dire straits
The Worldhonored One is referred to as the two kinds of elds 
rst is the eld of repaying indebtedness and second is the eld of producing meritorious virtue
The Dharma is also like this
The Sangha is referred to as three kinds of elds 
rst is the eld of repaying indebtedness second is the eld of producing meritorious virtue and third is the eld of giving things to the poor
Because of these causes and conditions those who have already received precepts should make offerings to the Three Treasures with sincerity
If a group of persons donate their material goods and if the eld of merit and that of the donors are all equal these two do not differ in attaining meritorious virtue
If the gift of material goods is equal to the mind and if the eld of merit is excellent attains wonderful meritorious virtue
If the eld and the mind are all inferior and yet the gift of material goods is superior however the meritorious virtue attained is wonderful
If the eld and the gift of material goods are all inferior and yet the donors mind is superior the meritorious virtue attained is also wonderful
If the eld of merit and the gift of material goods are all superior and yet the donors mind is inferior the meritorious virtue attained is not as good as 
Good sons 
When a wise person makes a donation he does not do so for the sake of reward
Because he certainly knows that this  causes him to surely obtain a reward Furthermore the Sengqiezha jing says
The Buddha told Yiqieyong Bodhisattva Suppose the trichiliocosm were lled with sesame seeds and there were as many wheelturning noble kings as there are even if someone were to make donations to wheelturning noble kings as these he is not as good as one who donates to just a single person who has attained the fruit of streamenterer of the sacred Dharma 
If someone were to donate to all people who have attained the srotaāpattiphala in the trichiliocosm the merit obtained is not as good as that of one who donates to just a single person who has attained the fruit of oncereturner 
If someone were to donate to all the people who have attained the sakṛdāgāmiphala in the trichiliocosm this is not as good as one who donates to just a single person who has attained the fruit of nonreturner 
If someone were to donate to all people who have attained the anāgāmiphala in the trichilio cosm this is not as good as one who donates to a single arhat
If someone were to donate to all arhats in the trichiliocosm this is not as good as one who donates to just a single pratyekabuddha
If someone were to donate to all pratyekabuddhas in the trichiliocosm this is not as good as one who donates to just a single bodhisattva
If someone were to donate to all bodhisattvas in the trichiliocosm this is not as good as one who gives rise to the clean pure mind in a single tathāgatas place
Even if someone were to give rise to the clean pure mind in all tathāgatas places of the trichiliocosm this is not as good as an ordinary person who hears this Buddhist teaching the latter excels the former in merit to say nothing of the case in which he reads recites and holds fast to  At that time all the people addressed the Buddha O Worldhonored One
How much capacity does a buddhas merit have The Buddha replied It is compared for example to  ne dust on the earth
If sentient beings as numerous as grains of sand in the Ganges River all become bodhisattvas of the nal  stage the merits of these bodhisattvas of the nal stage are not equal in power to a single buddhas merit Moreover the Apitan ganlouwei jing Abhidharmāmṛtarasaśāstra T
the goodness of the eld of merit There are three kinds
The rst is the eld of great virtue the second is the eld of hardships of poverty and the third is the eld of the hardships of poverty of great virtue
What do you think of the eld of great virtue
It refers to buddhas pratyekabuddhas and śramaṇas who have attained one of the four fruits of sainthood
 What do you think of the eld of hardships of poverty
It means the state of animals birth aging sickness or other 
What do you think of the eld of the hardships of poverty of great virtue
It means a sages aging sickness and other 
If you donate to the eld of great virtue with a respectful mind you will attain a great reward
If you donate to those in the eld of hardships of poverty with a compassionate mind you will attain a great reward
If you donate to those in the eld of the hardships of poverty of great virtue with a respectful and compassionate mind you will attain a great reward
These are referred to as the goodness in the eld of merit
What do you think of the goodness of sentient beings
They do not kill steal rob swindle or deceive and they make donations of pure things in accordance with more or less what one obtains
 These are referred to as the goodness of sentient beings
If you donate to the Buddha you immediately attain all merits
If you donate to the Sangha and they make use of your donation you attain all merits but if they do not make use of you do not attain all merits
If you make an offering to the Dharma you attain a great reward because of this
If someone who learns is sharp and makes an offering to the Dharma with great wisdom this refers to making an offering to the Dharma When you make a donation you obtain wealth
After donations have been received attains merit such as happiness powers or longevity which is remarkably excellent and he attains a great reward
If you donate to animals you will receive a reward for a hundred existences If you donate to an unwholesome person you will receive  for a thousand existences
If you donate to a wholesome person you will receive for ten million existences
If you donate to an ordinary person who has left behind desires you will receive a reward for as many existences as ten million times a hundred million If you donate to someone who has attained the Way you will receive for immeasurable generations
If you donate to the Buddha you will be able to reach nirvana
Furthermore there are six difculties in making donations
The rst is a donation made with arrogance
The second is a donation given in order to go after fame
The third is a donation given in order to become powerful
The fourth is a donation given by force
The fth is a donation based on motives
The last is a donation given in order to gain a reward
Moreover the Foshuo huaju tuoluoni jing Puṣpakūṭadhāraṇī T
The Buddha said Furthermore if there is someone who holds the seven treasures as large as Mount Sumeru and donates them to śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas during a kalpa is not as good as when monks and laypeople who are only able to hold a small amount of money donate it to someone who rst generates the aspiration for enlightenment 
The latter attain numerous merits
Compared to this the merit of the former case is not even onehundredth onethousandth or tenthousandth  the value of which is beyond compare and cannot be calculated The Baoliang jing says
 The Buddha said Good people
I will now explain that there are two types of people in the world who should receive donations from devotees
What are the two 
First are those who diligently practice and courageously progress 
Second are those who attain liberation
cause their donors to attain great benet There are three kinds of donations
First is to frequently donate food
Second is residential buildings for the monastics
Third is to practice a benevolent mind
Among these three meritorious deeds  a benevolent mind is the most excellent Furthermore the Pusa benxing jing says
Sudatta was a poor man who lived his life at home and had no property
When he came to believe in the Way the Buddha taught him to donate
Sudatta addressed the Buddha Shall I donate a lot or a little The Buddha told Sudatta Even if you donate a lot you will attain little reward yet if you donate only a little you will attain a large reward
Even if you were to donate much but you do not have sincerity you are highly conceited and you believe in heterodox and absurd views then you will not be able to be a straightforward person
even though you may donate much you will attain little reward It is just like the case that even if there are many seeds under the soil of an infertile eld only a few crops can be harvested
What is the case in which a donation is small and yet great merit is obtained
It is just like when even though a donation is small is happy and respectful giving without expecting a reward and donates to buddhas pratyekabuddhas śramaṇas in the four  and others
Even though the donation is small the reward one attains is great
It is just like when a fertile eld is seeded sparsely yet abundant crops are harvested Moreover the zhidu lun says
Although donating with a great compassionate mind is one and the same there is greater or lesser merit according to the superiority or inferiority of the mind
It is just like when āriputra offered a bowl of food to the Buddha
The Buddha immediately gave it to a dog then asked āriputra You offered a meal to me and I gave it to a dog
Who has attained more merit āriputra replied As I understand the signicance of the Buddhist teaching the merit the Buddha attained for giving to a dog is greater The Buddhas eld of merit is the best is not as good as that gave to the dog
For this reason we know that great merit arises from the mind it does not exist in the eld 
Even if those like āriputra make greater effort a thousand ten thousand or a hundred million times more will still not equal the Buddhas mind
Why is this
It is because the mind is ones master internally while the eld is an external matter
Sometimes the merit of a donation exists in the eld of merit
It is just as in the arhat roṇakoṭīviṃśa who offered a ower to a Buddhist stupa in the past
he enjoyed pleasure in the realms of heavenly and human beings for ninetyone kalpas and with the remaining power of that merit he attained arhatship
Moreover it is just as in King Aśoka who offered a lump of earth to the Buddha when he was a child
The king erected eighty thousand stupas in Jambudvīpa and nally attained the Way
While what he had donated was quite worthless and was given with a childs thoughtless mind the eld of merit was wonderful Therefore he attained a great reward
We should know that great merit arises from a good eld
Those who have the greatest morality mentioned above possess all three factors
a mind something  and a eld of merit which are all wonderful
It is just as  The Buddha scattered good owers for buddhas in the ten directions  Question
How can this the merit that results from a donation be increased
Answer
Just as it is stated in sutras you can increase the merit because you make a donation to meet current requirements
If you donate to a hungry person you will be able to increase the merit
Or if you donate  on a vast road or a dangerous path when him traveling to or from a distance or if you frequently make donations without ceasing or if you often think of making donations and therefore make a donation you will be able to extensively increase 
Furthermore the Zengyi ahan jing says
Those who give food to animals attain a hundred times greater merit than others
Those who give food to someone who has violated the precepts attain a thousand times more merit than others
Those who donate food to someone who observes the precepts attain ten thousand times more merit than others
Those who donate food to a hermit who has cut off desires attain ten million times more merit than others
Those who offer food to someone who is in cultivation toward the srotaāpattiphala attain innumerable merit not to mention someone who has accomplished the srotaāpattiphala or  someone who is in cultivation toward the sakṛdāgāmiphala or someone who has attained the path of the sakṛdāgāmiphala up to those such as one who has attained the anāgāmiphala an arhat a pratyekabuddha and a tathāgata
The meritorious virtue  is beyond praise and calculation
Again the zhidu lun says
It is just like a painter who lived in Puṣkarāvatī City in Dayueshi kingdom
His name was Karṇa
 He went to Takṣaśilā in the east
 As a visitor he painted for twelve years and obtained thirty taels of gold
Taking  he returned to his home country
Then he heard the sound of the drumbeat to call a great assembly in Puṣkarāvatī
He went and saw numerous monks
He had clean and pure faith 
Then he asked a Buddhist deacon How much is required for a days worth of meals for this many  The Buddhist deacon answered Thirty taels of gold are necessary to obtain a days worth of meals  then gave the Buddhist deacon all thirty taels of the gold he possessed Please provide a days worth of meals on my behalf
I will come back tomorrow returned home emptyhanded
wife asked him What did you get from working for twelve years He replied I obtained thirty taels of gold She then asked Where is the gold He answered  has already become a seed in the eld of merit His wife said What is the eld of merit He answered It is a donation to the Sangha His wife then bound her husband and took him to a government ofce to investigate his crime and adjudicate the matter
A ranking ofcial asked  What is the matter The wife said My husband is idiotic
He gave away all thirty taels of gold he had obtained from working for twelve years without showing compassion for his own wife and children
Therefore just as it is instituted in the government ofce I bound him and brought him here The ranking ofcial asked her husband  Why did you not provide for your wife and children but give it away to others replied I did not make merit in my previous existence
I suffer from poverty and have undergone various hardships in my present existence
In this life I have encountered the eld of merit
If I do not plant merit I will once again live in poverty in a later existence
I will continue to live in poverty lifetime after lifetime and will have no chance to escape from 
I now wish to immediately let go of suffering from poverty
For this reason I donated all my gold to the Sangha The ranking ofcial was a Buddhist layman and had pure faith in the Buddha
After hearing words he praised him This is considered to be very difcult
You obtained this small amount of material wealth by working diligently despite hardships and you donated it all to the monks
You are a good man then removed a necklace of precious stones from his body which he gave to the poor along with the horse he rode on as well as a village
He told  You donated to the Sangha for the rst time The monks have not yet eaten
This is because the millet has not been planted although the buds are already starting to form
A great reward awaits you in a future existence For this reason it is said that if you donate everything you have obtained despite hardship the merit is the greatest
According to the Dazhuangyan lun 
If you take the eld of merit you must take the element of virtue
You should not choose on the basis of the young and energetic or the old and weak
The Buddha said I heard at one time in the past that there was a donor who sent a Buddhist monk of his acquaintance to visit a Buddhist monastery and invite many monks
however asked only for the old and did not invite the young
Later his acquaintance the monk invited all the monks Subsequently novices arrived but they were not needed
The novices asked Why do you not need us replied The donor does not need you
It is not my intention The monk who begged for alms then said in verse The old have virtue earned in a previous existence
They are whitehaired and have wrinkles on their faces They have long eyebrow hair and they are toothless Their backs are bent and the joints of their bones are crooked The donor is fond of like this And he is not happy to see the young
At that time all the novices of the monastery were arhats
They all made this statement That donor is foolish and unintelligent
He is not fond of the virtuous and merely wants the old They then said in verse What is called an elder is Not necessarily one who is whitehaired wrinkled and toothless is foolish and unintelligent Who is esteemed is one who can cultivate merit Remove and leave behind all evils And purely perform moral practices This is what is considered to be an elder We do not give rise to a mind of uctuations In praise and censure We however cause that donor To receive a sin and a fault Moreover he slanders the Sangha the eld of merit And produces uctuations
We should swiftly go to that donor Cause him to give rise to the aspiration for enlightenment And cause him to not fall into the evil realms All the novices will soon transform To old gures Through supernatural powers Being whitehaired with wrinkled faces Longhaired eyebrows and toothless With bent backs supported by a cane They will go to that donors house The donor sees them And produces great joy in his mind He burns incense and scatters beautiful owers And quickly asks them to take a seat When in an instant They restore their gures as novices The donor is astonished Their transformation is just like this Because of drinking heavenly nectar Their features suddenly change
At that time the novices said We are neither yakṣa demons nor rākṣasa demons
Previously we saw that you our donor prefered the old and you produced a uctuating thought of the Sangha the eld of merit thereby destroying your wholesome root
Therefore we transformed in this way and caused you to repent They then said in verse
It is just as if with a mosquitos beak You wish to empty the ocean to the bottom In the world there is no one who can survey The meritorious virtue of the Sangha All of the people have no competence To assess the meritorious virtue of a Buddhist monk Not to mention the case where you alone wish to assess it Have you not heard  Four Things of Which You Should Not Make Light Spoken by the Tathāgata
 princes snakes res or novices
Just like the āmara fruit there are things that from the outside appear ripe yet on the inside they are unripe or the outside is unripe yet the inside is ripe
Do not judge recklessly the good or bad of your predecessors
Even in a momentary thought you can attain the Way
Do not give rise to discriminative thoughts of the Sangha the eld of merit They then said in verse The sea of the Sanghas meritorious virtue No one can survey
The Buddha still gives rise to joy and respect And praises you personally with a hundred verses Not to mention all other people Should they not admire you In a vast fertile eld A few seeds can produce abundant crops Therefore to the Sangha Regardless of old and young You should offer with the mind of equality You should not give rise to discriminative thoughts
At that time the donor on hearing these words was overcome with goosebumps
He prostrated his body praying for mercy and repenting Verses say In order to be led to the four fruits Understand the six sense organs thoroughly The search for what is profound awakens you Testify truth and recollect a good omen Old and young are on friendly terms They are all respectful prudent and sincere They go together following the law of conditions They assist and lead you to the deep and profound world
Taking Refuge and Believing in  Introduction Minor Sincerity and Great Sincerity Faith is the origin of the Way and the mother of meritorious virtue
Wisdom is the foundation of transcending the world and leading to emancipation
One who has no faith cannot board even a small boat
One who is unintelligent cannot cut off even small delusions
This way  is evident rising and setting can be seen
I frequently see ignorant people who do not believe in the law that karma is able to cause retribution or reward
They think that poverty or wealth is spontaneous joy and sorrow are natural temperaments beauty or ugliness does not stem from forbearance or anger and the noble or the humble is not concerned with being discreet or lazy
All sentient beings personally feel that they may be compared to grass and trees that good or bad is spontaneous and how these might be derived from causes
We now rely on Buddhist sutras which are not the same as those of nonBuddhist teachings
consider that poverty or wealth derives entirely from karmic conditions noble or humble is not concerned with fate lack of intelligence is not a mere variation of thinking and beauty or ugliness is not a mere physical variant
Therefore sutras say Reward and retribution beauty and ugliness are determined by karma The Book of History says Fate and good or bad fortune are suspended in Heaven  On this account it is said that among soldiers and civilians the people who are poor in karma are given and yet do not attain it and those whose outer appearance indicates wealth are certainly assured to be continually wealthy
Formerly Emperor Wen of the Han dynasty favored Deng Tong because in a dream
A physiognomist divined Tongs fortune  will starve to death in poverty The emperor said I am able to make him rich
Why do you say he will in poverty gave a copper mine and let him freely smelt ore
Later met with a mishap ed and died of starvation in someone elses house
 Furthermore a maidservant of King Yeongpumni became pregnant
A physiognomist divined fortune  is noble and must become a king The king said He is not my descendent and intended to kill the baby
The maidservant said The energy came down from Heaven and therefore I have become pregnant When the baby was born the king thought that he was inauspicious
was thrown into a sty where the hogs warmed him with their exhaled air
Then he was abandoned in a stockpen where the horses suckled him
So he survived and at last he became the king of Puyo
Therefore we know that karmic conditions and fate are determined at the beginning of the obscure state in which nothing has been embodied
They are not changed after all and they cannot be given or taken away
Accordingly it is known that to do good is to attain merit and to do evil is to receive misfortune karma and its effects is infallible This law is clear
How can you remain obscured by ignorance harbor delusions and not be awakened
Moreover at the time of Wu Ding in the past two kinds of mulberry trees grew in the imperial court of Bo 
The Grand Scribe divined and said If wild plants grow in the imperial court the dynasty will fall Wu Ding was frightened He lived cautiously in apprehension and cultivated wholesomeness
The mulberry trees withered away
 The way of the Shang dynasty was restored
Isnt this because that to do good causes good fortune
Furthermore at the time of Di Xin  a sparrow gave birth to a crow in a corner of the city
 The Grand Scribe divined and said Because the small gave birth to the large the state will be surely prosperous Di Xin was arrogant and cruel and he did not govern well
Consequently the Shang dynasty fell
Isnt this because that to do evil causes misfortune
In this way books of history introduce numerous in detail
How can you obstinately reject and oppose the classics and in history books
The people of the world all witness that when a seed is sown in the spring the are collected and stored in winter If you donate you will obtain a reward in the future
If you feel you are pregnant give away the money that is in your palm
Your virtue will surely be revealed and a reward will come to you just as held a pearl in its mouth and gave it  and a deer  carried him on its back
 Again formerly a person rescued someone from starvation  a ladle  and he was rewarded with the supporting wheel mark
Now a purication assembly is offered in order to allow for donations to the bhikṣu sangha
How could there be no happiness and reward
Just as the Buddha says in the Nirvāṇasūtra  there are two types of sentient beings
those who have faith and those who lack faith
Those who have faith are called ones who can be saved
They will surely attain nirvana
It is because they have no ulcers and warts 
Those who lack faith are called icchantikas or ones who cannot be saved
Furthermore in the Za ahan jing  for the sake of a brahman the Worldhonored One speaks in verse on cultivation of the eld One who takes faith as a seed Asceticism as timely rains Wisdom as a plough or a yoke and The sense of shame as the shafts of a carriage And who protects oneself with mindfulness is The tamer of humans
That person comprehends bodily and verbal acts Recognizes where he or she eats and keeps it in mind He or she considers truth to be of what he or she really avails himself or herself Pleasant life to be an indolent breath and Diligence to be the rejection of negligence He or she advances quickly and peacefully Goes straight ahead without falling back And is able to reach the place of no anxiety One who cultivates the eld in this way Will come to attain the nectar fruit One who cultivates the eld in this way Will not turn back and will receive all that exists At that time the brahman on hearing this awakened the aspiration for enlightenment renounced the world and attained arhatship
Moreover the baoxing lun says
For the sake of the six kinds of people the Three Treasures are explained
First is the Tamer of Humans  second is the Dharma of the Tamer of Humans and third are the disciples of the Tamer of Humans
What are the six kinds of people
First are those of the Mahayana second are those of the pratyekabuddha vehicle third are those of the Hinayana fourth are those who believe in the Buddha fth are those who believe in the Dharma and sixth are those who believe in the Sangha
Furthermore the Sengqiezha jing says
At that moment Yiqieyong Bodhisattva addressed the Buddha O Worldhonored One
By what causes and conditions can all sentient beings of this assembly awaken the aspiration for bodhi The Buddha replied O Yiqieyong
In the past incalculable kalpas ago there was a buddha a worldhonored one called Baode 
I was a boy at that time
The sentient beings of this assembly are those who abide in the Buddhas wisdom
Formerly they all existed in the realm of deer
Then I made a vow that I would cause all the deer to completely abide in the Buddhas wisdom
At that moment shortly after the deer heard this they all made a vow and attained  O Yiqieyong
The masses of this assembly should attain highest perfect enlightenment on the basis of the wholesome faculty of that time Moreover the Zhengfanian jing Saddharmasmṛtyupasthāna T
If sentient beings cultivate wholesomeness take refuge with a clean and pure mind in the Buddha Dharma and Sangha and if they do not give rise to other thoughts for a time as long as it takes to clap ones hands ten times they will be reborn in the white maṇi heaven after death
With the ve desires they will give rein to passion and they will be happy and cheerful in their minds and thoughts
The merits attained from taking refuge in the Three Treasures will lead them to the exhaustion of retribution
They will be able to reach nirvana in a future existence
Furthermore the Wushangchu jing says The Buddha told the bhikṣus There are three highest places
First the Buddha is the highest place
Second the Dharma is the highest place
Third the Sangha is the highest place
If all sentient beings who have either two legs four legs no legs or many legs if they have form or no form if they have thoughts or no thoughts or if they are neither those who have thoughts nor those who have no thoughts the Tathāgata will speak about the highest places among them
If there are those among sentient beings who awaken faith and have aspiration in these highest places they will attain the highest reward in the realm of heavenly beings Just as the Chusheng putixin jing says
At that time the brahman Kāśyapa addressed the Buddha O Worldhonored One
How much merit should those who give rise to the aspiration for enlightenment have The Buddha replied in verse
If all sentient beings of this buddha land are caused To abide in faith and to observe the precepts The collection of supreme great merits attained through this are Not equal to onesixteenth of the aspiration for bodhi  If all sentient beings of this buddha land are caused To abide in faith and to practice the Dharma The collection of supreme great merits attained through this are Not equal to onesixteenth that of the aspiration for bodhi If in all buddha lands as numerous as grains of sand in the Ganges River All beings build temples because they seek merit And they erect various stupas as large as Mount Sumeru are Not equal to onesixteenth that of the aspiration for bodhi If there are buddha lands as numerous as grains of sand in the River Where everyone donates all seven treasures The collection of supreme great merits attained through this are Not equal to onesixteenth that of the aspiration for bodhi If immeasurable stupas as tall and vast as Cakravāḍaparvata Are erected for the sake of all buddhas And sentient beings seek merit in this way The collection of supreme great merits attained through this are Not equal to onesixteenth that of the aspiration for bodhi If all sentient beings have for a full kalpa Or if they always carry it on their heads and shoulders The collection of supreme great merits attained through this are Not equal to onesixteenth that of the aspiration for bodhi Those who in this way Attain the wonderful Dharma If they seek bodhi and benet other sentient beings They are the most excellent among sentient beings There is no one to compare with themhow could there be anyone above them Therefore when people are able to hear these various teachings The wise people always give rise to a wish for the Dharma in their minds One should obtain boundless great merit And promptly attain a testimony in the highest path Furthermore the Nirvāṇasūtra says
The Buddha praised Kāśyapa If there are sentient beings who awaken the aspiration for enlightenment at all buddhas places as numerous as grains of sand in the Hiraṇyavatī River then in the evil world they will be able to hold fast to a sutra like this and will not give rise to slander
Good man if there are those who awaken the aspiration for enlightenment at the places of all buddhas and worldhonored ones as numerous as the grains of sand in a single Ganges River then later in the evil world they will be able to not slander this sutra and to be happily fond of this scripture and yet they will be unable to discern and explain it at length for others
If there are sentient beings who awaken the aspiration for enlightenment at buddhas places as numerous as the grains of sand in two Ganges Rivers then later in the evil world they will be able to not slander this Dharma
They will correctly understand happily believe in hold fast to and read it aloud and yet they will be unable to explain it at length for other people
If there are sentient beings who awaken the aspiration for enlightenment at buddhas places as numerous as the grains of sand in three Ganges Rivers then later in the evil world they will be able to not slander this Dharma
They will hold fast to read aloud and copy the sutra scrolls
Although they will be able to explain it for other people they will not understand the profound meaning
If there are sentient beings who awaken the aspiration for enlightenment at buddhas places as numerous as the grains of sand in four Ganges Rivers then later in the evil world they will be able to not slander this Dharma
They will hold fast to read aloud and copy the sutra scrolls
They will explain onesixteenth of the meaning at length for other people
Even though they will deliver a speech it will still be incomplete If there are sentient beings who awaken the aspiration for enlightenment at buddhas places as numerous as the grains of sand in ve Ganges Rivers then later in the evil world they will be able to not slander this sutra
They will hold fast to and read it aloud
They will explain at length eightsixteenths of the meaning for others
If there are those who awaken the aspiration for enlightenment at buddhas places as numerous as the grains of sand in six Ganges Rivers then later in the evil world they will be able to not slander this sutra They will hold fast to and read it aloud
They will explain twelvesixteenths  of the meaning at length for other people
If there are those who awaken the aspiration for enlightenment at buddhas places as numerous as the grains of sand in seven Ganges Rivers then later in the evil world they will be able to not slander this Dharma They will hold fast to and read it aloud
They will explain fourteensixteenths of the meaning at length for other people
If there are those who awaken the aspiration for enlightenment at buddhas places as numerous as the grains of sand in eight Ganges Rivers then later in the evil world they will be able to not slander this Dharma They will hold fast to and read it aloud
They will also exhort other people and cause them to be able to copy it
They will be able to listen to and receive it for themselves
They will also exhort other people and cause them to be able to hear and receive it Furthermore the Dabei jing says
The Buddha said to nanda If there is a sentient being who awakens faith at various buddhas places one of good faculty like this will not be defeated and overthrown after all not to mention one who has various other good faculties
For instance suppose a man breaks off and divides a piece of hair into a hundred pieces
He takes one of hair and moistens it with a drop of water
Then he brings to me and says I entrust this water to you Gautama
Do not cause this water to increase or decrease
Do not cause wind to violently blow or the sun to dry up this water either
Do not cause birds and beasts to drink it up
Do not mix it with other water
Keep it in a container and do not put it on the ground At that time I the Tathāgata immediately received the entrusted water and placed it in the Ganges River where I did not allow  to enter and whirl about
I did not cause other things to brush against it or break into it either
In this way the water drop stayed in the great river followed the current and left is not allowed to enter and whirl about and again nothing obstructs it
No birds and beasts can drink it up either
In this way the water drop neither increases nor decreases
It is all the same as it has always been
Together with a great amount of water it gradually ows into an ocean
The water drop is like this at the time when a very strong wind called vairam bhaka blows at the destruction of the world
If this person lives in the world for a kalpa and I am also able to live in this way for a kalpa at the time when the kalpa comes to an end he approaches me and says O Gautama
Presently do you have the water I formerly entrusted to you At that time I the Tathāgata know that his water drop stayed in the ocean
I see and know where it is
It is not mixed with other water
It has neither increased nor decreased It is the same as it has always been I retrieve it and return it to that person
O nanda
In this way the Tathāgata Arhat Perfectly Enlightened One has great supernatural powers and immeasurable insights and thoughts He clearly understands without hindrance
Among those who received the entrustment he is the most esteemed and the most eminent
Even if what the Buddha is entrusted with is only a tiny amount a drop of water like this it lasts a long time and is never depleted
The signicance of this should be known
O nanda
That tiny piece of hair can be compared to the mind and consciousness
The Ganges River can be compared to the transmigration of birth and death
The water drop is compared to a very small amount of the wholesome faculty to awaken the aspiration for enlightenment
The ocean is compared to the Buddha the Tathāgata Arhat Perfectly Enlightened One
The man who entrusted is compared to those such as laypeople  brahmans wealthy people of virtue and lay believers 
The duration of one kalpa is compared to the time the Tathāgata received that entrusted water to the time it is found not depleted after all and it is also equivalent to the period that that water drop entrusted by that man lasted a long time without being depleted even a bit
Thus nanda if in the Buddhas place a person gives rise to faith he will not lose the wholesome faculty and needless to say all other excellent subtle wholesome faculties
I say that this person completely advances toward the fruition of nirvana
Even if he were to fall into the three evil realms because of remaining unwholesomeness since the Buddha knows they have the original wholesome faculty  pulls them out from there and places them on the fearless shore
causes them to remember the wholesome faculty that they have planted to stop all suffering and to attain all joy Furthermore the Foshuo wuwein
jing  says  At that time King Ajātaśatru had a daughter called Aśokadattā who was incomparably upright and who had attained the most excellent and extremely subtle virtue
She had just turned twelve years old She was seated in the imperial palace of her father the king wearing shoes made of gold and jewels
Once the girl Aśokadattā saw various śrāvakas but she did not stand up and go out in person to meet them
She remained silent and did not join them to have a conversation
She did not welcome worship or yield a seat to them
King Ajātaśatru seeing that Aśokadattā remained silent immediately asked her How can you not know that these people are all ākyamuni Tathāgatas leading disciples who have attained the great Dharma and that they are all the eld of merit in the secular world
Because they have compassionate thoughts for all sentient beings they go begging for alms
Now you have already seen them
Why didnt you stand up go swiftly to meet them worship them commit to asking questions together with me and yield a seat to them You see them now
Why do you not stand up and go out to meet them At that moment Aśokadattā replied to her father the king I am not liable to conviction Great King
Have you more or less seen or heard that when a wheelturning noble king sees various minor kings he stands up to go out in person to meet them The king said No again asked Have you more or less seen or heard that when a lion the king of animals sees a fox stands up and goes out in person to meet  The king answered No asked again Have you more or less seen or heard that akradevānāmindra goes out in person to meet other heavenly beings The king replied No Have you more or less seen or heard that the ocean god respectfully worships the god of rivers and ponds The king answered No His daughter said O Great King
It is just like this
The bodhisattva who awakens the aspiration for bodhi and who practices for highest perfect enlightenment is the wheelturning noble king
I have awakened this aspiration with great benevolence
Why should I respectfully worship śrāvakas minor kings who leave behind great benevolence
O Great King
Are there many cases where a lion the king of animals that has completed seeking the highest Way of right perfect enlightenment worships beings like the foxes of the Hinayana school
Are there many cases where someone who intends to reach the sea of great wisdom and who wishes to seek the good knowledge of the collection of the great Dharma seeks out śrāvakas who are following the tracks of a cow 
O Great King
If someone is intimate with a śrāvaka that person will awaken the aspiration for the śrāvaka mind
If someone is close to a pratyekabuddha that person will awaken the aspiration for the pratyekabuddha mind
If someone is intimate with one of right true perfect enlightenment that person will awaken the aspiration for the mind of highest perfect enlightenment At that time King Ajātaśatru said again to his daughter Aśokadattā You are extremely arrogant
The reason I say this is because when you see various śrāvakas you do not respectfully welcome them The daughter replied O Great King
Please do not make such a statement
You Great King are haughty too
The reason I say so is that you do not receive people of great poverty into Rājagṛha The king told his daughter They are not of my class
Why do I have to receive them The daughter said O Great King
I a bodhisattva on the rst stage am just like this too
All śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas are not in my class either The king said to his daughter Havent you seen that all bodhisattvas entirely respect all sentient beings The daughter replied O Great King
Bodhisattvas liberate all sentient beings from arrogance and anger and cause them to be able to give rise to the mind of transferring their merit to others
Therefore to respect with courtesy all sentient beings is to increase the various foundations of their wholesome roots
For this reason respect with courtesy  At that time Aśokadattā Bodhisattvas mother called Moonlight went to the Buddhas place with King Ajātaśatru
The Buddha said This lady Moonlight will be reborn in Trāyastriṃśa Heaven after giving up her present body and she will be called the Son of Heaven Powerful Light 
In this way when Maitreya attains enlightenment   he will promptly renounce the world
He will see all the buddhas of the auspicious kalpa one by one and will be able to make offerings to all of them
Afterward at the place of Ligou Tathāgata he will be able to become a great king who completely possesses the seven treasures and he will be called Dharaṇiṃdharo 
 After making an offering to the buddha of that time he will attain highest perfect enlightenment and will be called Bianguang  Tathāgata Verses say Covered by delusion we are ignorant for a long time
Lingering and hiding within a dream The delements of our mind have not been completely washed away We are afraid of receiving the benet of nectar juice The light emitted from the kindly face Illuminates us just as if we are seeing the morning sun Suddenly we come across a virtuous friend Who educates and enlightens us And who increases mystic light We have gradually awakened Our mind is clear and calm We come to detest secular life is vast and expansive without boundary The Buddhist laypeople are all respectful Buddhist monks are lofty too Those who see them are happy They take refuge in them and go to a seminary the Buddhist Way If we believe in heterodox and absurd What misfortune will we suffer from in the future
Miracle Stories Dharma Master Zhu  a śramaṇa of the Jin dynasty who resided in Guiji was very close to Wang Hengzhi of Beizhong
Together they discussed issues of birth and death evil acts and meritorious deeds as well as reward and retribution but these issues were indistinct and difcult to clarify and they could not ascertain whether or not there are such things
Accordingly they came to make an agreement that the one who died rst should report to the other one 
Later they were separated from each other and Wang Hengzhi lived in the metropolis
he unexpectedly saw Dharma Master coming there Wang asked with surprise O upādhyāya
Where did you come from replied I passed away on a certain day
The relation between evil acts and meritorious deeds is not entirely groundless It is just as a shadow follows form and sound follows voice
You my donor should diligently practice the Way in order to promote and save your spirit
Since I formerly promised you  I came to report this to you When Zhu had nished speaking he disappeared
Yuan Bing of the Song dynasty whose pseudonym is Shunhuan was a man from Chen prefecture 
He became the Director of Linxiang in the last year of the Taishi era 
A long time later after his death his friend Sima Xun quite early in the morning saw in the borderland between sleeping and waking that Yuan Bing had come to say that they had separated from each other for a long time and he inquired after 
Then told Xun When we used to discuss making a resolution we often said Living is a series of rushing and death is rest Today I found out for the rst time that this is surely not the case
My constant worry when I was in this world was that some people are eagerly engaged in striving after moneymaking and giving presents to each other
Even in the other world the situation is just like this Xun asked  What are the facts of the relationships between evil or meritorious deeds and retribution or reward Bing answered As far as I previously saw the facts do not always tally with the teaching expounded in the sutras
is simply the account of the Sage who tries to restrain 
As far as I see now the great law of good and evil is in brief not different from 
Surely the destruction of life is still the heaviest prohibition
Therefore you must be careful and should not violate  Xun said Your instruction of this with corroborative evidence is truly and unspeakably appreciated
I should report it to the Imperial Secretary Bing said Very good
Please send my good regards to the Imperial Secretary at the same time At that time Minister of Works Lord Wang  Jianmu was the Imperial Secretary of the Ministry of Personnel
Both Bing and Xun had been members of his staff
Therefore they mentioned 
They exchanged many hundreds of words
When was about to leave Xun said We have been separated from each other for a long time
I always wished to get together and talk with you but it is very difcult for us to meet each other
Cant you stay a little bit longer Bing replied I just stopped by for a short time
I cannot make a long visit
Moreover I am not allowed to tell this kind of story completely Thereupon left
At rst Bing came at night yet for some reason or another Xun could clearly see 
When Bing was leaving Xun got down from his bed to see him off
As put on his clogs it was still dark
Xun saw in the space between Bings legs a light about one chi long  which shone upon legs too
It was said that the rest of the place was still totally dark
In the Sui dynasty there was Shi Daoxian at Zhulin Temple on Mount Guan kou of the Shu region 
He was originally from Kangju and had taken up peddling as his occupation
He plied in the Wu and Shu regions  and accumulated pearls and valuables worth a hundred thousand guan
 Later he arrived at Mount Niutou of Zizhou  where he came across a monk who was preaching the Dharma deeply awakened Therefore he immediately threw all of the money he had accumulated into a large river
He then joined Zhulin Temple on Mount Guankou and renounced the world
On the day he took the tonsure at the beginning he made an oath to all  Until I attain the Way I vow that I will not leave the mountain He made a resolution to not live in the community he stayed in the elds with the birds and beasts
Once he sat down in meditation he took ve days as a period 
If a visitor arrived at his gate he was secretly aware of it promptly awoke  and stood up talk with the visitor
When there was no visitor he sat up straight in the meditation room  as quiet as the empty sky Sometimes he notied others beforehand Tomorrow I will accept the guests who are coming
There will be a certain number of them the appearance of the guests and the colors of their clothes exactly Next day as had been expected arrived
Their number and their clothes were all just as 
At one time there was a severe drought
Farmers were fearful terried and anxious about the crops turning pale with worry
They all came and begged to pray for rain
xian immediately went to the cave of a dragon knocked on its door with his cane and shouted The sentient beings 
 Why do you spend hours in idle slumber He spoke like this The dragon quickly woke up
Then dark clouds gathered from the four directions and a heavy rain fell everywhere The people relied on this benet
People of all ranks and classes vied with each other in admiring  just as they did the heavenly gods
Xiu the king of Shu of the Sui dynasty was responsible for the garrison in the area of Mount Min 
Someone informed the king I looked for and dispatched to summon him  but he did not accept the order at all The king became angry and changed his countenance
He personally led troops to go and arrest 
Certainly if rmly disobeys me he should be executed xian heard the soldiers arrive but he acted audaciously as if there were no one else around
He covered himself with a saṃghāṭī robe and sat straight up meditating and chanting 
When the king arrived at the foot of the mountain he unexpectedly encountered a rainfall
Snow mixed with hail poured down on him thunder roared and oodwaters gushed and lled the river in an instant
The helpless corps was enveloped  and were afriad that they would die
As found himself aficted and in a predicament he repented and took refuge in worshiping xians virtue from a distance
The hanging clouds suddenly scattered and the mountain path became clear and smooth so that the king and his troops could reach xians place
The king fully paid respect to in person wholeheartedly took refuge in him and repented 
xian preached the Dharma for  who gave rise to faith again
Then politely and respectfully invited  and he returned with to Chengdu 
They arrived at Jingzhong Temple where was cordially worshiped revered by all the people of the city
He was known as cārya xian
During the Renshou era he returned to his mountain temple where he died and was buried
Men and Women Secular Men and Secular Women Introduction Admonition for Secular People and Exhortation and Guidance As for laypeople there are two types superior and inferior
One is noble and the other is humble one is rich and the other is poor
People of wealth and high position are mostly selfindulgent
They are haughty overbearing and conceited and they despise and humiliate others and maltreat their subordinates
Some people taking advantage of authority and the inuence of their native place esteem themselves and maltreat others
Some people who are erudite and intelligent relying on their natural abilities maltreat others
Some people who are eloquent speak smooth words yet maltreat others
Some people who are proud of themselves are extremely arrogant disrespectful to others and maltreat them
Some people who are goodlooking maltreat others on the basis of their appearance
Some people who ride wellfed and swift horses maltreat others who must rely on riding 
Some people who have wealth and servants maltreat others on the basis of their wealth
Cases like these are numerous it is impossible to completely explain them all
Sentient beings are foolish and ignorant they are greatly pitiable
They are unaware that the impermanence is about to visit them
They recklessly give rise to haughtiness
In the future a retribution just like being boiled in hot water over a charcoal re awaits them
The wardens of hell take spears in their hands waiting a long time for the day to come
are not concerned about this matter and they are openly very joyful
How different are they from hogs and sheep who do not know that they are about to be slaughtered
How different are they from ies that greedily feast on a corpse
Thinking of ancient and present times wealthy and noble people are numerous
Birth and death come alternately The noble and the humble are the same as dust
Wealth and high position are merely like abandoned graves that we see
Humble and destitute circumstances are already the same as dirt
If we all know that the noble and the humble are the same as ashes then we must be humble ourselves and respect our seniors Therefore intimacy and remoteness have nothing denite
Being noble or humble is not permanent
Joy and sorrow change positions and the rise and fall alternate with each other
The Garland Sutra says There are ten kinds of arrogant acts that we must avoid
First if in the places of respectable elds of merit such as upādhyāyas ācāryas parents śramaṇas and brahmans one does not venerate and worship them or make offerings to them this is an arrogant act
Second there are various Dharma teachers who have attained the excellent and subtle Dharma who know the path out of the transmigration of birth and death in the profound Dharma of the Mahayana who have attained dhāraṇīs who have attained the status of the learned who possess the repository of wisdom and who can skillfully expound the Dharma
If one fails to faithfully receive  respect them and make offerings to them this is an arrogant act
Third at the time of listening to and receiving the Dharma when one hears the profound Dharma he should arouse the mind to leave behind desires and to be immeasurably happy
If however one does not praise the Dharma teacher who causes people to be happy this is an arrogant act
Fourth if one gives rise to selfconceit is proud of oneself makes little of others does not examine the reality of oneself and does not regulate his own mind this is an arrogant act
Fifth if one gives rise to the mind of comparing himself with others whenever he sees a person of virtue and wisdom he does not praise that person for his goodness
Whenever he sees a person of no virtue on the contrary he speaks of the goodness of that person
When he hears  praise someone else his mind is lled with envy toward that person This is an arrogant act
Sixth suppose there is a Dharma teacher who knows that this is the Dharma this is the Vinaya this is reality and this is the Buddhas word yet if he says out of jealous hatred that it is not the Dharma not the Vinaya not reality and not the Buddhas word
Since he intends to ruin other peoples faith this is an arrogant act
Seventh suppose someone sits on the raised seat to give exposition in person and that person says I am a Dharma teacher
I should not carry out temple business I need not respect other people and make offerings to them
Older and virtuous people who cultivate various pure practices all must respect and make offerings to me then this is an arrogant act
Eighth who leaves far behind seeing others with scorn or evil eyes and who always equally observes sentient beings with a peaceful countenance
His words are gentle and he has no ferocity or rudeness He leaves behind vehement hatred
If however one were to look for the faults of that Dharma teacher this is an arrogant act
Ninth someone is lled with selfconceit and does not go to the learned respect them and begin to listen to the Dharma
He puts obstacles in the path of his cultivation
Neither does he inquire what wholesomeness is what unwholesomeness is what actions should be taken what actions should not be taken what acts benet all sentient beings during the long night of spiritual darkness  what conduct is not of benet to sentient beings what conduct causes one to enter from brightness to brightness and what conduct causes one to enter from darkness to darkness
This kind of person drifts and sinks due to his own mind and he or she cannot get a chance to see the right path out of the transmigration of birth and death
This is an arrogant act
Finally suppose that someone giving rise to selfconceit does not meet all buddhas and has difculties in attaining the Dharma
He exhausts the wholesome faculty he had planted in his previous existences
He speaks what he should not is stung by conscience and further makes ridiculous arguments with others
If he abides in the Dharma in this way he must enter wrong ways
Out of the power of his aspiration for enlightenment however he does not permanently give up the bodhisattva practices
Yet even though he does not give up the way of bodhisattva he does not meet a buddha for innumerable kalpas not to mention get a chance to listen to the Dharma
This is an arrogant act
Furthermore verses in the Chuyao jing say
Sentient beings are bound by their haughtiness They are polluted by selfconceit They are deluded in their views They cannot escape from the limits of birth and death
 Therefore it is known that if ordinary people do evil even if only to a small degree this will later result in serious suffering such people will receive endless retribution
It is just as when there is poison in the mind Peoples thoughts differ from each other
Laypeople engage in ordinary life without ever concerning themselves about death
Nevertheless life cannot be maintained and death visits us all surely and suddenly
This sudden danger of life can happen at any moment
A tragedy will soon occur nothing is permanent
vainly cultivate their lands adorn their houses and are deeply attached to their spouses and children
The Faju yu jing says When the Buddha was staying in rāvastī there was a brahman in the city
was nearly eighty years old and possessed great wealth
By nature it was difcult for him to be edied
He did not have knowledge of the right path and its virtue nor did he have the contemplation of the impermanence 
He was constructing a good residence with a front hall a rear hall a balcony a heated room and small rooms around a main building on both the east and west sides which were several tens of beams long
Only the sunshades in front of the rear hall had not yet been completed
At that time the brahman always managed himself he directed and instructed all matters 
The Buddha looked on this elder with his great insight  His life will come to an end before the end of today He must go to the next life
Yet he cannot be aware of this in person and just now hurriedly manages 
He has no merit in his spirit
He is quite pitiable Together with nanda the Buddha arrived at the gate
questioned the elder Are you not fatigued
You are now building this house
What are you planning The elder replied The front hall is to entertain my guests and the rear hall is my own residence
The small rooms in the two wings on the east and west will be arranged for my children belongings and servants
In the summer I will go up to the balcony and in the winter I will go into the heated room The Buddha told the elder I have heard about you virtuous elder for a long time I wish to talk with you
I the Buddha have an important verse that is advantageous in the transmigration of life and death
I would like to give it to you as a present I am not sure 
May I ask that you abandon your project for a moment sit down and talk with me The elder replied Right now I am in a great hurry I cannot sit down and talk
Please come back another day and I will talk at length with you
You can then speak the important verse you mentioned Thereupon the Worldhonored One said in verse
I have children and wealth The ignorant is only restless Self is also notself Why is one worried about children and wealth  In summer I will precisely stay here In winter I will precisely stay there The ignorant often worries beforehand He does not know the coming misfortune He is ignorant and stupid
He says he is intelligent He is ignorant yet he claims to be intelligent This is called the extremely ignorant The brahman said You have skillfully spoken this verse
But I am now really in a great hurry
Please come back later
Lets talk more about it Then the Worldhonored One felt sorrow and departed
Later the elder was himself handing over a rafter beam of the house when it fell on his head and split it open He immediately died
His family members wept and wailed astonishing the neighbors
This accident happened before the Buddha had traveled very far
the outskirts of a village where he met several dozen brahmans
They asked the Buddha where he had come from
The Buddha replied Recently I went to the house of the elder who passed away  and expounded the Dharma for his sake
He however did not believe in the Buddhas words He did not know about impermanence
The elder has already suddenly left for the next life further completely explained the meaning of the previous verse for the sake of all the brahmans
They heard it were happy and then attained the way to practice it
Thereupon the Worldhonored One spoke to them in verse The ignorant who approaches the wise is Just like a ladle that scoops up something delicious Although one is familiar with for a long time He still does not know the Dharma An enlightened one who approaches the wise is Just like a tongue that tastes something delicious
Although he receives training for only a brief moment He promptly understands the essence of the Way When an ignorant person performs conduct He brings disaster upon himself When he feels happy and does evil He brings serious misfortune upon himself If he performs unwholesome conduct He takes a step backward bears regret for it And renders a tearful face Retribution derives from the habits accumulated in his past lives At that time all the brahmans heard this verse repeatedly
They gave rise to sincere faith more and more and worshiped the Buddha
They rejoiced upheld the teaching and practiced it
I think that selfconceit is common in both the clergy and laypeople neither the intelligent nor the ignorant are exempted from it and both the noble and the humble possess it
If we just remove unimportance and discuss importance is serious in the secular world
There is also frivolous speech selfpraising criticizing the virtuous and ridiculing and slandering people of eminent virtue
All laypeople do these from morning till night
Even for a single day they have never been ashamed of their sins expressed a feeling to seek the wonderful path or examined themselves
Therefore a nonBuddhist text says If one earnestly longs for the wholesome way he may nd shelter for life
If he earnestly longs to be a lial son and respectful to his elder brothers he may bring glory to his parents There are also wise people who greatly admire ākyamunis teaching who abide by and practice it who are virtuous and benevolent who yield for others who are upright and prudent and who faithfully follow  These are all due to what one has planted in his previous existences
Ones natural disposition is spontaneous
How different is this from the Way
There are also those who have renounced the world yet do not rely on the sacred teaching and violate the Buddhist precepts śīla and Vinaya who do not study and remain ignorant and who are no different from vulgar people
Nevertheless although the clergy and laypeople differ from each other in appearance who violate are few
There are light and darkness in the mind and there is the relative gravity of faults
Consequently those who are renouncing the world keep this in mind before violating and they enter the Buddhist Way
If good deeds have already inuenced  the foundation of ones meritorious virtue is already very strong
Even if has a minor vice if he is even slightly ashamed of it cannot overwhelmingly affect his condition
If he is even slightly ashamed of it then he can recover cleanness
When I speak of secular people they remain in the situation of no shame
They have no feeling of shame in their minds
They support their wives and raise children
Their halls and rooms are lled with the ve desires for wealth sex food and drink fame and sleep
Strongsmelling foods wine and meat are obtained as they wish
Their feeling of attachment is deep and they cannot even temporarily give up anything
Evil conditions dwell together in them
How can they escape from this
This is the point where the paths of light and darkness branch off from each other and the difference between the clergy and laypeople
Therefore it is known that light can destroy darkness while darkness cannot destroy light
The light of a small lamp can already illuminate the interior of a room
Even if someone who has renounced the world violates with a minor fault the previous light is already complete
It is surely possible that the light does not increase brightness yet the original light continually shines
Just as a the dish of exists and the lamps wick stands the eld of merit is stable and karma is external
In addition it is extremely difcult for someone who has renounced the world to do evil
It is just like trying to sail a ship on land
It is precisely easy for laypeople to give rise to evil just like rowing a boat at sea
Moreover someone who has renounced the world practices the Buddhist Way as easily as a boat can be rowed at sea
For laypeople doing meritorious deeds is extremely difcult just as sailing a ship on land
Even though the ship  is the same there is a difference in where they travel Therefore the speed is not the same
There are relative difculties in practicing and violating  From this it is known that during the transmigration of birth and death  are easily deled and wholesome things are difcult to accomplish
Seek selfliberation soon Exert yourself to admire those who have renounced the secular world
Furthermore the Xianyu jing says
Regarding the merit of renouncing the world this blessing is very plentiful
If one sets male and female servants free listens to the people and renounces the world of his own accord to enter the Buddhist Way the merit is immeasurable beyond comparison
The merit of renouncing the world is higher than Mount Sumeru deeper than a great ocean and vaster than the sky
The reason for this is that because one renounces the world he completely achieves the Buddhist Way
When the Buddha resided in this world there was an elder called rīvardhana in Rājagṛha
He was more than a hundred years old
Every member of his family both adults and children disliked him and slighted him 
They heard said that the merit of renouncing the world is immeasurable
soon went to the Buddhas place seeking and wishing for the way to renounce the world but the Buddha was absent Then he went to āriputras place and āriputra saw that he was and could not be liberated
In this way ve hundred great arhats all refused to liberate him
He came out of the monastery and stopping at the threshold of a gate he bitterly wept aloud
The Worldhonored One later went to him and consoled and advised him in various ways
The Buddha promptly told Maudgalyāyana to allow the elder to renounce the world
Maudgalyāyana allowed to renounce the world and gave him the precepts
Again the elder was often verbally abused by the young bhikṣus
He wanted to throw himself into a river to drown and die
Maudgalyāyana saw this and with his supernatural power he placed him on the bank of the river
asked and came to know the cause 
Maudgalyāyana thought to himself This man is not afraid of the transmigration of birth and death
There is nothing by which he attains the Buddhist Way Then he ordered  With sincerity grab onto a corner of my robe They ew up into the sky and arrived on the shore of an ocean where they saw the fresh corpse of a goodlooking woman
They watched as a worm emerged from her mouth and returned through her nostril and further as it came out from her eye and reentered through her ear
After Maudgalyāyana observed this he threw away 
His disciple asked him Who was this woman replied This was a wife of a great caravan master in rāvastī
She had wellproportioned features which are rare in the world
The wife always held a mirror with a handle of three wooden pieces to cast light over her face
She looked at her own pleasing appearance gave rise to haughtiness and was deeply attached to herself
Her husband respected and loved her very much He took her with him and they put out to sea together but the conditions at sea were bad
Their ship wrecked and sank and they died
was cast ashore
Because the caravan masters wife had been attached to her own body she was reborn in her former body after death and became the worm
After giving up her worm life she will fall into the great hell where she will endure immeasurable suffering Again walked a little further and saw a woman carrying a copper cauldron on her back
While supporting the cauldron she poured water  made a re and boiled 
Then she took off her clothes and entered the cauldron
Her esh was cooked and her bones were separated 
The water boiled over and the bones came out 
A blast of wind blew Soon thereafter she recovered a human body
She then took her own esh and ate it
rīvardhana asked  Who was this woman His teacher answered In rāvastī there was a upāsikā who respectfully believed in the Three Treasures
For one summer she invited a bhikṣu and made offerings to him
She stayed on the roadside and made a room in which she stayed
She personally prepared various kinds of delicious foods and sent a maidservant to deliver them 
When the maidservant came to a place hidden from view however she selected good things and ate them in advance and gave the remaining food to the bhikṣu
The lady became aware of this and asked the maid Have you eaten some of the food by stealth The maidservant replied Not at all
After the bhikṣu ate he gave me some of what remained which I then ate
If I rst took some of the food please cause me to eat my own esh lifetime after lifetime Because of this she rst received the current retribution and later she will fall into hell Next they advanced a little more and saw a tree made of esh
Numerous insects surrounded and picked at the body leaving no space on it
shouted wept and wailed It sounded just like the voice from hell
The disciple asked his teacher What is this tree Maudgalyāyana replied This was Lailizha  a bhikṣu who was in charge of administration 
Because of his free will he gave to laypeople resources belongings owers fruits drink and food
Because of this cause he has received this current retribution
Later he will fall into hell
All the insects pecking at the tree are the same people who were given the goods at that time Next they advanced again and saw a man around whom were many various evil spirits with an animal heads and human bodies
Each  held a crossbow a trident and a poisoned arrow in their hands
The arrowheads were all burning with ames
They vied with each other in shooting  His entire body was in ames
rīvardhana asked his teacher Who was this man Maudgalyāyana replied In his former existence this man was a great hunter and killed many animals
Therefore he receives this suffering
After nishing this existence he will fall into the great hell Next they advanced again and saw a big mountain
At the base  knives and swords were arranged
They saw a person thrown down from the top pierced and destroyed his body After being thrown down he again ascended  just as before without ceasing
rīvardhana asked his teacher Again who was this person His teacher again replied This was the kings great ghter of Rājagṛha
Because he was brave and erce he was placed in the vanguard and he injured and destroyed the lives of sentient beings
First he receives this suffering and later he will fall into hell Next they again went on and saw a mountain of bones
The mountain was as high as seven hundred yojanas and could obstruct the sunlight and cause the sea to become dark and black
At that time on a great ridge of this bone mountain Maudgalyāyana came and went walking around slowly
The disciple asked his teacher What was this bone mountain The teacher answered rīvardhana You wish to know this
These are precisely the bones of your former body After hearing this rīvardhana became frightened and had gooseesh
He perspired from fear and addressed the upādhyāya I have now heard about myself
In a brief moment before my heart breaks I pray that you will now explain for me my karmic history from beginning to end Maudgalyāyana told him There is no end to the transmigration of birth and death
When one creates good or evil karma nothing decays and becomes rotten after his death and he certainly receives retribution or reward according to his conduct
In the past there was a king here in Jambudvīpa called Dharmavar dhana
He was fond of donating observing the precepts and listening to the Dharma
He had compassion toward sentient beings and did not harm the lives of living creatures
He ruled over the state by means of the true Dharma for fully twenty years
During that period of time in his leisure time he gambled with other people
There was once a man who had violated the law by committing murder
Vassals reported it to the king
The king at that time was engaged in gambling and he neglectfully answered Punish him in accordance with the law of the land According to the law which stipulated that one who commits homicide must be executed they subsequently put to death
After the king nished gambling he asked all the vassals Where is the criminal His vassals answered We have put him to death When the king heard this he fainted in agony and fell to the ground
He was sprinkled with water and brought back to consciousness
Weeping the king said The court ladies female entertainers elephants horses and the seven treasures will all remain here but I alone will enter hell
I have just now murdered a person
You should know that I am a caṇdāla king
I do not know where I should go lifetime after lifetime
I have now decided that I must not remain on the throne
I will give up the throne enter a mountain and abide by myself When he later died he was reborn in the ocean and became a makara sh measuring seven hundred yojanas long
Various kings and ministers relying on their own inuence overpower the peasants through injustice They kill limitlessly
After death many of them fall into the state of makara sh and numerous various insects pick at the huge shs body
Since feels itchy it scratches its body with a mountain and kills the insects Polluting the sea the blood spreads to a hundred li
 The sleep of a sh lasts a hundred years
When feels hungry and thirsty it drinks water
Water ows into its mouth just as a large river drains itself into 
Accidentally at that time there were ve hundred traveling merchants who had put out to sea to collect treasures
They came across an openmouthed sh and their ship quickly went into the mouth
Fearful the merchants shouted and cried out loudly
Just as they were about to be swallowed by the sh they chanted in unison We take refuge in the Buddha The sh heard the voices invoking the Buddha and closed its mouth The ow of water stopped and the merchants survived
The sh starved to death and was reborn in Rājagṛha where it became you
After the sh died demigods  yakṣas and rākṣasas took out of and placed it on the shore
The esh vanished but the bones remained and became this bone mountain
King Dharmavardhana is you
Because you had the man put to death you fell into the sea and became a sh On hearing this rīvardhana deeply dreaded the transmigration of birth and death
Observing his former self he understood that everything is impermanent and attained the fruit of arhatship
Introduction and The Wicked and Falsehood Women in the secular world are excessively grievous and loathsomely unpleasant
The Buddha said that they are more wicked atterers than men
Some women avail themselves of applying to their faces and necks and make adjustments to decorate themselves with cosmetics
Some women wearing gorgeous dresses delude and tempt shallow men
Some haughtily trie with men with eloquence and obsequiously look askance at a man while singing and smiling
Some sigh while intoning a verse and gaze at their audience
Some expose their breasts while covering their faces with their hands and hiding their heads
Some walk slowly and sinuously the form of their body playing with shadow
Some become suddenly sad or happy closing or opening their eyes to confuse and delude ignorant men and cause them to give rise to wild desire
In this way they are seductive and false In the end it is difcult to explain everything 
Ordinary men are bewitched by  they are all deluded by 
is just like a villain who has committed numerous various kinds of fraud and also just like a painted bottle full of excrement to deceive people also like a net hung high to trap a ock of birds also like a ne net into which many sh jump also like a pit in the darkness into which a blind man falls also like a re that attracts a ying moth into its ames and also like a y that greedily enjoys a putrid corpse
When come close they disorder a country and ruin ones family
When you touch them it is just like holding a venomous serpent
Their outward words are just like honey but their intentions are just like poisoned wine
Sufferings from poverty of a family are all due to women
Leaving ones family for a distant place and ruining himself are also due to women
Domestic discord is also due to women
Alienation between a man and a woman is also due to women
Breaking up between brothers is also due to women
Ones estrangement from members of his clan and loneliness are also due to women
Falling into the evil realms is also due to women
Not being reborn in heaven and the realm of human beings is also due to women
The obstruction to the path of wholesome acts is also due to women
Not entering the sacred fruit is also due to women In this way it is impossible to completely discuss demerits and troubles 
The sentient beings are very pitiful like this
They are continuously burned by the re of lust and unable to leave behind 
They result in receiving sufferings from misfortune Up to the present it has not discontinued
Just as the Chuyao jing says
Formerly in rāvastī there was a woman
Carrying a pitcher with a child in her arms she went to a well to draw water
There was a goodlooking man there who sat on the right edge of the well entertained himself by playing a stringed instrument
At the time that woman had extremely strong desires and she indulged in attachment to the man
The man also had vigorous desires he indulged in attachment to the woman
The womans desires caused her to be completely confused She tied a thick rope around her childs neck and hung the child in the well
Soon she returned and pulled out of the well but the child was dead
was distressed and heartbroken She cried bitterly and loudly weeping copiously Furthermore   The Buddha was staying in the kingdom of Kauśāmbī
The king was called Udayana
In the kingdom of Kuru there was a brahman called Māgandiya
His daughter was born and she was decent and beautiful in appearance with few matches in the world
The father saw that his daughters face was very rare in the state
So she was called Anupamā 
All the kings ofcials and men from inuential families of the neighboring states wanted to take her in marriage
The father replied If there is a gentleman who is as goodlooking as my daughter I will comply with his request The Buddha was temporarily residing in that country at that time
The brahman saw that the Buddha had the thirtytwo marks and the eighty minor marks of physical excellence his physical form was of purplishgold color he was magnicent and dignied and his brilliant appearance and deportment were supreme
was happy in his heart and said My daughter has a match who is exactly this man He came home and told his wife I found a husband for Anupamā He urged her to adorn their daughter to go 
The husband and wife both dressed her up
When their daughter walked beautiful light emanated from her
Her necklace of pearls and precious stones magnicently brightened the kingdom
The husband and his wife together went to the Buddha taking 
The wife on the way saw the Buddhas traces the marks of his physical excellence and the color of his luster which are unearthly
When she realized that these were of the Worldhonored One she told her husband The wellregulated patterns of this mans footprints are really not what we hear about in the world
This man must be extraordinary
He must be spontaneously clean and pure and have no sexual desire
He will not take our 
There is nothing with which he will disgrace himself The husband asked her How do you know this is so The wife thereupon explained in verse
A licentious man walks dragging his feet An enraged man takes steps with curled toes An ignorant man treads upon the earth This footprint is of the Worldhonored One
The brahman said This is not something you a woman could know
If you are unhappy return home by yourself He then took his daughter by himself to the Buddhas place Bowing his head to the Buddhas feet he addressed  O Great Benevolent One
You diligently teach us I have nothing to offer you
I have only this demoralizing daughter
I wish to give her to you as your wife The Buddha asked him Do you think your daughter is good answered From the moment of her birth we saw that she has a really ne appearance
There is no match in the world
Many kings and members of inuential families of various countries have proposed marriage to her but I did not comply with their requests
I caught a glimpse of you O Great Benevolent One You are of golden color and you are dignied You are not what we see in the world
Since I wish to offer what I have to you I only brave to personally take refuge in you The Buddha asked What do you think are this womans good points The brahman answered Observing all over from her head to her feet nothing is not good The Buddha said You are deluded by your physical eyes
As I see her now there is not even a single good point from her head to her feet
You see that she has hair on her head
The hair is just fur
The tails of elephants and horses are like this too
Under the hair there is the human skull which is bone
The skull of a butchered pig is entirely that too
In the head there is a brain
A brain is just like mud
It smells bad and causes peoples noses to twitch
Even if it were to drop and stick to the ground no one would step on it
The eyes are ponds
Gouge them out and purify the bodily uids
In the nose is nasal mucus and in the mouth is just saliva
The belly contains the liver and the lungs All these smell offensive
The intestines the stomach and the bladder are merely full of excrement and urine
It is difcult to talk about how they decay with a bad odor
The belly is a leather bag in which there are various impurities
In the four limbs the hands and feet bones support each other
The muscles are tangled and the skin shrinks They only depend on the breath in order to move
For instance the body can be compared to a wooden doll A machine made it
After it is nished if that body is taken to pieces the parts separate from each other and the hands and feet are totally in disorder
A human being is also like this What good points are there
You however said that there are few matches 
Formerly when I stayed under the aśvattha tree  the king of devils of the sixth heaven adorned his three daughters whose faces were beautifully decorated
There was no match in heaven was not merely for these girls
He intended to destroy my aspiration for enlightenment
I then explained for them what is lthy and disgusting in the body
Accordingly transformed into old women
Their appearances were decayed and not restored
They departed ashamed of themselves
What disturbance does this excrement bag want to make now
Quickly return home taking your daughter with you
I will not take her in marriage The brahman heard what the Buddha said He suddenly felt ashamed and had no words 
 Again  addressed the Buddha If Benevolent One you do not take in marriage may I marry her to King Udayana The Buddha did not answer
The brahman sent his daughter to King Udayana and gave her 
The king on receiving the girl was greatly happy
He appointed her father Grand Mentor built a palace for her and gave a thousand musicians to attend her
King s queen had studied under the Buddha and attained the path of the srotaāpattiphala
The daughter slandered to the king
The king was misled by her words and shot the queen with a hundred arrows
The queen saw the arrows but she was not afraid of them She was not enraged at all
Her thoughts and her sole intention were of recalling the Buddhas benevolent mind
As she kneeled upright facing the king all the arrows went around her three times and returned to in front of the king
All hundred arrows did this
King then realized  He felt disappointed and frightened
He immediately rode a golden vehicle led by a white elephant and rushed to the Buddhas place He got off the vehicle before arriving at and kept his attendants away
He folded his hands in greeting proceeded forward and bowed to the Buddhas feet
Kneeling upright confessed and said I have a grave fault I feel ashamed of myself in the presence of the Three Revered Ones
The reason is that this licentious witch gave rise to wickedness following her desires
 I held atrocious malice toward the Buddha and his disciples and shot one of the Buddhas disciples with a hundred arrows
Then things happened to her
I saw this and I was frightened
I think that you the Buddha the Most August have immeasurable compassion
The power of your disciple laywomans compassion is like this how much greater is the highest right and true power of the Buddha
I now confess my sin and take refuge in the Three Revered Ones
I only pray that you Buddha will forgive me for my fault with your great benevolence The Buddha sighed in wonderment and said Good
The king realized the evil and is repentant
This is the action of an intelligent man
I accept the kings good intentions The king bowed his head to the ground
In this way he thrice to the Buddha who received the worship
The king again touched his head to the ground He withdrew took a seat and said The energy with which I am naturally endowed is erce and stupid
I am irritable perverse and selsh
I have no forbearance
I have not removed the three poisons Evil conduct is pleasing 
Women are wicked and harmful I did not know their evils
I think for myself that I will denitely go to hell after death
I pray that the Buddha will have compassion on me and extensively explain the evil aspects of women the evil spirits
Few of those who have fallen into their nets can pull themselves out
If I hear of the disasters  I will certainly take them as warnings
My people the noble and the menial will be able to correct their moral conduct The Buddha said Do you take this matter to be your question
I will however explain other meanings King replied If I receive other meanings some other day it is not too late
Womens intentions to delude men bring great disasters and misfortune
If I do not hear about the disasters they cause how can I keep away from them
I pray that the Buddha will fully explain for me calamities of hell as well as the lth of women The Buddha said Just listen 
Men possess the vice of stupidity Lets step back and see womens bewitchment The king said Good
I wish to receive your brilliant teaching The Buddha said Men have the four kinds of evils the vitals
You should know that in the world there are licentious men who continually think about seeing women and hearing their seductive voices
They keep away from or give up the true Dharma
They doubt truth and believe depraved thoughts
They wish to be trapped in a net and be submerged in darkness
They want to be used by women just as slaves revere their masters
They covet and enjoy womens charms and do not consider that the impure uids from the orices of the body are stinking and lthy
In a chaotic state they are in the midst of desire Just like hogs kept in a dirty place they are not aware of the bad odor and happily think that they are content with it
They do not consider that later they must fall into Avīci Hell where they will suffer from pain limitlessly
They concentrate their attention on lewdness lap up nasal mucus and saliva amuse themselves with womens pus and blood treasuring them as much as gems and enjoying them as much as honey
Therefore they are called men who are slaves to desire
This is the rst evil aspect of men
Furthermore regarding the matter of parents raising a son the mother becomes pregnant and gives birth to him and the child attains manhood It is difcult to talk about the hardships the parents who work diligently 
When the son grows up to be a man he might not remain living in the home he might exhaust the  or he might have walking on his knees or with his elbows touching the ground
Depending on a matchmaker  out of their love for him arrange for him to have a wife
Even if he lives in another city try to look out for him regardless of the distance they are unconcerned about suffering from hardship
however gives his mind to lewdness deserts his parents and forgets they are getting old
Soon he makes a girl to be his wife and values her as highly as treasure
Wishing to indulge in private amusements with each other he turns malicious eyes upon his parents
He believes the wicked words and comes into conict 
He does not think about from whom he was born
He neglects his parents immeasurable favor 
This is the second evil aspect of men
Moreover people conduct themselves in life with diligence and hard work and they obtain money and stores of grain
They originally possess sincere faith and the intention to respect the Way
They respectfully support the mental the śramaṇas and brahmans
They realize that the world is impermanent and that making donations is meritorious
After they take a wife their feelings are deluded by licentious desire
They hinder themselves with ignorance and go against truth and toward wrong This is entirely due to womens plot
Even if they have the intention to donate  they really just want to say I would rather for women to adorn themselves They abandon clean and pure conduct They are controlled and become mean men
They do not know the important admonitions stated in the Buddhist scriptures and to what fortune and misfortune are attributable
If licentiousness causes them to throw themselves into a net  they will surely fall into the evil realms and in the end will not correct themselves
This is the third evil aspect of men
In addition if one is fortunate to be someones son he may not think of his parents favor in raising him
Even if he makes a good living and amasses a fortune he may not support his parents
Instead he may seek the path to sensuality from east to west
He may think of keeping treasures and inviting men and women or he may kill the six kinds of domestic animals to offer to the spirits of popular religions
