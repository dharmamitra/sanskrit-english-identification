monastery workersWell then Venerable please ask the Buddha and tell me the outcomeYes great kingAnd Pilindavaccha instructed inspired and gladdened King Bimbisāra with a teachingafter which the King got up from his seat bowed down circumambulated Pilindavaccha with his right side toward him and leftSoon afterwards Pilindavaccha sent a message to the BuddhaVenerable Sir King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha wishes to provide a monastery workerWhat should I doThe Buddha then gave a teaching and addressed the monksI allow monastery workersOnce again King Bimbisāra went to Pilindavaccha bowed sat downVenerable has the Buddha allowed monastery workersYes great kingWell then Ill provide you with a monastery workerBut after making this promise he forgot and only remembered after a long time He then addressed the official in charge of all practical affairsListen has that monastery worker I promised been providedNo sir he hasntHow long is it since we made that promiseThe official counted the days and saidIts five hundred daysWell then provide him with five hundred monastery workersYes sirThe official provided Pilindavaccha with five hundred monastery workers and a separate village was establishedThey called it The Monastery Workers Village and Pilinda VillageAnd Pilindavaccha began associating with the families in that villageAfter robing up one morning he took his bowl and robe and entered Pilinda Village for almsfoodAt that time they were holding a celebration in that villageand the children were dressed up with ornaments and garlandsAs Pilindavaccha was walking on continuous almsround he came to the house of a certain monastery worker where he sat down on a prepared seatJust then the daughter of the house had seen the other children dressed up in ornaments and garlands and she criedGive me a garland Give me ornamentsPilindavaccha asked her motherwhy the girl was cryingShe told himadding How can poor people like us afford garlands and ornamentsPilindavaccha took a pad of grass and said to the motherHere place this pad of grass on the girls headand it turned into a beautiful golden garlandEven the royal compound had nothing like itPeople told King BimbisāraSir in the house of a particular monastery worker theres a beautiful golden garlandEven in your court sir theres nothing like itSo how did those poor people get itNo doubt it was taken by theftAnd King Bimbisāra had that family imprisonedOnce again Pilindavaccha robed up in morning took his bowl and robe and entered Pilinda Village for almsfoodAs he was walking on continuous almsround he came to the house of that monastery worker And he asked the neighborsWhere is the family of this monastery workerVenerable the king had them imprisoned because of that golden garlandPilindavaccha then went to King Bimbisāras house and sat down on a prepared seatKing Bimbisāra approached Pilindavaccha bowed and sat downAnd Pilindavaccha saidGreat king why have you had the family of that monastery worker imprisonedVenerable in the house of that monastery worker there was a beautiful golden garlandEven the royal compound has nothing like itSo how did those poor people get itNo doubt it was taken by theftPilindavaccha then focused his mind on turning King Bimbisāras stilt house into goldAs a result the whole house became goldAnd he said Great king how did you get so much

courtBeing delighted and gaining confidence in Pilindavaccha they brought him the five tonicsghee butter oil honey and syrupOrdinarily too Pilindavaccha was getting the five tonicsSince he was getting so much he gave it away to his followersAs a consequence his followers acquired an abundance of tonicsAfter filling up basins and waterpots and setting these asidethey filled their water filters and bags and hung these in the windowsThe tonics were dripping all overand the dwellings became infested with ratsWhen people walking about the dwellings saw this they complained and criticized themThese Sakyan ascetics are hoarding goods indoors just like King Seniya Bimbisāra of MagadhaThe monks heard the complaints of those peopleand the monks of few desires complained and criticized those monksHow can these monks choose to live in such abundanceAfter criticizing those monks in many ways they told the Buddha He had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monksIs it true monks that some monks are

was being prepared He approached that place and saw that they mixed the sugar with flour and ash He thoughtSugar mixed with food is unallowable and so its unallowable to eat this sugar at the wrong timeand being afraid of wrongdoing he and his followers did not take sugarThey told the Buddha and he saidWhy are they adding flour and ash to the sugarTo harden it SirIf they add flour or ash to sugar to harden it its still considered as sugarI allow you to take as much sugar as you likeWhile still traveling Revata saw mung beans sprouting from feces He thoughtMung beans are unallowablethey sprout even after being digestedand being afraid of wrongdoing he and his followers did not eat mung beansThey told the Buddha and he saidAlthough mung beans may sprout after being digested I allow you to eat as much of it as you likeOn one occasion a certain monk who had a stomach achedrank salty purgativeand was curedI allow the salty purgative when youre sickIf youre not sick I allow you to drink it mixed with waterDiscussion of the prohibition against storing indoors etcWandering on the Buddha eventually arrived at Rājagaha where he stayed in the Bamboo Grove the squirrel sanctuarySoon

sesame seeds rice and mung beans stored them indoors cooked them himself indoors and brought them to the Buddha sayingSir please drink the threefold pungent rice porridgeWhen Buddhas know what is going on sometimes they ask and sometimes notthey know the right time to ask and the right time not to askBuddhas ask when it is beneficial not when it is unbeneficialfor Buddhas are incapable of doing what is unbeneficialBuddhas question the monks for two reasons to give a teaching or to lay down a training ruleThe Buddha said to nanda nanda where does this rice porridge come fromnanda told

invited for a mealThis wont give rise to confidence in those without it  after criticizing them he gave a teaching and addressed the monksWhen you have been invited to a meal you should not eat someone elses thick rice porridge beforehandIf you do you should be dealt with according to the ruleThe account of Belaṭṭha KaccānaWhen the Buddha had stayed at Andhakavinda for as long as he liked he set out wandering toward Rājagaha together with a large sangha of twelvehundred and fifty monksJust then Belaṭṭha Kaccāna was traveling from Rājagaha to Andhakavinda with five hundred carts all of them filled with jars of sugarWhen the Buddha saw Belaṭṭha Kaccāna coming he stepped off the road and sat down at the foot of a treeBelaṭṭha Kaccāna approached the Buddha bowedVenerable Sir I would

with its ascetics and brahmins its gods and humans who would be able to properly digest that sugar except a Buddha or his discipleSo discard that sugar where there are no cultivated plants or in water without lifeSaying Yes Sir he dumped that sugar in water without lifeAs he did so that sugar hissed sputtered fumed and smokedjust like a plowshare heated the whole day hisses sputters fumes and smokes when dropped in waterBelaṭṭha Kaccāna was awestruck with goosebumps all over He approached the Buddha bowed and sat downThe Buddha then gave him a progressive teachingtalk on generosity talk on morality talk on heaven and he revealed the danger degradation and defilement in worldly pleasures and the benefit of renunciationWhen the Buddha knew that his mind was ready supple without hindrances joyful and confident he revealed the teaching unique to the Buddhas suffering its origin its end and the pathAnd just as a clean and stainless cloth takes the dye properly so too while he was sitting right there Belaṭṭha Kaccāna experienced the stainless vision of the TruthAnything that has a beginning has an endHe had seen the Truth had reached understood and penetrated it he had gone beyond doubt and uncertainty had attained to confidence and had become independent of others in the Teachers instruction He then said to the BuddhaWonderful Venerable Sir wonderfulJust as one might set

the Teaching clear in many waysI go for refuge to the Buddha to the Teaching and to the Sangha of monksPlease accept me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for lifeThe Buddha then continued wandering toward RājagahaWhen he eventually arrived he stayed in the Bamboo Grove the squirrel sanctuaryAt that time there was an abundance of sugar in RājagahaThe Buddha has only allowed sugar for those who are sickand being afraid of wrongdoing they did not eat itI allow you to take sugar when youre sick and sugar mixed in water when youre notPāṭaligāmaWhen the Buddha had stayed at Rājagaha for as long as he liked he set out wandering toward Pāṭaligāma with a large sangha of twelvehundred and fifty monksWhen he eventually arrived he stayed thereWhen the lay followers of Pāṭaligāma heardthat he had arrivedthey went to see him bowed and sat down on one sideThe Buddha then instructed inspired and gladdened them with a teachingAnd they said to the BuddhaPlease visit our guesthouse together with the Sangha of monksThe Buddha consented by remaining silentKnowing that he had consented they got up from their seats bowed down and circumambulated him with their right side toward him They then went to the guesthouse spread mats on the floor prepared seats put out a large waterpot and hung up an oil lamp They then returned to the Buddha bowedand told himthat everything was preparedadding Sir please come at your convenienceThe Buddha robed up took his bowl and robe and went to the guesthouse together with the Sangha of monks He washed his feet entered the guesthouse and sat down facing the east leaning on the central pillarThe monks washed their feet too entered the guesthouse and sat down facing east with the Buddha in front of them leaning against the western wallThe lay followers of Pāṭaligāma followed suit and sat down facing west with the Buddha in front of them leaning against the eastern wallAnd the Buddha addressed those lay followersThere are these five dangers for one who is immoral because of failure in moralityBecause of heedlessness they lose much wealthThis is the first dangerThey get a bad reputationThis is the second dangerWhenever they come to a gathering of peoplewhether a gathering of aristocrats brahmins householders or asceticsthey are diffident and timidThis is the third dangerThey die confusedThis is the fourth dangerAfter

first benefitThey get a good reputationThis is the second benefitWhenever they come to a gathering of peoplewhether a gathering of aristocrats brahmins householders or asceticsthey are confident and selfassuredThis is the third benefitThey die with a clear mindThis is the fourth benefitAfter death they are reborn in heavenThis is the fifth benefitThe Buddha instructed inspired and gladdened them by teaching for much of the night He then dismissed them sayingIts late at nightPlease go at your convenienceSaying Yes Sir they got up from their seats bowed down circumambulated him with their right side toward him and leftSoon after the lay followers of Pāṭaligāma had left the Buddha entered an empty cubicleSunidha and VassakāraAt that time Sunidha and Vassakāra the government officials of Magadha were building a fortress at Pāṭaligāma to defend against the VajjiansThe Buddha got up early in the morning and with his superhuman and purified clairvoyance he saw a number of gods taking possession of sites around PāṭaligāmaWherever powerful gods took possession of a site just there powerful kings and government officials inclined to build their housesWherever gods of middle standing took possession of a site just there the kings and government officials of middle standing inclined to build their housesAnd wherever the lower ranked gods took possession of a site just there the lower ranked kings and government officials inclined to build their housesThe Buddha said to Venerable nandaWho is building a fortress in PāṭaligāmaSunidha and Vassakāra SirThey are building the fortress nanda as if they had consulted with the Tāvatisa godsAnd the Buddha told nanda what he had seenadding As far nanda as the extent of the Indian realm as far as the routes of commerce Pāṭaliputta will be the chief city the destination for merchandiseBut there will be three dangers for Pāṭaliputtafire water and internal dissensionSunidha and Vassakāra then went to the Buddha and exchanged pleasantries with himPlease accept tomorrows meal from us together with the Sangha of monksThe Buddha consented by remaining silentKnowing that he had consented they leftWhen they had had various kinds of fine food prepared they had the Buddha informed that the meal was readyAfter robing up the Buddha took his bowl and robe and went to Sunidhas and Vassakāras meal offering where he sat down on the prepared seat together with the Sangha of monksSunidha and Vassakāra then personally served various kinds of fine food to the Sangha of monks headed by the Buddha When the Buddha had finished his meal they sat down to one sideAnd the Buddha expressed his appreciation with these versesIn whatever placeThe wise decide to liveThere they feed the virtuousThe restrained monasticsWhatever gods are thereOne should dedicate the offering to themBeing revered and honoredThey revere and honor one in returnAnd they have compassion for oneAs a mother for her own childThe person the gods have compassion forAlways has good fortuneThe Buddha then got up from his seat and leftBut Sunidha and Vassakāra followed behind him thinkingWhatever gate the ascetic Gotama uses to depart well name the Gotama GateAnd the ford he uses to cross the Ganges river well name the Gotama FordAnd the gate though which the Buddha left was named the Gotama GateThe Buddha then went to the river GangesAt that time the river was full to the brimAmong the people who wanted to cross some were looking for a boat some for a barge and some were putting together a raftThe Buddha saw this Then just as a strong man might bend or stretch out his arm so too the Buddha disappeared on the near shore of the river and reappeared on the far shore together with the Sangha of monksSeeing the significance of this the Buddha exclaimed this inspired verseWhoever crosses the flowing mass of waterThey build a bridge leaving the water behindWhile ordinary people put together a raftThe wise have crossed alreadyDiscussion of the truths at KoṭigāmaThe Buddha then went to Koṭigāmaand he stayed thereWhile there he addressed the monksIt is because of not awakening to and not penetrating these four noble truths that you and I have wandered on and transmigrated for such a long timethe noble truth of sufferingthe noble truth of the origin of sufferingthe noble truth of the end of sufferingthe noble truth of the path leading to the end of sufferingBut now monks the noble truth of suffering has been awakened to and penetrated likewise the noble truth of the origin of suffering the noble truth of the end of suffering and the noble truth of the path leading to the end of suffering Craving for existence has been cut off that which leads to existence has come to an end now there is no further existenceBecause of not properly seeingThe four noble truthsYou transmigrate for a long timeAmong various kinds of rebirthThese have now been seenThat which leads to existence has been abolishedThe root of suffering has been cut offNow there is no further existenceThe account of Ambapālī and the LicchavīsThe courtesan Ambapālī heardthat the Buddha had arrived at KoṭigāmaShe had her best carriages harnessed mounted one of them and left Vesālī to visit the BuddhaShe went by carriage as far as the ground would allow dismounted and then approached the Buddha on foot After bowing down to the Buddha she sat downand the Buddha instructed inspired and gladdened her with a teachingShe then said to the BuddhaSir please accept tomorrows meal from me together with the Sangha of monksThe Buddha consented by remaining silentKnowing that he had consented she got up from her seat bowed down circumambulated him with her right side toward him and leftThe Licchavīs of Vesālī tooheard that the Buddha had arrived at KoṭigāmaThey had their best carriages harnessed mounted one of them and left Vesālī to visit the BuddhaSome of them were blue with blue makeup blue clothes and blue ornaments and likewise some of them were yellow some red and some whiteWhen Ambapālī met the young Licchavīs she turned her carriage around and drove up next to them pole to pole yoke to yoke wheel to wheel axle to axleThe Licchavīs asked her whyand she replied Because sirs Ive invited the Buddha for tomorrows meal together with the Sangha of monksWell give you a hundred thousand for this meal AmbapālīEven if you gave me the whole of Vesālī together with its supporting land I would not give you this mealThe Licchavīs snapped their fingers in dismay sayingDamn it weve been beaten by the mango womanAnd they continued on their way to the BuddhaWhen the Buddha saw them coming he said to the monksThose of you who havent seen the Tāvatisa gods look at the LicchavīsThe Licchavīs are comparable with the Tāvatisa godsThe Licchavīs went by carriage as far as the ground would allow dismounted and then approached the Buddha on footAfter bowing down to the Buddha they sat downand the Buddha instructed inspired and gladdened them with a teachingThey then said to the BuddhaSir please accept tomorrows meal from us together with the Sangha of monksI have already accepted tomorrows meal from AmbapālīThe Licchavīs snapped their fingers in dismaysaying Damn it weve been beaten by the mango womanAfter rejoicing in the Buddhas words they got up from their seats bowed down circumambulated him with their right side toward him and leftWhen the Buddha had stayed at Koṭigāma as long as he liked he went to Nātikāwhere he stayed in the brick houseThe following morning Ambapālī had various kinds of fine food prepared in her own park She then had the Buddha informed that the meal was readyAfter robing up the Buddha took his bowl and robe and went to Ambapālīs meal offering where he sat down on the prepared seat together with the Sangha of monksAnd Ambapālī personally served various kinds of fine food to the Sangha of monks headed by the BuddhaWhen the Buddha had finished his meal she sat down to one side and saidVenerable Sir I give this mango grove to the Sangha of monks headed by the BuddhaThe Buddha accepted the parkAfter instructing inspiring and gladdening her with a teaching he got up from his seat and went to the Great Wood near Vesālīwhere he stayed in the hall with the peaked roofThe third section for recitation on the Licchavīs is finishedThe account of General SīhaOn one occasion a number of wellknown Licchavīs were seated together in the public hall praising the Buddha the Teaching and the Sangha in many waysSīha the general a disciple of the Jains was seated in that gatheringHe thoughtNo doubt that Buddha is perfected a fully Awakened One since these wellknown Licchavīs praise the Buddha the Teaching and the Sangha in this wayLet me go and visit that BuddhaHe then went to Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta and saidSir I wish to visit the ascetic GotamaSīha why visit the ascetic Gotama who teaches nonaction when you believe in actionFor the ascetic Gotama teaches for the sake of nonaction and he trains his disciples in thatAnd Sīhas intention to go died downThe same sequence of events happened a second timeA third time a number of wellknown Licchavīs were seated together in the public hall praising the Buddha the Teaching and the Sangha in many waysSīha heard this and he had the same thoughts as beforeIn addition he thought this What can the Jains do to me whether I get their permission or notLet me go and visit the Buddha the Perfected and fully Awakened One without getting permission from the JainsSoon afterwards in the middle of the day General Sīha set out from Vesālī with five hundred carriages to visit the BuddhaHe went by chariot as far as the ground would allow dismounted and then approached the Buddha on foot He bowed sat downSir I have heard that the ascetic Gotama teaches nonaction that he teaches for the sake of nonaction and that he trains his disciples in thatThose who say thisdo they say what you have said without falsely misrepresenting you Do they explain according to the Teaching so that they cant be legitimately criticizedI dont wish to misrepresent youThere is a way Sīha one could rightly say of methat I teach nonaction that I teach for the sake of nonaction and that I train my disciples in thatWhat is that wayI teach the nondoing of misconduct by body speech and mindI teach the nondoing of various kinds of bad and unwholesome actionsThere is a way one could rightly say of methat I teach action that I teach for the sake of action and that I train my disciples

unwholesome qualitiesmisconduct by body speech and mindare to be disciplinedOne who has abandoned the bad unwholesome qualities that are to be disciplined who has cut them off at the root made them like a palmstump done away with them so utterly that they are incapable of reappearingsuch a one I call one who is austereNow the Buddha has abandoned the bad unwholesome qualities that are to be disciplined has cut them off at the root made them like a palm tree done away with them so utterly that they are incapable of reappearingThere is a way one could rightly say of methat Im withdrawn that I teach for the sake of withdrawal and that I train my disciples in that What is that wayOne whose future conception in a womb whose rebirth in a future life is abandoned and cut off at the root made like a palmstump so utterly done away with that one is incapable of reappearingsuch a one I call one who is withdrawnNow the Buddhas future conception in a womb his rebirth in a future life is

exclaimedWonderful Venerable Sir wonderful Just as one might set upright what had been overturned or reveal what was hidden or show the way to one who was lost or bring a lamp into the darkness so that one with eyes might see whats therejust so have you made the Teaching clear in many ways I go for refuge to you and to the Teaching and to the Sangha of monksPlease accept me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for lifeConsider it carefully Sīha Its good for wellknown people such as yourself to think carefullyNow Im even more pleased with you SirIf I became a lay follower of another religion they would carry a banner all over Vesālī proclaiming itBut you instead tell meto consider it carefullyFor the second time I go for refuge to you and to the Teaching and to the Sangha of monksPlease accept me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for lifeFor a long time Sīha your family has been a wellspring of support for the Jains When they come to you you should still consider giving them almsfoodNow Im even more pleased with you SirI had heard that you saythat offerings should only be given to you and your disciples not to anyone elseand that only offerings given to you and your disciples are fruitful not whats given to othersBut in reality you encourage me to give to the JainsIndeed I shall know the right time for thisFor the third time I go for refuge to you and to the Teaching and to the Sangha of monksPlease accept me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for lifeThe Buddha then gave Sīha a progressive teachingtalk on generosity talk on morality talk on heaven and he revealed the danger degradation and defilement in worldly pleasures and the benefit of renunciation When the Buddha knew that his mind were ready supple without hindrances joyful and confident he revealed the teaching unique to the Buddhas suffering its origin its end and the path And just as a clean and stainless cloth takes the dye properly so too while he was sitting right there Sīha experienced the stainless vision of the Truth Anything that has a beginning has an end He had seen the Truth had reached understood and penetrated it he had gone beyond doubt and uncertainty had attained to confidence and had become independent of others in the Teachers instructionHe then said to the BuddhaPlease accept tomorrows meal from me together with the Sangha of monksThe Buddha consented by remaining silentKnowing that the Buddha had consented Sīha got up from his seat bowed down circumambulated the Buddha with his right side toward him and leftSīha then told a manGo and get some ready meatAnd the following morning Sīha had various kinds of fine food prepared and he had the Buddha informed that the meal was readyAfter robing up the Buddha took his bowl and robe and went to General Sīhas house where he sat down on the prepared seat together with the Sangha of monksJust then a number of Jains were walking around Vesālī from street to street from intersection to intersection holding up their arms and calling outGeneral Sīha has killed a large animal and made a meal for the ascetic Gotama The ascetic Gotama is eating that meat knowing that the animal was killed for his sakeA certain man approached Sīha and whispered to him what the Jains were doingSīha said Forget about it For a long time those venerables have disparaged the Buddha the Teaching and the Sangha of monksThey will grow old and still keep on misrepresenting the Buddha with liesAnd as for me I would not kill a living being for the sake of my lifeSīha then personally served various kinds of fine food to the Sangha of monks headed by the Buddha When the Buddha had finished his meal Sīha sat down to one sideThe Buddha instructed inspired and gladdened him with a teaching He then got up from his seat and leftSoon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monksYou should not eat meat when you know the animal was killed for your sakeIf you do you commit an offense of wrong conductI allow you to eat meat and fish that is pure in three respects you havent seen heard or suspected that the animal was killed for your sakeThe allowance for a foodstorage areaSome time later in Vesālī there was plenty of food the crops were abundant and there was no problem getting by on almsfoodThen while the Buddha was in seclusion he thoughtThose things that I allowed the monks when there was a shortage of food the crops were meager and it was hard to get by on almsfoodthat is what has been stored indoors within the monastery what has been cooked indoors within the monastery what has been cooked by the monks themselves what has been received after picking it up what has been brought out what has been received before the meal what has come from the forest or a lotus ponddo the monks still make use of thisWhen the Buddha had come out from seclusion he asked Venerable nanda about thisHe replied They do SirSoon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monksThose things that I allowed you when there was a shortage of food the crops were meager and it was hard to get by on almsfood I prohibit from today onwardYou should not eat what has been stored indoors within the monastery what has been cooked indoors within the monastery what has been cooked by yourselves or what has been received after picking it upIf you do you commit an offense of wrong conductIf you have finished your meal and refused an invitation to eat more you should not eat nonleftovers that have been brought out that have been received before the meal or that have come from the forest or a lotus pondIf you do you should be dealt with according to the ruleAt that time people from the country loaded much salt oil rice and nonstaple food onto carts brought them to outside the monastery gateway and waited for their turn to cook a mealJust then a storm was approachingThose people went to Venerable nanda and told him what was happening adding What should we do nownanda told the Buddha who saidWell then nanda the Sangha should designate a building at the edge of the monastery as a foodstorage area and then store the food therewhether it a dwelling a stilt house or a caveAnd it should be done like thisA competent and capable monk should inform the SanghaPlease Venerables I ask the Sangha to listenIf it seems appropriate to the Sangha the Sangha should designate suchandsuch a dwelling as a foodstorage areaPlease Venerables I ask the Sangha to listenThe Sangha designates suchandsuch a dwelling as a foodstorage areaAny monk who approves of designating suchandsuch a dwelling as a foodstorage area should remain silentAny monk who does not approve should speak upThe Sangha has designated suchandsuch a dwelling as a foodstorage areaThe Sangha approves and is therefore silent I will remember it thusSoon afterwards people used the agreedupon foodstorage area for various purposes for cooking rice porridge and rice to prepare curries to chop meat and to split firewoodAfter getting up early in the morning the Buddha heard loud noises just like the cawing of crows He asked Venerable nanda what it wasand nanda explained what was going onSoon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monksYou should not use an agreedupon foodstorage areaIf you do you commit an offense of wrong conductI allow three places as foodstorage areasa building made according to a proclamation a place where cows rest and a place given for the purpose by a householderSoon afterwards Venerable Yasoja was sickPeople brought him tonicsand the monks stored them outsideVermin ate them and thieves stole themI allow you to use an agreedupon foodstorage areaI allow four places as foodstorage areasa building made according to a proclamation a building where cows rest a building given for the purpose by a householder and a building agreed upon by the SanghaThe fourth section for recitation on Sīha is finishedThe account of the householder MeṇḍakaAt that time in the town of Bhaddiya there was a householder called Meṇḍakawho had supernormal powersHe would wash his hair sweep out his granary and sit down outside the door A

was over Venerable nanda got up from his seat put his upper robe over one shoulder raise his joined palms and said to the BuddhaVenerable Sir the night is well advanced and the first part of the night is over The Sangha of monks has been seated for a long timePlease recite the Monastic CodeBut the Buddha did not replyAt the end of the middle part of the night Venerable nanda asked a second timeand again received no replyAt the end of the last part of the night when the sky was flaring up at dawn he asked a third timeAnd the Buddha replied nanda the gathering is impureVenerable Mahāmoggallāna thoughtWho is the Buddha talking aboutHe then read the minds of the the entire Sangha of monksAnd he saw that personimmoral with bad qualities impure and dubious in conduct hiding his actions not an ascetic while claiming to be one not abstaining from sexuality while claiming to do so rotten inside lustful defiledseated in the midst of the Sangha of monksHe went up to him and saidGet up the Buddha has seen youYou dont belong to the community of monksBut he did not replyMahāmoggallāna said the same thing a secondand a third timestill not getting a replyMahāmoggallāna then grabbed him by the arms took him outside the gateway and fastened the bolts And he went to the Buddha and saidSir I have taken that person outsidethe gathering is purePlease recite the Monastic Code to the monksIts amazing Moggallāna how that fool waited until he was grabbed by the armsAnd the Buddha addressed the monksThe eight amazing qualities of the oceanMonks the antigods delight in the ocean when they see these eight amazing qualities in itThe ocean slopes and inclines gradually It does not drop off all at onceThe ocean is steady It does not go beyond the shorelineThe ocean does not tolerate dead bodies but quickly carries them to the shore and discards them on dry landWhen the great riversthe Ganges the Yamunā the Aciravatī the Sarabhū or the Mahīreach the ocean they lose their former names and become known simply as the oceanWhatever rivers in the world flow into the ocean and whatever rain falls into it the ocean is not diminished or filled up because of thatThe ocean has only one taste the taste of saltThe ocean contains many precious thingspearls gems beryls motherofpearls quartz corals silver gold rubies and cats eyesThere are great beings in the oceanseamonsters antigods dragons and divinities creatures with bodies one thousand kilometers long two thousand three thousand four thousand and five thousand kilometers longThe eight amazing qualities on this spiritual pathJust so the monks delight in this spiritual path when they see these eight amazing qualities in itJust as the ocean slopes and inclines gradually and does not drop off all at onceso too on this spiritual path the training is gradual the practice is gradual and penetration to perfect insight does not happen all at onceJust as the ocean is steady and does not go beyond the shorelineso too on this spiritual path my disciples dont transgress the training rules I have laid down even for the sake of lifeJust as the ocean does not tolerate dead bodies but quickly carries them to the shore and discards them on dry landso too the Sangha of monks does not associate with anyone who is immoralsomeone with bad qualities impure and dubious in conduct hiding his actions not an ascetic while claiming to be one not abstaining from sexuality while claiming to do so rotten inside lustful defiledWhen the Sangha has gathered  they quickly eject him Even if he is seated in the midst of the Sangha he is far from the Sangha and the Sangha is far from himJust as when the great riversthe Ganges the Yamunā the Aciravatī the Sarabhū or the Mahīreach the ocean they lose their former names and become known simply as the oceanso too when anyone who goes forth on this spiritual path made known by the Buddhawhether aristocrats brahmins merchants or workersthey lose their former name and class and become known simply as Sakyans asceticsJust as the ocean does not decrease or fill up because of all the rivers in the world that flow into it or the rain that falls into itso too even if many monks are extinguished without remainder there is no decrease or filling up of the element of extinguishmentJust as the ocean has only one taste the taste of saltso too this spiritual path has only one taste the taste of freedomJust as the ocean contains many precious thingspearls gems beryls motherofpearls quartz corals silver gold rubies and cats eyesso too this spiritual path contains many precious thingsthe four applications of mindfulness the four right efforts the four foundations for supernormal power the five spiritual faculties the five spiritual powers the seven factors of awakening and the noble eightfold pathJust as there are great beings in the oceanseamonsters antigods dragons and divinities creatures with bodies one thousand kilometers long two thousand three thousand four thousand and five thousand kilometers longso too there are great beings on this spiritual pathstreamenterers those practicing for the realization of the fruit of streamentry oncereturners those practicing for the realization of the fruit of oncereturning nonreturners those practicing for the realization of the fruit of nonreturning perfected ones and those practicing for the realization of the fruit of perfectionSeeing the significance of this on that occasion the Buddha exclaimed this inspired utteranceIt rains on whats concealedNot on whats revealedTherefore reveal

ninth chapter on the cancellation of the Monastic Code is finishedIn this chapter there are thirty topicsThe chapter on the cancellation of the Monastic Code is finishedTheravāda Collection on Monastic LawThe chapter on the group of seven hundredOne hundred years after the Buddha had attained final extinguishment the Vajjian monks of Vesālī proclaimed ten practices as allowablethe saltinhorn practice the two fingerbreadths practice the nextvillage practice the manymonasteries practice the consent practice customary practices the unchurned practice palmjuice drinking sitting mats without borders and gold silver and moneyAt that time Venerable Yasa of Kākaṇḍa was wandering in the Vajjian country when he arrived at VesālīThere he stayed in the hall with the peaked roof in the Great WoodSoon afterwards on the day of the observance procedure the Vajjian monks of Vesālī filled a bronze bowl with water and placed it in the midst of the Sangha of monks Whenever a lay follower of Vesālī came they saidGive a kahāpaṇa coin to the Sangha or half a kahāpaṇa or a pāda or a māsakaThe Sangha needs requisitesBut Yaso said to the lay followersDont give a kahāpaṇa to the Sangha or half a kahāpaṇa or a pāda or a māsakaGold silver and money are not allowable for the Sakyan asceticsThey neither acceptnor receive gold silver and moneyThe Sakyan ascetics have given up gems and gold and live without gold silver and moneyBut although Yasa said this the lay followers continued to give money to the SanghaThe next morning the Vajjian monks shared out the money evenlyAnd they said to YasaHere is your share YasaThere is no share for me I dont accept moneyThe Vajjian monks said to one anotherYasa is abusing and reviling the lay followers who have faith and confidence Hes destroying their confidenceLets do a legal procedure of reconciliation against him And they did just thatYasa said to themThe Buddha has laid downthat a monk who has had a legal procedure of reconciliation done against himself should be given a monk as companion messengerPlease give me a companion monkThey appointed one monk and gave him to Yasa as companion messengerYasa entered Vesālī with his companion and said to the lay followers thereIt seems that Im abusing and reviling the venerable lay followers who have faith and confidence and that Im destroying their confidencesince I speak of what is contrary to the Teaching as contrary to the Teaching and of the Teaching as the Teaching and since I speak of what is contrary to the Monastic Law as contrary to the Monastic Law and of the Monastic Law as the Monastic LawOn one occasion the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas MonasteryThere he addressed the monksThere are these four defilements of the sun and the moon that stop them from shining and radiatingsmoke and dustand an eclipse by Rāhu the ruler of the antigodsIn the same way there are these four defilements of ascetics and brahmins that stop them from shining and radiatingdrinking alcoholhaving sexual intercourseaccepting gold silver and moneyand making a living through wrong livelihoodHaving said this the Teacher addedDefiled by desire and ill willSome ascetics and brahminsThose hindered by delusionDelight in what seems lovelySome ascetics and brahminsDeluded they drink alcoholHave sexual intercourseAccept gold silver and moneyAnd make a livingThrough wrong livelihoodThese are called defilements by the BuddhaThe Kinsman of the SunThose ascetics and brahminsWho are defiled by theseDo not shine and radiateThey are impure dirty and lowEnveloped in darknessSlaves to craving that leads them onFilling the dreaded cemeteriesThey receive another lifeIts by speaking like this it seems that Im abusing and reviling the venerable lay followers who have faith and confidence and that Im destroying their confidenceAt one time when the Buddha was staying at Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grovethe royal court was seated together in the royal compound having the following conversationGold silver and money are allowable for the Sakyan asceticsthey acceptand receive gold silver and moneyOn that occasion the chief Maṇicūlaka was sitting in that gatheringgold silver and money are not allowable for the Sakyan asceticsThey neither acceptnor receive gold silver or moneyThe Sakyan ascetics have given up gems and gold and live without gold silver and moneyAnd he was able to persuade the gatheringSoon afterwards Maṇicūlaka went to the Buddha bowed sat downand told him what had happenedadding Venerable Sir have I explained in accordance with the Teaching so that I cant be legitimately criticized or censuredYou certainly haveFor gold silver and money are not allowable for the Sakyan asceticsThey neither acceptnor receive gold silver or moneyThe Sakyan ascetics have given up gems and gold and live without gold silver and moneyWhoever is allowed gold silver and money is also allowed the pleasures of the worldAnd you should know that anyone who is allowed the pleasure of the worlddoes not have the qualities of an ascetic or a SakyanStill I say that anyone who needs grass may look for itlikewise timberor a workerBut under no circumstances should they accept or look for gold silver or moneyIts by speaking like this it seems that Im abusing and reviling the venerable lay followers who have faith and confidence and that Im destroying their confidenceOn one occasion at Rājagaha the Buddha prohibited gold silver and money and laid down a training rule because of Venerable Upananda the SakyanIts by speaking like this it seems that Im abusing and reviling the venerable lay followers who have faith and confidence and that Im destroying their confidencesince I speak of what is contrary to the Teaching as contrary to the Teaching and of the Teaching as the Teaching and since I speak of what is contrary to the Monastic Law as contrary to the Monastic Law and of the Monastic Law as the Monastic LawAnd the lay followers of Vesālī said to YasaVenerable youre the only Sakyan asceticnone of these others isPlease stay at VesālīWell do our best to supply you with robes almsfood a dwelling and medicinesHaving persuaded the lay followers of Vesālī Yasa returned to the monastery together with his companion messengerSoon afterwards the Vajjian monks asked the monk who had been the companion messengerDid Yasa ask the lay followers for forgivenessThe lay followers have acted badly toward usThey now regard Yasa as the only Sakyan asceticbut none of usThe Vajjian monks saidYasa has informed the householders without our approvalLets do a legal procedure of ejection against himBut when they gathered together to do the procedure against himYasa rose up into the air and reappeared at KosambīYasa then sent a message to the monks at Pāvā and to the monks in Avantī in the southern regionPlease come VenerablesLets raise this legal issuebefore what is contrary to the Teaching shines forth and the Teaching is obstructedbefore what is contrary to the Monastic Law shines forth and the Monastic Law is obstructedbefore those who speak contrary to the Teaching become strong and those who speak in accordance with it become weakbefore those who speak contrary to the Monastic Law become strong and those who speak in accordance with it become weakYasa then traveled to Venerable Sambhūta Sāṇavāsī who was staying on the Ahogaṅga mountainHe bowed sat downVenerable the Vajjian monks of Vesālī proclaim these ten practices as allowablethe saltinhorn practice the two fingerbreadths practice the nextvillage practice the manymonasteries practice the consent practice customary practices the unchurned practice palmjuice drinking sitting mats without borders and gold silver and

AhogaṅgaThen as the senior monks were consulting one another it occurred to themThis legal issue is going to be contentious and difficultHow can we get supporters so that we will be strongerAt this time Venerable Revata was staying at SoreyyaHe was learned and a master of the tradition he was an expert on the Teaching the Monastic Law and the summaries he was knowledgeable and competent had a sense of conscience and was afraid of wrongdoing and fond of the trainingThe senior monks considered thisand said If we get Revata as a supporter well be strongerRevata heard this conversation between the senior monksby means of clairaudienceand he thoughtThis legal issue is going to be contentious and difficultIt would not be appropriate for me to stay away from such a legal issueBut now these monks are comingand I wont be at ease when they crowd me inLet me leave before they arriveAnd he went from Soreyya to SaṅkassaThe senior monks went to Soreyyaand asked where Revata wasThey were toldthat he had gone to SaṅkassaRevata then went from Saṅkassa to KaṇṇakujjaWhen the senior monks went to Saṅkassaand asked where Revata wasthey were toldhe had gone to KaṇṇakujjaAnd Revata went from

Monastic Law and on the summaries he is knowledgeable and competent has a sense of conscience and is afraid of wrongdoing and fond of the trainingIf we ask Revata a question he would be capable of spending the whole night answering just that oneNow soon he will ask a pupil monk to chantOnce the chanting is finished go up to Revata and ask him about these ten practicesSoon afterwards when the chanting was finished Yasa approached Revata bowed sat downIs the saltinhorn practice allowableWhat is the saltinhorn practiceIs it allowable to carry salt in a hornand then eat it whenever the food

supporters And it seems he is gaining supportThey saidThis legal issue is going to be contentious and difficultHow can we get supporters so that we will be strongerAnd it occurred to themVenerable Revata is learned and a master of the tradition he is an expert on the Teaching on the Monastic Law and on the summaries he is knowledgeable and competent has a sense of conscience and is afraid of wrongdoing and fond of the trainingIf we get Revata as a supporter well be strongerThey prepared many monastic requisitesa bowl a robe a sitting mat a needle case a belt a water filter and a water strainerTaking those requisites they traveled by boat upstream to SahajātiAfter disembarking they had a meal at the foot of a treeJust then Venerable Sāḷha was in seclusion wonderingWho speak in accordance with the Teachingthe monks from the east or the monks from PāvāReflecting on the Teaching and the Monastic Law it occurred to himThe monks from the east speak contrary to the Teaching but the monks from Pāvā dontA god from the pure abodes read Sāḷhas mindThen just as a strong man might bend or stretch out his arm so too he disappeared from pure abodes and appeared in front of SāḷhaAnd he said to SāḷhaYoure right Venerable Sāḷha The monks from the east speak contrary to the Teaching but the monks from Pāvā dontSo then take a stand in accordance with the TeachingBoth previously and now do I take a stand in accordance with the TeachingBut I wont reveal my view in case Im appointed to deal with this legal issueThe Vajjian monks then went to Revata and saidVenerable please accept these monastic requisitesNot wanting to accept them he replied There is no need My bowl and robes are completeAt this time a monk called Uttara who had twenty years of seniority was Revatas attendantThe Vajjian monks then went to him and saidPlease accept these monastic requisitesNot wanting to accept them he replied There is no need My bowl and robes are completePeople brought monastic requisites to the BuddhaIf the Buddha received them they were pleasedIf he didnt they brought them to Venerable nanda insteadsaying Venerable please accept these monastic requisitesIt will be as if

Please say what you wantPlease say this to the elderSir please say this in the midst of the SanghaBuddhas appear in the eastern countriesThe monks from the east speak in accordance with the Teaching not so the monks from PāvāHe then went to Revataand told him what he had been asked to sayRevata replied Youre urging me to act contrary to the Teaching and he dismissed UttaraSoon afterwards the Vajjian monks asked UttaraWhat did he sayWe have acted badlySaying Youre urging me to act contrary to the Teaching the elder dismissed meAre you not a senior monk of twenty years standingYes Nevertheless I live with formal support from him because I respect himThe Sangha then gathered to deliberate on that legal issueRevata informed the SanghaPlease I ask the Sangha to listenIf we were to resolve this legal issue here it might be that the monks who started the ten practices would reopen itIf it seems appropriate to the Sangha the Sangha should resolve this legal issue in the place where it aroseThe senior monks then went to Vesālīto deliberate on that legal issueAt that time there was a monk called Sabbakāmī who had been ordained for one hundred and twenty years and was the most senior monk in the world He had been a student of Venerable nanda and was now staying at VesālīRevata said to Sambhūta SāṇavāsīIll be staying in Sabbakāmīs dwellingPlease go to Sabbakāmī at the appropriate time and ask about these ten practicesRevata then entered Sabbakāmīs dwellingAnd Sabbakāmī had his resting place prepared in the room whereas Revata had his prepared in the entrance areaWhen Revata sawthat the old monk did not lie downhe too did not lie downAnd when Sabbakāmī sawthat the tired monk who had just arrived did not lie downhe too did not lie downGetting up early in

group of seven hundred is finishedThe Short Division is finishedThe canonical text of the Short Division is finishedTheravāda Collection on Monastic LawThe chapter on schism in the SanghaThe account of the going forth of the six SakyansAt one time the Buddha was staying at the Mallian town of AnupiyāAt this time a number of wellknown young Sakyans had followed the Buddha in going forthThe Sakyans Mahānāma and Anuruddha were brothersAnuruddha had been brought up in great comfortHe had three stilt housesone for the winter one for the summer and one for the rainy seasonHe spent the four months of the rainy season in the rainyseason house attended on only by female musicians never descending from that houseMahānāma thoughtA number of wellknown young Sakyans have just followed the Buddha in going forthbut noone from our householdPerhaps I or Anuruddha should go forthHe then went to Anuruddha and told him what he had thoughtAnuruddha replied Ive been brought up in great comfort Im not able to go forthYou go forthCome then and Ill teach you the affairs of the household lifeFirst you must plow the fieldsthen sow the seedsand drainand then weedNext you must cut the harvestgather it togetherand make sheavesYou must then thresh itremove the strawand then winnow itbefore you bring it into storageAnd next year you must do the same and the nextBut does the work never stopI cant see any end to itWhen can you enjoy yourself with worldly pleasures free from botherThe work doesnt stopand you wont see any end of itWhile the work was still unfinished our fathers and grandfathers have all diedWell then you go ahead with the affairs of the household lifeIll go forth into homelessnessAnuruddha then went to his mother and saidMum I wish to go forth into homelessnessPlease allow meBoth of you Anuruddha my two sons are dear and beloved to meEven if you died I would lose you against my wishesSo how can I allow you to go forth from home into homelessness while youre still livingA second time Anuruddha asked the same question and got the same replyHe then asked a third timeAt that time the Sakyans were ruled by King Bhaddiyawho was a friend of AnuruddhasAnuruddhas mother considered thisand thought Bhaddiya wont be able to go forth into homelessnessAnd she said to AnuruddhaIf Bhaddiya the King of the Sakyans goes forth then you too may go forthAnuruddha then went to King Baddiya and saidMy going forth depends on yoursDont worry about whether your going forth depends on mine or not Im with youSo just go forth when you likeCome lets go forth togetherIm not able to go forthIm not able to do what you do What can I doYou go forthMy mother told methat I may go forth only if you go forthAnd then you saidDont worry about whether your going forth depends on mine or not Im with youSo just go forth when you likeSo come lets go forth togetherAt that time people spoke the truthand so Bhaddiya said to AnuruddhaPlease wait seven yearsThen well go forth togetherThats too longIm not able to wait for seven yearsThen wait six years five years four years three years two years and well go forth togetherThats too longIm not able to wait for one yearThen wait seven monthsand well go forth togetherThats too longIm not able to wait for seven monthsThen wait six months five months four months three months one month half a monthand well go forth togetherThats too longIm not able to wait for half a monthThen wait seven days while I hand over the rulership to my sons and brothersSeven days isnt long Ill waitSoon afterwards King Bhaddiya Anuruddha nanda Bhagu Kimila and Devadatta with the barber Upāli as the seventh went out to the park with the fourfold army just as they used toAfter going a good distance they turned back the army They then entered a foreign territory removed their ornaments bound them in a bundle with an upper robe and said to UpāliNow turn back UpāliThis is enough for you to live onAs Upāli was returning he thoughtThe Sakyans are temperamentalThinking that Im responsible for the departure of these young men they might have me killedNow if these young Sakyans are going forth into homelessnesswhy shouldnt IUndoing the bundle he hung the goods from a tree saying Whoever sees this may take it as given And he returned to the young SakyansSeeing Upāli comingthey said to himWhy are you coming back UpāliAnd he told what he had doneYou have done the right thingThe Sakyans are indeed temperamentalThinking that you were responsible for our departure they might have killed youThen the young Sakyans taking Upāli with them went to the Buddha bowed sat downVenerable Sir we Sakyans are proudThis barber Upāli has been serving us for a long timePlease let him go forth firstWe will then bow down to him rise up for him raise our joined palms to him and do acts of respect toward himIn this way our Sakyan pride will be subduedAnd the Buddha had Upāli go forth first and afterwards the young SakyansDuring that very rainy season Venerable Bhaddiya realized the three insightsVenerable Anuruddha obtained clairvoyanceVenerable nanda realized streamentrywhereas Devadatta obtained supernormal powers but no stage of awakeningWhen Bhaddiya was in the wilderness at the foot of a tree or in an empty dwelling he frequently exclaimed an inspired utteranceOh what happiness Oh what happinessA number of monks went to the Buddha bowed sat downand told him what was happeningadding No doubt Bhaddiya is dissatisfied with the spiritual lifeIts because hes recalling his former happiness as a king that he is saying thisThe Buddha addressed a certain monkGo monk and in my name say to BhaddiyaBhaddiya the Teacher is calling youSaying Yes Sir he did just thatBhaddiya consented He then went to the Buddha bowed and sat downAnd the Buddha said to himIs it true Bhaddiya that when youre in the wilderness at the foot of a tree or in an empty dwelling you frequently exclaim an inspired utteranceOh what happiness Oh what happinessYes Venerable SirBut why do you say thisFormerly when I was a king I was well protected within and outside the royal compound within and outside of town and within and outside of the countryBut although I was protected and guarded in this way I was fearful agitated and distrustfulBut now Sir when Im in the wilderness at the foot of a tree or in an empty dwelling Im free from fear agitation and distrust Im free from bother relaxed living on whats given by others with a mind as free as a wild animalThis is why I say thisSeeing the significance of this on that occasion the Buddha exclaimed an inspired utteranceThey who have no anger withinGone beyond any kind of existenceHappy free from fear and sorrowEven the gods are unable to see themThe account of DevadattaWhen the Buddha had stayed at Anupiyā for as long as he liked he set out wandering toward KosambīWhen he eventually arrivedhe stayed in Ghositas MonasteryAt this time while in seclusion Devadatta thoughtWho might I inspire to have confidence in me so that Id get much gain and honorAnd it occurred to himPrince Ajātasattu is young and has a bright futureLet me inspire him to have confidence in meIll then get much gain and honorDevadatta put his dwelling in order took his bowl and robes and left for Rājagahawhere he eventually arrivedHe then transformed himself into a boy wearing a snake as a belt and appeared on Prince Ajātasattus lapWhen Ajātasattu became fearful and agitatedDevadatta said to himAre you afraid of me PrinceWho are youIm DevadattaIf you are Venerable Devadatta then please appear in your own formDevadatta abandoned the form of a boy and then stood in front of Ajātasattu wearing his robes and carrying his bowlBy means of this wonder Devadatta was able to inspire Ajātasattu to have confidence in him Ajātasattu then attended on him morning and evening with five hundred carriages and a meal offering of five hundred dishes of foodOvercome by gain honor and fameDevadatta started desiring to lead the Sangha of monksBut with the appearance of that thought his supernormal powers disappearedAt that time Kakudha the Koḷiyan the attendant to Venerable Mahāmoggallāna had recently died and been reborn in a mindmade bodyHe had acquired a bodytwo or three times the size of the fields of a Magadhan villageYet he harmed neither himself nor others with that bodySoon afterwards the god Kakudha approached Mahāmoggallāna bowed downand told himabout Devadattas desireand the disappearance of his supernormal powersHe then bowed down circumambulated Mahāmoggallāna with his right side toward him and disappeared on the spotMahāmoggallāna then went to the Buddha bowed sat downand told him all that had happenedThe Buddha said But Moggallāna have you read Kakudhas mindso that you know that all he says is just so and not otherwiseI have Venerable SirRemember these words MoggallānaSoon that fool will show himself as he truly isDiscussion of the five kinds of teachersMoggallāna there are five kinds of teachers in the worldOne kind of teacher is impure in behavior while claiming it is pureHis disciples know about his impure behaviorbut think It would be unpleasant for him if we inform the householdersYet its because of him that were honored with gifts of robes almsfood dwellings and medicines How then can we inform themHe will be known through his own actionsThe disciples conceal the impure behavior of such a teacherAnd the teacher expects his disciples to conceal itAnother kind of teacher is impure in livelihood while claiming it is pureHis disciples know about his impure livelihoodbut think It would be unpleasant for him if we inform the householdersYet its because of him that were honored with gifts of robes almsfood dwellings and medicines How then can we inform themHe will be known through his own actionsThe disciples conceal the impure livelihood of such a teacherAnd the teacher expects his disciples to conceal itStill another kind of teacher gives impure teachings while claiming they are pureHis disciples know about his impure teachingsbut think It would be unpleasant for him if we inform the householdersYet its because of him that were honored with gifts of robes almsfood dwellings and medicines How then can we inform themHe will be known through his own actionsThe disciples conceal the impure teachings of such a teacherAnd the teacher expects his disciples to conceal themStill another kind of teacher gives impure explanations while claiming they are pureHis disciples know about his impure explanationsbut think It would be unpleasant for him if we inform the householdersYet its because of him that were honored with gifts of robes almsfood dwellings and medicines How then can we inform themHe will be known through his own actionsThe disciples conceal the impure explanations of such a teacherAnd the teacher expects his disciples to conceal themStill another kind of teacher has impure knowledge and vision while claiming they are pureHis disciples know about his impure knowledge and visionbut think It would be unpleasant for him if we inform the householdersYet its because of him that were honored with gifts of robes almsfood dwellings and medicines How then can we inform themHe will be known through his own actionsThe disciples conceal the impure knowledge and vision of such a teacherAnd the teacher expects his disciples to conceal itBut in my case Moggallāna I claim my behavior is pure because it isMy disciples dont conceal my behaviorand I dont expect them to do soI claim my livelihood is pure I claim my teachings are pure I claim my explanations are pure I claim my knowledge and vision are pure because they areMy disciples dont conceal my knowledge and visionand I dont expect them to do soWhen the Buddha had stayed at Kosambī for as long as he liked he set out wandering toward RājagahaWhen he eventually arrivedhe stayed in the Bamboo Grove the squirrel sanctuaryThen a number of monks went to the Buddha bowed sat downVenerable Sir Prince Ajātasattu attends on Devadatta morning and evening with five hundred carriagesand a meal offering of five hundred dishes of foodDont envy Devadatta monks his gain honor and fameSo long as Prince Ajātasattu treats him like this Devadatta can be expected to decline in good qualitiesJust as a fierce dog would get even more fierce if you break a gall bladder on its noseso too so long as Prince Ajātasattu treats like this Devadatta can be expected to decline in good qualitiesDevadattas gain honor and fame will cause his destruction and ruinJust as a plantain banana tree produces fruit for its own destruction and ruinso too do Devadattas gain honor and fame cause his own destruction and ruinJust as a bamboo produces fruit for its own destruction and ruinso too do Devadattas gain honor and fame cause his own destruction and ruinJust as a naḷa reed produces fruit for its own destruction and ruinso too do Devadattas gain honor and fame cause his own destruction and ruinJust as a mule becomes pregnant for its own destruction and ruinso too do Devadattas gain honor and fame cause his own destruction and ruinThe fruit destroys the plantainAnd the bamboo and the reedHonor destroys the bad personAs the fetus destroys the muleThe first section for recitation is finishedThe legal procedure of announcementSoon afterwards the Buddha was seated giving a teaching surrounded by a large gathering of people including the KingThen Devadatta got up from his seat put his upper robe over one shoulder raised his joined palms and saidVenerable Sir youre now old and close to the end of your lifeYou should live free from bother and enjoy the happiness of the present life Hand the Sangha of monks over to meLet me lead the SanghaLet it be Devadatta dont think of leading the Sangha of monksA second time Devadatta said the same thing and got the same replyHe then said it a third timeand the Buddha repliedI wouldnt even hand the Sangha over to Sāriputta and Mogallāna so why then to you a wretched devourer of junkDevadatta thoughtThe Buddha disparages me in front of a gathering that includes the king as a devourer of junk while praising Sāriputta and Mogallānaand he bowed down in anger circumambulated the Buddha with his right side toward him and leftThis was the first time Devadatta had ill will toward the BuddhaSoon afterwards the Buddha addressed the monksWell then the Sangha should do a legal procedure to announce the following about Devadatta in RājagahaPreviously Devadatta had one nature now he has

DevadattaPreviously Devadatta had one nature now he has anotherWhatever Devadatta does by body or speech has nothing to do with the Buddha the Teaching or the Sangha but only with DevadattaThe foolish people there those with little faith and confidence saidThese Sakyan ascetics are envious of Devadattas gain and honorBut the wise ones those with faith and confidence saidThis must be a serious matter in that the Buddha has an announcement made about Devadatta in RājagahaThe account of Prince AjātasattuSoon afterwards Devadatta went to Prince Ajātasattu and saidFormerly Prince people were longlived but now they are shortlivedIts possible that you might die while still a princeSo kill your father and become the KingAnd Ill kill the Buddha and become the BuddhaAjātasattu thoughtVenerable Devadatta is powerful and mighty He would knowSo he bound a dagger to his thigh and fearful and agitated he hastily entered the royal compound in the middle of the dayThe officials in the royal compound saw Ajātasattus strange behaviorand seized himWhen they examined him they found the dagger tied to his thigh They asked himwhat he was up toI want to kill my fatherWho has instigated

nothing to do with the Buddha the Teaching or the Sangha but only with DevadattaAnd he fired those officials who had suggestedto execute the Prince Devadattaand the Sanghahe demoted those who had suggestedto execute the Prince and Devadattaand he promoted those who had suggestedto act according to the Kings ordersThe King then said to AjātasattuWhy do you want to kill meI want to rule sirIf you want to rule the kingdom is yours And he handed the rulership over to the PrinceThe sending of assassinsSoon afterwards Devadatta went to Ajātasattu and saidGreat king tell your men to kill the ascetic GotamaAnd the King told his menDo as Venerable Devadatta saysDevadatta then told one manGo to such and such a place where the ascetic Gotama is stayingKill him and return via this pathOn that path he stationed two men sayingKill the man who comes along this path and return via that pathOn that path he stationed four men sayingKill the two men who come along this path and return via that pathOn that path he stationed eight men sayingKill the four men who come along this path and return via that pathOn that path he stationed sixteen men sayingKill the eight men who come along this path and then returnSoon afterwards that one man took a sword and shield fastened on a bow and quiver and approached the Buddha When he got close he became fearful and agitated his body rigidThe Buddha saw himCome dont be afraidHe then placed his sword and shield to one side put down his bow and quiver and went up to the Buddha He bowed down with his head at the Buddhas feet and saidSir Ive committed an offense Foolishly deludedly and unskillfully I came here with an evil mind intent on murderPlease accept my confession for my future restraintCertainly you have committed an offense Foolishly deludedly and unskillfully you acted like thisBut since you acknowledge your offense and you make amends for it in accordance with the Teaching I accept your confessionFor this is called growth in the training of the noble onesthat is acknowledging an offense making amends in accordance with the Teaching and undertaking restraint for the futureThe Buddha then gave him a progressive teachingtalk on generosity talk on morality talk on heaven and he revealed the danger degradation and defilement in worldly pleasures and the benefit of renunciationWhen the Buddha knew that his mind was ready supple without hindrances joyful and confident he revealed the teaching unique to the Buddhassuffering its origin its end and the pathAnd just as a clean and stainless cloth takes the dye properlyso too while he was sitting right there that man experienced the stainless vision of the TruthAnything that has a beginning has an endHe had seen the Truth had reached understood and penetrated it he had gone beyond doubt and uncertainty had attained to confidence and had become independent of others in the Teachers instruction And he said to the BuddhaWonderful Sir wonderfulJust as one might set upright what had been overturned or reveal what was hidden or show the way to one who was lost or bring a lamp into the darknessso that one with eyes might see whats therejust so has the Buddha made the Teaching clear in many waysI go for refuge to the Buddha to the Teaching and to the Sangha of monksPlease accept me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for lifeThe Buddha then said to himDont go back along this path go along that one And he sent him down a different pathThe two men thoughtWhy is it taking that one man so long to arriveAs they were walking along that path in the opposite direction they saw the Buddha seated at the foot of a treeThey approached him bowed and sat downAnd the Buddha gave them a progressive teaching and they had become independent of others in the Teachers instruction They then said to the BuddhaWonderful Sir Please accept us as lay followers who have gone for refuge for lifeThe Buddha then said to themDont go back along this path go along that one And he sent them down a different pathThe four men the eight men the sixteen men thoughtWhy is it taking those eight men so long to arriveAs they were walking along that path in the opposite direction they saw the Buddha seated at the foot of a treeThey approached him bowed and sat downAnd the Buddha gave them a progressive teaching and they had become independent of others in the Teachers instruction They then said to the BuddhaWonderful Sir Please accept us as lay followers who have gone for refuge for lifeSoon afterwards that one man went to Devadatta and saidI wasnt able to kill him SirHes powerful and mighty that BuddhaForget itDont kill the ascetic GotamaIll do it myselfThe act of causing the Buddha to bleedSoon afterwards the Buddha was walking up and down in the shade of the Vulture PeakDevadatta climbed the peak and threw down a large stone thinkingWith this Ill kill the ascetic GotamaBut the stone got stuck in the junction of two outcropsA chip flew off hitting the Buddhas foot and causing it to bleedThe Buddha looked up and said to DevadattaFoolish man you have made much demerit With an evil mind intent on murder you have made the Buddha bleedSoon afterwards the Buddha addressed the monksWith an evil mind intent on murder Devadatta has made the Buddha bleed This is his first action with immediate resultsWhen the monks heardthat Devadatta was trying to murder the Buddhathey walked back and forth on all sides of the Buddhas dwelling trying to protect the Buddha by reciting loudlyThe Buddha heard that loud sound of recitationHe asked nanda what it wasand nanda told himThe Buddha said Well then nanda tell those monks in my namethat the Teacher is calling themSaying Yes Sir he did just thatThe monks consented They then went to the Buddha bowed and sat downThe Buddha said to themIts impossible monks for anyone to kill me through an act of violenceThe Buddha will not attain final extinguishment through an act of violenceMonks there are five kinds of teachers in the worldOne kind of teacher is impure in behavior while claiming it is pureHis disciples know about his impure behaviorbut think It would be unpleasant for him if we inform the householdersYet its because of him that were honored with gifts of robes almsfood dwellings and medicines How then can we inform themHe will be known through his own actionsThe disciples conceal the impure behavior of such a teacherAnd the teacher expects his disciples to conceal itAnother kind of teacher is impure in livelihood gives impure teachings gives impure explanations has impure knowledge and vision while claiming they are pureHis disciples know about his impure knowledge and visionbut think It would be unpleasant for him if we inform the householdersYet its because of him that were honored with gifts of robes almsfood dwellings and medicines How then can we inform themHe will be known through his own actionsThe disciples conceal the impure knowledge and vision of such a teacherAnd the teacher expects his disciples to conceal itBut in my case I claim my behavior is pure because it isMy disciples dont conceal my behaviorand I dont expect them to do soI claim my livelihood is pure I claim my teachings are pure I claim my explanations are pure I claim my knowledge and vision are pure because they are My disciples dont conceal my knowledge and vision and I dont expect them to do soIts impossible for anyone to kill me through an act of violenceThe Buddha will not attain final extinguishment through an act of violenceGo to your dwellings monksI dont need any protectionThe letting loose of NāḷāgiriAt that time in Rājagaha there was a violent elephant called Nāḷāgiri a killer of humansDevadatta then entered Rājagaha went to the elephant stables and said to the elephant keepersWe who are relatives of the King are capable of getting people promoted and getting them a raise in salarySo then when the ascetic Gotama comes walking along this street release the elephant Nāḷāgiri down this same streetYes SirOne morning soon afterwards the Buddha robed up took his bowl and robe and entered Rājagaha for alms together with a number of monksAnd the Buddha walked down that very streetWhen the elephant keepers saw the Buddha comingthey released Nāḷāgiri down the same streetNāḷāgiri saw the Buddha comingHe blew his trunk and with ears and tail bristling he charged toward the BuddhaWhen the monks saw Nāḷāgiri comingthey said to the BuddhaThis elephant coming down the street is Nāḷāgiri a violent killer of humansPlease retreat SirCome dont be afraidIts impossible for anyone to kill the Buddha through an act of violenceThe Buddha will not attain final extinguishment through an act of violenceA second timeand a third time those monks said the same thing to the Buddhaeach time getting the same replyOn that occasion people had ascended their stilt houses and even their roofsThe foolish people with little faith and confidence saidThe elephant will hurt the handsome great asceticBut the wise people with faith and confidence saidSoon the great man and the great elephant will meet in battleThe Buddha then pervaded Nāḷāgiri with a mind of loveFeeling it Nāḷāgiri lowered his trunk went up to the Buddha and stood in front of himAnd while stroking Nāḷāgiri on the forehead with his right hand the Buddha spoke these versesDo not elephant attack a great manPainful it is to attack a great manFor a killer of a great manThe next rebirth is not goodDont be intoxicated or heedlessFor the heedless are not reborn wellOnly do those thingsThat will take you to a good rebirthNāḷāgiri sucked the dust from the Buddhas feet with his trunk and scattered it overhead He then walked backwards while looking at the Buddhaand returned to his own spot in the elephant stablesThat is how tame Nāḷāgiri had becomeOn that occasion people chanted this verseSome are tamed with sticksAnd with goads and whipsWithout stick or swordThe great sage tamed the elephantAnd people complained and criticized himHow evil he is this Devadatta how benighted in that he tries to kill the ascetic Gotama so powerful and mightyDevadattas gain and honor declinedwhereas those of the Buddha increasedThe account of the request for the five pointsBecause of decline in material support and loss of respect Devadatta and his followers were only invited to meals after repeatedly askingPeople complained and criticized themHow can the Sakyan ascetics eat at invitations after repeatedly askingWho doesnt like nice food Who doesnt prefer tasty foodThe monks heard the complaints of those peopleand the monks of few desires complained and criticized those monksHow can Devadatta and his followers eat at invitations after repeatedly askingThey told the Buddha Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned DevadattaIs it true Devadatta that you do thisIts true Sir After rebuking him the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monksWell then for monks eating among families Ill lay down a rule against eating in groups of more than three for these three reasonsfor the restraint of bad peoplefor the ease of good monks stopping those with bad desires from creating a faction and then splitting the Sanghaand out of compassion for familiesAnyone eating in a group is to be dealt with according to the ruleSoon afterwards Devadatta went to see Kokālika Kaṭamodakatissaka Khaṇḍadeviyāputta and Samuddadatta and he said to themCome lets create a schism in the Sangha of the ascetic Gotama a break in transmissionKokālika said to DevadattaThe ascetic Gotama is powerful and mightyHow can we achieve thisWell lets go to the ascetic Gotama and request five thingsSir in many ways the Buddha praises fewness of wishes contentment erasing of defilements ascetic practices being inspiring reduction in things and being energeticAnd there are five things that lead to just thatIt would be good Sir if the monks stayed in the wilderness for life and whoever stays near an inhabited area would commit an offenseif they ate only almsfood for life and whoever accepts an invitational meal would commit an offenseif they wore ragrobes for life and whoever accepts a robe from a householder would commit an offenseif they live at the foot of a tree for life and whoever takes shelter would commit an offenseif they didnt eat fish or meat for life and whoever does would commit an offenseThe ascetic Gotama wont allow thisWell then be able to win people over with these five pointsKokālika said It might be possible to create a schism in the Sangha with these five pointsfor people have confidence in austerityDevadatta and his followers then went to the Buddha bowed sat downand Devadatta made his requestThe Buddha replied No DevadattaThose who wish may stay in the wilderness and those who wish may live near an inhabited areaThose who wish may eat only almsfood and those who wish may accept invitationsThose who wish may wear ragrobes and those who wish may accept robes from householdersI have allowed the foot of a tree as resting place for eight months of the yearas well as fish and meat which are pure in three respectsone hasnt seen heard or suspected that the animal was specifically killed to feed a monasticDevadatta thoughtThe Buddha doesnt allow the five pointsand he was glad and elated He got up from his seat bowed down circumambulated the Buddha with his right side toward him and left with his followersDevadatta then entered Rājagaha and won people over with the five pointssaying The ascetic Gotama doesnt agree to thembut we practice in accordance with themThe foolish people there with little faith and confidence saidThese Sakyan ascetics are practicing asceticism and they live for the sake of erasing defilementsBut the acetic Gotama lives in luxury and has chosen to live in abundanceBut the wise people who had faith and confidence complained and criticized DevadattaHow can Devadatta pursue schism in the Sangha of the Buddha a break in transmissionThe monks heard the criticism of those peopleand the monks of few desires complained and criticized him in the same wayThey then told the Buddha Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned DevadattaHe said Is it true Devadatta that youre pursuing schism in the Sangha a break in transmissionIts true SirLet it be Devadattadont create a schism in the SanghaSchism in the Sangha is a serious matterWhoever creates a schism in a united Sangha does a bad act with effect for an eon he is boiled in hell for an eonBut whoever unites a divided Sangha generates the supreme merit he rejoices in heaven for an eonSo let it be Devadattadont create a schism in the SanghaSchism in the Sangha is a serious matterSoon afterwards after robing up in the morning Venerable nanda took his bowl and robe and entered Rājagaha for almsWhen Devadatta saw himhe approached him and saidFrom today on nanda Ill do the observanceday procedure and the legal procedures of the Sangha separate from the Buddha and the Sangha of monksWhen nanda had walked for alms after his meal and after returning from almsround he went to the Buddha bowed sat downand told him what had happenedadding From today Venerable Sir Devadatta has created a schism in the SanghaUnderstanding the significance of this on that occasion the Buddha exclaimed a heartfelt utteranceFor the good doing good is easyFor the bad doing good is hardFor the bad doing evil is easyFor the noble ones doing evil is hardThe second section for recitation is finishedThe account of schism in the SanghaOn the observance day soon afterwards Devadatta got up from his seat and distributed voting tickets sayingWe have gone to the ascetic Gotama and asked for five thingsSir in many ways the Buddha praises fewness of wishes contentment erasing of defilements ascetic practices being inspiring reduction in thingsand being energeticAnd there are five things that lead to just thatIt would be good Sir if the monks stayed in the wilderness for life and whoever stays near an inhabited area would commit an offenseif they didnt eat fish or meat for life and whoever does would commit an offenseThe ascetic Gotama doesnt agree to thembut we practice in accordance with themAny monk who approves of these five things should take a voting ticketOn that occasion five hundred Vajjian monks from Vesālī newly ordained and ignorant were presentThinking This is the Teaching this is the Monastic Law this is the Teachers instruction they took voting ticketsThen after causing a schism in the Sangha Devadatta left for Gayāsīsa together with five hundred monksSoon afterwards Sāriputta and Moggallāna went to the Buddha bowed sat downVenerable Sir Devadatta has split the Sangha and left for Gayāsīsa together with five hundred monksYou have compassion for those five hundred newly ordained monks dont youGo then Sāriputta and Moggallāna before they are affected by misfortune and disasterSaying Yes Sāriputta and Moggallāna got up from their seats bowed down circumambulated the Buddha with their right side toward him and went to GayāsīsaJust then a certain monk who was standing near the Buddha was cryingThe Buddha asked him whyHe replied Even Sāriputta and Moggallāna the Buddhas chief disciples are going to Devadatta because they approve of his teachingIts impossible for Sāriputta and Moggallāna to approve of Devadattas teaching Instead theyve gone to win those monks overOn that occasion Devadatta was seated giving a teaching surrounded by a great gatheringWhen Devadatta saw Sāriputta and Moggallāna cominghe said to the monksSee how welltaught my teaching is in that even Sāriputta and Moggallāna the ascetic Gotamas chief disciples are coming herebecause they approve of my teachingBut Kokālika saidBut Kokālika said Dont trust Sāriputta and MoggallānaThey have bad desires They are in the grip of bad desiresDont worryAnyone who comes to approve of my teaching is welcomeDevadatta invited Venerable Sāriputtato sit on a seat half the height of his ownSaying Theres no need Sāriputta took another seat and sat down to one sideas did MahāmoggallānaAfter spending most of the night instructing inspiring and gladdening the monks with a teaching Devadatta invited Sāriputta sayingThe Sangha of monks is without dullness and drowsinessGive a teaching Sāriputta My back is aching and Ill stretch itDevadatta then folded his upper robe in four and lay down on his right sideBecause he was tired absentminded and heedless he fell asleep in an instantVenerable Sāriputta then used the wonder of mind reading to instruct themand Venerable Mahāmoggallāna used the wonder of supernormal powers to the same effectWhile those monks were being instructed like this they experienced the stainless vision of the TruthAnything that has a beginning has an endAnd Sāriputta addressed those monksLets go to the BuddhaWhoever approves of the teaching of the Buddha should come alongSāriputta and Moggallāna then went to the Bamboo Grove accompanied by those five hundred monksIn the meantime Kokālika woke up Devadatta sayingGet up Devadatta your monks are being led away by Sāriputta and MoggallānaDidnt I tell younot to trust Sāriputta and MoggallānaDidnt I say that they have bad desires that they are in the grip of bad desiresAnd right there warm blood emerged from Devadattas mouthBut Sāriputta and Moggallāna went to the Buddha bowed sat downVenerable Sir it would be good if we could reordain the monks who sided with the schismLet it be Sāriputtadont think of reordaining the monks who sided with the schismInstead have them confess a serious offenseAnd Devadatta how did he treat youJust as you Sir spend most of the night instructing inspiring and gladdening the monks with a teaching and then invite me sayingThe Sangha of monks is without dullness and drowsinessGive a teaching Sāriputta My back is aching and Ill stretch itthats how Devadatta treated usAnd the Buddha addressed the monksOnce upon a time there was a great lake in a wilderness areawith elephants living nearbyThey plunged into the lake pulled up lotus roots and tubers with their trunks gave them a good rinse to remove the mud and then chewed and swallowed themThat gave them beauty and strengthAnd they didnt die or experience deathlike suffering because of thatThen baby elephants tried to imitate those great elephantsThey plunged into the lake pulled up lotus roots and tubers with their trunks but didnt give them a good rinse to remove the mud and then chewed and swallowed them while muddyThat didnt give them any beauty or strengthAnd they died or experienced deathlike suffering because of thatJust so by imitating me Devadatta will die miserablyWhile the great elephant removes the earthEats the tuber and is alert in the riversHes like a baby elephant thats eaten mudBy imitating me he will die miserablyA monk who has eight qualities is qualified to act as messengerHe listens and communicates he learns and remembers he understands and gets things across hes skilled in what is and what isnt relevant hes not argumentativeBecause he has these eight qualities Sāriputta is qualified to act as messengerHe doesnt tremble when faced withA gathering of fierce debatersHe doesnt mangle his wordsOr fail to get the instruction acrossHe speaks with confidenceAnd isnt agitated when questionedThis kind of monk indeedIs qualified to act as messengerBecause he is overcome by and immersed in eight bad qualities Devadatta is irredeemably destined to an eon in hellBecause Devadatta is overcome by and immersed in gainlack of gainlack of famelack of honorbad desiresand bad friends he is irredeemably destined to an eon in hellIts good for a monk to overcome whatever gain hes affected by whatever lack of gain hes affected bywhatever fame hes affected bywhatever lack of fame hes affected bywhatever honor hes affected bywhatever lack of honor hes affected bywhatever bad desires hes affected byor whatever bad friends hes affected byFor what reason should a monk overcome these thingsIf he doesnt overcome whatever gain hes affected by corruptions distress and fevers may arise But if he overcomes whatever gain hes affected by he wont have those corruptions distress and feversIf he doesnt overcome whatever lack of gain hes affected bywhatever fame hes affected bywhatever lack of fame hes affected bywhatever honor hes affected bywhatever lack of honor hes affected bywhatever bad desires hes affected byor whatever bad friends hes affected by corruptions distress and fevers may arise But if he overcomes whatever bad friends hes affected by he wont have those corruptions distress and feversTherefore monks you should overcome whatever gain youre affected by whatever lack of gain youre affected bywhatever fame youre affected bywhatever lack of fame youre affected bywhatever honor youre affected bywhatever lack of honor youre affected bywhatever bad desires youre affected byand whatever bad friends youre affected byIts in this way you should train yourselvesBecause he is overcome by and immersed in three bad qualities Devadatta is irredeemably destined to an eon in hellWhat threeBad desires bad friends after minor success he stopped short of the goalNoone with bad desiresIs ever reborn in this worldIn this way you may knowThe destination of those with bad desiresDesignated as wiseAgreed upon as welltrainedIt was as if he was shining with fameI have heard Devadatta was like thisHe was heedlessAnd after hurting the BuddhaHes gone to the Avīci hellFrightful and with four doorsIf you hurt one free from angerOne who doesnt do anything badYou experience that evil yourselfBeing evilminded and disrespectfulYou might think to polluteThe ocean with a pot of poisonBut you would not be able to do soFor the ocean is frightfully largeIts the same with the BuddhaIf by speech one tries to harm himWith his right conduct and peaceful mindThat speech doesnt affect himThe wise make friends with such a personAnd they associate with himThe monk who follows his pathAchieves the end of sufferingUpālis questionsOn one occasion Upāli went to the Buddha bowed sat downVenerable Sir we speak of fracture in the SanghaBut how is there fracture in the Sangha yet not schism in the SanghaAnd

nun cannot cause a schism in the Sangha even if she makes an effort to cause a schism A trainee nuna novice monk a novice nun a male lay follower or a female lay follower cannot cause a schism in the

chapterThe story at the Bodhi treeHomage to the Buddha the Perfected One the fully Awakened OneAt one time soon after his awakening the Buddha was staying at Uruvelā on the bank of the river Nerañjara at the foot of a Bodhi treeThere the Buddha sat crosslegged for seven days without moving experiencing the bliss of freedomThen in the first part of the night the Buddha reflected on dependent origination in forward and reverse orderIgnorance is a condition for intentional activities intentional activities are a condition for consciousness consciousness is a condition for name and form name and form are a condition for the six sense spheres the six sense spheres are a condition for contact contact is a condition for feeling feeling is a condition for craving craving is a condition for grasping grasping is a condition for existence existence is a condition for birth birth is a condition for old age and death for grief sorrow pain aversion and distress to come to beThis is how there is the origin of this whole mass of sufferingBut with the complete fading away and end of ignorance comes the end of intentional activities with the end of intentional activities comes the end of consciousness with the end of consciousness comes the end of name and form with the end of name and form comes the end of the six sense spheres with the end of the six sense spheres comes the end of contact with the end of contact comes the end of feeling with the end of feeling comes the end of craving with the end of craving comes the end of grasping with the end of grasping comes the end of existence with the end of existence comes the end of birth with the end of birth comes the end of old age and death and the end of sorrow lamentation pain displeasure and distressThis is how there is the end of this whole mass of sufferingSeeing the significance of this the Buddha exclaimed an inspired utteranceWhen things become clearTo the energetic brahmin who practices absorptionThen all his doubts are dispelledSince he understands the natural order and its conditionsIn the middle part of the night the Buddha again reflected on dependent origination in forward and reverse orderIgnorance is a condition for intentional activities intentional activities are a condition for consciousness consciousness is a condition for name and form This is how there is the origin of this whole mass of suffering This is how there is the end of this whole mass of sufferingSeeing the significance of this the Buddha exclaimed an inspired utteranceWhen things become clearTo the energetic brahmin who practices absorptionThen all his doubts are dispelledSince hes understood the end of the conditionsIn the last part of the night the Buddha again reflected on dependent origination in forward and reverse orderIgnorance is a condition for intentional activities intentional activities are a condition for consciousness consciousness is a condition for name and form This is how there is the origin of this whole mass of suffering This is how there is the end of this whole mass of sufferingSeeing the significance of this the Buddha exclaimed an inspired utteranceWhen things become clearTo the energetic brahmin who practices absorptionHe defeats the army of the Lord of DeathLike the sun shining in the skyThe story at the Bodhi tree is finishedThe story at the goatherds banyan treeAfter seven days the Buddha came out from that stillness and went from the Bodhi tree to a goatherds banyan tree There too he sat crosslegged for seven days without moving experiencing the bliss of freedomThen a conceited brahmin approached the Buddhaexchanged pleasantries with himGood Gotama how is one a brahmin What are the things that make one a brahminSeeing the significance of this the Buddha exclaimed an inspired utteranceThe brahmin who has shut out bad qualitiesWho is humble free from flaws and selfcontrolledWho has reached the end of knowledge and has lived the spiritual lifeRighteously without being full of himselfHe may proclaim himself a brahminThe story at the goatherds banyan tree is finishedThe story at the powderpuff treeAfter seven days the Buddha came out from that stillness and went from the goatherds banyan tree to a powderpuff tree There too he sat crosslegged for seven days without moving experiencing the bliss of freedomJust then an unseasonal storm was approaching with seven days of rain cold winds and cloudsMucalinda the dragon king came out from his abode And he encircled the body of the Buddha with seven coils and spread his large hood over his head thinkingMay the Buddha not be hot or cold nor be touched by horseflies or mosquitoes by the wind or the burning sun or by creeping animals and insectsAfter seven days when he knew the sky was clear Mucalinda unraveled his coils from the Buddhas body and transformed himself into a young brahmin He then stood in front of the Buddha venerating him with joined palms raisedSeeing the significance of this the Buddha exclaimed an inspired utteranceSeclusion is bliss for the contented oneFor the one who sees the Truth that he has heardKindness to the world is happinessFor the one who is harmless to living beingsDispassion for the world is happinessFor the one who overcomes sensualityBut removing the conceit I amThis indeed is the highest blissThe story at the powderpuff tree is finishedThe story at the apeflower treeAfter seven days the Buddha came out from that stillness and went from the powderpuff tree to an apeflower tree There too he sat crosslegged for seven days without moving experiencing the bliss of freedomJust then the merchants Tapussa and Bhallika were traveling from Ukkala to that areaThen a god who was a former relative of theirs said to themSirs a Buddha who has just attained awakening is staying at the foot of an apeflower treeGo to that Buddha and offer him baked goods and honeyThat will be for your benefit and happiness for a long timeAnd they took baked goods and honey and approached the Buddha They bowed downVenerable Sir please accept the baked goods and honey from us That will be to our benefit and happiness for a long timeThe Buddha thoughtBuddhas dont receive with their handsIn what should I receive the baked goods and honeyThen reading the mind of the Buddha the four great kings offered him four stone bowls from the four directions sayingHere Sir please receive the baked goods and honey in theseAfter receiving the baked goods and honey in one of the valuable stone bowls the Buddha ate themWhen Tapussa and Bhallika knew that the Buddha had finished his meal they bowed down with their head at his feet and saidSir we take refuge in the Buddha and the Teaching Please accept us as lay followers who have gone for refuge for lifeBy means of the double refuge they became the first lay followers in the worldThe story at the apeflower tree is finishedThe account of the supreme beings requestAfter seven days the Buddha came out from that stillness and went from the apeflower tree to a goatherds banyan treeand he stayed thereThen while in seclusion the Buddha thought thisI have discovered this profound truth so hard to see so hard to comprehend Its peaceful and sublime subtle beyond the intellect and knowable only to the wiseBut human beings delight in holding on find pleasure in holding on rejoice in holding onand because of that its hard for them to see causal relationships dependent originationThis too is very hard for them to see the stilling of all intentional activities the giving up of all ownership the stopping of craving fading away ending extinguishmentIf I were to teach this truth others would not understand and that would be wearying and troublesome for meAnd spontaneously these verses never heard before occurred to the BuddhaWhat Ive discovered with difficultyTheres no point in making it knownFor those overcome by sensual desire and ill willThis truth is hard to understandThose who are excited by sensual desireObstructed by a mass of darknessWont see what goes against the streamWhats subtle and refined profound and hard to seeWhen the Buddha reflected like this he inclined to inactivity and not to teachingJust then the supreme being Sahampati read the mind of the Buddha And he thoughtThe world is lost its perishedfor the Buddha perfected and fully awakened inclines to inaction and not to teachingThen just as a strong man might bend or stretch out his arm so Sahampati disappeared from the world of supreme beings and appeared in front of the BuddhaHe put his upper robe over one shoulder placed his right knee on the ground raise his joined palms and saidPlease teach Venerable Sir please teachThere are beings with little dust in their eyes who are ruined because of not hearing the Teaching There will be those who understandThis is what Sahampati said and he addedEarlier among the MagadhansAn impure teaching appeared conceived by defiled peopleOpen this door to the deathlessLet them hear the Truth discovered by the Pure OneJust as one standing on a rocky mountain topWould see the people all aroundJust so Allseeing Wise OneAscend the temple of the TruthBeing rid of sorrow look upon the peopleSunk in grief overcome by birth and old ageStand up Victorious HeroDebtless One Leader of travelers go walking in the worldSir proclaim the TeachingThere will be those who understandTwice the Buddha repeated to Sahampati what he had thoughtBut human beings delight in holding on find pleasure in holding on rejoice in holding onand because of that its hard for them to see causal relationships dependent originationThis too is very hard for them to see the stilling of all intentional activities the giving up of all ownership the stopping of craving fading away ending extinguishmentand on both occasions Sahampati repeated his requestThere will be those who understandThe Buddha understood the request of that supreme being and because he had compassion for the world he surveyed the world with the eye of a BuddhaHe saw beings with little dust in their eyes and with much dust in their eyes with sharp faculties and with dull faculties with good qualities and with bad qualities those easy to teach and those difficult to teach and he even saw some who regarded the next world as dangerous and to be avoidedIt was just like a lotus pond with lotuses born and grown in water some remain submerged in the water without rising out of it others reach the surface of the water and others still rise out of the water without being touched by itWhen he had seen this the Buddha replied to Sahampati in verseOpen to them are the doors to the deathlessMay those who hear give rise to faithSeeing trouble supreme beingI did not speak the sublime and subtle TruthSahampati thoughtThe Buddha has consented to teach He bowed down circumambulated the Buddha with his right side toward him and disappeared right thereThe account of the supreme beings request is finishedThe account of the group of fiveThe Buddha thoughtWho should I teach firstWho will understand this Teaching quicklyAnd it occurred to himlāra Kālāma is wise and competent and has for a long time had little dust in his eyesPerhaps I should teach him first He will understand this Teaching quicklyBut an invisible god informed the Buddha Sir lāra Kālāma died seven days agoand the Buddha also knew this for himselfHe thoughtlāra Kālāmas loss is greatfor if he had heard this Teaching he would have understood it quicklyAgain the Buddha thoughtWho should I teach firstWho will understand this Teaching quicklyAnd it occurred to himUdaka Rāmaputta is wise and competent and has for a long time had little dust in his eyesPerhaps I should teach him first He will understand this Teaching quicklyBut an invisible god informed the Buddha Sir Udaka Rāmaputta died last nightand the Buddha also knew this for himselfHe thoughtUdaka Rāmaputtas loss is greatfor if he had heard this Teaching he would have understood it quicklyOnce again the Buddha thoughtWho should I teach firstWho will understand this Teaching quicklyAnd it occurred to himThe group of five monks who supported me while I was striving were of great service to mePerhaps I should teach them firstBut where are they staying nowAnd with superhuman and purified clairvoyance the Buddha saw that the group of five monks were staying near Benares in the dear park at IsipatanaThen after staying at Uruvelā for as long as he liked he set out wandering toward BenaresThe jīvaka ascetic Upaka saw the Buddha traveling between Gayā and the place of awakening And he said to the BuddhaSir your faculties are clear and your skin is pure and brightWho have you gone forth underWho is your teacheror whose teaching do you followThe Buddha replied to Upaka in verseOvercoming all I know allAbandoning all Im not soiled by anythingThrough my own insight Im freed by the ending of cravingSo who should I refer to as a teacherI have no teacherNoone like me existsIn the world with its godsI have no equalFor Im a Perfected OneA teacher supremeI alone am fully awakenedI am cool and extinguishedIm going to the city of KāsiTo set rolling the wheel of the TeachingIn this world immersed in darknessIll beat the drum of the deathlessAccording to your own claim you must be a universal conquerorIndeed those like me are conquerorsThose who have ended the corruptionsI have conquered all bad traitsTherefore Upaka Im a conquerorSaying May it be so Upaka shook his head chose the wrong road and leftThe Buddha continued wandering toward the deer park at Isipatana near Benares When he eventually arrived he approached to the group of five monksSeeing him comingthe group of five made an agreement with one anotherHere comes the ascetic Gotama who has has given up his striving and returned to a life of abundanceWe shouldnt bow down to him stand up for him or receive his bowl and robebut we should prepare a seat If he wishes he may sit downBut as the Buddha approached the group of five monks was unable to keep their agreementOne went to meet him to receive his bowl and robe another prepared a seat another set out water for washing the feet yet another set out a footstool and the last one put out a footscraperThe Buddha sat down on the prepared seatand washed his feetBut they still addressed him by name and as friendThe Buddha said to the group of five monksMonks dont address the Buddha by name or as friendListen Im perfected and fully awakened I have discovered the deathless I will instruct you and teach you the TruthWhen you practice as instructedin this very life you will soon realize with your own insight the supreme goal of the spiritual lifefor which people from good families rightly go forth from home to homelessnessThey repliedFriend Gotama by practicing extreme austerities you didnt gain any superhuman quality any distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of noble ones Since you have given up your striving and returned to a life of abundance how could you now have achieved any of thisThe Buddha saidI havent given up striving and returned to a life of abundanceand he repeated what he had said beforeA second time the group of five monks repeated their questionand a second time the Buddha repeated his replyA third time they repeated their questionand the Buddha then saidDo you remember me ever making such a statementNo SirThen listen Im perfected and fully awakened I have discovered the deathless I will instruct you and teach you the TruthWhen you practice as instructedin this very life you will soon realize with your own insight the supreme goal of the spiritual lifefor which people from good families rightly go forth from home to homelessnessThe Buddha was able to persuade the group of five monksThey then listened to the Buddha paid careful attention and applied their minds to understandAnd the Buddha addressed themThere are these two opposites that should not be pursued by one who has gone forthOne is the devotion to worldly pleasures which is inferior common for the ordinary person ignoble and unbeneficial The other is the devotion to selftorment which is painful ignoble and unbeneficialBy avoiding both these opposites I have awakened to the middle path which produces vision and knowledge which leads to peace insight awakening and extinguishmentAnd what monks is that middle pathIts just this noble eightfold paththat is right view right aim right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness and right stillnessAnd this is noble truth of sufferingbirth is suffering old age is suffering sickness is suffering death is suffering association with what is disliked is suffering separation from what is liked is suffering not getting what one wants is sufferingIn brief the five aspects of existence affected by grasping are sufferingAnd this is noble truth of the origin of sufferingthe craving that leads to rebirth that comes with delight and sensual desire ever delighting in this and thatthat is craving for worldly pleasures craving for existence and craving for nonexistenceAnd this is noble truth of the end of sufferingthe full fading away and ending of that very craving giving it up relinquishing it releasing it letting it goAnd this is noble truth of the path leading to the end of

I had not fully purified my knowledge and vision according to reality of these four noble truths with their three stages and twelve characteristics I didnt claim the supreme full awakening in this world with its gods its lords of death and its supreme beings in this population with its ascetics and brahmins its gods and peopleBut when I had fully purified my knowledge and vision according to reality of these four noble truths with their three stages and twelve characteristics then I did claim the supreme full awakening in this world with its gods its lords of death and its supreme beings in this population with its ascetics and brahmins its gods and peopleAnd knowledge and vision arose in meMy freedom is unshakable this is my last birth now there is no further rebirthThis is what the Buddha said The monks from the group of five were pleased and they rejoiced in the Buddhas expositionAnd while this exposition was being spoken Venerable Koṇḍañña experienced the stainless vision of the TruthAnything that has a beginning has an endWhen the Buddha had set rolling the wheel of the Teaching the earth gods cried outAt Benares in the deer park at Isipatana the Buddha has set rolling

repelled by consciousnessBeing repelled they become desirelessBecause they are desireless they are freedWhen the are freed they know they are freed They understand that birth has come to an end that the spiritual life has been fulfilled that the job has been done that there is no further state of existenceThis is what the Buddha saidThe monks from the group of five were pleased and they rejoiced in the Buddhas expositionAnd while this exposition was being spoken to the monks from the group of five their minds let go and were freed from the corruptionsThen there were six perfected ones in the worldThe account of the group of five is finishedThe first section for recitation is finishedThe account of the going forthAt that time in Benares there was a son of a good family called Yasa the son of a prominent merchant who had been brought up in great comfortHe had three stilt housesone for the winter one for the summer and one for the rainy seasonWhile Yasa was spending the four months of the rainy season in the rainyseason house he was only attended on by female musicians and he did not come down from that houseOn one occasion while he was enjoying himself with worldly pleasures he fell asleep early and so did his attendants When he woke up early the oil lamp was still burningHe saw his attendants sleepingone with a lute in her armpit another with a tabor on her neck still another with a drum in her armpit one with hair disheveled another drooling still another talking in her sleep It was like a charnel ground before his very eyesWhen he saw this the misery became clear and a feeling of repulsion stayed with himHe exclaimed a heartfelt utteranceOh the oppression Oh the afflictionYasa put on his golden shoes and went to the entrance doorSpirits opened the door thinkingNoone should create any obstacle for Yasas going forth into homelessnessHe went to the town gateand again it was opened by spiritsHe then went to the dear park at IsipatanaJust then after getting up early in the morning the Buddha was walking up and down outsideWhen the Buddha saw Yasa coming he came down from his walkingpath and sat down on a prepared seatAs he was getting close to the Buddha Yasa exclaimed the same heartfelt utteranceOh the oppression Oh the afflictionThe Buddha saidThis Yasa isnt oppressive it isnt afflictiveCome and sit down Ill give you a teachingApparently this isnt oppressive apparently its not afflictive excited and joyful Yasa removed his shoes approached the Buddha bowed and sat downThe Buddha then gave Yasa a progressive teachingtalk on generosity talk on morality talk on heaven and he revealed the danger degradation and defilement in worldly pleasures and the benefit of renunciationWhen the Buddha knew that Yasas mind was ready supple without hindrances joyful and confident he revealed the teaching unique to the Buddhassuffering its origin its end and the pathJust as a clean and stainless cloth takes the dye properlyso too while he was sitting right there Yasa experienced the stainless vision of the TruthAnything that has a beginning has an endSoon afterwards Yasas mother went up to his stilt house Not seeing him she went to her husband and saidI cant find your son YasaThe merchant then dispatched horsemen in the four directions and he himself went to the dear park at IsipatanaHe saw the imprints of the golden shoes on the ground and he followed alongWhen the Buddha saw the prominent merchant coming he thoughtLet me use my supernormal powers so that the merchant when he sits down doesnt see Yasa seating next to himAnd he did just thatThe merchant approached the Buddha and saidSir have you seen Yasa by any chancePlease sit down householder Perhaps youll see Yasa seated next to youWhen the merchant heard thishe was elated and joyful and he bowed and sat downThe Buddha then gave him a progressive teachingtalk on generosity talk on morality talk on heaven and he revealed the danger degradation and defilement in worldly pleasures and the benefit of renunciationWhen the Buddha knew that his mind was ready supple without hindrances joyful and confident he revealed the teaching unique to the Buddhassuffering its

Teachers instruction And he said to the BuddhaWonderful Venerable Sir wonderfulJust as one might set upright what had been overturned or reveal what was hidden or show the way to one who was lost or bring a lamp into the darknessso that one with eyes might see whats therejust so has the Buddha made the Teaching clear in many waysI take refuge in the Buddha the Teaching and the Sangha of monksPlease accept me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for lifeAnd he was the first person in the world to become a lay follower by means of the triple refugeWhile his father was given this teaching Yasa reviewed what he had already seen and understood and his mind was freed from the corruptions without graspingThe Buddha realized what had happenedand he thought Yasa is incapable of returning to the lower life to enjoy worldly pleasures as he did while still a householderLet me stop using my supernormal powersAnd he did soThe merchant saw Yasa sitting there and he said to himDear Yasa your mother is grieving and lamenting Please give her back her lifeYasa looked to the Buddhaand the Buddha said to the merchantWhat do you think householder suppose the mind of one such as youwho has seen and understood the Truth with the trainees knowledge and visionwhile reviewing what he had already seen and understood were freed from the corruptions without graspingWould he be able to return to the lower life to enjoy worldly pleasures as he did while still a householderDefinitely notBut this is what has happened to YasaHe is now unable to return to the lower lifeIts a great gain for Yasa that his mind has been freed from the corruptions without graspingSir please accept todays meal from me with Yasa as your attendantAnd the Buddha consented by remaining silentKnowing that the Buddha had consented the merchant got up from his seat bowed down circumambulated the Buddha with his right side toward him and leftSoon after the merchant had left Yasa said to the BuddhaSir I wish

Buddha asked a secondand a third timeand on both occasions Uruvelā Kassapa replied as beforeThe Buddha then said Perhaps it wont harm me Come on Kassapa allow me to stay in the fire hutWell then do as you likeThe Buddha entered the fire hut and prepared a straw mat He sat down crossed his legs straightened his body and established mindfulness in front of himWhen the dragon saw that the Buddha had entered he was displeased and emitted smokeThe Buddha thoughtLet me overpower this dragon using fire against fire but without harming it in the slightest wayThe Buddha then used his supernormal powers so that he too emitted smokeThe dragon not being able to contain his rage emitted flamesThe Buddha entered the fire element and he too emitted flamesWith both of them emitting flames it was as if the fire hut was ablaze and burningThose dreadlocked ascetics gathered around the fire hut sayingThe Great Ascetic is handsome but the dragon is harming himThe next morning the Buddha had overcome that dragon using fire against fire but without harming it in the slightest way He put it in his almsbowl and showed it to Uruvelā KassapaThis is your dragon Kassapa his fire overpowered by fireUruvelā Kassapa thoughtThe Great Ascetic is powerful and mightyusing fire against fire he has overcome that fierce and terribly poisonous dragon king with its supernormal powers But hes not a perfected one

Buddha and saidIts time Great Ascetic the meal is readyAnd who was it that visited you last nightThat was the four great kings They came to me to hear the TeachingUruvelā Kassapa thoughtThe Great

groveThe fourth wonder is finishedAt this time Uruvelā Kassapa was holding a great sacrifice and the whole of Aṅga and Magadha wanted to attend with much food of various kindsUruvelā Kassapa considered thisand thought If the Great Ascetic performs a wonder of supernormal power for the great crowd his gain and honor will increase whereas mine will decreaseI hope he doesnt come tomorrowThe Buddha read the mind of Uruvelā Kassapa He then went to Uttarakuru collected almsfood there ate it at the Anotatta lake and stayed there for the days meditationThe next morning Uruvelā Kassapa went to

fragrant and delicious tooPlease eat it if you wishTheres no need You deserve it and you should eat itUruvelā Kassapa thoughtThe Great Ascetic is powerful and mighty in that he dismissed me then took a fruit from a roseapple tree and still arrived first in the fire hut But hes not a perfected one like meThe Buddha ate his meal and continued to stay in the same forest groveThe next morning Uruvelā Kassapa went to the Buddha and saidIts time Great Ascetic the meal is readyYou just go ahead Kassapa Ill come After dismissing him he took a fruit from a mango tree not far from the roseapple tree he took a fruit from an emblic myrobalan tree not far from the roseapple tree he took a fruit from a chebulic myrobalan tree not far from the roseapple tree he went to Tāvatisa heaven took a flower from an orchid tree and then arrived first in the fire hut where he sat downWhen Uruvelā Kassapa saw the Buddha sitting there he said to himWhich path did you takeI left first but youre already hereThe Buddha told him what he had done and addedThis orchid tree flower is colorful and fragrantPlease take it if you wishTheres no need You deserve it and you should keep itUruvelā Kassapa thoughtThe Great Ascetic is powerful and mighty in that he dismissed me then went to Tāvatisa heaven took an orchid tree flower and still arrived first in the fire hut But hes not a perfected one like meSoon afterwards those dreadlocked ascetics wanted to tend the sacred fire but were unable to split the logsThey thoughtThis must be because of the supernormal powers of the Great AsceticThe Buddha said to Uruvelā KassapaMay the logs be split KassapaYes may they he repliedAnd five hundred logs were split all at onceUruvelā Kassapa thoughtThe Great Ascetic is powerful and mighty in that he can split logs just like that But hes not a perfected one like meThose ascetics still wanted to tend the sacred fire but were unable to light itThey thoughtThis must be because of the supernormal powers of the Great AsceticThe Buddha said to Uruvelā KassapaMay the fire be lit KassapaYes may it he repliedAnd five hundred fires were lit all at onceUruvelā Kassapa thoughtThe Great Ascetic is powerful and mighty in that he can light fires just like that But hes not a perfected one like meWhen those ascetics had tended the sacred fires they were unable to extinguish themThey thoughtThis must be because of the supernormal powers of the Great AsceticThe Buddha said to Uruvelā KassapaMay the fires be extinguished KassapaYes may they he repliedAnd the five hundred fires were extinguished all at onceUruvelā Kassapa thoughtThe Great Ascetic is powerful and mighty in that he can extinguish fires just like that But hes not a perfected one like meAt that time it was midwinter when the days are cold and the snow is falling During this period those ascetics emerged from the Nerañjara river immersed themselves in it and repeatedly emerged and immersed themselvesThen the Buddha manifested five hundred pans with hot coals where those ascetics could warm themselves after coming out of the waterThey thoughtThese were no doubt created by the supernormal powers of the Great AsceticUruvelā Kassapa thoughtThe Great Ascetic is powerful and mighty in that he can manifest so many pans with hot coals But hes not a perfected one like meSoon afterwards an unseasonal storm poured down producing a great floodThe place where the Buddha was staying was inundatedThe Buddha thoughtLet me drive back the water on all sides and walk on the dry ground in the middleAnd he did soUruvelā Kassapa thoughtI hope the Great Ascetic hasnt been swept away by the water Together with a number of ascetics he went by boat to where the Buddha was stayingHe saw that the Buddha had driven back the water on all sides and was walking on dry ground in the middle and he said to the BuddhaIs that you Great AsceticIts me KassapaThe Buddha rose up into the air and reappeared in the boatUruvelā Kassapa thoughtThe Great Ascetic is powerful and mighty in that he can displace the water But hes not a perfected one like meThen the Buddha thoughtFor a long time this foolish man has thoughtThe Great Ascetic is powerful and mighty but hes not a perfected one like meLet me stir up this dreadlocked asceticAnd he said to Uruvelā KassapaKassapa youre not a perfected one or on the path to perfectionYou dont have the practice by which you might be a perfected one or on the path to perfectionAt that Uruvelā Kassapa bowed down with his head at the Buddhas feet and saidVenerable Sir I wish to receive the going forth in your presence I wish to receive the full ordinationKassapa youre the leader and chief of five hundred dreadlocked asceticsTell them first so that they may act as they think appropriateUruvelā Kassapa then went to those ascetics and saidI wish to practice the spiritual life under the Great Ascetic Please do whatever you think is appropriateSir weve had confidence in the Great Ascetic for a long time If you are to practice the spiritual life under him so will all of usThen after letting their hair and dreadlocks their carrying pole and bundle and their fireworship implements be carried away by the water they went to the Buddha They bowed down with their head at his feet and saidVenerable Sir we wish to receive the going forth in your presence we wish to receive the full ordinationThe Buddha said Come monksThe Teaching is wellproclaimed Practice the spiritual life to make a complete end of sufferingAnd that was the full ordination of those venerablesNadī Kassapa saw those things being carried away by the water and he thoughtI hope my brother is okayHe dispatched his ascetics sayingGo and check on my brotherTogether with the three hundred ascetics he then went to Uruvelā Kassapa and saidIs this better KassapaYes this is betterThen after letting their hair and dreadlocks their carrying pole and bundle and their fireworship implements be carried away by the water they went to the Buddha They bowed down with their head at his feet and saidVenerable Sir we wish to receive the going forth in your presence we wish to receive the full ordinationThe Buddha said Come monksThe Teaching is wellproclaimed Practice the spiritual life to make a complete end of sufferingAnd that was the full ordination of those venerablesGayā Kassapa saw those things being carried away by the water and he thoughtI hope my brothers are okayHe dispatched his ascetics sayingGo and check on my brothersTogether with the two hundred ascetics he then went to Uruvelā Kassapa and saidIs this better KassapaYes this is betterThen after letting their hair and dreadlocks their carrying pole and bundle and their fireworship implements be carried away by the water they went to the Buddha They bowed down with their head at his feet and saidVenerable Sir we wish to receive the going forth in your presence we wish to receive the full ordinationThe Buddha said Come monksThe Teaching is wellproclaimed Practice the spiritual life to make a complete end of sufferingAnd that was the full ordination of those venerablesBy an act of supernormal determination the Buddha stopped five hundred logs from being split before splitting themhe stopped fires from being lit before lighting themhe then stopped them from being extinguished before extinguishing themand he created five hundred pans with hot coalsIn this way there were three and a half thousand wondersAfter staying at Uruvelā for as long as he liked the Buddha set out for Gayāsīsa together with that large sangha of one thousand monks all of them previously dreadlocked asceticsand they stayed thereThen the Buddha addressed the monksEverything is burningWhat is that everything that is burningThe eye is burning Sights are

freedThey understand that birth has come to an end that the spiritual life has been fulfilled that the job has been done that there is no further state of existenceAnd while this exposition was being spoken the minds of those one thousand monks were freed from the corruptions without graspingThe discourse on fire is finishedThe third section for recitation on the wonders at Uruvelā is finishedThe account of the meeting with BimbisāraAfter staying at Gayāsīsa for as long as he liked the Buddha set out wandering toward Rājagaha with that large sangha of one thousand monks all of them previously dreadlocked asceticsWhen he eventually arrived at Rājagahahe stayed in the cane grove at the Suppatiṭṭha ShrineKing Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha heardSir the ascetic Gotama the Sakyan who has gone forth from the Sakyan clan has arrived at Rājagaha and is staying in the cane grove at the Suppatiṭṭha ShrineThat Buddha Gotama has a good reputationHe is indeed a Master perfected and fully awakened complete in insight and conduct happy knower of the world supreme trainer of tamable people teacher of gods and humans the Master the BuddhaWith his own insight he has seen this world with its gods its lords of death and its supreme beings this population with its ascetics and brahmins its gods and humans and he makes it known to othersHe has a Teaching thats good in the beginning good in the middle and good in the end It has a true goal and is well articulated He sets out a perfectly complete and pure spiritual lifeIts good to see such perfected onesThen accompanied by one hundred and twenty thousand brahmin householders from Magadha King Bimbisāra went to the Buddha bowed and sat downAmong those brahmin householders some bowed to the Buddha and then sat down some exchanges pleasantries with him and then sat down some raised their joined palms and then sat down some announced their name and clan and then sat down and some sat down in silenceAnd they thoughtIs the Great Ascetic practicing the spiritual life under Uruvelā Kassapa or is Uruvelā Kassapa practicing the spiritual life under the Great AsceticAfter reading the minds of those brahmin householders the Buddha spoke to Venerable Uruvelā Kassapa in verseThe resident of Uruvelā known as The Emaciated OneWhat did he see that he abandoned the fireKassapa I ask you this questionWhy did you abandon the fire worshipAs a reward for the sacrifice they promise sense pleasuresSights sounds and tastes and women tooBut knowing the stain in ownershipI found no delight in worship and sacrificeSo your mind didnt delight thereIn sights sounds and tastes tooIn sights sounds and tastes tooWhat then in the world of gods and humansDoes your mind delight in Tell me this KassapaI saw the state of peace that is detached from sense existenceWhere there is nothing and no ownershipIt doesnt change and cant be found through anotherThats why I found no delight in worship and sacrificeAnd Uruvelā Kassapa got up from his seat put his upper robe over one shoulder bowed down with his head at the Buddhas feet and saidVenerable Sir youre my teacher Im your discipleyoure my teacher Im your discipleThe one hundred and twenty thousand brahmin householders from Magadha thoughtSo Uruvelā Kassapa is practicing the spiritual life under the Great AsceticReading their minds the Buddha gave them a progressive teachingtalk on generosity talk on morality talk on heaven and he revealed the danger degradation and defilement in worldly pleasures and the benefit of renunciationWhen the Buddha knew that their minds were ready supple without hindrances joyful and confident he revealed the teaching unique to the Buddhassuffering its origin its end and the pathAnd just as a clean and stainless cloth takes the dye properlyso too while they were sitting right there one hundred and ten thousand of those brahmin householders headed by Bimbisāra experienced the stainless vision of the TruthAnything that has a beginning has an endThe remaining ten thousand declared themselves as lay followersKing Bimbisāra had seen the Truth had reached understood and penetrated it he had gone beyond doubt and uncertainty had attained to confidence and had become independent of others in the Teachers instruction He then said to the BuddhaVenerable Sir when I was a prince I had five wishes and they have now been fulfilledWhen I was a prince I thoughtOh I wish they would anoint me as the king That was my first wish which has now been fulfilledMay one who is perfected and fully awakened come to my kingdom That was my second wish which has now been fulfilledMay I get to visit that Buddha That was my third wish which has now been fulfilledMay that Buddha give me a teaching That was my fourth wish which has now been fulfilledMay I understand the Teaching of that Buddha That was my fifth wish which has now been fulfilledWonderful Sir wonderfulJust as one might set upright what had been overturned or reveal what was hidden or show the way to one who was lost or bring a lamp into the darkness so that one with eyes might see whats therejust so has the Buddha made the Teaching clear in many waysI take refuge in the Buddha in the Teaching and in the Sangha of monksPlease accept me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life And please accept tomorrows meal from me together with the Sangha of monksThe Buddha consented by remaining silentKnowing that the Buddha had consented the King got up from his seat bowed down circumambulated the Buddha with his right side toward him and leftThe following morning King Bimbisāra had various kinds of fine food prepared He then had the Buddha informedthat the meal was readyThe Buddha robed up took his bowl and robe and together with a large sangha of a thousand monks all previously dreadlocked ascetics he entered RājagahaJust then Sakka the ruler of the gods had transformed himself into a young brahmin He walked in front of the Sangha of monks headed by the Buddha chanting these versesThe Tamed One with the tamed ones previously dreadlockedThe Liberated One with the liberated onesGolden in colorThe Buddha entered RājagahaThe Freed One with the freed ones previously dreadlockedThe Liberated One with the liberated onesGolden in colorThe Buddha entered RājagahaThe One Gone Beyond with the ones gone beyond previously dreadlockedThe Liberated One with the liberated onesGolden in colorThe Buddha entered RājagahaThe Peaceful One with the peaceful ones previously dreadlockedThe Liberated One with the liberated onesGolden in colorThe Buddha entered RājagahaHe has ten abidings and ten powersHe knows ten truths and has ten qualitiesWith a following of ten times one hundredThe Buddha entered RājagahaPeople saw Sakka and they saidThis young brahmin is beautiful hes handsome and gracefulWho is this young brahminAnd Sakka replied to them in verseUnwavering and tamed in all respectsPurified perfected and without equalThe one in the world who is happyIm his servantThe Buddha then went to King Bimbisāras house where he sat down on the prepared seat together with the Sangha of monksThe King personally served various kinds of fine food to the Sangha of monks headed by the Buddha When the Buddha had finished his meal the King sat down to one sideAnd he thoughtWhere will the Buddha staythats neither too far from the village nor too close that has good access roads thats easily accessible for people who seek him that has few people during the day and is quiet at night thats free from chatter and offers solitude thats away from human habitation and suitable for seclusionAnd it occurred to himMy Bamboo Grove park has all these qualitiesLet me give the park to the Sangha of monks headed by the BuddhaThe King then took hold of a golden ceremonial vessel and dedicated the park to the Buddha sayingI give this park the Bamboo Grove to the Sangha of monks headed by the BuddhaThe Buddha accepted the parkAfter instructing inspiring and gladdening the King with a teaching he got up from his seat and leftSoon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monksI allow monasteriesThe account of the meeting with Bimbisāra is finishedThe account of the going forth of Sāriputta and MoggallānaAt that time the wanderer Sañcaya was staying at Rājagaha with a large group of two hundred and fifty wanderersincluding Sāriputta and MoggallānaThe two of them had made an agreementthat whoever reached the deathless first would inform the otherJust then Venerable Assaji robed up in the morning took his bowl and robe and entered Rājagaha for almsfood He inspired confidence in the way he entered and returned in his looking at and looking away in his drawing in and stretching out of his arms his eyes were lowered and he was perfect in deportmentThe wanderer Sāriputta observed all thisand thoughtThis monk is among those in the world who are perfected or on the path to perfectionLet me approach him and ask himwho he has gone forth under who his teacher is and whose teachings he followsBut it occurred to himIts the wrong time to ask him while hes walking for almsfood among the housesLet me follow behind him for one who seeks the path will find itAfter walking for almsfood in Rājagaha Assaji took his almsfood and turned backSāriputta then approached him and exchanged pleasantries with himAnd he askedVenerable your faculties are clear and your skin is pure and brightWho have you gone forth under Who is your teacher or whose teaching do you followTheres a great ascetic a Sakyan who has gone forth from the Sakyan clan Ive gone forth under him hes my teacher and I follow his teachingBut what does your teacher teachIve only recently gone forth and so Im new to this spiritual path Im not capable of giving you the Teaching in full but I can tell you the meaning in briefSāriputta repliedYes please and he addedSpeak little or muchBut do tell me the meaningI just want the meaningFor whats the point of a detailed expositionAnd Assaji gave this teaching to the wanderer SāriputtaOf causally arisen thingsThe Buddha has declared their causeAs well as their endingThis is the teaching of the Great AsceticWhen he had heard this teaching Sāriputta experienced the stainless vision of the TruthAnything that has a beginning has an endNow this is the truth even just thisThe sorrowless state that you have penetratedWhich has been unseen and neglectedThrough innumerable eonsThen the wanderer Sāriputta went to the wanderer MoggallānaWhen Moggallāna saw him coming he said to SāriputtaYour faculties are clear and your skin is pure and brightYou havent attained the deathless have youYes I haveBut how did it happenAnd Sāriputta told him everything up to and including the teaching given by AssajiWhen he had heard this teaching Moggallāna experienced the stainless vision of the TruthAnything that has a beginning has an endNow this is the truth even just thisThe sorrowless state that you have penetratedWhich has been unseen and neglectedThrough innumerable eonsAnd Moggallāna said to SāriputtaLets go to the Buddha hes our teacherBut these two hundred and fifty wanderers look to us for support We must tell them firstThey can then act as they think appropriateAnd they went to those wanderers and saidWere going to the Buddha hes our teacherBut we look to you for support If you are to practice the spiritual life under the Great Ascetic so will all of usThen Sāriputta and Moggallāna went to Sañcaya and saidWere going to the Buddha hes our teacherDont go Let the three of us look after this community togetherSāriputta and Moggallāna said the same thing a second timeand a third timeand they got the same replyThey then took those two hundred and fifty wanderers and went to the Bamboo GroveBut the wanderer Sañcaya vomited warm blood right thereWhen the Buddha saw Sāriputta and Moggallāna coming he said to the monksThe two friends Kolita and Upatissa are comingThey will be my most eminent disciples an excellent pairThey had not even reached the Bamboo GroveYet had a profound range of knowledgeAbout the supreme end of ownership about freedomThe Teacher explained about themThese two friends are comingKolita and UpatissaThey will be an excellent pairMy most eminent disciplesSāriputta and Moggallāna approached the Buddha bowed down with their heads at the Buddhas feet and saidVenerable Sir we wish to receive the going forth in your presence we wish to receive the full ordinationThe Buddha said Come monksThe Teaching is wellproclaimed Practice the spiritual life to make a complete end of sufferingAnd that was the full ordination of those venerablesThe going forth of those who were wellknownAt that time many wellknown Magadhans from good families were practicing the spiritual life under the BuddhaPeople complained and criticized himThe ascetic Gotama is making us childless and hes making widows out of us hes breaking up good families Right now a thousand dreadlocked ascetics have gone forth because of him and also these two hundred and fifty wanderers who were disciples of SañcayaAll these wellknown Magadhans from good families are practicing the spiritual life under the ascetic GotamaAnd when they saw monks they confronted them with this verseThe Great Ascetic has arrivedAt Giribbaja in MagadhaAfter leading away all of Sañcayas disciplesWho will he lead away nextThe monks heard the complaints of those peopleand they told the Buddha what had happened Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and saidThe complaining will soon stop it will only last seven daysAnd when people confront you like thisyou can confront them in return with this verseIndeed the Great Heroes the BuddhasLead by means of a good teachingWhen you understand this what indignation can there beToward those who lead legitimatelySoon when they had seen monks people confronted them with this verseThe Great Ascetic has arrivedAt Giribbaja in MagadhaAfter leading away all of Sañcayas disciplesWho will he lead away nextAnd the monks confronted them in return with this verseIndeed the Great Heroes the BuddhasLead by means of a good teachingWhen you understand this what indignation can there beToward those who lead legitimatelyPeople thought So it seems the Sakyan ascetics lead legitimately not illegitimately And the complaining lasted seven days and then it stoppedThe account of the going forth of Sāriputta and Moggallāna is finishedThe fourth section for recitation is finishedDiscussion of the proper conduct toward the preceptorAt that time the monks did not have preceptors or teachers and as a result they were not being instructed While walking for almsfood they were shabbily dressed and improper in appearanceWhile people were eating they held out their almsbowls to receive leftovers even right over their food whether it was staple food nonstaple food delicacies or drinksThey ate bean curry and rice that they themselves had asked forand they were noisy in the dining hallPeople complained and criticized themHow can the Sakyan ascetics act like thisThey are just like brahmins at a brahminical mealThe monks heard the complaints of those peopleThe monks of few desires who had a sense of conscience who were contented afraid of wrongdoing and fond of the training complained and criticized themHow can monks act like thisThey then told the BuddhaSoon afterwards the Buddha had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monksIs it true monks that monks act like thisIts true SirThe Buddha criticzed themIts not suitable for those foolish men its not proper its not worthy of an ascetic its not allowable its not to be doneHow can they act like thisThis wont give rise to confidence in those without it or increase the confidence of those who have itbut it will hinder confidence in those without it and it will cause some with confidence to change their mindsThen the Buddha spoke in many ways in dispraise of being difficult to support and maintain in dispraise of great desires discontent socializing and laziness but he spoke in many ways in praise of being easy to support and maintain of fewness of wishes contentment selfelimination ascetic practices serenity reduction in things and of being energetic After giving a teaching on what is right and proper he addressed the monksThere should be a preceptorThe preceptor should regard his student as a son and the student his preceptor as a fatherIn this way they will respect esteem and be considerate toward each other and they will grow and reach greatness on this spiritual pathAnd a preceptor should be chosen like thisAfter putting his upper robe over one shoulder a student should pay respect at the feet of a potential preceptor He should then squat on his heels raise his joined palms and sayVenerable please be my preceptorAnd he should repeat this a secondand a third timeIf the other makes it understood by body by speech or by body and speech Yes or No problem or Its suitable or Its appropriate or Carry on with inspirationthen a preceptor has been chosenIf the other doesnt make it understood by body

for the going forthbut the monks declinedAs a result he became thin haggard and pale his veins protruding all over his limbsThe Buddha saw him and he asked the monksWhy is that brahmin looking so sicklyAnd they told him what had happenedThe Buddha saidDoes anyone remember any act of service from that brahminVenerable Sāriputta repliedI do SirWhat service do you remember SāriputtaWhile I was walking for almsfood here in Rājagaha that brahmin gave a ladleful of foodGood good Sāriputta superior people have gratitudeWell then Sāriputta give that brahmin the going forth and the full ordinationBut how should I do itThe Buddha then gave a teaching and addressed the monksFrom today I rescind the full ordination of going for refuge three timesInstead you should give the full ordination through a legal procedure consisting of one motion and three announcementsAnd the ordination should be done like thisA competent and capable monk should inform the SanghaPlease Venerables I

allowableBut I didnt ask you to ordain meWhy did you ordain me without being askedThey told the Buddha and he saidYou should not give the full ordination to someone without being askedIf you do you commit an offense of wrong conductI allow you to give the full ordination to someone when you have been askedAnd you should be asked like thisAfter approaching the Sangha the one who wants the full ordination should put his upper robe over one shoulder and pay respect at the feet of the monks He should then squat on his heels raise his joined palms and sayVenerables I ask the Sangha for the full ordination May the Sangha lift me up out of compassionAnd he should ask a secondand a third timeA competent and capable monk should then inform the SanghaPlease Venerables I ask the Sangha to

approves and is therefore silent I will remember it thusAt that time in Rājagaha there was a succession of fine mealsA certain brahmin thoughtThese Sakyan ascetics have pleasant habits and a happy life After eating nice food they sleep in beds sheltered from the windLet me go forth with the Sakyan asceticsThen that brahmin approached the monks and asked for the going forthThe monks gave him the going forth and the full ordinationWhen he had gone forth that succession of meals came to a stopThe monks said to himCome now lets walk for almsfoodI didnt go forth to walk for almsfoodIf you give me some Ill eat it If not Ill disrobeBut did you go forth for the sake of your stomachThe monks of few desires complained and criticized himHow can a monk go forth on this wellproclaimed spiritual path for the sake of his stomachThey told the Buddha Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned that monkIs it true monk that you went forth for the sake of our stomachIts true SirThe Buddha rebuked him Foolish man how can you go forth on this wellproclaimed spiritual path for the sake of your stomachThis wont give rise to confidence in those without it or increase the confidence of those who have it  and after rebuking him he gave a teaching and addressed the monksWhen you are giving the full ordination you should point out the four supportsOne gone forth is supported by almsfood You should persevere with this for lifeThese are the extra material supportsa meal for the Sangha a meal for designated monks an invitational meal a meal for which lots are drawn a halfmonthly meal a meal on the observance day and a meal on the day after the observance dayOne gone forth is supported by ragrobes You should persevere with this for lifeThese are the extra material supportslinen cotton silk wool sunn hemp and hempOne gone forth is supported by the foot of a tree as resting place You should persevere with this for lifeThese are the extra material supportsa dwelling a stilt house and a caveOne gone forth is supported by medicine of fermented urine You should persevere with this for lifeThese are the extra material supportsghee butter oil honey and syrupThe fifth section for recitation on the proper conduct toward the preceptor is finishedDiscussion of the proper conduct toward a teacherSoon afterwards a young brahmin approached the monks and asked for the going forthThe monks told him about the four supportsVenerables if you had told me about this after my going forth I would have been fineBut now I wont go forthfor these supports are disgusting and repulsive to meThey told the Buddha and he saidYou should not point out the four supports beforehandIf you do you commit an offense of wrong conductYou should point out the supports immediately after the full ordinationAt that time the monks gave the full ordination in groups of two and threeThey told the Buddha and he saidYou should not give the full ordination in groups of less than tenIf you do you commit an offense of wrong conductYou should give the full ordination in groups of ten or more than tenAt that time monks who only had one or two years of seniority gave the full ordinationone of whom was Venerable Upasena of VaṅgantaAfter completing the rainyseason residence he had two years of seniority and his student one Taking his student he then went to the Buddha bowed and sat downSince it is the custom for Buddhas to greet newly arrived monksthe Buddha said to UpasenaI hope youre keeping well monk I hope youre comfortableI hope youre not tired from travelingIm keeping well Venerable Sir Im comfortableand Im not tired from travelingWhen Buddhas know what is going on sometimes they ask and sometimes not they know the right time to ask and the right time not to askBuddhas ask when it is beneficial not when it is unbeneficialfor Buddhas are incapable of doing what is unbeneficialBuddhas question the monks for two reasons to give a teaching or to lay down a training ruleThe Buddha said to Upasena How long have you been a monkTwo years SirAnd this monkOne yearAnd whats his relationship to youHes my studentThe Buddha rebuked himIts not suitable foolish man its not proper its not worthy of an ascetic its not allowable its not to be doneHow can you who should be taught and instructed by others think to teach and instruct anotherYou have turned to abundance too readily that is by forming a groupThis wont give rise to confidence in those without it or increase the confidence of those who have it  and after rebuking him he gave a teaching and addressed the monksYou should not give the full ordination if you have less than ten years of seniorityIf you do you commit an offense of wrong conductI allow you to give the full ordination if you have ten or more years of senioritySoon afterwardswhen they had ten years of seniorityignorant and incompetent monks gave the full ordinationAs a result there were ignorant preceptors with knowledgeable studentsincompetent preceptors with competent studentsuneducated preceptors with learned studentsstupid preceptors with clever studentsA monk who was formerly an ascetic of another religion refuted his preceptor even though he had been legitimately corrected by him He then returned to that religious communityThe monks of few desires complained and criticized themHow can ignorant and incompetent monks give the full ordination just because they have ten years of seniorityThere are ignorant preceptors with knowledgeable students incompetent preceptors with competent students uneducated preceptors with learned students stupid preceptors with clever studentsThey told the Buddha He saidIs it true monks that this is happeningIts true SirThe Buddha criticized them How can those foolish men give the full ordination just because they have ten years of seniorityThe consequences are evidentThis wont give rise to confidence in those without it  and after criticizing them he gave a teaching and addressed the monksAn ignorant and incompetent monk should not give the full ordinationIf he does he commits an offense of wrong conductI allow a competent and capable monk to give the full ordination if he has ten or more years of seniorityAt that time there were preceptors who left disrobed died or joined another faction and as a consequence their students were not being instructedWhile walking for almsfood they were shabbily dressed and improper in appearanceWhile people were eating they held out their almsbowls to receive leftovers even right over their food whether it was staple food nonstaple food delicacies or drinksThey ate bean curry and rice that they themselves had asked forand they were noisy in the dining hallPeople complained and criticized themHow can the Sakyan ascetics act like thisThey are just like brahmins at a brahminical mealThe monks heard the complaints of those people They then told the BuddhaIs it true monks  Its true Sir after rebuking them the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monksThere should be a teacherThe teacher should regard his pupil as a son and the pupil his teacher as a fatherIn this way they will respect esteem and be considerate toward each other and they will grow and reach greatness on this spiritual pathYou should live with formal support for ten years And I allow a monk of ten years seniority to give such supportAnd a teacher should be chosen like thisAfter putting his upper robe over one shoulder a pupil should pay respect at the feet of a potential teacher He should then squat on his heels raise his joined palms and sayVenerable please be my teacher I wish to live with formal support from youAnd he should repeat this a secondand a third timeIf the other makes it understood by body by speech or by body and

ascetics of another religionSoon afterwards he who was formerly an ascetic of another religion and who had returned to that religious community after refuting his preceptorcame back to the monks and asked for the full ordinationThe monks told the BuddhaMonks when someone who was formerly an ascetic of another religion refutes his preceptor after being legitimately corrected by him and then returns to that religion but then comes back from that religious community once more he should not be given the full ordinationAnyone else who was formerly an ascetic of another religion who wants the going forth and the full ordination on this spiritual path should be given four months of probationAnd it should be given like thisFirst he should shave off his hair and beard and put on the ocher robes He should then put his upper robe over one shoulder pay respect at the feet of the monks squat on his heels and raise his joined palms He should then be told to say thisI take refuge in the BuddhaI take refuge in the TeachingI take refuge in the SanghaFor the second time I take refuge in the BuddhaFor the second time I take refuge in the TeachingFor the second time I take refuge in the SanghaFor the third time I take refuge in the BuddhaFor the third time I take refuge in the TeachingFor the third time I take refuge in the SanghaThen after approaching the Sangha he who was formerly an ascetic of another religion should put his upper robe over one shoulder pay respect at the feet of the monks squat on his heels and raise his joined palms He should then say thisVenerables I was formerly an ascetic of another religion and I wish for the full ordination on this spiritual pathI ask the Sangha for four months of probationAnd he should ask a secondand a third timeA competent and capable monk should then inform the SanghaPlease Venerables I ask the Sangha to listenSoandso who was formerly an ascetic of another religion wants the full ordination on this spiritual pathHe is asking the Sangha for four months of probationIf it seems appropriate to the Sangha the Sangha should give soandso four months of probationPlease Venerables I ask the Sangha to listenSoandso who was formerly an ascetic of another religion wants the full ordination on this spiritual pathHe is asking the Sangha for four months of probationThe Sangha gives soandso four months of probationAny monk who approves of giving soandso four months of probation should remain silentAny monk who does not approve should speak upThe Sangha has given soandso who was formerly an ascetic of another religion four months of probationThe Sangha approves and is therefore silent I will remember it thusWhen someone who was formerly an ascetic of another religion is on probationthis is how hes unsuccessfulHe enters the village too early and returns too late in the dayHe regularly associates with prostitutes widows young unmarried women paṇḍakas and nunsHes not skilled or diligent in the various things that need to be done for his fellow monastics and he doesnt possess the good judgment needed to do and arrange them wellHe doesnt have a keen desire for recitation for questioning for the higher morality for the higher mind and for the higher wisdomHe is displeased when anyone disparages the teacher the views the beliefs the persuasion or the opinions of the religious community hes left but hes pleased when anyone disparages the Buddha the Teaching or the Sanghaand hes pleased when anyone praises the teacher the views the beliefs the persuasion or the opinions of the religious community hes left but he is displeased when anyone praises the Buddha the Teaching or the SanghaThis is the critical factor in the lack of success of someone who was formerly an ascetic of another religionWhen someone who was formerly an ascetic of another religion is unsuccessful in this way he should not be given the full ordinationWhen someone who was formerly an ascetic of another religion is on probation this is how hes successfulHe doesnt enter the village too early or return too late in the dayHe doesnt regularly associate with prostitutes widows young unmarried women paṇḍakas or nunsHes skilled or diligent in the various things that need to be done for his fellow monastics and he possesses the good judgment needed to do and arrange them wellHe has a keen desire for recitation for

community hes left but he is displeased when anyone disparages the Buddha the Teaching or the Sanghaand he is displeased when anyone praises the teacher the views the beliefs the persuasion or the opinions of the religious community hes left but hes pleased when anyone praises the Buddha the Teaching or the SanghaThis is the critical factor in the success of someone who was formerly an ascetic of another religionWhen someone who was formerly an ascetic of another religion is successful in this way he should be given the full ordinationIf someone who was formerly an ascetic of another religion arrives naked a robe should be sought through his preceptorIf he arrives with hair he should get permission from the Sangha to shaveBut any dreadlocked fireworshiping ascetic who comes to be ordained should be given the full ordination without probationWhy is thatBecause they believe in the teaching of action the teaching of doingAnd if someone who was formerly an ascetic of another religion arrives who is a Sakyan by birth he should be given the full ordination without probationI give this special privilege to my relativesThe discussion on those who were formerly ascetics of another religion is finishedThe seventh section for recitation is finishedThe five diseasesAt that time in Magadha there were five common diseasesleprosy abscesses mild leprosy tuberculosis and epilepsyWhen people were afflicted with any of these five diseases they went to Jīvaka Komārabhacca and saidDoctor please treat meHe replied Im very busyI look after King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha and his harem I also look after the Sangha of monks headed by the BuddhaIm not able to treat youI will give you everything I ownand Ill be your slavePlease treat me doctorJīvaka repeated what he had already saidAnd those people thoughtThese Sakyan ascetics have pleasant habits and a happy life After eating nice food they sleep in beds sheltered from the windPerhaps I should go forth with the Sakyan asceticsIf I do the monks will nurse me and Jīvaka Komārabhacca will treat meThey then went to the monks and asked for the going forthThe monks gave them the going forth and the full ordinationAnd the monks nursed them and Jīvaka treated themAt one time the monks were nursing many sick monks As a result they kept on askingPlease give a meal for the sick and for those nursing the sick Please give medicines for the sickAnd because Jīvaka was treating many sick monks he was unable to fulfill his duty to the kingThen a certain man who was afflicted with one of the five diseases went to Jīvaka and saidDoctor please treat meHe replied Im very busy I look after King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha and his harem I also look after the Sangha of monks headed by the BuddhaIm not able to treat youI will give you everything I own and Ill be your slavePlease treat me doctorJīvaka repeated what he had already saidAnd that man thoughtThese Sakyan ascetics have pleasant habits and a happy life After eating nice food they sleep in beds sheltered from the windPerhaps I should go forth with the Sakyan asceticsIf I do the monks will nurse me and Jīvaka Komārabhacca will treat meAnd when Im healthy Ill disrobeHe then went to the monks and asked for the going forthThe monks gave him the going forth and the full ordinationafter which they nursed him and Jīvaka treated himAnd when he was healthy again he disrobedJīvaka saw that man after he had disrobed and he asked himDidnt you go forth with the monksYes doctorAnd why did you do itWhen that man had told him what had happenedJīvaka complained and criticized the monksHow can the venerables allow those with the five diseases to go forthHe went to the Buddha bowed sat downVenerable Sir it would be good if the venerables didnt allow those with the five diseases to go forthThe Buddha instructed inspired and gladdened him with a teachingJīvaka then got up from his seat bowed down circumambulated the Buddha with his right side toward him and leftSoon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monksYou should not give the going forth to anyone afflicted with any of the five diseasesIf you do you commit an offense of wrong conductThose employed by the kingOn one occasion anger erupted in the outlying districts governed by King BimbisāraThe King told his generalsGo and sort out those districtsYes sirBut the most famous soldiers thoughtIf we go and enjoy the battle well do whats bad and make much demeritHow can we avoid whats bad and do whats good insteadAnd it occurred to themThese Sakyan ascetics live according to the Truth Theyre celibate and their conduct is good and theyre truthful moral and have a good characterIf we go forth with them well avoid whats bad and do whats goodThose soldiers then went to the monks and asked for the going forthAnd the monks gave them the going forth and the full ordinationSoon afterwards the generals asked among the Kings employeesWhy are the soldiers soandso and soandso missingTheyve gone forth with the monksThe generals complained and criticized the monksHow can the Sakyan ascetics give the going forth to people who are employed by the KingAnd they told the KingThe King then asked the judgeWhats the penalty for one who gives the going forth to someone employed by the KingThe preceptor should have his head cut off the one who does the formal proclamation should have his tongue cut out and the participating group should have half their ribs brokenThe King went to the Buddha bowed sat downVenerable Sir there are kings with little faith and confidenceThey would give the monks a hard time even over small mattersIt would be good if the venerables didnt give the going forth to those employed by a kingThe Buddha instructed inspired and gladdened him with a teachingThe King then got up from his seat bowed down circumambulated the Buddha with his right side toward him and leftSoon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monksYou should not give the going forth to anyone employed by a kingIf you do you commit an offense of wrong conductThe criminal AṅgulimālaAt that time the criminal Aṅgulimāla had gone forth with the monksWhen people saw him they became alarmed and fearful They ran away took a different path turned away and closed their doorsPeople complained and criticized the monksHow can the Sakyan ascetics give the going forth to a notorious criminalThe monks heard the complaints of those peopleThey then told the Buddha Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and saidYou should not give the going forth to a notorious criminalIf you do you commit an offense of wrong conductThe escaped criminalAt that time King Bimbisāra had given the following instructionNothing should be done to anyone who has gone forth with the Sakyan asceticsThe Teaching is wellproclaimed so allow them to practice the spiritual life to make a complete end of

years old is able to endure these thingsThis wont give rise to confidence in those without it or increase the confidence of those who have it  and after criticizing them he gave a teaching and addressed the monksYou should not give the full ordination to a person you know is less than twenty years oldIf you do you should be dealt with according to the ruleThe deadly and contagious diseaseAt

seasonPeople complained and criticized themThe districts are left dark and obscure by the Sakyan ascetics they dont brighten them upThe monks heard the complaints of those peopleand they told the BuddhaHe said to Venerable nandaTake a key nanda and go around the precincts and inform the monksThe Buddha wishes to go wandering in the southern hillsAnyone is welcome to join himSaying Yes Sir he

teaching and addressed the monksThe going forth as a novice monk should be given by means of going for refuge three timesAnd it should be done like thisFirst the candidate should shave off his hair and beard and put on ocher robes He should then put his upper robe over one shoulder pay respect at the feet of the monks squat on his heels and raise his joined palms He should then be told to say thisI take refuge in the BuddhaI take refuge in the TeachingI take refuge in the SanghaFor the second time I take refuge in the BuddhaFor the second time I take refuge in the TeachingFor the second time I take refuge in the SanghaFor the third time I take refuge in the BuddhaFor the third time I take refuge in the TeachingFor the third time I take refuge in the SanghaAnd Sāriputta gave Rāhula the going forthSoon afterwards Suddhodana approached the Buddha bowed sat downSir may I ask for a favorBuddhas dont grant favors GotamaIts allowable and blamelessWell then please say what it isWhen the Buddha went forth it was very painful for me and the same when Nanda went forth With Rāhula its even worseAffection for a child cuts through the outer and inner skin it cuts the flesh the sinews and the bones and it reaches all the way to the bonemarrowIt would be good if the venerables didnt give the going forth to a child without the parents permissionThe Buddha then instructed inspired and

leprosy tuberculosis and epilepsyThey told the Buddha and he saidThe one who is giving the full ordination should ask about the thirteen obstructionsAnd it should be done like thisDo you have any of these diseasesleprosy abscesses mild leprosy tuberculosis or epilepsyAre you a free manAre you employed by the KingDo you have permission from your parentsAre you twenty years oldDo you have a full set of bowl and robesWhat is the name of your preceptorSoon afterwards they asked those seeking the full ordination about the obstructions without first instructing themThey were embarrassed humiliated and unable to respondThey told the Buddha and he saidYou should instruct first and then ask about the obstructionsThey instructed them right there in the midst of the SanghaOnce more those seeking the full ordination were embarrassed humiliated and unable to respondThey told the Buddha and he saidYou should instruct them to one side and then ask about the obstructions in the midst of

robe and this your sarongNow please go and stand over thereThey were instructed by monks who were ignorant and incompetentAnd because they were badly instructed they were once again embarrassed

difficult for those gone forth to get sexCome lets have intercourseAnd he had intercourse with herIt took him a long time to catch up with the other monks They asked himwhy it had taken him so longand he told them what had happenedThey told the Buddha and he saidWhen you have given the full ordination to someone you should give him a companion and point out the four things not to be doneA monk who is fully ordained should not have sexual intercourse even with an animalIf he has sexual intercourse hes not an ascetic not a son of the SakyanJust as a man with his head cut off is unable to continue

SakyanYou shouldnt do this for as long as you liveA monk who is fully ordained should not claim a superhuman quality even just saying I delight in empty dwellingsIf because he has bad desires and is overcome by desire he claims a nonexistent unreal superhuman qualitywhether absorption release stillness attainment path or fruithes not an ascetic not a son of the SakyanJust as a palm tree with its crown cut off is incapable of further growthso too a monk with bad desires overcome by desire who has claimed a nonexistent unreal superhuman quality is not an ascetic not a son of the SakyanYou

topicsThe long chapter is finishedTheravāda Collection on Monastic LawThe chapter on entering the rainyseason residenceThe instruction to enter the rainyseason residenceAt one time the Buddha was staying at Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove the squirrel sanctuaryAt that time the Buddha had not yet laid down the rainyseason residence for the monksAnd so the monks were wandering about in the winter in the summer and also during the rainy seasonPeople complained and criticized themHow can the Sakyan ascetics go wandering in the winter in the summer and even during the rainy season They are trampling down the green grass oppressing life with one sense faculty and destroying many small creaturesEven the ascetics of other religions with their flawed teachings settle down for the rainyseasonEven birds make a nest in the top of a tree and settle down for the rainyseasonBut not so the Sakyan asceticsThe monks heard the complaints of those peopleand they told the BuddhaSoon afterwards he gave a teaching and addressed the monksYou should enter the rainyseason residenceThe monks thoughtWhen should we enter the rains residenceThey told the Buddha and he saidYou should enter the rainyseason residence during the rainy seasonThe monks thoughtHow many entries to the rains residence are thereThere are two entries to the rainyseason residencethe first and the secondYou should enter the first on the day after the full moon of July and the second one month after the full moon of JulyThe prohibition against wandering during the rainy season etcSoon afterwards the monks from the group of six entered the rains residence and then went wandering during the rainy seasonPeople complained and criticized themjust as they had beforeThe monks heard the complaints of those peopleand the monks of few desires complained and criticized themHow can the monks from the group of six enter the rains residence and then go wandering during the rainy seasonAnd they told the BuddhaSoon afterwards he gave a teaching and addressed the monksAfter entering the rainyseason residence you should stay put for the first or the second threemonth period before you go wanderingIf you go wandering during the rainyseason residence period you commit an offense of wrong conductThe monks from the group of six did not want to enter the rains residenceYou should enter the rainyseason residenceIf you dont you commit an offense of wrong conductOn the day of the entry to the rains residence the monks from the group of six deliberately bypassed a monastery because they did not want to enter the rains residenceOn the day of the entry to the rainyseason residence you should not deliberately bypass a monastery because you dont want to enter the rainyseason residenceIf you do you commit an offense of wrong conductAt one time King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha wanted to postpone the rains residence He sent a message to the monksWould the venerables please enter the rains residence the next full moonYou should comply with the wishes of kingsThe allowance for sevenday businessWhen the Buddha had stayed at Rājagaha for as long as he liked he set out wandering toward
