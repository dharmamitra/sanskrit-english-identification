is quite enough for you to become disillusioned dispassionate and freed regarding all conditionsSineru the king of mountains is  leagues long and  leagues wide It sinks  leagues below the ocean and rises  leagues above itThere comes a time when after a very long period has passed the rain doesnt fall For many years many hundreds many thousands many hundreds of thousands of years no rain fallsWhen this happens the plants and seeds the herbs grass and big trees wither away and dry up and are no moreSo impermanent are conditionsso unstable so unreliableThis is quite enough for you to become disillusioned dispassionate and freed regarding all conditionsThere comes a time when after a very long period has passed a second sun appearsWhen this happens the streams and pools wither away and dry up and are no moreSo impermanent are conditions There comes a time when after a very long period has passed a third sun appearsWhen this happens the great riversthe Ganges Yamunā Aciravatī Sarabhū and Mahīwither away and dry up and are no moreSo impermanent are conditions There comes a time when after a very long period has passed a fourth sun appearsWhen this happens the great lakes from which the rivers originatethe Anotattā Sīhapapātā Rathakārā Kaṇṇamuṇḍā Kuṇālā Chaddantā and Mandākinīwither away and dry up and are no moreSo impermanent are conditions There comes a time when after a very long period has passed a fifth sun appearsWhen this happens the water in the ocean sinks by a hundred leagues It sinks by two three four five six or even seven hundred leaguesThe water that remains in the ocean is only seven palm trees deep Its six five four three two or even one palm tree deepThe water that remains in the ocean is only seven fathoms deep Its six five four three two one or even half a fathom deep Its waist high knee high or even ankle highIts like the time in the autumn when the rain falls heavily and water remains here and there in the cows hoofprintsIn the same way water in the ocean remains here and there in puddles like cows hoofprintsWhen the fifth sun appears theres not even enough water in the great ocean to wet a toejointSo impermanent are conditions There comes a time when after a very long period has passed a sixth sun appearsWhen this happens this great earth and Sineru the king of mountains smoke and smolder and give off fumesIts like when a potters kiln is first kindled and it smokes and smolders and gives off fumesIn the same way this great earth and Sineru the king of mountains smoke and smolder and give off fumesSo impermanent are conditions There comes a time when after a very long period has passed a seventh sun appearsWhen this happens this great earth and Sineru the king of mountains erupt in one burning mass of fireAnd as they blaze and burn the flames are swept by the wind as far as the Brahmā realmSineru the king of mountains blazes and burns crumbling as its overcome by the great fire And meanwhile mountain peaks a hundred leagues high or two three four or five hundred leagues high disintegrate as they burnAnd when the great earth and Sineru the king of mountains blaze and burn no soot or ash is foundIts like when ghee or oil blaze and burn and neither ashes nor soot are foundIn the same way when the great earth and Sineru the king of mountains blaze and burn no soot or ash is foundSo impermanent are conditionsso unstable are conditionsso unreliable are conditionsThis is quite enough for you to become disillusioned dispassionate and freed regarding all conditionsMendicants who would ever think or believe thatthis earth and Sineru king of mountains will burn and crumble and be no more except for one who has seen the truthOnce upon a time there was a teacher called Sunetta He was a religious founder and was free of sensual desireHe had many hundreds of disciplesHe taught them the path to rebirth in the company of BrahmāThose who totally understood Sunettas teachings werewhen their body broke up after deathreborn in a good place the company of BrahmāOf those who didnt totally understand Sunettas teachings somewhen their body broke up after deathwere reborn in the company of the Gods Who Control the Creations of Others Some were reborn in the company of the Gods Who Love to Create some with the Joyful Gods some with the Gods of Yama some with the Gods of the ThirtyThree and some with the Gods of the Four Great Kings Some were reborn in the company of welltodo aristocrats or brahmins or householdersThen the teacher Sunetta thoughtIts not proper for me to be reborn in the next life in exactly the same place as my disciples Why dont I further develop loveThen Sunetta developed love for seven yearsHaving done so he did not return to this world for seven eons of cosmic expansion and contractionAs the cosmos contracted he went to the realm of streaming radianceAs it expanded he was reborn in an empty mansion of BrahmāThere he was Brahmā the Great Brahmā the undefeated the champion the universal seer the wielder of powerHe was Sakka lord of gods thirtysix timesMany hundreds of times he was a king a wheelturning monarch a just and principled king His dominion extended to all four sides he achieved stability in the country and he possessed the seven treasuresHe had over a thousand sons who were valiant and heroic crushing the armies of his enemiesAfter conquering this land girt by sea he reigned by principle without rod or swordYet even though Sunetta lived so long he was not exempt fromrebirth old age and death He was not exempt from sorrow lamentation pain dejection and despair I sayWhy is thatBecause of not understanding and not penetrating four thingsWhat fourNoble ethics immersion wisdom and freedomThese noble ethics immersion wisdom and freedom have been understood and comprehended Craving for continued existence has been cut off the attachment to continued existence is ended now therell be no more future livesThat is what the Buddha saidThen the Holy One the Teacher went on to sayEthics immersion and wisdomand the supreme freedomthese things have been understoodby Gotama the renownedAnd so the Buddha having

Venerable Mahāmoggallāna was nodding off while meditatingThe Buddha saw him with his clairvoyance that is purified and superhumanThen as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm he vanished from the deer park at Bhesakaḷās Wood in the land of the Bhaggas and reappeared in front of Mahāmoggallāna near Kallavāḷamutta Village in the land of the MagadhansHe sat on the seat spread outand said to MahāmoggallānaAre you nodding off Moggallāna Are you nodding offYes sirSo Moggallāna dont focus on or cultivate the perception that you were meditating on when you fell drowsyIts possible that youll give up drowsiness in this wayBut what if that doesnt work Then think about and consider the teaching as youve learned and memorized it examining it with your mindIts possible that

that doesnt work Then pinch your ears and rub your limbsIts possible that youll give up drowsiness in this wayBut what if that doesnt work Then get up from your seat flush your eyes with water look around in every direction and look up at the stars and constellationsIts possible that youll give up drowsiness in this wayBut what if that doesnt work Then focus on the perception of light concentrating on the perception of dayregardless of whether its night or dayAnd so with an open and unenveloped heart develop a mind thats full of radianceIts possible that youll give up drowsiness in

UpāliWith VajjiyamāhitaAt one time the Buddha was staying near Campā on the banks of the Gaggarā Lotus PondThen the householder Vajjiyamāhita left Sāvatthī in the middle of the day to see the

wanderers who follow other pathsThen he went to the monastery of the wanderers who follow other pathsNow at that time the wanderers who follow other paths had come together making an uproar a dreadful racket as they sat and talked about all kinds of unworthy topicsThey saw Vajjiyamāhita coming off in the distance and stopped each other sayingBe quiet good sirs dont make a soundThe householder Vajjiyamāhita a disciple of the ascetic Gotama is coming into our monasteryHe is included among the whiteclothed lay disciples of the ascetic Gotama who is residing near CampāSuch venerables like the quiet are educated to be quiet and praise the quietHopefully if he sees that our assembly is quiet hell see fit to approachThen those wanderers who follow other paths fell silentThen Vajjiyamāhita went up to them and exchanged greetings with the wanderers thereWhen the greetings and polite conversation were over he sat down to one sideThe wanderers said to himIs it really true householder Does the ascetic Gotama criticize all forms of mortification Does he categorically condemn and denounce those selfmortifiers who live roughNo sirs the ascetic Gotama does not criticize all forms of mortification Nor does he categorically condemn and denounce those selfmortifiers who live roughThe Buddha criticizes where it is due and praises where it is dueIn doing so he is one who speaks after analyzing the questionand is not definitive on this pointWhen he said this one of the wanderers said to himHold on householder That ascetic Gotama who you praise is an exterminator who refrains from making statementsOn this point also I reasonably respond to the venerablesThe Buddha has stated This is skillful andThis is unskillfulSo when it comes to what is skillful and unskillful the Buddha makes a statementHe is not an exterminator who refrains from making statementsWhen this was said those wanderers sat silent dismayed shoulders drooping downcast depressed with nothing to saySeeing this Vajjiyamāhita got up from his seat He went to the Buddha bowed sat down to one sideand informed the Buddha of all they had discussedGood good householderThats how you should legitimately and

mouth the garland of fire the burning hand the grass blades the bark dress the antelope the meat hook the coins the caustic pickle the twisting bar the straw mat being splashed with hot oil being fed

subject me to the same punishmentsAfraid of the fault apparent in the present life they do not steal the belongings of othersThis is called the fault apparent in the present lifeWhat is the fault to do with lives to comeIts when someone reflectsBad conduct of body speech or mind has a bad painful result in the next lifeIf I conduct myself badlythen when my body breaks up after death wont I be
