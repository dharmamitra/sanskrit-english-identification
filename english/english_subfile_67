Third Immersion
And then several mendicants went up to Venerable Sāriputta and exchanged greetings with him
When the greetings and polite conversation were over they sat down to one side and said to him
Could it be reverend that a mendicant might gain a state of immersion like this They wouldnt perceive earth in earth water in water fire in fire or air in air And they wouldnt perceive the dimension of infinite space in the dimension of infinite space the dimension of infinite consciousness in the dimension of infinite consciousness the dimension of nothingness in the dimension of nothingness or the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception in the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception They wouldnt perceive this world in this world or the other world in the other world And they wouldnt perceive what is seen heard thought known attained sought or explored by the mind And yet they would still perceive
It could be reverends
But how could this be
Its when a mendicant perceives
This is peaceful this is sublimethat is the stilling of all activities the letting go of all attachments the ending of craving fading away cessation extinguishment
Thats how a mendicant might gain a state of immersion like this They wouldnt perceive earth in earth water in water fire in fire or air in air And they wouldnt perceive the dimension of infinite space in the dimension of infinite space the dimension of infinite consciousness in the dimension of infinite consciousness the dimension of nothingness in the dimension of nothingness or the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception in the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception They wouldnt perceive this world in this world or the other world in the other world And they wouldnt perceive what is seen heard thought known attained sought or explored by the mind And yet they would still perceive

With Nandiya
At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Sakyans near Kapilavatthu in the Banyan Tree Monastery
Now at that time the Buddha wanted to commence the rains residence at Sāvatthī
Nandiya the Sakyan heard about this
and thought
Why dont I also commence the rains residence at Sāvatthī
There I can apply myself to my work and from time to time get to see the Buddha
So the Buddha commenced the rains residence in Sāvatthī
and so did Nandiya
There he applied himself to his work and from time to time got to see the Buddha
At that time several mendicants were making a robe for the Buddha thinking that
when his robe was finished and the three months of the rains residence had passed the Buddha would set out wandering
Nandiya the Sakyan heard about this
He went up to the Buddha bowed sat down to one side and said to him
Sir I have heard that
several mendicants are making a robe for the Buddha thinking that
when his robe was finished and the three months of the rains residence had passed the Buddha would set out wandering
Now we spend our life in various ways Which of these should we practice
Good good Nandiya
Its appropriate that gentlemen such as you come to me and ask
We spend our life in various ways Which of these should we practice
The faithful succeed not the faithless
The ethical succeed not the unethical
The energetic succeed not the lazy
The mindful succeed not the unmindful
Those with immersion succeed not those without immersion
The wise succeed not the witless
When youre grounded on these six things go on to develop five further things
Firstly you should recollect the Realized One
That Blessed One is perfected a fully awakened Buddha accomplished in knowledge and conduct holy knower of the world supreme guide for those who wish to train teacher of gods and humans awakened blessed
In this way you should establish mindfulness internally based on the Realized One
Furthermore you should recollect the teaching
The teaching is well explained by the Buddhavisible in this very life immediately effective inviting inspection relevant so that sensible people can know it for themselves
In this way you should establish mindfulness internally based on the teaching
Furthermore you should recollect your good friends
Im fortunate so very fortunate
to have good friends who advise and instruct me out of kindness and compassion
In this way you should establish mindfulness internally based on good friends
Furthermore you should recollect your own generosity
Im so fortunate so very fortunate
Among people with hearts full of the stain of stinginess I live at home rid of stinginess freely generous openhanded loving to let go committed to charity loving to give and to share
In this way you should establish mindfulness internally based on generosity
Furthermore you should recollect the deities
There are deities who surpassing the company of deities that consume solid food are reborn in a certain host of mindmade deities They dont see in themselves anything more to do or anything that needs improvement
An irreversibly freed mendicant doesnt see in themselves anything more to do or anything that needs improvement
In the same way Nandiya there are deities who surpassing the company of deities that consume solid food are reborn in a certain host of mindmade deities They dont see in themselves anything more to do or anything that needs improvement
In this way you should establish mindfulness internally based on the deities
A noble disciple who has these eleven qualities gives up bad unskillful qualities and doesnt cling to them
Its like when a pot full of water is tipped over so the water drains out and doesnt go back in
Suppose there was an uncontrolled fire It advances burning up dry woodlands and doesnt go back over what it has burned

A noble disciple whose mind is unswerving finds joy in the meaning and the teaching and finds joy connected with the teaching
When theyre joyful rapture springs up When the mind is full of rapture the body becomes tranquil When the body is tranquil they feel bliss And when theyre blissful the mind becomes immersed in samādhi
You should develop this recollection of the Buddha while walking standing sitting lying down while working and while at home with your children

The Vajji Seven
With Vassakāra
So I have heard
At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha on the Vultures Peak Mountain
Now at that time King Ajātasattu Vedehiputta of Māgadha wanted to invade the Vajjis
He declared
I shall wipe out these Vajjis so mighty and powerful I shall destroy them and lay ruin and devastation upon them
And then King Ajātasattu addressed Vassakāra the brahmin minister of Māgadha
Please brahmin go to the Buddha and in my name bow with your head to his feet Ask him if he is healthy and well nimble strong and living comfortably
And then say
Sir King Ajātasattu Vedehiputta of Māgadha wants to invade the Vajjis
He has declared
I shall wipe out these Vajjis so mighty and powerful I shall destroy them and lay ruin and devastation upon them
Remember well how the Buddha answers and tell it to me
For Realized Ones say nothing that is not so
Yes sir Vassakāra replied He went to the Buddha and exchanged greetings with him
When the greetings and polite conversation were over he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha
Master Gotama King Ajātasattu bows with his head to your feet He asks if you are healthy and well nimble strong and living comfortably
King Ajātasattu wants to invade the Vajjis
He has declared
I shall wipe out these Vajjis so mighty and powerful I shall destroy them and lay ruin and devastation upon them
Now at that time Venerable nanda was standing behind the Buddha fanning him
Then the Buddha said to him
nanda have you heard that the Vajjis meet frequently and have many meetings
I have heard that sir
As long as the Vajjis meet frequently and have many meetings they can expect growth not decline
nanda have you heard that the Vajjis meet in harmony leave in harmony and carry on their business in harmony
I have heard that sir
As long as the Vajjis meet in harmony leave in harmony and carry on their business in harmony they can expect growth not decline
nanda have you heard that the Vajjis dont make new decrees or abolish existing decrees but proceed having undertaken the ancient Vajjian principles as they have been decreed
I have heard that sir
As long as the Vajjis dont make new decrees or abolish existing decrees but proceed having undertaken the traditional Vajjian principles as they have been decreed they can expect growth not decline
nanda have you heard that the Vajjis honor respect esteem and venerate Vajjian elders and think them worth listening to
I have heard that sir
As long as the Vajjis honor respect esteem and venerate Vajjian elders and think them worth listening to they can expect growth not decline
nanda have you heard that the Vajjis dont rape or abduct women or girls from their families and force them to live with them
I have heard that sir
As long as the Vajjis dont rape or abduct women or girls from their families and force them to live with them they can expect growth not decline
nanda have you heard that the Vajjis honor respect esteem and venerate the Vajjian shrines whether inner or outer not neglecting the proper spiritofferings that were given and made in the past
I have heard that sir
As long as the Vajjis honor respect esteem and venerate the Vajjian shrines whether inner or outer not neglecting the proper spiritofferings that were given and made in the past they can expect growth not decline
nanda have you heard that the Vajjis organize proper protection shelter and security for perfected ones so that more perfected ones might come to the realm and those already here may live in comfort
I have heard that sir
As long as the Vajjis organize proper protection shelter and security for perfected ones so that more perfected ones might come to the realm and those already here may live in comfort they can expect growth not decline
Then the Buddha said to Vassakāra
Brahmin one time I was staying near Vesālī at the Sārandada woodland shrine
There I taught the Vajjis these principles that prevent decline
As long as these seven principles that prevent decline last among the Vajjis and as long as the Vajjis are seen following them they can expect growth not decline
When the Buddha had spoken Vassakāra said to him Master Gotama if the Vajjis follow even a single one of these principles they can expect growth not decline
How much more so all seven
King Ajātasattu cannot defeat the Vajjis in war unless by diplomacy or by sowing dissension
Well now Master Gotama I must go I have many duties and much to do
Please brahmin go at your convenience
Then Vassakāra the brahmin having approved and agreed with what the Buddha said got up from his seat and left

Perceptions in Detail
Mendicants these seven perceptions when developed and cultivated are very fruitful and beneficial They culminate in the deathless and end with the deathless
What seven
The perceptions of ugliness death repulsiveness of food dissatisfaction with the whole world impermanence suffering in impermanence and notself in suffering
These seven perceptions when developed and cultivated are very fruitful and beneficial They culminate in the deathless and end with the deathless
When the perception of ugliness is developed and cultivated its very fruitful and beneficial It culminates in the deathless and ends with the deathless
Thats what I said but why did I say it
When a mendicant often meditates with a mind reinforced with the perception of ugliness their mind draws back from sexual intercourse They shrink away turn aside and dont get drawn into it And either equanimity or revulsion become stabilized
Its like a chickens feather or a strip of sinew thrown in a fire It shrivels up shrinks rolls up and doesnt stretch out
In the same way when a mendicant often meditates with a mind reinforced with the perception of ugliness their mind draws back from sexual intercourse 
If a mendicant often meditates with a mind reinforced with the perception of ugliness but their mind is drawn to sexual intercourse and not repulsed
they should know My perception of ugliness is undeveloped I dont have any distinction higher than before I havent attained a fruit of development
In this way they are aware of the situation
But if a mendicant often meditates with a mind reinforced with the perception of ugliness their mind draws back from sexual intercourse 
they should know My perception of ugliness is well developed I have realized a distinction higher than before I have attained a fruit of development
In this way they are aware of the situation
When the perception of ugliness is developed and cultivated its very fruitful and beneficial It culminates in the deathless and ends with the deathless
Thats what I said and this is why I said it

Thats what I said and this is why I said it

When a mendicant often meditates with a mind reinforced with the perception of suffering in impermanence they establish a keen perception of the danger of sloth laziness slackness negligence lack of commitment and failure to review like a killer with a drawn sword 
Thats what I said and this is why I said it
When the perception of notself in suffering is developed and cultivated its very fruitful and beneficial It culminates in the deathless and ends with the deathless Thats what I said but why did I say it
When a mendicant often meditates with a mind reinforced with the perception of notself in suffering their mind is rid of Imaking minemaking and conceit for this conscious body and all external stimuli It has gone beyond discrimination and is peaceful and well freed
If a mendicant often meditates with a mind reinforced with the perception of notself in suffering but their mind is not rid of Imaking minemaking and conceit for this conscious body and all external stimuli nor has it gone beyond discrimination and is not peaceful or well freed
they should know My perception of notself in suffering is undeveloped I dont have any distinction higher than before I havent attained a fruit of development
In this way they are aware of the situation

Nandas Mother
So I have heard
At one time the venerables Sāriputta and Mahāmoggallāna were wandering in the Southern Hills together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants
Now at that time the laywoman Veḷukaṇṭakī Nandas mother rose at the crack of dawn and recited the verses of The Way to the Beyond
And at that time the great king Vessavaṇa was on his way from the north to the south on some business
He heard Nandas Mother reciting and stood waiting for her to finish
Then when her recital was over she fell silent
Then knowing she had finished Vessavaṇa applauded saying
Good sister Good sister
But who might you be my dear
Sister I am your brother Vessavaṇa the great king
Good my dear Then may my recital of the teaching be my offering to you as my guest
Good sister And let this also be your offering to me as your guest
Tomorrow the mendicant Saṅgha headed by Sāriputta and Moggallāna will arrive at Veḷukaṇṭa before breakfast When youve served the Saṅgha please dedicate the religious donation to me
Then that will also be your offering to me as your guest
And when the night had passed the lay woman Nandas Mother had a variety of delicious foods prepared in her own home
Then the Saṅgha of mendicants headed by Sāriputta and Moggallāna arrived at Veḷukaṇṭa
Then Nandas Mother addressed a man
Please mister go to the monastery and announce the time to the Saṅgha saying
Sirs its time The meal is ready in the home of the lady Nandas Mother
Yes Maam that man replied and he did as she said
And then the Saṅgha of mendicants headed by Sāriputta and Moggallāna robed up in the morning and taking their bowls and robes went to the home of Nandas Mother where they sat on the seats spread out
Then Nandas Mother served and satisfied them with her own hands with a variety of delicious foods
When Sāriputta had eaten and washed his hand and bowl Nandas Mother sat down to one side
Sāriputta said to her
Nandas Mother who told you that the Saṅgha of mendicants was about to arrive
Sir last night I rose at the crack of dawn and recited the verses of The Way to the Beyond and then I fell silent
Then the great king Vessavaṇa knowing I had finished applauded me
Good sister Good sister
I asked But who might you be my dear
Sister I am your brother Vessavaṇa the great king
Good my dear Then may my recital of the teaching be my offering to you as my guest

And so sir may the merit and the growth of merit in this gift be for the happiness of the great king Vessavaṇa
Its incredible Nandas Mother its amazing
that you converse face to face with a mighty and illustrious god like the great king Vessavaṇa
Sir this is not my only incredible and amazing quality

I had an only son called Nanda who I loved dearly
The rulers forcibly abducted him on some pretext and had him executed

Whenever I want quite secluded from sensual pleasures secluded from unskillful qualities I enter and remain in the first absorption which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion while placing the mind and keeping it connected
As the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled I enter and remain in the second absorption which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion with internal clarity and confidence and unified mind without placing the mind and keeping it connected
And with the fading away of rapture I enter and remain in the third absorption where I meditate with equanimity mindful and aware personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare Equanimous and mindful one meditates in bliss
With the giving up of pleasure and pain and the ending of former happiness and sadness I enter and remain in the fourth absorption without pleasure or pain with pure equanimity and mindfulness
Its incredible Nandas Mother its amazing
Sir this is not my only incredible and amazing quality
there is another
Of the five lower fetters taught by the Buddha I dont see any that I havent given up
Its incredible Nandas Mother its amazing
Then Venerable Sāriputta educated encouraged fired up and inspired Nandas Mother with a Dhamma talk after which he got up from his seat and left

Now the buds of the Shady Orchid Tree have burst It wont be long until it fully blossoms
When the Shady Orchid Tree of the Gods of the ThirtyThree has fully blossomed the gods are elated For four heavenly months they amused themselves at the root of the tree supplied and provided with the five kinds of sensual stimulation
When the Shady Orchid Tree has fully blossomed its radiance spreads for fifty leagues while its fragrance wafts for a hundred leagues Such is the majesty of the Shady Orchid Tree
In the same way when a noble disciple plans to go forth from the lay life to homelessness theyre like the Shady Orchid Tree when its leaves turn brown
When a noble disciple shaves off their hair and beard dresses in ocher robes and goes forth from the lay life to homelessness theyre like the Shady Orchid Tree when its leaves fall

When a noble disciple realizes the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life and they live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements
theyre like the Shady Orchid tree when it fully blossoms
At that time the earth gods raised the cry
This venerable named soandso from suchandsuch village or town the pupil of the venerable named soandso went forth from the lay life to homelessness Theyve realized the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life And they live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements

Tissa the Brahmā
So I have heard
At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha on the Vultures Peak Mountain
Then late at night a glorious deity lighting up the entire Vultures Peak went up to the Buddha bowed stood to one side and said to him
Sir these nuns are freed
And another deity told the Buddha
Sir these nuns are well freed without anything left over
This is what that deity said
and the teacher approved
Then that deity knowing that the teacher approved bowed and respectfully circled the Buddha keeping him on his right before vanishing right there
Then when the night had passed the Buddha told the mendicants all that had happened
Now at that time Venerable Mahāmoggallāna was sitting not far from the Buddha
He thought
Which gods know whether a person has anything left over or not
Now at that time a monk called Tissa had recently passed away and been reborn in a Brahmā realm
There they knew that
Tissa the Brahmā was very mighty and powerful
And then Venerable Mahāmoggallāna as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm vanished from the Vultures Peak and reappeared in that Brahmā realm
Tissa saw Moggallāna coming off in the distance
and said to him
Come my good Moggallāna
Welcome my good Moggallāna
Its been a long time since you took the opportunity to come here
Sit my good Moggallāna this seat is for you
Moggallāna sat down on the seat spread out
Then Tissa bowed to Moggallāna and sat to one side
Moggallāna said to him
Which gods know whether a person has anything left over or not
The gods of Brahmās Host know this
But do all of them know this
No my good Moggallāna not all of them
Those gods of Brahmās Host who are content with the lifespan of Brahmā with the beauty happiness fame and sovereignty of Brahmā and who dont truly understand any higher escape
they dont know this
But those gods of Brahmās Host who are not content with the lifespan of Brahmā with the beauty happiness fame and sovereignty of Brahmā and who do truly understand a higher escape
they do know this
Take a mendicant who is freed both ways
The gods know of them
This venerable is freed both ways
As long as their body remains they will be seen by gods and humans
But when their body breaks up gods and humans will see them no more
This too is how those gods know whether a person has anything left over or not
Take a mendicant who is freed by wisdom
The gods know of them
This venerable is freed by wisdom
As long as their body remains they will be seen by gods and humans
But when their body breaks up gods and humans will see them no more
This too is how those gods know whether a person has anything left over or not
Take a mendicant who is a personal witness
The gods know of them
This venerable is a personal witness
Hopefully this venerable will frequent appropriate lodgings associate with good friends and control their faculties
Then they might realize the supreme culmination of the spiritual path in this very life and live having achieved with their own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness
This too is how those gods know whether a person has anything left over or not
Take a mendicant who is attained to view 
freed by faith 
a follower of the teachings
The gods know of them
This venerable is a follower of the teachings
Hopefully this venerable will frequent appropriate lodgings associate with good friends and control their faculties
Then they might realize the supreme culmination of the spiritual path in this very life and live having achieved with their own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness
This too is how those gods know whether a person has anything left over or not
Moggallāna approved and agreed with what Tissa the Brahmā said Then as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm he vanished from the Brahmā realm and reappeared on the Vultures Peak
Then Mahāmoggallāna went up to the Buddha bowed sat down to one side
and told him what had happened
But Moggallāna Tissa the Brahmā didnt teach the seventh person the signless meditator
Now is the time Blessed One Now is the time Holy One
May the Buddha teach the seventh person the signless meditator
The mendicants will listen and remember it
Well then Moggallāna listen and pay close attention I will speak
Yes sir Mahāmoggallāna replied
The Buddha said this
Moggallāna take the case of a mendicant who not focusing on any signs enters and remains in the signless immersion of the heart
The gods know of them
This venerable not focusing on any signs enters and remains in the signless immersion of the heart
Hopefully this venerable will frequent appropriate lodgings associate with good friends and control their faculties
Then they might realize the supreme culmination of the spiritual path in this very life and live having achieved with their own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness

Yes sir

So you should train like this
Our use of robes almsfood lodgings and medicines and supplies for the sick shall be of great fruit and benefit for those who offered them And our going forth will not be wasted but will be fruitful and fertile
Thats how you should train
Considering your own good mendicants is quite enough for you to persist with diligence
Considering the good of others is quite enough for you to persist with diligence
Considering the good of both is quite enough for you to persist with diligence
That is what the Buddha said
And while this discourse was being spoken sixty monks spewed hot blood from their mouths
Sixty mendicants resigned the training and returned to a lesser life saying
Its too hard Blessed One Its just too hard
And sixty monks were freed from defilements by not grasping

Bulls bullocks heifers goats and ramsfive hundred of eachhad been led to the post for the sacrifice
Then the brahmin Uggatasarīra went up to the Buddha and exchanged greetings with him
When the greetings and polite conversation were over he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha
Master Gotama I have heard that kindling the sacrificial fire and raising the sacrificial post is very fruitful and beneficial
Ive also heard this brahmin
For a second time

Brahmin you should properly and happily take care of three fires honoring respecting esteeming and venerating them

The fire of those worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods The fire of a householder And the fire of those worthy of a religious donation
And what is the fire of those worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods
Your mother and father are called the fire of those worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods
Why is that
Since it is from them that youve been incubated and produced So you should properly and happily take care of this fire honoring respecting esteeming and venerating it
And what is the fire of a householder
Your children partners bondservants workers and staff are called a householders fire
So you should properly and happily take care of this fire honoring respecting esteeming and venerating it
And what is the fire of those worthy of a religious donation
The ascetics and brahmins who avoid intoxication and negligence are settled in patience and gentleness and who tame calm and extinguish themselves are called the fire of those worthy of a religious donation
So you should properly and happily take care of this fire honoring respecting esteeming and venerating it
You should properly and happily take care of these three fires honoring respecting esteeming and venerating them
But the wood fire brahmin should from time to time be fanned watched over with equanimity extinguished or put aside
When he said this the brahmin Uggatasarīra said to the Buddha
Excellent Master Gotama Excellent 
From this day forth may Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life

At one time the Buddha was staying near Campā on the banks of the Gaggarā Lotus Pond
Then several lay followers of Campā went to Venerable Sāriputta bowed sat down to one side and said to him
Sir its been a long time since weve heard a Dhamma talk from the Buddha
It would be good if we got to hear a Dhamma talk from the Buddha
Well then reverends come on the next sabbath day
Hopefully youll get to hear a Dhamma talk from the Buddha
Yes sir they replied Then they rose from their seats bowed to Sāriputta and respectfully circled him before leaving
Then on the next sabbath the lay followers of Campā went to Venerable Sāriputta bowed and stood to one side
Then they went together with Sāriputta to the Buddha bowed and sat down to one side
Sāriputta said to the Buddha
Sir could it be that someone gives a gift and it is not very fruitful or beneficial
while someone else gives exactly the same gift and it is very fruitful and beneficial
Indeed it could Sāriputta
Sir what is the cause what is the reason for this
Sāriputta take the case of a someone who gives a gift as an investment their mind tied to it expecting to keep it thinking Ill enjoy this in my next life
They give to ascetics or brahmins such things as food drink clothing vehicles garlands fragrance and makeup and bed house and lighting
What do you think Sāriputta dont some people give gifts in this way
Yes sir
Sāriputta someone who gives a gift as an investment
when their body breaks up after death is reborn in the company of the gods of the Four Great Kings
When that deed success fame and sovereignty is spent they return to this state of existence
Next take the case of a someone who gives a gift not as an investment their mind not tied to it not expecting to keep it and not thinking Ill enjoy this in my next life
But they give a gift thinking Its good to give 
They give a gift thinking Giving was practiced by my father and my fathers father It would not be right for me to abandon this family tradition 
They give a gift thinking I cook they dont It wouldnt be right for me to not give to them 
They give a gift thinking The ancient brahmin hermits were Aṭṭhaka Vāmaka Vāmadeva Vessāmitta Yamadaggi Aṅgīrasa Bhāradvāja Vāseṭṭha Kassapa and Bhagu
Just as they performed great sacrifices I will share a gift 
They give a gift thinking When giving this gift my mind becomes clear and I become happy and joyful 
They dont give a gift thinking When giving this gift my mind becomes clear and I become happy and joyful
But they give a gift thinking This is an adornment and requisite for the mind
They give to ascetics or brahmins such things as food drink clothing vehicles garlands fragrance and makeup and bed house and lighting
What do you think Sāriputta dont some people give gifts in this way
Yes sir
Sāriputta someone who gives gifts not for any other reason
but thinking This is an adornment and requisite for the mind
when their body breaks up after death is reborn among the gods of Brahmās Host
When that deed success fame and sovereignty is spent they are a nonreturner they do not return to this state of existence

The Seven Suns
So I have heard
At one time the Buddha was staying near Vesālī in Ambapālīs Wood
There the Buddha addressed the mendicants
Mendicants
Venerable sir they replied
The Buddha said this
Mendicants conditions are impermanent
Conditions are unstable
Conditions are unreliable
This is quite enough for you to become disillusioned dispassionate and freed regarding all conditions
Sineru the king of mountains is  leagues long and  leagues wide It sinks  leagues below the ocean and rises  leagues above it
There comes a time when after a very long period has passed the rain doesnt fall For many years many hundreds many thousands many hundreds of thousands of years no rain falls
When this happens the plants and seeds the herbs grass and big trees wither away and dry up and are no more
So impermanent are conditions
so unstable so unreliable
This is quite enough for you to become disillusioned dispassionate and freed regarding all conditions
There comes a time when after a very long period has passed a second sun appears
When this happens the streams and pools wither away and dry up and are no more
So impermanent are conditions 
There comes a time when after a very long period has passed a third sun appears
When this happens the great rivers
the Ganges Yamunā Aciravatī Sarabhū and Mahīwither away and dry up and are no more
So impermanent are conditions 
There comes a time when after a very long period has passed a fourth sun appears
When this happens the great lakes from which the rivers originate
the Anotattā Sīhapapātā Rathakārā Kaṇṇamuṇḍā Kuṇālā Chaddantā and Mandākinīwither away and dry up and are no more
So impermanent are conditions 
There comes a time when after a very long period has passed a fifth sun appears
When this happens the water in the ocean sinks by a hundred leagues It sinks by two three four five six or even seven hundred leagues
The water that remains in the ocean is only seven palm trees deep Its six five four three two or even one palm tree deep
The water that remains in the ocean is only seven fathoms deep Its six five four three two one or even half a fathom deep Its waist high knee high or even ankle high
Its like the time in the autumn when the rain falls heavily and water remains here and there in the cows hoofprints
In the same way water in the ocean remains here and there in puddles like cows hoofprints
When the fifth sun appears theres not even enough water in the great ocean to wet a toejoint
So impermanent are conditions 
There comes a time when after a very long period has passed a sixth sun appears
When this happens this great earth and Sineru the king of mountains smoke and smolder and give off fumes
Its like when a potters kiln is first kindled and it smokes and smolders and gives off fumes
In the same way this great earth and Sineru the king of mountains smoke and smolder and give off fumes
So impermanent are conditions 
There comes a time when after a very long period has passed a seventh sun appears
When this happens this great earth and Sineru the king of mountains erupt in one burning mass of fire
And as they blaze and burn the flames are swept by the wind as far as the Brahmā realm
Sineru the king of mountains blazes and burns crumbling as its overcome by the great fire And meanwhile mountain peaks a hundred leagues high or two three four or five hundred leagues high disintegrate as they burn
And when the great earth and Sineru the king of mountains blaze and burn no soot or ash is found
Its like when ghee or oil blaze and burn and neither ashes nor soot are found
In the same way when the great earth and Sineru the king of mountains blaze and burn no soot or ash is found
So impermanent are conditions
so unstable are conditions
so unreliable are conditions
This is quite enough for you to become disillusioned dispassionate and freed regarding all conditions
Mendicants who would ever think or believe that
this earth and Sineru king of mountains will burn and crumble and be no more except for one who has seen the truth
Once upon a time there was a teacher called Sunetta He was a religious founder and was free of sensual desire
He had many hundreds of disciples
He taught them the path to rebirth in the company of Brahmā
Those who totally understood Sunettas teachings werewhen their body broke up after deathreborn in a good place the company of Brahmā
Of those who didnt totally understand Sunettas teachings somewhen their body broke up after deathwere reborn in the company of the Gods Who Control the Creations of Others Some were reborn in the company of the Gods Who Love to Create some with the Joyful Gods some with the Gods of Yama some with the Gods of the ThirtyThree and some with the Gods of the Four Great Kings Some were reborn in the company of welltodo aristocrats or brahmins or householders
Then the teacher Sunetta thought
Its not proper for me to be reborn in the next life in exactly the same place as my disciples Why dont I further develop love
Then Sunetta developed love for seven years
Having done so he did not return to this world for seven eons of cosmic expansion and contraction
As the cosmos contracted he went to the realm of streaming radiance
As it expanded he was reborn in an empty mansion of Brahmā
There he was Brahmā the Great Brahmā the undefeated the champion the universal seer the wielder of power
He was Sakka lord of gods thirtysix times
Many hundreds of times he was a king a wheelturning monarch a just and principled king His dominion extended to all four sides he achieved stability in the country and he possessed the seven treasures
He had over a thousand sons who were valiant and heroic crushing the armies of his enemies
After conquering this land girt by sea he reigned by principle without rod or sword
Yet even though Sunetta lived so long he was not exempt from
rebirth old age and death He was not exempt from sorrow lamentation pain dejection and despair I say
Why is that
Because of not understanding and not penetrating four things
What four
Noble ethics immersion wisdom and freedom
These noble ethics immersion wisdom and freedom have been understood and comprehended Craving for continued existence has been cut off the attachment to continued existence is ended now therell be no more future lives
That is what the Buddha said
Then the Holy One the Teacher went on to say
Ethics immersion and wisdom
and the supreme freedom
these things have been understood
by Gotama the renowned
And so the Buddha having insight
explained this teaching to the mendicants
The Teacher has made an end of suffering
seeing clearly he is extinguished

General Sīha
So I have heard
At one time the Buddha was staying near Vesālī at the Great Wood in the hall with the peaked roof
Then General Sīha went up to the Buddha bowed sat down to one side and said to him
Sir can you point out a fruit of giving thats apparent in the present life
Well then Sīha Ill ask you about this in return and you can answer as you like
What do you think Sīha
Consider two people
One is faithless stingy miserly and abusive One is a faithful donor who loves charity
Which do you think the perfected ones will show compassion for first
Why would the perfected ones first show compassion for the person who is faithless stingy miserly and abusive
Theyd show compassion first for the faithful donor who loves charity
Which do you think the perfected ones will first approach
Theyd first approach the faithful donor who loves charity
Which do you think the perfected ones will receive alms from first
Theyd receive alms first from the faithful donor who loves charity
Which do you think the perfected ones will teach the Dhamma to first
Theyd first teach the Dhamma to the faithful donor who loves charity
Which do you think would get a good reputation
The faithful donor who loves charity would get a good reputation
Which do you think would enter any kind of assembly bold and assured whether its an assembly of aristocrats brahmins householders or ascetics
The faithful donor who loves charity would enter any kind of assembly bold and assured whether its an assembly of aristocrats brahmins householders or ascetics
When their body breaks up after death which do you think would be reborn in a good place a heavenly realm
Why would the person who is faithless stingy miserly and abusive be reborn in a good place a heavenly realm
The faithful donor who loves charity would when their body breaks up after death be reborn in a good place a heavenly realm
When it comes to these fruits of giving that are apparent in the present life I dont have to rely on faith in the Buddha
for I know them too
Im a giver a donor and the perfected ones show compassion for me first
Im a giver and the perfected ones approach me first
Im a giver and the perfected ones receive alms from me first
Im a giver and the perfected ones teach me Dhamma first
Im a giver and I have this good reputation
General Sīha gives serves and attends on the Saṅgha
Im a giver I enter any kind of assembly bold and assured whether its an assembly of aristocrats brahmins householders or ascetics
When it comes to these fruits of giving that are apparent in the present life I dont have to rely on faith in the Buddha
for I know them too
But when the Buddha says
When a givers body breaks up after death theyre reborn in a good place a heavenly realm I dont know this
so I have to rely on faith in the Buddha
Thats so true Sīha Thats so true
When a givers body breaks up after death theyre reborn in a good place a heavenly realm

Irritable
Mendicants these seven things that please and assist an enemy happen to an irritable woman or man
What seven
Firstly an enemy wishes for an enemy
If only theyd become ugly
Why is that
Because an enemy doesnt like to have a beautiful enemy
An irritable person overcome and overwhelmed by anger is ugly even though theyre nicely bathed and anointed with hair and beard dressed and wearing white clothes
This is the first thing that pleases and assists an enemy which happens to an irritable woman or man
Furthermore an enemy wishes for an enemy
If only theyd sleep badly
Why is that
Because an enemy doesnt like to have an enemy who sleeps at ease
An irritable person overcome and overwhelmed by anger sleeps badly even though they sleep on a couch spread with woolen coversshagpiled pure white or embroidered with flowersand spread with a fine deer hide with a canopy above and red pillows at both ends
This is the second thing 
Furthermore an enemy wishes for an enemy
If only they dont get all they need
Why is that
Because an enemy doesnt like to have an enemy who gets all they need
When an irritable person overcome and overwhelmed by anger gets what they dont need they think Ive got what I need When they get what they need they think Ive got what I dont need
When an angry person gets these things that are the exact opposite of what they need its for their lasting harm and suffering
This is the third thing 
Furthermore an enemy wishes for an enemy
If only they werent wealthy
Why is that
Because an enemy doesnt like to have an enemy who is wealthy
When a person is irritable overcome and overwhelmed by anger the rulers seize the legitimate wealth theyve earned by their efforts built up with their own hands gathered by the sweat of their brow
This is the fourth thing 
Furthermore an enemy wishes for an enemy
If only they werent famous
Why is that
Because an enemy doesnt like to have a famous enemy
When a person is irritable overcome and overwhelmed by anger any fame they have acquired by diligence falls to dust
This is the fifth thing 
Furthermore an enemy wishes for an enemy
If only they had no friends
Why is that
Because an enemy doesnt like to have an enemy with friends
When a person is irritable overcome and overwhelmed by anger their friends and colleagues relatives and kin avoid them from afar
This is the sixth thing 
Furthermore an enemy wishes for an enemy
If only when their body breaks up after death theyre reborn in a place of loss a bad place the underworld hell
Why is that
Because an enemy doesnt like to have an enemy who goes to a good place
When a person is irritable overcome and overwhelmed by anger they do bad things by way of body speech and mind
When their body breaks up after death theyre reborn in a place of loss a bad place the underworld hell
This is the seventh thing that pleases and assists an enemy which happens to an irritable woman or man
These are the seven things that please and assist an enemy which happen to an irritable woman or man
An irritable person is ugly
and they sleep badly
When they get what they need
they take it to be what they dont need
An angry person
kills with body or speech
overcome with anger
they lose their wealth
Mad with anger
they fall into disgrace
Family friends and loved ones
avoid an irritable person
Anger creates harm
anger upsets the mind
That person doesnt recognize
the danger that arises within
An angry person doesnt know the good
An angry person doesnt see the truth
When a person is beset by anger
only blind darkness is left
An angry person destroys with ease
what was hard to build
Afterwards when the anger is spent
theyre tormented as if burnt by fire
Their look betrays their sulkiness
like a fires smoky plume
And when their anger flares up
they make others angry
They have no conscience or prudence
nor any respectful speech
One overcome by anger
has no island refuge anywhere
The deeds that torment a man
are far from those that are good
Ill explain them now
listen to this for it is the truth
An angry person slays their father
their mother too they slay
An angry person slays a saint
a normal person too they slay
A man is raised by his mother
who shows him the world
But an angry ordinary person slays
even that good woman who gave him life
Like oneself all sentient beings
hold themselves most dear
But angry people kill themselves all kinds of ways
distraught for many reasons
Some kill themselves with swords
some distraught take poison
Some hang themselves with rope
or fling themselves down a mountain gorge
When they commit deeds of destroying life
and killing themselves
they dont realize what they do
for anger leads to their downfall
The snare of death in the form of anger
lies hidden in the heart
You should cut it out by selfcontrol
by wisdom energy and right ideas
An astute person should cut out
this unskillful thing
And theyd train in the teaching in just the same way
not yielding to sulkiness
Free of anger free of despair
free of greed with no more longing
tamed having given up anger
they become extinguished without defilements

Nodding Off
So I have heard
At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Bhaggas on Crocodile Hill in the deer park at Bhesakaḷās Wood
Now at that time in the land of the Magadhans near Kallavāḷamutta Village Venerable Mahāmoggallāna was nodding off while meditating
The Buddha saw him with his clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman
Then as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm he vanished from the deer park at Bhesakaḷās Wood in the land of the Bhaggas and reappeared in front of Mahāmoggallāna near Kallavāḷamutta Village in the land of the Magadhans
He sat on the seat spread out
and said to Mahāmoggallāna
Are you nodding off Moggallāna Are you nodding off
Yes sir
So Moggallāna dont focus on or cultivate the perception that you were meditating on when you fell drowsy
Its possible that youll give up drowsiness in this way
But what if that doesnt work Then think about and consider the teaching as youve learned and memorized it examining it with your mind
Its possible that youll give up drowsiness in this way
But what if that doesnt work Then recite in detail the teaching as youve learned and memorized it
Its possible that youll give up drowsiness in this way
But what if that doesnt work Then pinch your ears and rub your limbs
Its possible that youll give up drowsiness in this way
But what if that doesnt work Then get up from your seat flush your eyes with water look around in every direction and look up at the stars and constellations
Its possible that youll give up drowsiness in this way
But what if that doesnt work Then focus on the perception of light concentrating on the perception of day
regardless of whether its night or day
And so with an open and unenveloped heart develop a mind thats full of radiance
Its possible that youll give up drowsiness in this way
But what if that doesnt work Then walk mindfully concentrating on the perception of continuity your faculties directed inwards and your mind not scattered outside
Its possible that youll give up drowsiness in this way
But what if that doesnt work Then lie down in the lions postureon the right side placing one foot on top of the othermindful and aware and focused on the time of getting up
When you wake you should get up quickly thinking
I will not live attached to the pleasures of sleeping lying down and drowsing
Thats how you should train
So you should train like this
I will not approach families with my head swollen with vanity
Thats how you should train
What happens if a mendicant approaches families with a head swollen with vanity Well families have business to attend to
so people might not notice when a mendicant arrives In that case the mendicant thinks
Who on earth has turned this family against me It seems they dont like me any more
And so because they dont get anything they feel dismayed Being dismayed they become restless Being restless they lose restraint And without restraint the mind is far from immersion
So you should train like this
I wont get into arguments
Thats how you should train
When theres an argument you can expect therell be lots of talking When theres lots of talking people become restless Being restless they lose restraint And without restraint the mind is far from immersion
Moggallāna I dont praise all kinds of closeness
Nor do I criticize all kinds of closeness
I dont praise closeness with laypeople and renunciates
I do praise closeness with those lodgings that are quiet and still far from the madding crowd remote from human settlements and fit for retreat
When he said this Venerable Moggallāna asked the Buddha
Sir how do you briefly define a mendicant who is freed through the ending of craving who has reached the ultimate end the ultimate sanctuary the ultimate spiritual life the ultimate goal and is best among gods and humans
Its when a mendicant has heard
Nothing is worth insisting on
When a mendicant has heard that
nothing is worth insisting on
they directly know all things
Directly knowing all things they completely understand all things Having completely understood all things when they experience any kind of feelingpleasant unpleasant or neutral
they meditate observing impermanence dispassion cessation and letting go in those feelings
Meditating in this way they dont grasp at anything in the world
Not grasping theyre not anxious Not being anxious they personally become extinguished
They understand Rebirth is ended the spiritual journey has been completed what had to be done has been done there is no return to any state of existence
Thats how I briefly define a mendicant who is freed through the ending of craving who has reached the ultimate end the ultimate sanctuary the ultimate spiritual life the ultimate goal and is best among gods and humans

About Sunetta
Once upon a time mendicants there was a Teacher called Sunetta He was a religious founder and was free of sensual desire
He had many hundreds of disciples
He taught them the path to rebirth in the company of Brahmā
Those lacking confidence in Sunetta werewhen their body broke up after deathreborn in a place of loss a bad place the underworld hell
Those full of confidence in Sunetta werewhen their body broke up after deathreborn in a good place a heavenly realm
Once upon a time there was a teacher called Mūgapakkha 
Hatthipāla 
Jotipāla 
Araka He was a religious founder and was free of sensual desire

Those lacking confidence in Araka werewhen their body broke up after deathreborn in a place of loss a bad place the underworld hell
Those full of confidence in Araka werewhen their body broke up after deathreborn in a good place a heavenly realm
What do you think mendicants
If someone with malicious intent were to abuse and insult these seven teachers with their hundreds of followers would they not make much bad karma
Yes sir
They would indeed
But someone who abuses and insults a single person accomplished in view with malicious intent makes even more bad karma
Why is that
I say that any injury done by those outside of the Buddhist community does not compare with what is done to ones own spiritual companions
So you should train like this
We will have no malicious intent for our spiritual companions
Thats how you should train

Yes sir the mendicants replied
The Buddha said this
And what are the seven places people are reborn
Take a mendicant who practices like this
It might not be and it might not be mine It will not be and it will not be mine I am giving up what exists what has come to be They gain equanimity
Theyre not attached to life or to creating a new life And they see with right wisdom that there is a peaceful state beyond
But they havent completely realized that state They havent totally given up the underlying tendencies of conceit attachment to life and ignorance
With the ending of the five lower fetters theyre extinguished between one life and the next

Then as Venerable Sāriputta was in private retreat this thought came to his mind

the teaching 
the Saṅgha

immersion

Then these qualities will not only be purified in me but will be better known as purified
Suppose a man were to acquire a gold coin pure and bright
Theyd think
My gold coin is pure and bright Why dont I take it to show the smiths
Then it will not only be purified but will be better known as purified

A Great Sacrifice
Then the brahmin Jāṇussoṇi went up to the Buddha and exchanged greetings with him
When the greetings and polite conversation were over he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha
Does Master Gotama claim to be celibate
Brahmin if anyone should be rightly said to
live the celibate life unbroken impeccable spotless and unmarred full and pure its me
But what Master Gotama is a break taint stain or mar in celibacy
Firstly an ascetic or brahmin who claims to be perfectly celibate does not mutually engage in sex with a female
However they consent to being anointed massaged bathed and rubbed by a female
They enjoy it and like it and find it satisfying
This is a break taint stain or mar in celibacy
This is called one who lives the celibate life impurely tied to the fetter of sex Theyre not freed from rebirth old age death sorrow lamentation pain sadness and distress Theyre not freed from suffering I say
Furthermore an ascetic or brahmin who claims to be perfectly celibate does not mutually engage in sex with a female Nor do they consent to massage and bathing
However they giggle and play and have fun with females 
they gaze into a females eyes 
they listen through a wall or rampart to the sound of females laughing or chatting or singing or crying 
they recall when they used to laugh chat and have fun with females 
they see a householder or their child amusing themselves supplied and provided with the five kinds of sensual stimulation 
They dont see a householder or their child amusing themselves supplied and provided with the five kinds of sensual stimulation
However they live the celibate life wishing to be reborn in one of the orders of gods They think By this precept or observance or mortification or spiritual life may I become one of the gods
They enjoy it and like it and find it satisfying
This is a break taint stain or mar in celibacy
This is called one who lives the celibate life impurely tied to the fetter of sex Theyre not free from rebirth old age death sorrow lamentation pain sadness and distress Theyre not free from suffering I say
As long as I saw that these seven sexual fettersor even one of themhad not been given up in me I didnt announce my supreme perfect awakening in this world with its gods Māras and Brahmās this population with its ascetics and brahmins its gods and humans
But when I saw that these seven sexual fettersevery one of themhad been given up in me I announced my supreme perfect awakening in this world with its gods Māras and Brahmās this population with its ascetics and brahmins its gods and humans
Knowledge and vision arose in me
My freedom is unshakable this is my last rebirth now therell be no more future lives
When he said this the brahmin Jāṇussoṇi said to the Buddha
Excellent Master Gotama Excellent 
From this day forth may Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life

About Araka
Once upon a time mendicants there was a Teacher called Araka He was a religious founder and was free of sensual desire
He had many hundreds of disciples
and he taught them like this
Brahmins life as a human is short brief and fleeting full of pain and misery Think about this and wake up Do whats good and lead the spiritual life for noone born can escape death
Its like a drop of dew on a grass tip When the sun comes up it quickly evaporates and doesnt last long
In the same way life as a human is like a dewdrop Its brief and fleeting full of pain and misery Think about this and wake up Do whats good and lead the spiritual life for noone born can escape death
Its like when the rain falls heavily The bubbles quickly vanish and dont last long
In the same way life as a human is like a bubble 
Its like a line drawn in water It vanishes quickly and doesnt last long
In the same way life as a human is like a line drawn in water 
Its like a mountain river traveling far flowing fast carrying all before it It doesnt turn backnot for a moment a second an instantbut runs rolls and flows on
In the same way life as a human is like a mountain river 
Its like a strong man who has formed a glob of spit on the tip of his tongue He could easily spit it out
In the same way life as a human is like a glob of spit 
Suppose there was an iron cauldron that had been heated all day If you tossed a lump of meat in it would quickly vanish and not last long
In the same way life as a human is like a lump of meat 
Its like a cow being led to the slaughter With every step she comes closer to the slaughter closer to death
In the same way life as a human is like a cow being slaughtered Its brief and fleeting full of pain and misery Think about this and wake up Do whats good and lead the spiritual life for noone born can escape death
Now mendicants at that time human beings had a life span of  years Girls could be married at  years of age
And human beings only had six afflictions
cold heat hunger thirst and the need to defecate and urinate
But even though humans were so longlived with so few afflictions Araka still taught in this way
Life as a human is short brief and fleeting full of pain and misery Think about this and wake up Do whats good and lead the spiritual life for noone born can escape death
These days itd be right to say
Life as a human is short brief and fleeting full of pain and misery Think about this and wake up Do whats good and lead the spiritual life for noone born can escape death
For these days a long life is a hundred years or a little more
Living for a hundred years there are just three hundred seasons
a hundred each of the winter summer and rains
Living for three hundred seasons there are just twelve hundred months
four hundred in each of the winter summer and rains
Living for twelve hundred months there are just twentyfour hundred fortnights
eight hundred in each of the winter summer and rains
Living for  fortnights there are just  days
 in each of the summer winter and rains
Living for  days you just eat  meals
 in each of the summer winter and rains including when youre suckling at the breast and when youre prevented from eating
Things that prevent you from eating include anger pain sickness sabbath or being unable to get food
So mendicants for a human being with a hundred years life span I have counted the life span the limit of the life span the seasons the years the months the fortnights the nights the days the meals and the things that prevent them from eating
Out of compassion Ive done what a teacher should do who wants whats best for their disciples
Here are these roots of trees and here are these empty huts
Practice absorption mendicants Dont be negligent Dont regret it later This is my instruction to you

Dont Fear Good Deeds
Mendicants dont fear good deeds
For good deeds is a term for happiness
I recall undergoing for a long time the likable desirable and agreeable results of good deeds performed over a long time
I developed a mind of love for seven years
As a result for seven eons of the cosmos contracting and expanding I didnt return to this world again
As the cosmos contracted I went to the realm of streaming radiance
As it expanded I was reborn in an empty mansion of Brahmā
There I was Brahmā the Great Brahmā the undefeated the champion the universal seer the wielder of power
I was Sakka lord of gods thirtysix times
Many hundreds of times I was a king a wheelturning monarch a just and principled king My dominion extended to all four sides I achieved stability in the country and I possessed the seven treasures
These were my seven treasures
the wheel the elephant the horse the jewel the woman the treasurer and the counselor as the seventh treasure
I had over a thousand sons who were valiant and heroic crushing the armies of my enemies
After conquering this land girt by sea I reigned by principle without rod or sword
See the result of good deeds
of skillful deeds for one seeking happiness
I developed a mind of love
for seven years mendicants
For seven eons of expansion and contraction
I didnt return to this world again
As the world contracted
I went to the realm of streaming radiance
And when it expanded
I went to an empty mansion of Brahmā
Seven times I was a Great Brahmā
and at that time I was the wielder of power
Thirtysix times I was lord of gods
acting as ruler of the gods
Then I was king a wheelturning monarch
ruler of all India
An anointed aristocrat
I was sovereign of all humans
Without rod or sword
I conquered this land
Through nonviolent action
I guided it justly
After ruling this territory
by means of principle
I was born in a rich family
affluent and wealthy
It was replete with all sense pleasures
and the seven treasures
This was well taught by the Buddhas
who bring the world together
This is the cause of greatness
by which one is called a lord of the land
I was a majestic king
with lots of property and assets
Successful and glorious
I was lord of India
Who would not be inspired by this
even someone of dark birth
Therefore someone who cares for their own welfare
and wants to become the very best they can be
should respect the true teaching

First Graduation
Then Venerable Sāriputta robed up in the morning and taking his bowl and robe entered Sāvatthī for alms
Then it occurred to him
Its too early to wander for alms in Sāvatthī
Why dont I go to the monastery of the wanderers who follow other paths
Then he went to the monastery of the wanderers who follow other paths and exchanged greetings with the wanderers there
When the greetings and polite conversation were over he sat down to one side
Now at that time while those wanderers who follow other paths were sitting together this discussion came up among them
Reverends anyone who lives the full and pure spiritual life for twelve years is qualified to be called a graduate mendicant
Sāriputta neither approved nor dismissed that statement of the wanderers who follow other paths
He got up from his seat thinking
I will learn the meaning of this statement from the Buddha himself
Then Sāriputta wandered for alms in Sāvatthī
After the meal on his return from almsround he went to the Buddha bowed sat down to one side and told him what had happened adding
Sir in this teaching and training can we describe a mendicant as a graduate solely because they have completed a certain number of years
No Sāriputta we cannot
I make known these seven qualifications for graduation after realizing them with my own insight
What seven
Its when a mendicant has a keen enthusiasm to undertake the training  to examine the teachings  to get rid of desires  for retreat  to rouse up energy  for mindfulness and alertness  to penetrate theoretically And they dont lose these desires in the future

Nothing to Hide
Mendicants there are four areas where the Realized One has nothing to hide and three ways he is irreproachable
What are the four areas where the Realized One has nothing to hide
His bodily behavior is pure
So the Realized One has no bodily misconduct to hide thinking
Dont let others find this out about me
His verbal behavior is pure
So the Realized One has no verbal misconduct to hide thinking
Dont let others find this out about me
His mental behavior is pure
So the Realized One has no mental misconduct to hide thinking
Dont let others find this out about me
His livelihood is pure
So the Realized One has no wrong livelihood to hide thinking
Dont let others find this out about me
These are the four areas where the Realized One has nothing to hide
What are the three ways the Realized One is irreproachable
The Realized One has explained the teaching well
I see no reason for anyonewhether ascetic brahmin god Māra or Brahmā or anyone else in the worldto legitimately scold me saying
For such and such reasons you havent explained the teaching well

Second Graduation
So I have heard
At one time the Buddha was staying near Kosambi in Ghositas Monastery
Then Venerable nanda robed up in the morning and taking his bowl and robe entered Kosambi for alms
Then it occurred to him
Its too early to wander for alms in Kosambi
Why dont I go to the monastery of the wanderers who follow other paths
Then he went to the monastery of the wanderers who follow other paths and exchanged greetings with the wanderers there
When the greetings and polite conversation were over he sat down to one side
Now at that time while those wanderers who follow other paths were sitting together this discussion came up among them
Reverends anyone who lives the full and pure spiritual life for twelve years is qualified to be called a graduate mendicant
nanda neither approved nor dismissed that statement of the wanderers who follow other paths
He got up from his seat thinking
I will learn the meaning of this statement from the Buddha himself
Then nanda wandered for alms in Kosambi
After the meal on his return from almsround he went to the Buddha bowed sat down to one side and told him what had happened adding
Sir in this teaching and training can we describe a mendicant as a graduate solely because they have completed a certain number of years
No nanda we cannot
These are the seven qualifications for graduation that I make known after realizing them with my own insight
What seven

The Ceremony of Descent
First The Ceremony of Descent
Now at that time it was the sabbath The brahmin Jāṇussoṇi had bathed his head and dressed in a new pair of linen robes Holding a handful of fresh grass he stood to one side not far from the Buddha
The Buddha saw him
Brahmin why have you bathed your head and dressed in a new pair of linen robes Why are you standing to one side holding a handful of fresh grass
Whats going on today with the brahmin clan
Master Gotama today is the ceremony of descent for the brahmin clan
But how do the brahmins observe the ceremony of descent
Well Master Gotama on the sabbath the brahmins bathe their heads and dress in a new pair of linen robes They make a heap of fresh cow dung and spread it with green grass Then they make their beds between the boundary and the fire chamber
That night they rise three times and worship the fire with joined palms
We descend lord We descend lord
And they serve the fire with abundant ghee oil and butter
And when the night has passed they serve the brahmins with a variety of delicious foods
Thats how the brahmins observe the ceremony of descent
The ceremony of descent observed by the brahmins is quite different from that observed in the training of the Noble One
But Master Gotama how is the ceremony of descent observed in the training of the Noble One
Master Gotama please teach me this
Well then brahmin listen and pay close attention I will speak
Yes sir Jāṇussoṇi replied
The Buddha said this
Its when a noble disciple reflects
Wrong view has a bad result
in both this life and the next
Reflecting like this they give up wrong view
they descend from wrong view
Wrong thought has a bad result
in both this life and the next
Reflecting like this they give up wrong thought
they descend from wrong thought
Wrong speech has a bad result
in both this life and the next
Reflecting like this they give up wrong speech
they descend from wrong speech
Wrong action has a bad result
in both this life and the next
Reflecting like this they give up wrong action
they descend from wrong action
Wrong livelihood has a bad result
in both this life and the next
Reflecting like this they give up wrong livelihood
they descend from wrong livelihood
Wrong effort has a bad result
in both this life and the next
Reflecting like this they give up wrong effort
they descend from wrong effort
Wrong mindfulness has a bad result
in both this life and the next
Reflecting like this they give up wrong mindfulness
they descend from wrong mindfulness
Wrong immersion has a bad result
in both this life and the next
Reflecting like this they give up wrong immersion
they descend from wrong immersion
Wrong knowledge has a bad result
in both this life and the next
Reflecting like this they give up wrong knowledge
they descend from wrong knowledge
Wrong freedom has a bad result
in both this life and the next
Reflecting like this they give up wrong freedom
they descend from wrong freedom
This is the ceremony of descent in the training of the Noble One
The ceremony of descent observed by the brahmins is quite different from that observed in the training of the Noble One
And Master Gotama the ceremony of descent observed by the brahmins is not worth a sixteenth part of a master of the ceremony of descent observed in the training of the Noble One
Excellent Master Gotama 
From this day forth may Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life

Disciplinary Issues
There the Buddha addressed the mendicants concerning the mendicant Kalandaka
Mendicants
Venerable sir they replied
The Buddha said this
Firstly a mendicant raises disciplinary issues and doesnt praise the settlement of disciplinary issues
This quality doesnt conduce to warmth respect esteem harmony and unity
Furthermore a mendicant doesnt want to train and doesnt praise taking up the training 
Furthermore a mendicant has bad desires and doesnt praise getting rid of desires 
Furthermore a mendicant is irritable and doesnt praise getting rid of anger 
Furthermore a mendicant denigrates others and doesnt praise getting rid of denigration 
Furthermore a mendicant is devious and doesnt praise getting rid of deviousness 
Furthermore a mendicant is deceitful and doesnt praise getting rid of deceitfulness 
Furthermore a mendicant doesnt pay attention to the teachings and doesnt praise attending to the teachings 
Furthermore a mendicant is not in retreat and doesnt praise retreat 
Furthermore a mendicant is inhospitable to their spiritual companions and doesnt praise hospitality
This quality doesnt conduce to warmth respect esteem harmony and unity
Even though a mendicant such as this might wish
If only my spiritual companions would honor respect esteem and venerate me Still they dont honor respect esteem and venerate them
Why is that
Because their sensible spiritual companions see that they havent given up those bad unskillful qualities
Suppose a wild colt was to wish
If only the humans would put me in a thoroughbreds place feed me a thoroughbreds food and give me a thoroughbreds grooming Still the humans wouldnt put them in a thoroughbreds place feed them a thoroughbreds food or give them a thoroughbreds grooming
Why is that
Because sensible humans see that they havent given up their tricks bluffs ruses and feints
In the same way even though a mendicant such as this might wish
If only my spiritual companions would honor respect esteem and venerate me Still they dont honor respect esteem and venerate them
Why is that
Because their sensible spiritual companions see that they havent given up those bad unskillful qualities
Next a mendicant doesnt raise disciplinary issues and praises the settlement of disciplinary issues
This quality conduces to warmth respect esteem harmony and unity
Furthermore a mendicant wants to train and praises taking up the training 
Furthermore a mendicant has few desires and praises getting rid of desires 
Furthermore a mendicant is not irritable and praises getting rid of anger 
Furthermore a mendicant doesnt denigrate others and praises getting rid of denigration 
Furthermore a mendicant isnt devious and praises getting rid of deviousness 
Furthermore a mendicant isnt deceitful and praises getting rid of deceitfulness 
Furthermore a mendicant pays attention to the teachings and praises attending to the teachings 
Furthermore a mendicant is in retreat and praises retreat 
Furthermore a mendicant is hospitable to their spiritual companions and praises hospitality
This quality conduces to warmth respect esteem harmony and unity
Even though a mendicant such as this might never wish
If only my spiritual companions would honor respect esteem and venerate me Still they honor respect esteem and venerate them
Why is that
Because their sensible spiritual companions see that theyve given up those bad unskillful qualities
Suppose a fine thoroughbred never wished
If only the humans would put me in a thoroughbreds place feed me a thoroughbreds food and give me a thoroughbreds grooming Still the humans would put them in a thoroughbreds place feed them a thoroughbreds food and give them a thoroughbreds grooming
Why is that
Because sensible humans see that theyve given up their tricks bluffs ruses and feints
In the same way even though a mendicant such as this might never wish

nanda its when a mendicant explains what is not the teaching as the teaching 
and what was prescribed by the Realized One as not prescribed by the Realized One
On these ten grounds they split off and go their own way They perform legal acts autonomously and recite the monastic code autonomously
That is how schism in the Saṅgha is defined
But sir what does someone who has split a harmonious Saṅgha bring upon themselves
They bring upon themselves evil that lasts for an eon
But sir what is the evil that lasts for an eon
They burn in hell for an eon nanda
A schismatic remains for the eon
in a place of loss in hell
Taking a stand against the teaching
favoring factions they destroy their sanctuary
After causing schism in a harmonious Saṅgha
they burn in hell for an eon

With Migasālā
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monastery
Then Venerable nanda robed up in the morning and taking his bowl and robe went to the home of the laywoman Migasālā where he sat on the seat spread out
Then the laywoman Migasālā went up to nanda bowed sat down to one side and said to him
Sir nanda how on earth are we supposed to understand the teaching taught by the Buddha when the chaste and the unchaste are both reborn in exactly the same place in the next life
My father Purāṇa was celibate set apart avoiding the common practice of sex
When he passed away the Buddha declared that he was a oncereturner who was reborn in the company of the Joyful Gods
But my uncle Isidatta was not celibate he lived content with his wife
When he passed away the Buddha declared that he was also a oncereturner who was reborn in the company of the Joyful Gods
How on earth are we supposed to understand the teaching taught by the Buddha when the chaste and the unchaste are both reborn in exactly the same place in the next life
Youre right sister but thats how the Buddha declared it
Then nanda after receiving almsfood at Migasālās home rose from his seat and left
Then after the meal on his return from almsround nanda went to the Buddha bowed sat down to one side and told him what had happened
nanda who is this laywoman Migasālā a foolish incompetent matron with a matrons wit And who is it that knows how to assess individuals
These ten people are found in the world
Take a certain person who is unethical
And they dont truly understand the freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom where that unethical conduct ceases without anything left over
And theyve not listened or learned or comprehended theoretically or found even temporary freedom
When their body breaks up after death theyre headed for a lower place not a higher
Theyre going to a lower place not a higher
Take a certain person who is unethical
But they truly understand the freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom where that unethical conduct ceases without anything left over
And they have listened and learned and comprehended theoretically and found at least temporary freedom
When their body breaks up after death theyre headed for a higher place not a lower
Theyre going to a higher place not a lower
Judgmental people compare them saying
This one has just the same qualities as the other so why is one worse and one better
This will be for their lasting harm and suffering
In this case the person who is unethical
but truly understands the freedom of heart 
and has listened and learned and comprehended theoretically and found at least temporary freedom
is better and finer than the other person
Why is that
Because the stream of the teaching carries them along
But who knows the difference between them except a Realized One
So nanda dont be judgmental about people
Dont pass judgment on people
Those who pass judgment on people harm themselves
I or someone like me may pass judgment on people
Take a certain person who is ethical
But they dont truly understand the freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom where that ethical conduct ceases without anything left over

Who is this laywoman Migasālā a foolish incompetent matron with a matrons wit And who is it that knows how to assess individuals
These ten people are found in the world
If Isidatta had achieved Purāṇas level of ethical conduct Purāṇa could not have even known Isidattas destination
And if Purāṇa had achieved Isidattas level of wisdom Isidatta could not have even known Purāṇas destination
So both individuals were lacking in one respect

Decline
There Sāriputta addressed the mendicants
Reverends mendicants
Reverend they replied
Sāriputta said this
Reverends they speak of a person liable to decline
and one not liable to decline
But how did the Buddha define a person liable to decline and one not liable to decline
Reverend we would travel a long way to learn the meaning of this statement in the presence of Venerable Sāriputta
May Venerable Sāriputta himself please clarify the meaning of this
The mendicants will listen and remember it
Then listen and pay close attention I will speak
Yes reverend they replied
Sāriputta said this
How did the Buddha define a person liable to decline
Its when a mendicant doesnt get to hear a teaching they havent heard before They forget those teachings they have heard They dont keep rehearsing the teachings theyve already got to know And they dont come to understand what they havent understood before
Thats how the Buddha defined a person liable to decline
And how did the Buddha define a person not liable to decline
Its when a mendicant gets to hear a teaching they havent heard before They remember those teachings they have heard They keep rehearsing the teachings theyve already got to know And they come to understand what they havent understood before
Thats how the Buddha defined a person not liable to decline
If a mendicant isnt skilled in the ways of anothers mind then they should train themselves I will be skilled in the ways of my own mind
And how is a mendicant skilled in the ways of their own mind
Suppose there was a woman or man who was young youthful and fond of adornments and they check their own reflection in a clean bright mirror or a clear bowl of water If they see any dirt or blemish there theyd try to remove it
But if they dont see any dirt or blemish there theyre happy with that as theyve got all they wished for
How fortunate that Im clean
In the same way checking is very helpful for a mendicants skillful qualities
Is contentment often found in me or not Is kindheartedness often found in me or not Is freedom from dullness and drowsiness often found in me or not Is calm often found in me or not Is confidence often found in me or not Is love often found in me or not Is purity of mind often found in me or not Is internal joy with the teaching found in me or not Is internal serenity of heart found in me or not Is the higher wisdom of discernment of principles found in me or not
Suppose a mendicant while checking doesnt see any of these skillful qualities in themselves In order to get them they should apply outstanding enthusiasm effort zeal vigor perseverance mindfulness and situational awareness
Suppose your clothes or head were on fire In order to extinguish it youd apply outstanding enthusiasm effort zeal vigor perseverance mindfulness and situational awareness
In the same way they should apply outstanding enthusiasm to get those skillful qualities 
Suppose a mendicant while checking sees some of these skillful qualities in themselves but doesnt see others Grounded on the skillful qualities they see they should apply outstanding enthusiasm effort zeal vigor perseverance mindfulness and situational awareness in order to get the skillful qualities they dont see
Suppose your clothes or head were on fire In order to extinguish it youd apply outstanding enthusiasm effort zeal vigor perseverance mindfulness and situational awareness
In the same way grounded on the skillful qualities they see they should apply outstanding enthusiasm to get those skillful qualities they dont see
But suppose a mendicant while checking sees all of these skillful qualities in themselves Grounded on all these skillful qualities they should practice meditation further to end the defilements

At one time Venerable Mahākaccāna was staying in the land of the Avantis near Kuraraghara on Steep Mountain
Then the laywoman Kāḷī of Kurughara went up to Venerable Mahākaccāna bowed sat down to one side and said to him
Sir this was said by the Buddha in The Maidens Questions
Ive reached the goal peace of heart
Having conquered the army of the likable and pleasant
alone practicing absorption I awakened to bliss
Thats why I dont get too close to people
and noone gets too close to me
How should we see the detailed meaning of the Buddhas brief statement
Sister some ascetics and brahmins regard the attainment of the meditation on universal earth to be the ultimate Thinking this is the goal they are reborn
The Buddha directly knew the extent to which the attainment of the meditation on universal earth was the ultimate
Directly knowing this he saw the beginning the drawback and the escape And he saw the knowledge and vision of the variety of paths
Because he saw the beginning the drawback and the escape and he saw the knowledge and vision of the variety of paths he knew that he had reached the goal peace of heart
Some ascetics and brahmins regard the attainment of the meditation on universal water to be the ultimate Thinking this is the goal they are reborn 
Some ascetics and brahmins regard the attainment of the meditation on universal fire 
universal air 
universal blue 
universal yellow 
universal red 
universal white 
universal space 
universal consciousness to be the ultimate Thinking this is the goal they are reborn
The Buddha directly knew the extent to which the attainment of the meditation on universal consciousness was the ultimate
Directly knowing this he saw the beginning the drawback and the escape And he saw the knowledge and vision of the variety of paths
Because he saw the beginning the drawback and the escape and he saw the knowledge and vision of the variety of paths he knew that he had reached the goal peace of heart
So sister thats how to understand the detailed meaning of what the Buddha said in brief in The Maidens Questions

What Is Your View
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monastery
Then the householder Anāthapiṇḍika left Sāvatthī in the middle of the day to see the Buddha
Then it occurred to him
Its the wrong time to see the Buddha
as hes in retreat
And its the wrong time to see the esteemed mendicants
as theyre in retreat
Why dont I go to the monastery of the wanderers who follow other paths
Then he went to the monastery of the wanderers who follow other paths
Now at that time the wanderers who follow other paths had come together making an uproar a dreadful racket as they sat and talked about all kinds of unworthy topics
They saw Anāthapiṇḍika coming off in the distance
and stopped each other saying
Be quiet good sirs dont make a sound
The householder Anāthapiṇḍika a disciple of the ascetic Gotama is coming into our monastery
He is included among the whiteclothed lay disciples of the ascetic Gotama who is residing in Sāvatthī
Such venerables like the quiet are educated to be quiet and praise the quiet
Hopefully if he sees that our assembly is quiet hell see fit to approach
Then those wanderers who follow other paths fell silent
Then Anāthapiṇḍika went up to them and exchanged greetings with those wanderers
When the greetings and polite conversation were over he sat down to one side
The wanderers said to him
Tell us householder what is the view of the ascetic Gotama
Sirs I dont know all his views
Well then since it seems you dont know all the views of the ascetic Gotama
tell us what are the views of the mendicants
Sirs I dont know all the mendicants views
Well then since it seems you dont know all the views of the ascetic Gotama or of the mendicants
tell us householder what is your view
Sirs its not hard for me to explain what my views are
But please let the venerables explain their own convictions first Afterwards it wont be hard for me to explain my views
When he said this one of the wanderers said to him
The cosmos is eternal This is the only truth other ideas are silly
Thats my view householder
Another wanderer said
The cosmos is not eternal This is the only truth other ideas are silly
Thats my view householder
Another wanderer said
The world is finite  
The world is infinite  
The soul and the body are the same thing  
The soul and the body are different things  
A Realized One exists after death  
A Realized One doesnt exist after death  
A Realized One both exists and doesnt exist after death  
A Realized One neither exists nor doesnt exist after death This is the only truth other ideas are silly
Thats my view householder
When this was said Anāthapiṇḍika said this
Sirs regarding the venerable who said this
The cosmos is eternal This is the only truth other ideas are silly
Thats my view householder
This view of his has either arisen from his own improper attention or is conditioned by what someone else says
But that view is created conditioned chosen dependently originated
Anything that is created conditioned chosen and dependently originated is impermanent
And whats impermanent is suffering
What he clings to and holds to is just suffering
Regarding the venerable who said this

When he said this the wanderers said to him
Householder weve each explained our own convictions
Tell us householder what is your view
Sirs anything that is created conditioned chosen and dependently originated is impermanent
And whats impermanent is suffering
And whats suffering is not mine I am not this this is not my self
Thats my view sirs
Householder anything that is created conditioned chosen and dependently originated is impermanent
And whats impermanent is suffering
What you cling to and hold to is just suffering
Sirs anything that is created conditioned chosen and dependently originated is impermanent
And whats impermanent is suffering
And Ive truly seen clearly with right wisdom that whats suffering is not mine I am not this its not my self
And I truly understand the escape beyond that
When this was said those wanderers sat silent dismayed shoulders drooping downcast depressed with nothing to say
Seeing this Anāthapiṇḍika got up from his seat
He went to the Buddha bowed sat down to one side and informed the Buddha of all they had discussed
Good good householder
Thats how you should legitimately and completely refute those foolish men from time to time
Then the Buddha educated encouraged fired up and inspired the householder Anāthapiṇḍika with a Dhamma talk
after which Anāthapiṇḍika got up from his seat bowed and respectfully circled the Buddha before leaving
Then not long after Anāthapiṇḍika had left the Buddha addressed the mendicants
Mendicants even a mendicant who has ordained for a hundred years in this teaching and training would legitimately and completely refute those wanderers who follow other paths just as the householder Anāthapiṇḍika did

He went by carriage as far as the terrain allowed then descended and entered the monastery on foot

Sirs where is the Blessed One at present the perfected one the fully awakened Buddha
For I want to see the Buddha
Great king thats his dwelling with the door closed
Approach it quietly without hurrying go onto the porch clear your throat and knock with the latch The Buddha will open the door
So the king approached the Buddhas dwelling and knocked and the Buddha opened the door
Then King Pasenadi entered the Buddhas dwelling He bowed with his head to the Buddhas feet caressing them and covering them with kisses and pronounced his name
Sir I am Pasenadi king of Kosala

Our minds will be consolidated in the perceptions of impermanence notself ugliness and drawbacks Knowing what is just and unjust in the world our minds will be consolidated in that perception Knowing about continued existence and ending of existence in the world our minds will be consolidated in that perception Knowing the origination and ending of the world our minds will be consolidated in that perception Our minds will be consolidated in the perceptions of giving up fading away and cessation

At one time the Buddha was staying near Vesālī at the Great Wood in the hall with the peaked roof together with several wellknown senior disciples
They included Venerables Cāla Upacāla Kakkaṭa Kaṭimbha Kaṭa Kaṭissaṅga
and other wellknown senior disciples
Now at that time several wellknown Licchavis plunged deep into the Great Wood to see the Buddha Driving a succession of fine carriages they made a dreadful racket
Then those venerables thought
These several wellknown Licchavis have plunged deep into the Great Wood to see the Buddha Driving a succession of fine carriages theyre making a dreadful racket
But the Buddha has said that sound is a thorn to absorption
Lets go to the Gosiṅga Sal Wood
There we can meditate comfortably free of noise and crowds
Then those venerables went to the Gosiṅga Sal Wood
where they meditated comfortably free of noise and crowds
Then the Buddha said to the mendicants
Mendicants where are Cāla Upacāla Kakkaṭa Kaṭimbha Kaṭa and Kaṭissaṅga
Where have these senior disciples gone
And the mendicants told him what had happened
Good good mendicants Its just as those great disciples have so rightly explained I have said that sound is a thorn to absorption
Mendicants there are these ten thorns
Relishing company is a thorn for someone who loves seclusion Focusing on the beautiful feature of things is a thorn for someone pursuing the meditation on ugliness Seeing shows is a thorn to someone restraining the senses Lingering in the neighborhood of females is a thorn to celibacy Sound is a thorn to the first absorption Placing the mind and keeping it connected are a thorn to the second absorption Rapture is a thorn to the third absorption Breathing is a thorn to the fourth absorption Perception and feeling are a thorn to the attainment of the cessation of perception and feeling Greed hate and delusion are thorns

Grilled in this way they get stuck or lose their way They fall to ruin and disaster

Sir I wish to frequent remote lodgings in the wilderness and the forest
Upāli remote lodgings in the wilderness and the forest are challenging
Its hard to maintain seclusion and hard to find joy in it
Staying alone the forests seem to rob the mind of a mendicant who isnt immersed in samādhi
If someone should say this
Though I dont have immersion Im going to frequent remote lodgings in the wilderness and the forest You can expect that
theyll sink down or float away
Suppose there was a large lake
and along comes a bull elephant with a height of seven or eight cubits
Hed think
Why dont I plunge into this lake and play around while washing my ears and back
When Ive bathed and drunk Ill emerge from the water and go wherever I want
And thats just what he does
Why is that
Because his large lifeform finds a footing in the depths
Then along comes a rabbit or a cat
Theyd think
What difference is there between me and a bull elephant
Why dont I plunge into this lake and play around while washing my ears and back
When Ive bathed and drunk Ill emerge from the water and go wherever I want
They jump into the lake rashly without thinking
You can expect that
theyll sink down or float away
Why is that
Because their little lifeform finds no footing in the depths
If someone should say this
Though I dont have immersion Im going to frequent remote lodgings in the wilderness and the forest You can expect that

Suppose there was a little baby boy playing in his own urine and feces
What do you think Upāli
Isnt that a totally foolish game
Yes sir
After some time that boy grows up and his faculties mature
He accordingly plays childish games such as toy plows tipcat somersaults pinwheels toy measures toy carts and toy bows
What do you think Upāli
Arent such games better than what he did before
Yes sir
After some time that boy grows up and his faculties mature further
He accordingly amuses himself supplied and provided with the five kinds of sensual stimulation
Sights known by the eye that are likable desirable agreeable pleasant sensual and arousing
Sounds known by the ear 
Smells known by the nose 
Tastes known by the tongue 
Touches known by the body that are likable desirable agreeable pleasant sensual and arousing

Its not easy for someone living at home to lead the spiritual life utterly full and pure like a polished shell
Why dont I shave off my hair and beard dress in ocher robes and go forth from the lay life to homelessness
After some time they give up a large or small fortune and a large or small family circle They shave off hair and beard dress in ocher robes and go forth from the lay life to homelessness
Once theyve gone forth they take up the training and livelihood of the mendicants They give up killing living creatures renouncing the rod and the sword Theyre scrupulous and kind living full of compassion for all living beings
They give up stealing They take only whats given and expect only whats given They keep themselves clean by not thieving
They give up unchastity They are celibate set apart avoiding the common practice of sex
They give up lying They speak the truth and stick to the truth Theyre honest and trustworthy and dont trick the world with their words

Theyre content with robes to look after the body and almsfood to look after the belly

Theyre like a bird wherever it flies wings are its only burden
In the same way a mendicant is content with robes to look after the body and almsfood to look after the belly
Wherever they go they set out taking only these things
When they have this entire spectrum of noble ethics they experience a blameless happiness inside themselves
When they see a sight with their eyes they dont get caught up in the features and details
If the faculty of sight were left unrestrained bad unskillful qualities of desire and aversion would become overwhelming For this reason they practice restraint protecting the faculty of sight and achieving restraint over it
When they hear a sound with their ears 
When they smell an odor with their nose 
When they taste a flavor with their tongue 
When they feel a touch with their body 
When they know a thought with their mind they dont get caught up in the features and details
If the faculty of mind were left unrestrained bad unskillful qualities of desire and aversion would become overwhelming For this reason they practice restraint protecting the faculty of mind and achieving its restraint

They act with situational awareness when going out and coming back when looking ahead and aside when bending and extending the limbs when bearing the outer robe bowl and robes when eating drinking chewing and tasting when urinating and defecating when walking standing sitting sleeping waking speaking and keeping silent
When they have this noble spectrum of ethics this noble sense restraint and this noble mindfulness and situational awareness
they frequent a secluded lodginga wilderness the root of a tree a hill a ravine a mountain cave a charnel ground a forest the open air a heap of straw
Gone to a wilderness or to the root of a tree or to an empty hut they sit down crosslegged with their body straight and establish mindfulness right there
Giving up desire for the world they meditate with a heart rid of desire cleansing the mind of desire
Giving up ill will and malevolence they meditate with a mind rid of ill will full of compassion for all living beings cleansing the mind of ill will
Giving up dullness and drowsiness they meditate with a mind rid of dullness and drowsiness perceiving light mindful and aware cleansing the mind of dullness and drowsiness
Giving up restlessness and remorse they meditate without restlessness their mind peaceful inside cleansing the mind of restlessness and remorse
Giving up doubt they meditate having gone beyond doubt not undecided about skillful qualities cleansing the mind of doubt
They give up these five hindrances corruptions of the heart that weaken wisdom
Then quite secluded from sensual pleasures secluded from unskillful qualities they enter and remain in the first absorption which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion while placing the mind and keeping it connected

Yes sir
When my disciples see this quality inside themselves they frequent remote lodgings in the wilderness and the forest But so far they havent achieved their own goal

What do you think Upāli
Isnt this state better than what they had before
Yes sir
When my disciples see this quality inside themselves they frequent remote lodgings in the wilderness and the forest But so far they havent achieved their own goal

Now at that time after the meal on return from almsround several mendicants sat together in the assembly hall They engaged in all kinds of unworthy talk such as
talk about kings bandits and ministers talk about armies threats and wars talk about food drink clothes and beds talk about garlands and fragrances talk about family vehicles villages towns cities and countries talk about women and heroes street talk and well talk talk about the departed motley talk tales of land and sea and talk about being reborn in this or that state of existence
Then in the late afternoon the Buddha came out of retreat and went to the assembly hall where he sat on the seat spread out
and addressed the mendicants
Mendicants what were you sitting talking about just now What conversation was left unfinished
And they told him what had happened
Mendicants it is not appropriate for you gentlemen who have gone forth in faith from the lay life to homelessness to engage in these kinds of unworthy talk
There are mendicants these ten topics of discussion

Pleasure Seekers
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monastery
Then the householder Anāthapiṇḍika went up to the Buddha bowed and sat down to one side
Seated to one side the Buddha said to the householder Anāthapiṇḍika

They dont make themselves happy and pleased nor share it and make merit

Deaths domain so hard to pass
Rid of dark qualities
an astute person should develop the bright
Leaving home behind
for the seclusion so hard to enjoy
you should try to find delight there
having left behind sensual pleasures
With no possessions an astute person
should cleanse themselves of mental corruptions

Then the brahmin Jāṇussoṇi went up to the Buddha and exchanged greetings with him
When the greetings and polite conversation were over he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha
We who are known as brahmins
give gifts and perform memorial rites for the dead
May this gift aid my departed relatives and family May they partake of this gift
But does this gift really aid departed relatives and family
Do they actually partake of it
It aids them if the conditions are right brahmin but not if the conditions are wrong
Then Master Gotama what are the right and wrong conditions
Brahmin take someone who kills living creatures steals and commits sexual misconduct They use speech thats false divisive harsh or nonsensical And theyre covetous malicious with wrong view
When their body breaks up after death theyre reborn in hell
There they survive feeding on the food of the hell beings
The conditions there are wrong so the gift does not aid the one who lives there
Take someone else who kills living creatures  and has wrong view
When their body breaks up after death theyre reborn in the animal realm
There they survive feeding on the food of the beings in the animal realm
The conditions there too are wrong so the gift does not aid the one who lives there
Take someone else who doesnt kill living creatures steal commit sexual misconduct or use speech thats false divisive harsh or nonsensical They're contented kindhearted and have right view
When their body breaks up after death theyre reborn in the human realm
There they survive feeding on human food
The conditions there too are wrong so the gift does not aid the one who lives there
Take someone else who doesnt kill living creatures  and has right view
When their body breaks up after death theyre reborn in the company of the gods
There they survive feeding on the food of the gods
The conditions there too are wrong so the gift does not aid the one who lives there
Take someone else who kills living creatures  and has wrong view
When their body breaks up after death theyre reborn in the ghost realm
There they survive feeding on the food of the beings in the ghost realm Or else they survive feeding on what friends and colleagues relatives and kin provide them with from here
The conditions there are right so the gift aids the one who lives there
But Master Gotama who partakes of that gift if the departed relative is not reborn in that place
Other departed relatives reborn there will partake of that gift
But who partakes of the gift when neither that relative nor other relatives have been reborn in that place
Its impossible brahmin it cannot happen that that place is vacant of departed relatives in all this long time
Its never fruitless for the donor
Does Master Gotama propose this even when the conditions are wrong
I propose this even when the conditions are wrong
Take someone who kills living creatures steals and commits sexual misconduct They use speech thats false divisive harsh or nonsensical And theyre covetous malicious with wrong view
They give to ascetics or brahmins such things as food drink clothing vehicles garlands perfumes and makeup and bed house and lighting
When their body breaks up after death theyre reborn in the company of elephants
There they get to have food and drink garlands and various adornments
Since in this life they killed living creatures  and had wrong view they were reborn in the company of elephants
Since they gave to ascetics or brahmins  they get to have food and drink garlands and various adornments
Take someone else who kills living creatures  and has wrong view
They give to ascetics or brahmins 
When their body breaks up after death theyre reborn in the company of horses 
There they get to have food and drink garlands and various adornments
Since in this life they killed living creatures  and had wrong view they were reborn in the company of dogs
Since they gave to ascetics or brahmins  they get to have food and drink garlands and various adornments
Take someone else who doesnt kill living creatures steal or commit sexual misconduct They dont use speech thats false divisive harsh or nonsensical And theyre contented kindhearted with right view
They give to ascetics or brahmins 
When their body breaks up after death theyre reborn in the human realm
There they get to have the five kinds of human sensual stimulation
Since in this life they didnt kill living creatures  and had right view they were reborn in the company of humans
Since they gave to ascetics or brahmins  they get to have the five kinds of human sensual stimulation
Take someone else who doesnt kill living creatures  and has right view
They give to ascetics or brahmins 
When their body breaks up after death theyre reborn in the company of the gods
There they get to have the five kinds of heavenly sensual stimulation
Since in this life they didnt kill living creatures  and had right view they were reborn in the company of the gods
Since they gave to ascetics or brahmins  they get to have the five kinds of heavenly sensual stimulation
Its never fruitless for the donor
Its incredible Master Gotama its amazing
Just this much is quite enough to justify giving gifts and performing memorial rites for the dead since its never fruitless for the donor
Thats so true brahmin Its never fruitless for the donor
Excellent Master Gotama Excellent 
From this day forth may Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life

Sir what is the purpose and benefit of skillful ethics
nanda having no regrets is the purpose and benefit of skillful ethics
But whats the purpose and benefit of having no regrets
Joy is the purpose and benefit of having no regrets
But whats the purpose and benefit of joy
Rapture 
But whats the purpose and benefit of rapture
Tranquility 
But whats the purpose and benefit of tranquility
But whats the purpose and benefit of bliss
Immersion 
But whats the purpose and benefit of immersion
Truly knowing and seeing 
But whats the purpose and benefit of truly knowing and seeing
Disillusionment and dispassion 
But whats the purpose and benefit of disillusionment and dispassion
Knowledge and vision of freedom is the purpose and benefit of disillusionment and dispassion
So nanda the purpose and benefit of skillful ethics is not having regrets
Joy is the purpose and benefit of not having regrets
Rapture is the purpose and benefit of joy
Tranquility is the purpose and benefit of rapture
Bliss is the purpose and benefit of tranquility
Immersion is the purpose and benefit of bliss

She gets pregnant from that
So the king thinks
Noone else has entered here except for that monk
Could this be the monks doing

You should remember it in line with the Buddhas answer
Yes maam replied those lay followers approving and agreeing with what the nun Kajaṅgalikā said Then they got up from their seat bowed and respectfully circled her keeping her on their right Then they went to the Buddha bowed sat down to one side
and informed the Buddha of all they had discussed
Good good householders
The nun Kajaṅgalikā is astute she has great wisdom
If you came to me and asked this question I would answer it in exactly the same way as the nun Kajaṅgalikā
That is what it means and thats how you should remember it

Theyre very learned remembering and keeping what theyve learned These teachings are good in the beginning good in the middle and good in the end meaningful and wellphrased describing a spiritual practice thats entirely full and pure They are very learned in such teachings remembering them reinforcing them by recitation mentally scrutinizing them and comprehending them theoretically
Both monastic codes have been passed down to them in detail well analyzed well mastered well judged in both the rules and accompanying material
Theyre firm and unfaltering in the training
When there are opposing parties theyre able to persuade advocate and convince them make them see the other side and trust each other
Theyre skilled in raising and settling disciplinary issues

Then Venerable nanda went up to Venerable Sāriputta and exchanged greetings with him
When the greetings and polite conversation were over he sat down to one side and said to Sāriputta
Could it be reverend Sāriputta that a mendicant might gain a state of immersion like this They wouldnt perceive earth in earth water in water fire in fire or air in air And they wouldnt perceive the dimension of infinite space in the dimension of infinite space the dimension of infinite consciousness in the dimension of infinite consciousness the dimension of nothingness in the dimension of nothingness or the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception in the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception And they wouldnt perceive this world in this world or the other world in the other world And yet they would still perceive
It could be Reverend nanda
But how could this be
Reverend nanda one time I was staying right here at Sāvatthī in the Dark Forest
There I gained a state of immersion like this I didnt perceive earth in earth water in water fire in fire or air in air And I didnt perceive the dimension of infinite space in the dimension of infinite space the dimension of infinite consciousness in the dimension of infinite consciousness the dimension of nothingness in the dimension of nothingness or the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception in the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception And I didnt perceive this world in this world or the other world in the other world And yet I still perceived
But at that time what did Reverend Sāriputta perceive
One perception arose in me and another perception ceased The cessation of continued existence is extinguishment The cessation of continued existence is extinguishment
Suppose there was a burning pile of twigs One flame would arise and another would cease
In the same way one perception arose in me and another perception ceased The cessation of continued existence is extinguishment The cessation of continued existence is extinguishment
At that time I perceived that the cessation of continued existence is extinguishment

Now at that time it was the sabbath The brahmin Jāṇussoṇi had bathed his head and dressed in a new pair of linen robes Holding a handful of fresh grass he stood to one side not far from the Buddha
The Buddha saw him
Brahmin why have you bathed your head and dressed in a new pair of linen robes Why are you standing to one side holding a handful of fresh grass
Whats going on today with the brahmin clan
Master Gotama today is the ceremony of descent for the brahmin clan
But how do the brahmins observe the ceremony of descent
Well Master Gotama on the sabbath the brahmins bathe their heads and dress in a new pair of linen robes They make a heap of fresh cow dung and spread it with green grass Then they make their beds between the boundary and the fire chamber
That night they rise three times and worship the fire with joined palms
We descend lord We descend lord
And they serve the fire with abundant ghee oil and butter
And when the night has passed they serve the brahmins with a variety of delicious foods
Thats how the brahmins observe the ceremony of descent
The ceremony of descent observed by the brahmins is quite different from that observed in the training of the Noble One
But Master Gotama how is the ceremony of descent observed in the training of the Noble One
Master Gotama please teach me this
Well then brahmin listen and pay close attention I will speak
Yes sir Jāṇussoṇi replied
The Buddha said this
Its when a noble disciple reflects
Killing living creatures has a bad result in the present life and in lives to come
Reflecting like this they give up killing living creatures

 Stealing has a bad result

And they will know or see or realize it in whatever way it should be known or seen or realized This is possible
But this is the unsurpassable knowledge that is truly knowing each and every case

And a noble disciples ethical conduct is loved by the noble ones unbroken impeccable spotless and unmarred liberating praised by sensible people not mistaken and leading to immersion
These are the four factors of streamentry that they have
And what is the noble cycle that they have clearly seen and comprehended with wisdom

Continued existence is a condition for rebirth

they dont get the four absorptionsblissful meditations in the present life that belong to the higher mindwhen they want without trouble or difficulty 
they dont realize the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life and live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements
So theyre incomplete in that respect
and should fulfill it thinking
How can I become faithful ethical and educated a Dhamma speaker one who frequents assemblies one who teaches Dhamma to the assembly with assurance an expert in the training one who lives in the wilderness in remote lodgings one who gets the four absorptions when they want and one who lives having realized the ending of defilements
When theyre faithful ethical and educated a Dhamma speaker one who frequents assemblies one who teaches Dhamma to the assembly with assurance an expert in the training one who lives in the wilderness in remote lodgings one who gets the four absorptions when they want and one who lives having realized the ending of defilements
theyre complete in that respect

With Uttiya
Then the wanderer Uttiya went up to the Buddha and exchanged greetings with him
When the greetings and polite conversation were over he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha
Master Gotama is this right The cosmos is eternal This is the only truth other ideas are silly
This has not been declared by me Uttiya
Then is this right The cosmos is not eternal This is the only truth other ideas are silly
This has not been declared by me Uttiya
Then is this right The world is finite  
The world is infinite  
The soul and the body are the same thing  
The soul and the body are different things  
A Realized One exists after death  
A Realized One doesnt exist after death  
A Realized One both exists and doesnt exist after death  
A Realized One neither exists nor doesnt exist after death This is the only truth other ideas are silly
This has not been declared by me Uttiya
When asked about all these points Master Gotama says that they have not been declared by him
So what exactly has been declared by Master Gotama
Uttiya I teach my disciples from my own insight in order to purify sentient beings to get past sorrow and crying to make an end of pain and sadness to end the cycle of suffering and to realize extinguishment
But when Master Gotama teaches in this way is the whole world saved or half or a third
But when he said this the Buddha kept silent
Then Venerable nanda thought
The wanderer Uttiya must not get the harmful misconception
When the ascetic Gotama was asked this allimportant question he falters without answering He just cant do it
That would be for his lasting harm and suffering
Then nanda said to the wanderer Uttiya
Well then Reverend Uttiya I shall give you a simile
For by means of a simile some sensible people understand the meaning of what is said
Suppose there was a kings frontier citadel with fortified embankments ramparts and arches and a single gate
And it has a gatekeeper who is astute competent and clever He keeps strangers out and lets known people in
As he walks around the patrol path he doesnt see a hole or cleft in the wall not even one big enough for a cat to slip out
He doesnt know how many creatures enter or leave the citadel
But he does know that whatever sizable creatures enter or leave the citadel all of them do so via this gate
In the same way its not the Realized Ones concern whether the whole world is saved by this or half or a third
But the Realized One knows that whoever is saved from the worldwhether in the past the future or the presentall have given up the five hindrances corruptions of the heart that weaken wisdom They have firmly established their mind in the four kinds of mindfulness meditation And they have truly developed the seven awakening factors
Thats how theyre saved from the world in the past future or present
Uttiya you were just asking the Buddha the same question as before in a different way
Thats why he didnt answer

With Kokālika
Then the mendicant Kokālika went up to the Buddha bowed sat down to one side and said to him
Sir Sāriputta and Moggallāna have wicked desires Theyve fallen under the sway of wicked desires
Dont say that Kokālika Dont say that Kokālika
Have confidence in Sāriputta and Moggallāna
theyre good monks
For a second time Kokālika said to the Buddha
Despite my faith and trust in the Buddha Sāriputta and Moggallāna have wicked desires Theyve fallen under the sway of wicked desires
Dont say that Kokālika Dont say that Kokālika
Have confidence in Sāriputta and Moggallāna
theyre good monks
For a third time Kokālika said to the Buddha
Despite my faith and trust in the Buddha Sāriputta and Moggallāna have wicked desires Theyve fallen under the sway of wicked desires
Dont say that Kokālika Dont say that Kokālika
Have confidence in Sāriputta and Moggallāna
theyre good monks
Then Kokālika got up from his seat bowed and respectfully circled the Buddha keeping him on his right before leaving
Not long after he left his body erupted with boils the size of mustard seeds
The boils grew to the size of mung beans then chickpeas then jujube seeds then jujubes then myrobalans then unripe wood apples then ripe wood apples Finally they burst open and pus and blood oozed out
He just laid down on banana leaves like a poisoned fish
Then Tudu the independent brahmā went to Kokālika and standing in the sky he said to him
Kokālika have confidence in Sāriputta and Moggallāna
theyre good monks
Who are you reverend
I am Tudu the independent brahmā
Didnt the Buddha declare you a nonreturner So what exactly are you doing back here
See how far you have strayed
Then Tudu addressed Kokālika in verse
A person is born
with an axe in their mouth
A fool cuts themselves with it
when they say bad words
When you praise someone worthy of criticism
or criticize someone worthy of praise
you choose bad luck with your own mouth
youll never find happiness that way
Bad luck at dice is a trivial thing
if all you lose is your money
and all you own even yourself
Whats really terrible luck
is to hate the holy ones
For more than two quinquadecillion years
and another five quattuordecillion years
a slanderer of noble ones goes to hell
having aimed bad words and thoughts at them
Then the mendicant Kokālika died of that illness
He was reborn in the Pink Lotus hell because of his resentment for Sāriputta and Moggallāna
Then late at night the beautiful Brahmā Sahampati lighting up the entire Jetas Grove went up to the Buddha bowed stood to one side and said to him
Sir the mendicant Kokālika has passed away
He was reborn in the pink lotus hell because of his resentment for Sāriputta and Moggallāna
Thats what Brahmā Sahampati said
Then he bowed and respectfully circled the Buddha keeping him on his right side before vanishing right there
Then when the night had passed the Buddha told the mendicants all that had happened
When he said this one of the mendicants asked the Buddha
Sir how long is the life span in the Pink Lotus hell
Its long mendicant
Its not easy to calculate
how many years how many hundreds or thousands or hundreds of thousands of years it lasts
But sir is it possible to give a simile
Its possible said the Buddha
Suppose there was a Kosalan cartload of twenty bushels of sesame seed And at the end of every hundred years someone would remove a single seed from it
By this means the Kosalan cartload of twenty bushels of sesame seed would run out faster than a single lifetime in the Abbuda hell
Now twenty lifetimes in the Abbuda hell equal one lifetime in the Nirabbuda hell
Twenty lifetimes in the Nirabbuda hell equal one lifetime in the Ababa hell
Twenty lifetimes in the Ababa hell equal one lifetime in the Aṭaṭa hell
Twenty lifetimes in the Aṭaṭa hell equal one lifetime in the Ahaha hell
Twenty lifetimes in the Ahaha hell equal one lifetime in the Yellow Lotus hell
Twenty lifetimes in the Yellow Lotus hell equal one lifetime in the SweetSmelling hell
Twenty lifetimes in the SweetSmelling hell equal one lifetime in the Blue Water Lily hell
Twenty lifetimes in the Blue Water Lily hell equal one lifetime in the White Lotus hell
Twenty lifetimes in the White Lotus hell equal one lifetime in the Pink Lotus hell
The mendicant Kokālika has been reborn in the Pink Lotus hell because of his resentment for Sāriputta and Moggallāna
That is what the Buddha said
Then the Holy One the Teacher went on to say
A person is born
with an axe in their mouth
A fool cuts themselves with it
when they say bad words
When you praise someone worthy of criticism
or criticize someone worthy of praise
you choose bad luck with your own mouth

So I have heard
At one time the Buddha was staying near Pāvā in Cunda the smiths mango grove
Then Cunda the smith went to the Buddha bowed and sat down to one side
The Buddha said to him
Cunda whose purity do you believe in
Sir I believe in the purity advocated by the western brahmins draped with moss who carry pitchers serve the sacred flame and immerse themselves in water
But Cunda what kind of purity do these western brahmins advocate
The western brahmins encourage their disciples like this
Please good people rising early you should stroke the earth from your bed
If you dont stroke the earth stroke fresh cow dung
If you dont stroke fresh cow dung stroke green grass
If you dont stroke green grass serve the sacred flame
If you dont serve the sacred flame revere the sun with joined palms
If you dont revere the sun with joined palms immerse yourself in water three times including the evening
The western brahmins advocate this kind of purity
The purity advocated by the western brahmins is quite different from that in the training of the Noble One
But what Master Gotama is purity in the training of the Noble One
Master Gotama please teach me this
Well then brahmin listen and pay close attention I will speak
Yes sir Cunda replied
The Buddha said this
Cunda impurity is threefold by way of body
fourfold by way of speech
and threefold by way of mind
And how is impurity threefold by way of body
Its when a certain person kills living creatures Theyre violent bloodyhanded a hardened killer merciless to living beings
They steal
With the intention to commit theft they take the wealth or belongings of others from village or wilderness
They commit sexual misconduct
They have sexual relations with women who have their mother father both mother and father brother sister relatives or clan as guardian They have sexual relations with a woman who is protected on principle or who has a husband or whose violation is punishable by law or even one who has been garlanded as a token of betrothal
This is the threefold impurity by way of body
And how is impurity fourfold by way of speech
Its when a certain person lies
Theyre summoned to a council an assembly a family meeting a guild or to the royal court and asked to bear witness
Please mister say what you know Not knowing they say I know Knowing they say I dont know Not seeing they say I see And seeing they say I dont see So they deliberately lie for the sake of themselves or another or for some trivial worldly reason
They speak divisively
They repeat in one place what they heard in another so as to divide people against each other
And so they divide those who are harmonious supporting division delighting in division loving division speaking words that promote division
They speak harshly
They use the kinds of words that are cruel nasty hurtful offensive bordering on anger not leading to immersion
They talk nonsense Their speech is untimely and is neither factual nor beneficial It has nothing to do with the teaching or the training Their words have no value and are untimely unreasonable rambling and pointless
This is the fourfold impurity by way of speech
And how is impurity threefold by way of mind
Its when a certain person is covetous
They covet the wealth and belongings of others
Oh if only their belongings were mine
They have ill will and malicious intentions
May these sentient beings be killed slaughtered slain destroyed or annihilated
They have wrong view Their perspective is distorted
Theres no meaning in giving sacrifice or offerings Theres no fruit or result of good and bad deeds Theres no afterlife Theres no obligation to mother and father No beings are reborn spontaneously And theres no ascetic or brahmin who is well attained and practiced and who describes the afterlife after realizing it with their own insight
This is the threefold impurity by way of mind

Cunda purity is threefold by way of body
fourfold by way of speech

They give up stealing
They dont with the intention to commit theft take the wealth or belongings of others from village or wilderness
They give up sexual misconduct They dont have sexual relations with women who have their mother father both mother and father brother sister relatives or clan as guardian They dont have sexual relations with a woman who is protected on principle or who has a husband or whose violation is punishable by law or even one who has been garlanded as a token of betrothal
This is the threefold purity by way of body
And how is purity fourfold by way of speech
Its when a certain person gives up lying
Theyre summoned to a council an assembly a family meeting a guild or to the royal court and asked to bear witness
Please mister say what you know Not knowing they say I dont know Knowing they say I know Not seeing they say I dont see And seeing they say I see So they dont deliberately lie for the sake of themselves or another or for some trivial worldly reason
They give up divisive speech
They dont repeat in one place what they heard in another so as to divide people against each other Instead they reconcile those who are divided supporting unity delighting in harmony loving harmony speaking words that promote harmony

They have a kind heart and loving intentions
May these sentient beings live free of enmity and ill will untroubled and happy
They have right view an undistorted perspective
There is meaning in giving sacrifice and offerings There are fruits and results of good and bad deeds There is an afterlife There is obligation to mother and father There are beings reborn spontaneously And there are ascetics and brahmins who are well attained and practiced and who describe the afterlife after realizing it with their own insight
This is the threefold purity by way of mind

The Great Chapter
First The Great Questions
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monastery
Then several mendicants robed up in the morning and taking their bowls and robes entered Sāvatthī for alms
Then it occurred to him
Its too early to wander for alms in Sāvatthī
Why dont we go to the monastery of the wanderers who follow other paths
Then they went to the monastery of the wanderers who follow other paths and exchanged greetings with the wanderers there
When the greetings and polite conversation were over they sat down to one side
The wanderers said to them
Reverends the ascetic Gotama teaches his disciples like this
Please mendicants directly know all things Meditate having directly known all things
We too teach our disciples
Please reverends directly know all things Live having directly known all things
What then is the difference between the ascetic Gotamas teaching and instruction and ours
Those mendicants neither approved nor dismissed that statement of the wanderers who follow other paths
They got up from their seat thinking
We will learn the meaning of this statement from the Buddha himself
Then after the meal when they returned from almsround they went up to the Buddha bowed sat down to one side and told him what had happened
Mendicants when wanderers who follow other paths say this you should say to them
One thing question passage for recitation and answer Two  three  four  five  six  seven  eight  nine  ten things question passage for recitation and answer
Questioned like this the wanderers who follow other paths would be stumped and in addition would get frustrated
Why is that

Overestimation
At one time Venerable Mahākassapa was staying near Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove the squirrels feeding ground
There he addressed the mendicants
Reverends mendicants
Reverend they replied
Venerable Mahākassapa said this
Take a mendicant who declares enlightenment
I understand Rebirth is ended the spiritual journey has been completed what had to be done has been done there is no return to any state of existence
Theyre pursued pressed and grilled by the Realized One or by one of his disciples who has the absorptions and is skilled in attainments in the minds of others and in the ways of anothers mind
Grilled in this way they get stuck or lose their way They fall to ruin and disaster
The Realized One or one of his disciples comprehends their mind and investigates
Why does this venerable declare enlightenment saying
I understand Rebirth is ended the spiritual journey has been completed what had to be done has been done there is no return to any state of existence
They understand
This venerable overestimates themselves and takes that to be the truth They perceive that theyve attained what they havent attained done what they havent done and achieved what they havent achieved
And they declare enlightenment out of overestimation
I understand Rebirth is ended the spiritual journey has been completed what had to be done has been done there is no return to any state of existence
The Realized One or one of his disciples comprehends their mind and investigates
Why does this venerable overestimate themselves and take that to be the truth Why do they perceive that theyve attained what they havent attained done what they havent done and achieved what they havent achieved
And why do they declare enlightenment out of overestimation
I understand Rebirth is ended the spiritual journey has been completed what had to be done has been done there is no return to any state of existence
They understand
This venerable is very learned remembering and keeping what theyve learned These teachings are good in the beginning good in the middle and good in the end meaningful and wellphrased describing a spiritual practice thats entirely full and pure They are very learned in such teachings remembering them reinforcing them by recitation mentally scrutinizing them and comprehending them theoretically
Therefore this venerable overestimates themselves and takes that to be the truth 
They understand
This venerable is covetous
and often lives with a heart full covetousness
Being full of covetousness means decline in the teaching and training proclaimed by the Realized One
This venerable has ill will 
dullness and drowsiness 
restlessness 
This venerable relishes work They love it and like to relish it 
This venerable relishes talk 
When there is still more to be done this venerable stopped halfway after achieving some insignificant distinction
Stopping halfway means decline in the teaching and training proclaimed by the Realized One
Its not possible for a mendicant to achieve growth improvement or maturity in this teaching and training without giving up these ten qualities

A Seed
Mendicants consider a person who has wrong view thought speech action livelihood effort mindfulness immersion knowledge and freedom
Whatever bodily verbal or mental deeds they undertake in line with that view their intentions aims wishes and choices all lead to what is unlikable undesirable disagreeable harmful and suffering
Why is that
Because their view is bad
Suppose a seed of neem angled gourd or bitter gourd was planted in moist earth Whatever nutrients it takes up from the earth and water would lead to its bitter acerbic and unpleasant taste
Why is that

In the same way consider a person who has wrong view thought speech action livelihood effort mindfulness immersion knowledge and freedom

Then the wanderer Ajita went up to the Buddha and exchanged greetings with him
When the greetings and polite conversation were over he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha
Master Gotama we have a spiritual companion called The Philosopher
He has worked out around five hundred arguments by which followers of other paths will know when theyve been refuted
Then the Buddha said to the mendicants
Mendicants do you remember this philosophers points
Now is the time Blessed One Now is the time Holy One
Let the Buddha speak and the mendicants will remember it
Well then mendicants listen and pay close attention I will speak
Yes sir they replied
The Buddha said this
Mendicants take a certain person who rebuts and quashes unprincipled statements with unprincipled statements This delights an unprincipled assembly
who make a dreadful racket
Hes a true philosopher Hes a true philosopher
Another person rebuts and quashes principled statements with unprincipled statements This delights an unprincipled assembly

With Upāli
With Vajjiyamāhita
At one time the Buddha was staying near Campā on the banks of the Gaggarā Lotus Pond
Then the householder Vajjiyamāhita left Sāvatthī in the middle of the day to see the Buddha
Then it occurred to him
Its the wrong time to see the Buddha
as hes in retreat
And its the wrong time to see the esteemed mendicants
as theyre in retreat
Why dont I go to the monastery of the wanderers who follow other paths
Then he went to the monastery of the wanderers who follow other paths
Now at that time the wanderers who follow other paths had come together making an uproar a dreadful racket as they sat and talked about all kinds of unworthy topics
They saw Vajjiyamāhita coming off in the distance and stopped each other saying
Be quiet good sirs dont make a sound
The householder Vajjiyamāhita a disciple of the ascetic Gotama is coming into our monastery
He is included among the whiteclothed lay disciples of the ascetic Gotama who is residing near Campā
Such venerables like the quiet are educated to be quiet and praise the quiet
Hopefully if he sees that our assembly is quiet hell see fit to approach
Then those wanderers who follow other paths fell silent
Then Vajjiyamāhita went up to them and exchanged greetings with the wanderers there
When the greetings and polite conversation were over he sat down to one side
The wanderers said to him
Is it really true householder Does the ascetic Gotama criticize all forms of mortification Does he categorically condemn and denounce those selfmortifiers who live rough
No sirs the ascetic Gotama does not criticize all forms of mortification Nor does he categorically condemn and denounce those selfmortifiers who live rough
The Buddha criticizes where it is due and praises where it is due
In doing so he is one who speaks after analyzing the question
and is not definitive on this point
When he said this one of the wanderers said to him
Hold on householder That ascetic Gotama who you praise is an exterminator who refrains from making statements
On this point also I reasonably respond to the venerables
The Buddha has stated This is skillful and
This is unskillful
So when it comes to what is skillful and unskillful the Buddha makes a statement
He is not an exterminator who refrains from making statements
When this was said those wanderers sat silent dismayed shoulders drooping downcast depressed with nothing to say
Seeing this Vajjiyamāhita got up from his seat He went to the Buddha bowed sat down to one side
and informed the Buddha of all they had discussed
Good good householder
Thats how you should legitimately and completely refute those foolish men from time to time
Householder I dont say that all mortifications should be undergone
But I dont say that no mortifications should be undergone
I dont say that all observances should be undertaken
But I dont say that no observances should be undertaken
I dont say that all efforts should be tried
But I dont say that no efforts should be tried
I dont say that everything should be given up
But I dont say that nothing should be given up
I dont say that you should be liberated with all kinds of freedom
But I dont say that you should not be liberated with any kind of freedom
When undergoing certain mortifications unskillful qualities grow while skillful qualities decline I say that you shouldnt undergo those mortifications
When undergoing certain mortifications unskillful qualities decline while skillful qualities grow I say that you should undergo those mortifications
When undertaking certain observances unskillful qualities grow while skillful qualities decline I say that you shouldnt undertake those observances
When undertaking certain observances unskillful qualities decline while skillful qualities grow I say that you should undertake those observances
When trying certain efforts unskillful qualities grow while skillful qualities decline I say that you shouldnt try those efforts
When trying certain efforts unskillful qualities decline while skillful qualities grow I say that you should try those efforts
When giving up certain things unskillful qualities grow while skillful qualities decline I say that you shouldnt give up those things
When giving up certain things unskillful qualities decline while skillful qualities grow I say that you should give up those things
When being liberated with certain kinds of freedom unskillful qualities grow while skillful qualities decline I say that you shouldnt be liberated with those kinds of freedom
When being liberated with certain kinds of freedom unskillful qualities decline while skillful qualities grow I say that you should be liberated with those kinds of freedom
After Vajjiyamāhita had been educated encouraged fired up and inspired with a Dhamma talk by the Buddha he got up from his seat bowed and respectfully circled the Buddha before leaving
Then not long after Vajjiyamāhita had left the Buddha addressed the mendicants
Mendicants even a mendicant who for a long time has had little dust in their eye in this teaching and training would legitimately and completely refute those wanderers who follow other paths just as the householder Vajjiyamāhita did

I praise growth in skillful qualities not stagnation or decline
And how is there decline in skillful qualities not stagnation or growth
Its when a mendicant has a certain degree of faith ethics generosity wisdom and eloquence Those qualities neither stagnate nor grow in them
I call this decline in skillful qualities not stagnation or growth
This is how theres decline in skillful qualities not stagnation or growth

I call this growth in skillful qualities not stagnation or decline

If a mendicant isnt skilled in the ways of anothers mind then they should train themselves I will be skilled in the ways of my own mind
And how is a mendicant skilled in the ways of their own mind
Suppose there was a woman or man who was young youthful and fond of adornments and they check their own reflection in a clean bright mirror or a clear bowl of water If they see any dirt or blemish there theyd try to remove it
But if they dont see any dirt or blemish there theyre happy with that as theyve got all they wished for
How fortunate that Im clean
In the same way checking is very helpful for a mendicants skillful qualities
Am I often covetous or not Am I often malicious or not Am I often overcome with dullness and drowsiness or not Am I often restless or not Am I often doubtful or not Am I often irritable or not Am I often defiled in mind or not Am I often disturbed in body or not Am I often energetic or not Am I often immersed in samādhi or not
Suppose that upon checking a mendicant knows this
I am often covetous malicious overcome with dullness and drowsiness restless doubtful irritable defiled in mind disturbed in body lazy and not immersed in samādhi In order to give up those bad unskillful qualities they should apply outstanding enthusiasm effort zeal vigor perseverance mindfulness and situational awareness
Suppose your clothes or head were on fire In order to extinguish it youd apply outstanding enthusiasm effort zeal vigor perseverance mindfulness and situational awareness
In the same way in order to give up those bad unskillful qualities that mendicant should apply outstanding enthusiasm 
But suppose that upon checking a mendicant knows this
I am often content kindhearted rid of dullness and drowsiness calm confident loving pure in mind undisturbed in body energetic and immersed in samādhi Grounded on those skillful qualities they should practice meditation further to end the defilements

Punishments
So I have heard
At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monastery
There the Buddha addressed the mendicants
Mendicants
Venerable sir they replied
The Buddha said this
There are mendicants these two faults
The fault apparent in the present life and the fault to do with lives to come
What is the fault apparent in the present life
Its when someone sees that kings have arrested a bandit a criminal and subjected them to various punishments
whipping caning and clubbing cutting off hands or feet or both cutting off ears or nose or both the porridge pot the shellshave the demons mouth the garland of fire the burning hand the grass blades the bark dress the antelope the meat hook the coins the caustic pickle the twisting bar the straw mat being splashed with hot oil being fed to the dogs being impaled alive and being beheaded
It occurs to them
If I were to commit the kinds of bad deeds for which the kings arrested that bandit that criminal
the rulers would arrest me and subject me to the same punishments
Afraid of the fault apparent in the present life they do not steal the belongings of others
This is called the fault apparent in the present life
What is the fault to do with lives to come
Its when someone reflects
Bad conduct of body speech or mind has a bad painful result in the next life
If I conduct myself badly
then when my body breaks up after death wont I be reborn in a place of loss a bad place the underworld hell
Afraid of the fault to do with lives to come they give up bad conduct by way of body speech and mind and develop good conduct by way of body speech and mind keeping themselves pure
This is called the fault to do with lives to come
These are the two faults
So you should train like this
We will fear the fault apparent in the present life and we will fear the fault to do with lives to come We will fear faults seeing the danger in faults
Thats how you should train
If you fear faults seeing the danger in faults you can expect to be freed from all faults
Endeavor
These two endeavors are challenging in the world
The endeavor of laypeople staying in a home to provide robes almsfood lodgings and medicines and supplies for the sick And the endeavor of those gone forth from the lay life to homelessness to let go of all attachments
These are the two endeavors that are challenging in the world
The better of these two endeavors is the effort to let go of all attachments
So you should train like this
We shall endeavor to let go of all attachments
Thats how you should train
Mortifying
These two things mendicants are mortifying
Its when someone has done bad things and not done good things by way of body speech and mind
Thinking Ive done bad things by way of body speech and mind theyre mortified Thinking I havent done good things by way of body speech and mind theyre mortified
These are the two things that are mortifying
Not Mortifying
These two things mendicants are not mortifying
Its when someone has done good things and not done bad things by way of body speech and mind
Thinking Ive done good things by way of body speech and mind theyre not mortified Thinking I havent done bad things by way of body speech and mind theyre not mortified
These are the two things that are not mortifying
Learned for Myself
Mendicants I have learned these two things for myself
to never be content with skillful qualities and to never stop trying
I never stopped trying thinking
Gladly let only skin sinews and bones remain Let the flesh and blood waste away in my body I will not stop trying until I have achieved what is possible by human strength energy and vigor
It was by diligence that I achieved awakening and by diligence that I achieved the supreme sanctuary
If you too never stop trying thinking
Gladly let only skin sinews and bones remain Let the flesh and blood waste away in my body I will not stop trying until I have achieved what is possible by human strength energy and vigor
You will soon realize the supreme culmination of the spiritual path in this very life You will live having achieved with your own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness
So you should train like this
We will never stop trying thinking
Gladly let only skin sinews and bones remain Let the flesh and blood waste away in my body I will not stop trying until I have achieved what is possible by human strength energy and vigor
Thats how you should train
Fetters
There are mendicants these two things
Seeing things that are prone to being fettered as gratifying and seeing things that are prone to being fettered as boring

When these are not given up youre not freed from rebirth old age and death from sorrow lamentation pain sadness and distress
Youre not freed from suffering I say
When you keep seeing things that are prone to being fettered as boring you give up greed hate and delusion

But because the two bright things protect the world there is recognition of the status of mother aunts and wives and partners of teachers and respected people

The mendicant soandso is freed both ways soandso is freed by wisdom soandso is a personal witness soandso is attained to view soandso is freed by faith soandso is a follower of the teachings soandso is a follower by faith soandso is ethical of good character soandso is unethical of bad character
In this way they get material things
And when they get these things they use them tied infatuated attached blind to the drawbacks and not understanding the escape
This is called an assembly that values material things not the true teaching

And what is an assembly with unprincipled speech
It is an assembly where the mendicants take up disciplinary issues whether legitimate or not
But they dont persuade each other or allow themselves to be persuaded nor do they convince each other or allow themselves to be convinced
Unable to persuade or convince each other they cant let go of their opinions They obstinately stick to that disciplinary issue insisting that
This is the only truth other ideas are silly

Mendicants I see two reasons to frequent remote lodgings in the wilderness and the forest
Seeing a happy life for oneself in the present and having compassion for future generations

What is the benefit of developing the mind
Greed is given up
What is the benefit of developing discernment
Wisdom is developed
What is the benefit of developing wisdom
Ignorance is given up
The mind contaminated by greed is not free and wisdom contaminated by ignorance does not grow
In this way freedom of heart comes from the fading away of greed while freedom by wisdom comes from the fading away of ignorance

The power of reflection and the power of development
And what mendicants is the power of reflection
Its when someone reflects
Bad conduct of body speech or mind has a bad painful result in both this life and the next
Reflecting like this they give up bad conduct by way of body speech and mind and develop good conduct by way of body speech and mind keeping themselves pure
This is called the power of reflection
And what mendicants is the power of development
In this context the power of development is the power of the trainees
For when you rely on the power of a trainee you give up greed hate and delusion
Then you dont do anything unskillful or practice anything bad
This is called the power of development
These are the two powers

And what mendicants is the power of development
Its when a mendicant quite secluded from sensual pleasures secluded from unskillful qualities enters and remains in the first absorption which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion while placing the mind and keeping it connected
As the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled they enter and remain in the second absorption which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion with internal clarity and confidence and unified mind without placing the mind and keeping it connected
And with the fading away of rapture they enter and remain in the third absorption where they meditate with equanimity mindful and aware personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare Equanimous and mindful one meditates in bliss
Giving up pleasure and pain and ending former happiness and sadness they enter and remain in the fourth absorption without pleasure or pain with pure equanimity and mindfulness

There are mendicants these two ways of teaching the Dhamma
In brief and in detail
These are two ways of teaching the Dhamma
Mendicants in a disciplinary issue if neither the offending mendicant nor the accusing mendicant carefully checks themselves you can expect that issue
will lead to lasting acrimony and enmity and the mendicants wont live comfortably
But in a disciplinary issue if both the offending mendicant and the accusing mendicant carefully check themselves you can expect that issue
wont lead to lasting acrimony and enmity and the mendicants will live comfortably
And how mendicants does an offending mendicant carefully check themselves
An offending mendicant reflects
I have committed a certain unskillful offense with the body
That mendicant saw me do this
If I hadnt committed that offense they wouldnt have seen me
But since I did commit that offense they did see me
When they saw me they were upset
and they voiced their unhappiness to me
Then I also got upset
so I told others
So the mistake is mine alone like someone who owes customs duty on their goods
Thats how mendicants an offending mendicant carefully checks themselves
And how mendicants does an accusing mendicant carefully check themselves
An accusing mendicant reflects
This mendicant has committed a certain unskillful offense with the body
I saw them do that
If they hadnt committed that offense I wouldnt have seen them
But since they did commit that offense I did see them
When I saw them I was upset
and I voiced my unhappiness to them
Then they also got upset
so they told others
So the mistake is mine alone like someone who owes customs duty on their goods
Thats how mendicants an accusing mendicant carefully checks themselves
In a disciplinary issue if neither the offending mendicant nor the accusing mendicant carefully checks themselves you can expect that issue will lead to lasting acrimony and enmity and the mendicants wont live comfortably
But in a disciplinary issue if both the offending mendicant and the accusing mendicant carefully checks themselves you can expect that issue wont lead to lasting acrimony and enmity and the mendicants will live comfortably
Then a certain brahmin went up to the Buddha and exchanged greetings with him
When the greetings and polite conversation were over he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha
What is the cause Master Gotama what is the reason why some sentient beings when their body breaks up after death are reborn in a place of loss a bad place the underworld hell
Unprincipled and immoral conduct is the reason why some sentient beings when their body breaks up after death are reborn in a place of loss a bad place the underworld hell
What is the cause Master Gotama what is the reason why some sentient beings when their body breaks up after death are reborn in a good place a heavenly realm

I go for refuge to Master Gotama to the teaching and to the mendicant Saṅgha
From this day forth may Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life
Then the brahmin Jāṇussoṇi went up to the Buddha and exchanged greetings with him

What theyve done and what theyve not done
Thats why some sentient beings when their body breaks up after death are reborn in a place of loss a bad place the underworld hell

Well then brahmin listen and pay close attention I will speak
Yes sir Jāṇussoṇi replied
