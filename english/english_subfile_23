The diligent are not powerlessSuffering can be overcomeStill knowing ourselves to be sunk in confusion and beset by myriad defilements we might regard Nibbana as too remote to do us much good here and nowWe persist in seeing an unbridgeable chasm between saints and ordinary people like ourselvesWe think practically everybody is like us while maybe there are one or two genuine saints in the world they presumably having just been born in that condition or with the exceptional good luck to get themselves elevated  who knows howYet the human condition is not according to Buddhism a fixed sentence to this or that level of wisdom and virtueBeings are living at all stages of attainment and they do not stay in the same placeThey rise through their own good efforts and decline through their own negligence in the endless action and reaction of intentional deeds and results of deedsThe Buddha did not teach the Dhamma for the entertainment of those already perfected he taught it for the benefit of fallible people like us who were struggling to avoid pain and make sense of the worldEven to those who came to him with no intention to scale high spiritual summits he imparted the progressive training of giving morality and mental developmentWhyBecause there is always scope for improvement and because the human alternatives are not limited to holy wisdom or cloddish ignoranceSuffering lessens and happiness increases when we make an effort to follow the Noble Eightfold Path whatever our present conditionIn the classic formula the Dhamma is directly visible timeless calling one to come and see leading onwards to be personally realized by the wise Perhaps we cannot see Nibbana resplendent on the horizon but we can certainly make out the ground beneath our feet we can know when we draw a joyful breath or put behind us an old sorrow or refrain from a vicious act or compose an agitated mindThe Dhamma confers benefits here and now as well as in the futureIs there not satisfaction in performing a good deed with a clear mindIs there not uplift in a moment of quiet contemplation saved from the tumult of the dayThe Dhamma lightens our burdens in the present and gives us grounds for hopeWhat then does this have to do with the problems of loveSimply thisThe Dhamma puts the delights and torments of love into perspective so that we can break the illusion of love as the highest of aspirations and most essential of desiresHenry Thoreau wrote The only remedy for love is to love more We might amend this to say The only remedy for love is to love betterThe understanding and the practice of the Dhamma do not destroy our capacity to love or enjoy love  far from itThe Dhamma purges the grasping selfish qualities from our love and makes it purer and noblerAs we come to understand through personal experience the rightness and goodness of the path of Dhamma we may discover  slowly or suddenly  that the consuming passions we previously thought to be the only reasons for our existence are really not so and that something of wondrous value overarches them  indistinct as yet but flashing out now and again from the clouds of possibilityWhat do our heaving emotions matter compared with thatWhen we lean hard out of passion we will fall hard  such is the nature of attachmentBut when we do not lean when instead we stand upright with an eye to the heights then the love we bestow flows out of us without weakening us like a superabundance of vigorThis is metta  lovingkindness devoid of selfishnessIt becomes purer to the extent we realize it is not the purest it becomes happier to the extent we realize it is not the happiestNibbana surpasses allIf through our own ripening knowledge we appreciate that our ultimate and highest purpose should be Nibbana the absolute end of sorrow then all goals beneath that are cast in a new lightWhen we have something to live for that is higher than fame honor friendship or health  higher even than love  we can never be utterly impoverished or ruinedWe are in fact in a much better position to enjoy whatever may be achieved in worldly life because we no longer depend solely on changeable circumstances for our happinessLove cools friendships wane calamities carry off the good and the beautifulWho can deny itIf we are to overcome despair and grief we must not invest ourselves obsessively in what is perishableWe need to keep our minds and consequently our actions as free as possible from craving and attendant defilements like covetousness and possessiveness Dhammapada vv While nobody can cut off craving simply by an act of will we can certainly loosen its frightful grip on us by following the path and paying attention to the ultimate deliverance that shines at its endLove is never the poorer for being accompanied by wisdomIt is not harmed by being deprived of a crownThe agonies we endure and inflict in the name of love come from making love bear too heavy a weightWhile we are in the world and engaged in the life of a householder we will naturally form attachments to family job friends and lovers but the suffering produced from these attachments will vary according to our wisdom and maturityIf we see nothing higher at all and abandon ourselves to the lottery of gaining and losing we will surely suffer great pain but if we keep the ideals of the Dhamma before us we will gain a measure of insulation against worldly inclemenciesAccording to Buddhism everything that has the nature of arising has the nature of ceasing so it is well to place our greatest faith in Nibbana which being beyond all concepts and limits does not arise and thus does not fluctuate with the teetering universeAn independent mind intent on deliverance is not a cold unfeeling mind but a mind whose love is uncalculated beneficent free  and empty of the furious I want of egoIf we dont live for love we wont die for it eitherIf the windows of our mind are open to the streaming light of Dhamma then that light will bathe our thoughts and actions and distinguish the skillful from the foolishEven without understanding of the Dhamma most of us will distinguish in theory between love and infatuationWe think of infatuation as capricious irresponsible and shallow and true love as mature serious and steady  though in practice it is hard to tell where one ends and the other beginsAt least we recognize some advantage to clear sight and reflection and this recognition grows sharper with actual experience of the DhammaWe become less likely to throw ourselves at the feet of the adored object and more likely to stand erect honest and mindful ready to meet our fortune with braveryTo a world that knows nothing loftier than the convulsions of craving this may seem a loss but to one who truly experiences the refreshment of wisdom there comes no narrowness but rather a loosening of the bonds of fear and selfishnessOne can love without compulsion out of free willHow gratifying when affection is given or received without a bill for services renderedEven under promising circumstances there is no guarantee that love will be returned in equal measure or that it will last long or that it will provide unalloyed joyWhen we depend on it entirely for our happiness we must dwell in the shadow of pain however bright our amorous interludesWhat if we should lose our hearts support tomorrowWere okay as long as we have each other we assure ourselves dreamilyBut we will not have each other longQuarrels time distance changes or finally death dissolve all unions of friends lovers and relatives plunging the unwary into despair and meaninglessness and if we have no wisdom we too may go creeping about the lonely streets with our eyes staring hungrily into other eyes and seeing the same hunger thereBut in the way of the Buddha there is relief from distress and exileIn wisdom there is securityBecause love is fragile and temporary it cannot protect us forever but if we relax our grip it may bloom even better allowing us to give and receive without encumbrance frenzy or fear offering to each other our strength instead of our weaknessIn a sense the practice of Dhamma is like gradually filling the abyss of ignorance with knowledge until that terrible vacuum is appeased and neutralized and the heart no more cries for unknown succorThe perfected one clinging to nothing here or hereafter asks nothing and requires nothing so he is wholly freeHis lovingkindness is just the overmeasure the overflowing of his goodness quite purified of the need the visceral wanting and the vacillation of ordinary attachmentWhile we cannot all at once purify our sentiments of their dross we can raise the aim of our thought and conduct and reflect on  indeed contemplate  the virtues of the Buddha and the noble ones who are free from taintTheir achievement is an image to set before our inner eye something higher to live for within and beyond the motions of our conventional lifeNo good thing prospers in ignoranceThe more we understand this flawed universe the more skillfully we can live and the happier we will beWe love best when we do not love out of desperationBhikkhu

people of all creedsFounded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topicsIts publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddhas discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practiceThese works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first aroseIn May of this year members of Le Refuge a Buddhist group located in Eguilles near AixenProvence invited me to lead a tenday retreat on the topics of breath meditation and anattā or notselfThe retreat provided me with the rare opportunity to gather my thoughts on the topic of notself under one frameworkThe result was a series of eight evening talks edited transcripts of these talks form the body of this bookThe talks draw on passages from the Pali Canon and on the writings and talks of the ajaans or teachers of the Thai forest tradition in which I was trainedFor people unfamiliar with the Canon I have added passages from the discourses at the back of the book to flesh out some of the points made in the talksThese are followed by a glossary of Pali termsFor people unfamiliar with the Thai forest tradition you should know that it is a meditation tradition founded in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century by Ajaan Mun BhuridattoThe other ajaans mentioned in the talks trained under himOf these Ajaan Fuang and Ajaan Suwat were my teachersAjaan Fuang although he spent some time training directly under Ajaan Mun spent more time training under one of Ajaan Muns students Ajaan LeeMany people have helped with the preparation of this bookI would like to thank the people of Le Refuge who made the retreat possible and in particular Betty Picheloup the founder of the group and Claude LeNinan my excellent and meticulous interpreter throughout my stay in ProvenceHere at Metta the monks at the monastery helped in preparing the manuscript as did Michael Barber Alexandra Kaloyanides Addie Onsanit Ginger Vathanasombat and Josie WolfA French translation of the all the talks and questionandanswer sessions during the retreat is currently in preparationIf you are comparing the talks here with their French equivalents please be aware that the French is

the Royal Thai Edition of the Pali Canon and the BUDSIR IV edition of the Canon and Commentary produced by Mahidol University BangkokThe Buddhas teaching on anattā or notself is often mystifying to many WesternersWhen we hear the term notself we think that the Buddha was answering a question with a long history in our culture  of whether there is or isnt a self or a soul  and that his answer is perverse or confusingSometimes it seems to be No but the Buddha doesnt follow through with the implications of a real No  if theres no self how can there be rebirthSometimes his answer seems to be No with a hidden Yes but you wonder why the Yes is so hard to pin downIf you remember only one thing from these talks remember this that the Buddha in teaching notself was not answering the question of whether there is or isnt a selfThis question was one he explicitly put asideTo understand why its useful to look at the Buddhas approach to teaching  and to questions  in generalOnce he was walking through a forest with a group of monksHe stooped down to pick up a handful of leaves and told the monks that the leaves in his hand were like the teachings he had givenAs for the leaves in the forest they were like the knowledge he had gained in his awakeningThe leaves in his hand covered just two issues how suffering is caused and how it can be endedAfter his awakening the Buddha could have talked about anything at all but he chose to talk on just these two topicsTo understand his teachings we have to understand not only what he said about suffering and its end but also why these topics were of utmost importanceThe purpose of his teachings was to help people find true happinessHe didnt assume that all beings are inherently good or inherently bad but he did assume that they all want happinessHowever they tend to be bewildered by their suffering so they need help in finding a way to genuine happinessIn fact this sense of bewilderment gives rise to one of the minds most primal questions Is there anyone who knows how to put an end to this suffering The Buddhas teachings are a direct response to this burning gutlevel question providing people with something they desperately want and need advice on how to end their sufferingIn other words the Buddha chose to share the most compassionate knowledge he could provideBecause people have trouble thinking straight when theyre suffering they need reliable instruction in what really is causing their suffering and what they can do to put an end to it before they can actually find the way out of their suffering and arrive at true happinessAnd its important that these instructions not introduce other issues that will distract them from the main issue at handThis is why the path to true happiness begins with right view the understanding that helps clear up the minds bewildermentRight view is not just a matter of having correct opinions about why theres suffering and what can be done about itRight view also means knowing how you gain right opinions by asking the right questions learning which questions help put an end to suffering which questions get in the way and how to use this knowledge skillfully on the path to true happinessThis means that right view is strategicIn fact all of the Buddhas teachings are strategicThey are not simply to be discussed they are to be put to use and mastered as skills so as to arrive at their intended aimThe Buddha understood that the issues of our life are defined by our questionsA question gives a context to the knowledge contained in its answer  a sense of where that knowledge fits and what its good forSome questions are skillful in that they provide a useful context for putting an end to suffering whereas others are notOnce one of the Buddhas monks came to see him and asked him a list of ten questions the major philosophical questions of his timeSome of the questions concerned the nature of the world whether it was eternal or not finite or not others concerned the nature and existence of the selfThe Buddha refused to answer any of them and he explained the reason for his refusalHe said it was as if a man had been shot by an arrow and was taken to a doctor and before the doctor could take the arrow out the man would insist that he find out first who had shot the arrow who had made the arrow what the arrow was made of what kind of wood what kind of feathersAs the Buddha said if the doctor tried to answer all of those questions the man would die firstThe first order of business would be to take the arrow outIf the person still wanted to know the answer to those questions he could ask afterwardsIn the same way the Buddha would answer only the questions that provided an answer to our primal question and helped put an end to suffering and stressQuestions that would get in the way he would put aside because the problem of stress and suffering is urgentUsually when we hear the teaching on notself we think that its an answer to questions like these Do I have a selfWhat am IDo I existDo I not exist However the Buddha listed all of these as unskillful questionsOnce when he was asked pointblank Is there a selfIs there no self he refused to answerHe said that these questions would get in the way of finding true happinessSo obviously the teaching on notself was not meant to answer these questionsTo understand it we have to find out which questions it was meant to answerAs the Buddha said he taught two categorical teachings two teachings that were true across the board and without exceptionsThese two teachings form the framework for everything else he taughtOne was the difference between skillful and unskillful action actions that lead to longterm happiness and those that lead to longterm sufferingThe other was the list of the four noble truths the truth of suffering the cause of suffering the end of suffering and the path to the end of sufferingIf you want to put an end to suffering and stress these two categorical teachings carry duties or imperativesIn terms of the first teaching you want to avoid unskillful action and give rise to skillful actionIn terms of the second the four truths are categories for framing your experience with each category carrying a specific duty you have to master as a skillYou need to know which of the truths youre encountering so that you can deal with that truth in the right waySuffering must be comprehended the cause of suffering must be abandoned the end of suffering must be realized and the path to the end of suffering must be developed as a skillThese are the ultimate skillful actions which means that the mastery of the path is where the two sets of categorical teachings come togetherThe path begins with discernment  the factors of right view and right resolve  and discernment begins with this basic question about which actions are really skillful What when I do it will lead to longterm welfare and happiness The Buddhas teaching on notself  and his teaching on self  are in part answers to this questionTo fit into this question perceptions of self and perceptions of notself are best viewed as kamma or actions actions of identification and disidentificationIn the terms of the texts the perception of self is called an action of Imaking and mymaking The perception of notself is part of an activity called the notself contemplation Thus the question becomes When is the perception of self a skillful action that leads to longterm welfare and happiness when is the perception of notself a skillful action that leads to longterm welfare and happinessThis is the reverse of the way that the relationship between questions of kamma and notself are usually understoodIf youve ever taken an introductory course on Buddhism youve probably heard this question If there is no self who does the kamma who receives the results of kamma This understanding turns the teaching on notself into a teaching on no self and then takes no self as the framework and the teaching on kamma as something that doesnt fit in the frameworkBut in the way the Buddha taught these topics the teaching on kamma is the framework and the teaching of notself fits into that framework as a type of actionIn other words assuming that there really are skillful and unskillful actions what kind of action is the perception of selfWhat kind of action is the perception of notselfSo to repeat the issue is not What is my true self but What kind of perception of self is skillful and when is it skillful what kind of perception of notself is skillful and when is it skillfulWe already engage in these perceptions all of the time and have been doing so ever since we were childrenWe have many different perceptions of selfEach sense of self is strategic a means to an endEach comes with a boundary inside of which is self and outside of which is notself And so our sense of whats self and whats notself keeps changing all of the time depending on our desires and what we see will lead to true happinessTake an example from your childhoodSuppose you have a younger sister and someone down the street is threatening herYou want to protect herAt that moment she is very much your sisterShe belongs to you so you will do whatever you can to protect herThen suppose that when youve brought her home safely she begins to play with your toy car and wont give it back to youNow shes no longer your sisterShes the OtherYour sense of your self and of what is yours and not yours has shiftedThe boundary line between self and notself has changedYouve been doing this sort of thing  changing the boundaries of whats self and notself  all of the timeThink back on your life  or even for just a day  to see the many times your sense of self has changed from one role to anotherNormally we create a sense of self as a strategy for gaining happinessWe look for what abilities we have in order to gain a happiness we wantThose abilities are then oursThe hand we can use to reach for the object we want is our hand the loud voice we can use to scare off the bullies threatening our sister is our voiceThis is why the element of control is so essential to our sense of self We assume that the things we can control are us or oursThen we also try to think about which part of ourselves will live to enjoy the happiness were trying to gainThese things will change depending on the desireUnfortunately our desires tend to be confused and incoherentWere also unskillful in our understanding of what happiness isThus we often end up with an inconsistent and misinformed collection of selvesYou can see this clearly as you meditate You find that the mind contains many different inner voices expressing many conflicting opinions as to what you should and shouldnt be doing to be happyIts as if you have a committee inside the mind and the committee is rarely in orderThats because its composed of selves youve collected from all your past strategies for trying to gain happiness and these strategies often worked at crosspurposesSome of them seemed to work at a time when your standards for happiness were crude or you werent really paying attention to the results you were getting  as when you threw a tantrum and got your mother to give you the food you wantedThese members of the committee tend to be deludedSome of your strategies involved doing things you liked to do but actually led to suffering  as when you hit your sister and got your toy truck backThese members of the committee tend to be dishonest and deceitful They deny the suffering they causedThis is why your committee of selves is not an orderly gathering of saintsIts more like a corrupt city councilThe Buddhas purpose in having us master perceptions of self and notself is to bring some clarity honesty and order to the committee to teach us how to engage in these activities of perception in a conscious consistent and skillful way that will lead to true happinessIts important to understand this point for it helps to clear up a major misunderstanding that can cause us to resist the teaching on notselfWe instinctively know that our strategies of selfmaking are for the sake of happiness so when we misunderstand the Buddhas notself teaching  thinking that its a no self teaching and that hes trying to deny us of our selves  were afraid that hes trying to deprive us of our strategies for finding happiness and protecting the happiness weve foundThats why we resist the teachingBut when we gain a proper understanding of his teaching we see that his aim is to teach us how to use perceptions of self and notself as strategies leading to a happiness thats reliable and trueIn teaching notself hes not trying to deprive us of our strategies for happiness hes actually trying to show us how to expand and refine them so that we can find a happiness better than any happiness weve ever knownIn terms of the Buddhas two categorical teachings the teaching on notself is a strategy for helping you with the duties they call for if you want to put an end to suffering and stress helping you to avoid unskillful action in the first categorical teaching and to comprehend stress and abandon its cause in the secondYou do this in conjunction with some skillful selfstrategies that help you give rise to skillful actions and to develop the pathWhen you master these strategies properly they enable you to realize the end of sufferingThis is why these teachings are included in the Buddhas handful of leavesThese are the main points that Id like to discuss for the rest of the retreatThe important point to notice as we connect these talks with our meditation is that we can view our sense of self as an activity a processIts something we do and something we can learn to do more skillfullyAt the same time well look at our sense of whats notself  which is also an activity  and learn how to do that more skillfully tooWhen we learn to do this in the proper way well arrive at true happiness free from any suffering and stressAt that point questions of self and notself will be put asideWhen you arrive at true happiness you no longer need strategies to protect it  the way you do for forms of happiness that are subject to change  because its unconditionedIt doesnt depend on anything at allThe strategy of self is no longer needed and neither is the strategy of notselfAs Ajaan Suwat one of my teachers once said when you find true happiness you dont ask whos experiencing it for thats not an issueThe experience itself is sufficientIt doesnt need anybody to watch over itBut to reach that point we have to learn how to develop our skill in employing both the strategies of self and the strategies of notselfThese are the skills and strategies well be discussing each evening during the retreatTonight Id like to talk more about why the Buddha refused to get involved in the issue of whether there is or is not a selfThis will involve discussing in more detail two of the points I made last nightThe first point is that the Buddhas teaching was strategic aimed at leading to a specific goal total freedom in the minds of his listenersThe second point is that as part of this larger strategy the Buddha had strategic reasons for putting questions of the existence or nonexistence of the self asidePart of his teaching strategy was to divide questions into four types based on how they should be best approached for the purpose of putting an end to suffering and stressThe first type includes those that deserve a categorical answer in other words a straight yes or no this or that with no exceptionsThe second type includes questions that deserve an analytical answer in which the Buddha would reanalyze the question before answering itThe third type includes questions that deserve a counterquestionIn other words he would question the questioner before answering the original questionAnd the fourth type includes questions that deserve to be put aside as useless  or even harmful  in the quest to put an end to sufferingAnd as I said the questions Is there a selfIs there no self are ones he put asideHeres the passage where he explains whyThen Vacchagotta the wanderer went to the Blessed One and on arrival exchanged courteous greetings with himAfter an exchange of friendly greetings and courtesies he sat down to one sideAs he was sitting there he asked the Blessed One Now then master Gotama is there a self When this was said the Blessed One was silentThen is there no self The second time the Blessed One was silentThen Vacchagotta the wanderer got up from his seat and leftThen not long after Vacchagotta the wanderer had left Venerable nanda said to the Blessed One Why Lord did the Blessed One not answer when asked a question by Vacchagotta the wanderer And heres the Buddhas response nanda if I being asked by Vacchagotta the wanderer if there is a self were to answer that there is a self that would be conforming with those brahmans and contemplatives who are exponents of eternalismIf I being asked by Vacchagotta the wanderer if there is no self were to answer that there is no self that would be conforming with those brahmans and contemplatives who are exponents of annihilationismIf I being asked by Vacchagotta the wanderer if there is a self were to answer that there is a self would that be in keeping with the arising of knowledge that all phenomena are notselfAnd Venerable nanda said No LordThen the Buddha said And if I being asked by Vacchagotta the wanderer if there is no self were to answer that there is no self the bewildered Vacchagotta would become even more bewildered Does the self that I used to have now not existNotice that only one of the Buddhas reasons for putting these questions aside concerns the person asking them Vacchagotta would be bewildered by the answerThe other three reasons state that any answer to these questions would either side with wrong views or would get in the way of an insight that as we will see is an important step at an advanced stage of the pathAlso notice that the Buddha is not giving an analytical answer to either of Vacchagottas questions nor is he giving a counterquestion such as What kind of self do you mean This rules out the idea that the notself teaching is aimed at negating specific ideas of self  in other words that the answer would depend on what you mean by selfHowever most popular misinterpretations of the notself teaching give just this kind of answer to these questionsIn other words It depends on what kind of self were talking aboutCertain types of self exist whereas other types dont What this means is that these misinterpretations say that the Buddha didnt answer Vacchagottas categorical question because it required an analytical answerBut as we have seen the Buddha knew how to give analytical answers to categorical questions whenever he needed toAnd he had his reasons for putting these questions on the existence or nonexistence of the self asideBut because these popular misinterpretations are so pervasive its important that we look at them in some detail to see why they are misinterpretations how they misunderstand the Buddhas approach and place obstacles in the pathOtherwise its all too easy for us to fall into these misunderstandings ourselvesOne misinterpretation is that the Buddhas notself teaching is aimed specifically at negating the view of self proposed in the Brahmanical Upanishads  that the self is permanent cosmic and identical with God  but the Buddha is not negating the fact that we each have an individual selfIn other words hes saying Yes you have an individual self but No you dont have a cosmicGod selfThe second misinterpretation is the exact opposite The Buddha is negating the idea that you have a small separate self but hes affirming the existence of a large interconnected cosmic selfIn other words hes saying Yes you do have a connected self but No you dont have a separate selfThe third misinterpretation is similar to the first but it introduces the idea that a self to be a true self has to be permanentAccording to this interpretation the Buddha is affirming that the five aggregates are what you are but these five aggregates dont really qualify to be called a self because they arent permanentTheyre just processesIn other words No you dont have a self but Yes youre a bunch of processes the aggregates are what you areNone of these interpretations fit in with the Buddhas actual teachings or his actual approach to the question of whether there is or is not a selfThey misrepresent the Buddha both for formal reasons  the fact that they give an analytical answer to a question the Buddha put aside  and for reasons of content They dont fit in with what the Buddha actually had to say on the topic of self and notselfFor example with the first misinterpretation  that the Buddha is denying the cosmic self found in the Upanishads  it turns out that the Upanishads contain many different views of the self and the Buddha himself gives an analysis of those different kindsHe finds four main varietiesOne is that the self has a form and is finite  for example that your self is your conscious body and will end when the body diesThe second type is that the self has a form and is infinite  for example the view that the self is equal to the cosmosThe third type is that the self is formless and finiteThis is similar to the Christian idea of the soul It doesnt have a shape and its range is limitedThe fourth view is that the self is formless and infinite  for example the belief that the self is the infinite spirit or energy that animates the cosmosThe Buddha says that each of these four varieties of selftheory comes in three different modes as to when and how the self is that wayOne is that the self already is that wayAnother is that the self naturally changes to be that way  for example when you fall asleep or when you dieThe third is that the self is changeable through the willIn other words through meditation and other practices you can change the nature of your self  for example from being finite to being infiniteMultiply the four varieties of self by their three modes and you have twelve types of theories about the selfAll of these theories the Buddha rejectsHe doesnt agree with any of them because they all involve clinging which is something you have to comprehend and let goThis means that his notself teaching is not just negating specific types of self  such as a cosmic self a permanent self or an ordinary individual selfIt negates every imaginable way of defining the selfAs for the second misinterpretation that the Buddha is actually affirming the cosmic or interconnected self the evidence Ive already given you shows that that cannot be the caseThere is also a passage in the Canon where he says specifically that the idea of a cosmic self is especially foolishHis argument is this If there is a self there must be what belongs to a selfIf your self is cosmic then the whole cosmos must belong to youBut does itNoDoes it lie under your controlNoTherefore it doesnt deserve to be called yoursAs for the third misinterpretation  that the five aggregates arent a self because they arent permanent but nevertheless the five aggregates are what you are  the Buddha says repeatedly that its not fitting to identify the aggregates as what I amAs we will see later he explains the five aggregates as the raw material from which you create your sense of self but that its not skillful to think that they constitute what you areAnother problem with this misinterpretation is that it opens the Buddha to charges of lying in the many passages where he does refer to the self in a positive way  as when he says that the self is its own mainstayIf there really is no self at all why does he talk about it as if it existsTo get around this problem the interpretation introduces the distinction between two levels of truth conventional and ultimateThus it says when the Buddha is talking about self hes doing so only in a conventional wayOn the ultimate level no self existsThe problem with this distinction is that the Buddha himself never uses it  it was introduced into the tradition at a much later date  and if it were so central to understanding his teachings youd think that he would have mentioned itBut he didntTheres also the problem that if the aggregates were what you are then  because nibbāna is the ending of the aggregates  that would mean that when you attain nibbāna you would be annihilatedThe Buddha however denied that nibbāna was annihilationAt the same time what good would be the end of suffering if it meant total annihilationOnly people who hate themselves or hate all experience would go for itAnd as for the idea that only a permanent identity deserves to be called a self Its not the case that the Buddha would tell you to create a sense of self around the experience of something unchanging or permanentAs we will see at an advanced level of the practice he tells you to develop the perception of notself even for the phenomenon of the deathless which is something that doesnt changeThe problem with the act of selfidentification is not just that its mistakenly focused on impermanent objects when it should be focused on permanent objectsIt ultimately shouldnt be focused on anything at all because it always involves clinging regardless of what its focused on and clinging involves suffering and stressThe whole point of the Buddhas teaching is to put an end to suffering and stressSo when the Buddha refused to answer Vacchagottas questions it wasnt because he had an analytical answer in mind that he couldnt explain to Vacchagotta but would perhaps explain to othersIt was because in order to avoid getting involved with issues that get in the way of putting an end to suffering these questions deserved to be put aside no matter who asked themIn fact theres another sutta passage that makes precisely this point No matter who you are if you try to answer the question Do I exist or Do I not exist or What am I you get entangled in views like I have a self or I have no self which the Buddha calls a thicket of views a wilderness of views The image is clear If youre entangled in a thicket or a wilderness youve wandered far from the path and will have trouble getting back on courseThe main point to take from all of this is that the Buddha is not interested in defining what you are or what your self isHes a lot more compassionate than thatHe wants you to see how you define your own sense of selfAfter all youre not responsible for how he might define your self and his definition of your self is not really your problemBut you are responsible for the way you define yourself and that very much is your problemWhen you define yourself through ignorance you suffer and you often cause the people around you to suffer as wellAs a first step in putting an end to this suffering you have to bring awareness to the process by which you create your sense of self so that you can clearly see what youre doing and why its causing that sufferingThis is why the Buddha aims at getting you to understand that process in line with his two categorical teachingsHe wants you to see how your act of selfdefinition fits within the four noble truths and to see when its skillful and when its not so that you can use this knowledge to put an end to sufferingWhen its skillful you use itWhen its not you regard it as notself so that you can stop clinging to it and can put it asideIts possible to create a huge variety of selvesAs the Buddha once said the mind can take on more shapes than all the species of animals in the worldThink of what that means all the whales and insects and everything inbetweenYour selves are even more variegated than thatIf you watch your sense of self during the day youll see that it continually changes its shape like an amoebaSometimes it looks like a dog sometimes a person sometimes a heavenly being sometimes a shapeless blobHowever all of these ways of creating a self can be analyzed down to the five aggregates form feeling perception fabrication and consciousnessThe Buddha doesnt say that these aggregates are what your self is theyre simply the raw materials from which you create your sense of selfAs he notes you can create four different kinds of self out of each of these aggregatesTake the form of the body as an exampleYou can equate the aggregate with your self  for example you can say that your body is your selfYou can also say that your self possesses that aggregate  for example that you have a self that possesses a bodyYou could also have the idea that your self is inside that aggregate  for example that you have a self inside the bodyA few years back I got into a discussion with my older brother about how we had visualized the soul back when we were childrenWe both imagined that it was something inside the body but we had different ideas about what it looked likeMine was less imaginativeBecause the English word soul sounds like sole the bottom of your shoe I thought my soul looked like a glowing piece of leather in a dark spaceHowever my brother was more imaginativeHis soul looked like a rusty can with an iron rod stuck in itWhere he got that image I have no ideaAt any rate those are examples of a self conceived of as being inside the body the third way you could define a soul around the aggregate of formThe fourth way that you can create a sense of self around an aggregate is to say that the aggregate lies inside your selfFor example you have a cosmic self that encompasses your body that is larger than your body and your body moves around within that vast selfAll of these ways of defining the self the Buddha says cause sufferingThis is why he advises you ultimately to put them all asideBut some of them do have their uses on the path which is why he has you develop them in a skillful way before you drop themSo instead of getting into a discussion as to which type of self is your true self  or your ultimate self or your conventional self  the Buddha is more interested in showing you how your sense of self is an actionThe adjectives he uses to describe actions are not ultimate or conventional Theyre skillful and unskillful These are the terms in which he wants you to understand your selves Are they skillfulAre they notAnd because skill can be understood only through mastery the Buddha wants you to master these actions in practiceAs it turns out each of the aggregates is also an actionWhen you take on the idea of form in the mind there is actually a decision in the mind to take on that formThat decision is an actionFeeling is also an action perception is an action fabrication is an action as is consciousnessIf you cling to any of these activities that too is an action the act of taking delight in repeating that activity again and againThere are three reasons why its useful to analyze your ways of creating a self in this fashionFirst it shows that regardless of how you identify your self it always involves clingingWherever theres clinging theres also suffering and stressThis is why the ordinary way of creating a sense of self falls under the first noble truthIf the object youre clinging to changes you suffer from its changeEven if it changes for the better you realize that its nature is not permanent therefore it cannot be trustedEven if you cling to the idea of something permanent the idea is itself impermanent as is the clinging to the ideaWhen you see the activity of creating a self in this way it gives rise to a sense of disenchantment and dispassion two emotions that can lead to releaseThats the first reason why it is useful to think of the self as activity in this way When you see it as an activity its easier to apply the perception of notself to it so that you can end the suffering that comes from clinging to itThe second reason for analyzing your ways of creating a self is that as the Buddha once said however you define your self you limit yourselfFor example if you have the idea that youre intrinsically bad by nature something thats intrinsically bad cant make itself goodYou would need an outside power to help youThis would discourage you from practicingIf you have the idea that youre intrinsically good by nature you would need to explain how something intrinsically good could suffer or could cause suffering also if it could lose its original pure nature then once you make it pure again what would keep it from losing its pure nature againTheres also the practical concern that if you believe youre intrinsically good it gives rise to complacencyYou believe that any intuition that rises up from a quiet mind is trustworthyIn this way your idea of an intrinsically good self obscures your defilementsThis is the opposite of what we sometimes hear  that our defilements obscure our intrinsically good nature  but if you believe your nature is intrinsically good then when defilements arise in the quiet mind and you identify them as the wisdom of your innate nature manifesting itself your belief in your intrinsic goodness has blinded you to whats actually going onAlso there are times in the meditation when the mind comes to a great state of emptiness space light and peaceIf youre looking for an innately pure and good Buddha nature you could easily decide that thats your Buddha natureHowever the Buddha advises that even a great state like that should be analyzed to see where there is still some inconstancy and stress  in other words to see that state of concentration as the result of actions and not as an innate stateOtherwise again you get complacentAnd as the Buddha said complacency is the opposite of the source of goodnessThe source of goodness or skill is heedfulnessYou also place limitations on yourself if you hold to the idea that you have no selfHow could you functionHow could you insist that people treat you fairlyWhat motivation would you have to avoid unskillful actions and to develop the skills of the pathEven the idea of a cosmic self has its limitationsIt prevents you from seeing how youre actually functioning in the world and how youre creating suffering through your Imaking and mymaking in the present momentIt also provides you with excuses for your unskillful feelings Whatever arises in the mind is simply the cosmos acting through you and you take no personal responsibility for itI once heard of a woman on a retreat who discovered a strong desire for a man sitting in front of her  so strong that she couldnt stay in the same roomSo she went back to meditate in her dormitory room and there she had a realization that this was not just her own desire but it was the force of cosmic desire manifesting through her and that she should just allow it to happenWhen you believe something like that its impossible to practiceAs long as you dont see that these things have their causes in your individual mind youll never be able to put an end to themEvery way of defining yourself also places a limitation on yourself in the sense that your definition of who you are and what belongs to you is going to conflict with somebody elses definition of who you are and what belongs to youThe Buddha has a special term for the type of thinking that starts with the thought of selfidentification I am the thinker He calls it papañca or objectification and says that it lies at the basis of all conflictWhen you start thinking in these terms your thoughts turn around and bite youSo these are different ways in which defining what you are can give rise to limitationsWhen you learn how to drop these unskillful ways of creating a self  or even the idea that you have no self  you can free yourself from these limitationsFinally theres a third benefit that comes from looking at the creation of a self as an action Youre free to create different senses of self that you can use as toolsYou use them when theyre needed and you can put them down when theyre notAnd in fact this is the Buddhas strategyThis is how we create a path to the end of sufferingWe use conditioned things to reach the unconditionedIf you couldnt do that you wouldnt be able to reach the unconditioned  because the unconditioned is not something that can be usedAll you have to work with is conditioned phenomenaThe way you use conditioned phenomena is by learning how to master them as skillsIn other words you turn these five aggregates into a pathYou can think of the aggregates as bricks that youve been carrying in a sack over your shoulder weighing you downBut instead of carrying them you now put them down on the ground and make them into a pathFor example when youre in a state of concentration the concentration is actually composed of the five aggregatesForm is your sense of the body as experienced from within which includes the breathFeeling is the sense of pleasure or discomfort that can come with the breathPerception is your mental image or label of breath that helps you to stick with the breath and to perceive the breath energy in different parts of the bodyThe Buddha once said that all states of concentration  except for the very highest  depend on perception because you have to keep a perception of the object in mind in order to stay with the objectAs for fabrications they include sentences in your mind that talk about the breath or the body evaluating and adjusting the breath evaluating how well your concentration is goingAnd finally consciousness is your awareness of all of these other aggregateactivitiesWhen brought together into a state of concentration in this way the five aggregates form a pathAs you master this skill you get to see how you create your sense of self around these aggregates as the agent doing the concentration practice and as the person enjoying its benefitsThis is why the ability to create a set of skillful selves falls under the fourth noble truthThis ability allows you to see the process of Imaking and mymaking in actionIt allows you to understand the powers and limitations of intentional action in leading to true happinessThis understanding is what leads to freedomSo learn to use these aggregates  and the sense of self you build around them  as tools leading to freedom instead of as burdens weighing you downTheres a story that illustrates this principle in THWhites retelling of the King Arthur legend The Once and Future KingIn this version of the story when Arthur is a young boy Merlin the magician turns him into different kinds of animals to teach him the lessons that can be learned from animalsIn the final transformation young Arthur is turned into a badger and goes down to visit an old badger in his burrowIt turns out that the old badger is like an Oxford don with many papers spilling out of desks and shelves filling his burrowHes written a thesis about why man has dominion over the animals and he reads his thesis to ArthurHis explanation is much like the creation story in the Bible except that when God creates all the animals he doesnt create them in different formsHe creates them all as identical embryosOnce they are created he lines them up and announces that hes going to give them a boonHell allow them to change the shape of their bodies in any way they want in order to survive better in the worldFor example they can change their mouths into offensive weapons or their arms into wingsHowever theres one conditionOnce they change their form they have to stick with itSo he said step up and choose your tools The different animals thought over their choices and one by one made their requestsThe badgers being very practical asked to change their hands into garden forks their teeth into razors and their skin into shieldsSome of the animals made choices that were very bizarreFor example a toad who was going to live in the Australian desert asked to swap its entire body for blotting paper to soak up the water from the seasonal rains and store it for the rest of the yearAt the end of the sixth day there remained only one animal who had not changed its body parts for toolsThat was manSo God asked man Well our little man you have thought over your choice for two days nowObviously you have made a wise choiceWhat is it And the little man said If it pleases you I dont want to change any parts of my body for toolsI simply ask for the ability to make toolsFor example if I want to swim I will make a boatIf I want to fly I will make a flying boat God was pleasedHe said Well doneYou have guessed our riddleI will put you in charge of all of the other animalsThey have limited themselves but you have not limited yourselfYou will always have many potentialsIf we take away the theological elements of this story we can draw a useful lesson from it about our ideas of self If we create a fixed view of who or what we are we limit ourselvesWe keep on creating suffering and stressBut if we see that we can create many senses of self and can learn to use them as tools well be in charge of our happinessWe can use these tools to bring suffering and stress to an endAs with any tools we have to learn how to use them well and part of using them well is learning how and when to put them downOtherwise they get in the way of what were trying to doIf we carry them around all the time they weigh us down for no purpose at allThis is where the teaching on notself comes inIt too is an activity  a strategic activity  that has to be mastered as a skill knowing how to put down a particular sense of self when its no longer skillful and ultimately when your selves have taken you as far as they can knowing how to let go of them allWhen you understand both self and notself as activities in this way its easy to see how the Buddhas teachings on this topic are answers to his basic question for fostering discernment What when I do it will lead to longterm welfare and happiness When through practice youve learned how to use perceptions of self and notself in a skillful way youll know for yourself that these skills are a very effective answer to that questionSo thats the message for tonightFor the next few nights well explore the different ways in which the Buddha gives us lessons in how to use perceptions of self and notself as tools on the pathTonight Id like to start looking at how we create a sense of self that can lead to longterm welfare and happiness focusing first on the question of why we would need to do thisWe know that the Buddha often talked about notself but he also talked positively about selfHe said that the self should be its own mainstay that it should observe itself and reprimand itself when its gone astray and that theres a need to learn not to harm oneselfHere are some passages from the Dhammapada that speak positively of the role of self on the pathThese passages show that a sense of self is an important part of the practice  especially a sense of self that encourages responsibility heedfulness and careThe question is Why would it be necessary to create this skillful sense of selfIf ultimately youre going to develop the perception of notself why spend time developing a perception of selfThe short answer is that the path is a skill and as with many other skills there are many different stages in mastering itSometimes you have to do one thing at one stage and turn around and erase it at anotherIts like making a chairAt one stage you have to mark the wood with a pencil so that you can cut it properly but when youre ready to apply the final finish you have to sand the pencil marks awayThe long answer begins with a fact that I mentioned last night that the path to the unconditioned is conditionedIn the Buddhas terminology its fabricatedThe fact that its a fabricated path leading to an unfabricated goal means that you have to develop some fabricated qualities along the way that youll have to let go when you arrive at the goalToo often we focus on the goal without paying attention to the path but its only through focusing on the path that you can arrive at the goalIf you focus all your attention off in the distance you wont see where youre actually steppingYou may trip and fallSo when you focus on the fact that the path is fabricated the first thing you have to notice is that its something you have to put together through your own voluntary effortsThe path involves actively developing good qualities and letting go of bad qualities and you have to will yourself to do thisTo motivate your will you need a healthy sense of self realizing that youll benefit from fabricating the path and that you have within you the capabilities that the path requiresOnly at the end of the path when you no longer need these forms of motivation can you let go of every possible sense of selfAlso the act of fabricating the path requires strength and a healthy sense of self helps to nourish that strengthThe Buddhas strategy here draws on an analogy he uses for explaining the process of sufferingIn his first noble truth he identifies suffering as the five clingingaggregatesThe word clinging here is the important part of the compoundThe five aggregates are burdensome to the mind because we cling to themWithout the clinging they would not be a burdenNow the word for clinging upādāna also refers to the act of taking sustenance or foodThe aggregates are things that we feed on feeding both in the physical sense and in the mental senseFor example we find mental nourishment in feelings and perceptions and fabricationsSo the Buddhas basic analogy for the process of suffering is the act of feedingHe says that we feed on the aggregates in four waysThe first way is through passion for sensualityHere sensuality means your obsession with sensual resolves and intentionsIn other words you cling to thoughts about sensual pleasuresYou can think for hours about a sensual pleasure and how to get it  as when you plan to go out for an excellent meal  even though the actual pleasure of the meal itself may last for only a short timeThe obsession with thinking about sensuality is what constitutes the clingingThe second way that we cling to and feed on the aggregates is through our views about them  our opinions our theories about how the world works and what issues are important to hold opinions onThe most extreme form of clinging through views believes that simply holding a view can take you to heaven or whatever but the act of clinging to and feeding on views works in subtler ways as wellThe third way we feed on the aggregates is through our attachment to certain habits and practicesWe believe that things have to be done in certain ways in order to be rightThe extreme form of this clinging is ritual The idea that simply performing an action properly regardless of your motivation carries a certain magical power that bends the world to your will or makes you better than other peopleTo lighten the mood Id like to tell you a story that illustrates this particular form of attachmentIt concerns a gooseThere was once a biologist in Austria who raised a baby goose whose mother had diedThe baby goose fixated on the biologist and followed him everywhereThroughout the summer as long as the biologist was outside the goose would follow him around the yard of the houseWhen autumn came however the biologist knew he would have to take the goose insideSo one evening at the time when he would normally feed the goose he didnt feed the goose but instead walked into his house leaving the door open behind himThe goose followed him inNow the entryway to the house was a long hallway that led from the door to a window on the other side of the house and halfway down the hall on the right was a stairway that led up to the second floor which was where the biologist livedThe goose on entering the house immediately freaked out because it had never been inside beforeIt went running to the window to escape but then discovered that it couldnt get out the windowMeanwhile the biologist climbed the stairs and called the gooseSo the goose turned around and followed him up the stairs which is where the biologist fed himFrom that point on every time the goose entered the house it would go first to the window then it would turn around and go up the stairsAs time passed the trip to the window got shorter and shorter until finally it was simply a matter of the gooses going to the far side of the stairway and shaking its foot at the windowThen it would climb the stairsOne evening the biologist was late coming home from workThe goose was very hungry so as soon as the biologist opened the door it ran up the stairsHalfway up the stairs though it stopped and started shaking all overThen very deliberately it walked down the stairs walked over to the window turned around and then went back up the stairsSound familiarThats clinging to habits and practices the third way in which we feed on the aggregatesWhen we stay stuck on our habits and practices were listening to our inner gooseThe fourth way of feeding on the aggregates is through our ideas about what the self is and whether it exists or notAs we saw last night when we cling to ideas of what we are we get entangled in all sorts of complicationsNow even though these four ways of clinging cause suffering they do provide some nourishment some strength to the mindOtherwise we wouldnt bother feeding in this wayWe see that the energy put into clinging is repaid by the strength we get from these activitiesBut as is the case with physical food mental food can be either good or bad for youEven though unhealthy food can give you some strength it can also cause you health problems over the long termThe same principle applies to the mindOne way we can think of the path is as health food for the mindWe need this nourishment to give the mind strength for otherwise we wouldnt be able to engage in the fabrication needed for the pathUltimately the path will bring the mind to a level of strength where it no longer needs to feedBut in the meantime we need mental food to develop the strength and stamina needed to bring us to that pointSo the Buddhas strategy is to use some of these forms of clinging in a skillful way as steps on the pathWe have to hold to right viewsWe have to hold to the precepts which are habits and the practice of jhāna right concentration which counts as a practiceWe also need to develop a healthy sense of self which is selfreliant responsible and heedfulSo we need to feed in these three waysAs for clinging to sensuality This is the one type of clinging that has no role on the path but we do require external conditions conducive to training the mindWe need a certain amount of sensory pleasure provided by food clothing shelter medicine and the pleasures of a peaceful quiet place to meditateWere advised not to obsess over these things but if we havent yet gotten to the point where we can maintain our mental center everywhere we have to hold to the principle of searching out surroundings conducive for the practice whenever we canTo wean the mind off its usual habit of feeding on sensuality we have to train it to enjoy the genuine health food provided by the other means of skillful clingingThis is one of the main reasons why we have to feed it with concentrationThe pleasure and rapture of jhāna help provide the sense of wellbeing we need in the here and now to be willing to change our dietAnd the practice of jhāna in turn needs to be well fed with right views and the healthy sense of selfesteem that comes from the habits of generosity and virtueOtherwise we wont be able to endure the difficulties inherent in getting the mind to settle down and stay thereAt the same time as concentration develops it provides an even greater sense of selfesteem which ensures that when you finally do apply the perception of notself to all phenomena in an allaround way you dont do it with neurotic selfhatredThis is an important point because sometimes the teaching on notself is used as an excuse for selfhatredIn other words I dont like myself so Ill deny that my self exists This is not healthyBut when you develop a healthy strength of concentration you understand that youve taken your healthy sense of self as far as it can goAt that point youre ready for the next step in spiritual maturityYou let go for the sake of greater healthIts only then that you no longer need to feedBut as long as the mind is on the path it needs to feed in a discerning way on views habits practices and a healthy sense of selfAnd as I already mentioned the five aggregates are what we feed onThis means that we have to learn to feed on the aggregates in such a way that they become factors of the pathFor instance the second form of skillful feeding the practice of right concentration involves all five aggregates as we noted last nightThe first form of skillful feeding the development of discernment in right view and right resolve requires the aggregates of perception and fabricationSo in this way we use the clingingaggregates as steps on the pathThe purpose of this is to develop five strengths in the mind conviction persistence mindfulness concentration and discernmentThese are the inner strengths that will bring the mind to the point where it no longer needs to feedAs we develop a healthy sense of self to feed these strengths we gain practical insight into how we create our sense of selfWe also gain insight into our intentionsThe Buddha is especially interested in having us understand the role of our sense of self as the agent that exerts control over our actionsThis relates to his teaching on the role of kamma in the present momentOur experience of the present moment is composed of three sorts of things the results of past actions present actions and the results of present actionsWe have no control over the results of past actions but we do have some freedom  some element of control  in our choice of our present actionsThe question of exactly how much control and how much freedom is something that we can discover only by trying to act as skillfully as we can with each momentThis is why the topic of skillful action is one of the Buddhas most basic teachingsWe focus on learning more and more about the potentials and limitations of the freedom we have in the present moment because that is the area of awareness where the opening to ultimate freedom will be foundNow ultimate freedom is not the same as freedom of choiceIts a freedom from suffering thats totally unconditioned totally beyond space and time and so has nothing to do with questions of control or no controlIts just thereBut you can find it only by exploring what freedom you have to act skillfullyThis is why the Buddha doesnt encourage thoughts about essential nature about what you are or arent and whether thats good or badHes more interested in having you see the level of freedom you can exercise around your choices in the present momentIn other words hes not interested in having you speculate about what the self is or isnt hes interested instead in having you watch how you define yourself with each action in the presentThats because the line between self and notself is determined by what you can and cannot controlThe more precisely you see that line the closer you are to finding the true freedom where questions of control or no control no longer matterThis is another reason why the Buddha has us develop mindfulness and concentration together because you need both of these strengths acting together to observe the action of creating a sense of self or notself around that line between control and noncontrolMindfulness is what keeps remembering where to stay focused and what to keep doing to abandon whats unskillful and to develop whats skillfulConcentration is what maintains the steadiness of your gazeSo its only through clinging to the practice of the path that you can find the line between control and noncontrol and can observe it closelyIts only through healthy clinging that you reach the point where you can really let go and be freeIts as if youre a bird in a cageOne wall of the cage is a doorIf you cling to the other walls you stay stuck in the cageBut if you cling to the door then when the door is open you can fly awayIn the same way you cling to the pathWhen the path comes together it leads to the opening where you gain freedomThe door swings open and youre free to fly wherever you wantIn the words of the Dhammapada when youve reached that point your path  like that of birds through space  cant be tracedYoure so free that you leave no footprints in the skyLast night we talked about the reasons why its important to develop a skillful sense of self on the pathTonight well talk about the Buddhas instructions in how to do it and the lessons we learn from doing it wellThe self strategy that the Buddha recommends using along the path derives from the question at the basis of discernment What when I do it will lead to my longterm welfare and happiness This question contains two ideas of selfThe first is the idea of the self as agent the producer of happiness the second is the idea of the self as the consumer of happinessWhen the question says What when I do it the I here in I do it is the self as producerThe my in my longterm welfare and happiness is the self as consumer of happinessThe idea of the self as agent also introduces the element of control which the Buddha says is essential to any idea of selfThis was the point he made at the very beginning of his first discussion of notself If you have no real control over something how can you say that its you or yoursIts only through the relative element of control you have over some of the aggregates that you can identify with them to begin withNow the Buddha has us use both the idea of self as producer and the idea of self as consumer as part of our motivation for practiceFor example concerning the self as producer theres a passage where Vennanda tells a nun that even though we practice to put an end to conceit its only through a certain kind of conceit that we can actually practiceThe conceit hes referring to is the conceit implicit in the idea If others can do this so can I This relates to our confidence  as producers of action  that we are competent to learn how to do things correctly and skillfullyThis healthy sense of I gives us confidence that we can handle the pathWithout it we wouldnt be able to attempt the path at allThe Buddha also teaches us to use the idea of self as consumer as motivation for the pathTheres a passage in the Canon where hes apparently talking about a monk whos getting discouraged on the path and is thinking about going back to his lay lifeEssentially he recommends that a monk in that situation ask himself Do you really love yourselfAre you going to content yourself simply with the food clothing shelter and medicine of lay life even though this means staying in the cycle of birth aging illness and deathOr would you really like to put an end to suffering The implication here is that if you really love yourself you should try to put an end to sufferingYou should care for the self thats going to be consuming the results of your actionsSo what should the self as producer do to show genuine goodwill for the self as consumerThe traditional answers for the Buddhas question  What when I do it will lead to my longterm welfare and happiness  fall into two classesThe first class gives specific dos and dontsThe second class gives advice on how to determine for yourself whats the most skillful thing to do in a given situationIn the first class there are the practices called acts of merit generosity virtue and the development of goodwillEach of these practices fosters a healthy sense of selfWhen the Buddha teaches generosity he emphasizes the fact that youre free to giveIn fact when a king once asked him Who should I give things to the king expected that the Buddha would say Give to me and my disciples Instead the Buddha said Give wherever you feel inspired In other words he encouraged the king to practice generosity as a way of exercising his freedom to chooseThe act of generosity is one of the first ways we realize that we do have freedom of choiceWhen you were a child the first time you realized you had that freedom was when you gave away something you didnt need to giveIt wasnt on a holiday or somebodys birthday where you had to give somethingIt was when of your own accord you wanted to make a gift of something that was yoursA strong sense of wellbeing and selfworth came from that choiceWhen youre forced to give theres no special sense of selfworthBut if you give when theres no compulsion it gives rise to a sense of selfesteem Youre not just a slave to your appetitesYou have the noble heart thats willing to share pleasure with othersSimilarly with the practice of virtue such as observing the five precepts or avoiding the ten courses of unskillful action When you realize that there are ways that you could get away with harming someone but you choose not to it gives rise to a very strong sense of selfworthWhen youre tempted to do something thats unskillful but you learn how to say No to that temptation you realize again that youre not a slave to your defilementsThis is how the practice of virtue develops skill in learning to deal with addictive behaviorFor example suppose that you feel tempted to do something and you try to say No part of the mind will say Well youre going to say Yes in five minutes so why not say Yes now You learn how to say No Im not going to fall for that trickWhat I do in five minutes is not my responsibility right nowMy responsibility is what I do right now If you keep this up you learn how to deal with all the tricks that the mind has to fool itselfThis gives rise to a sense of competence and selfworthIt also gives you a lesson in the existence of choice which is an important element on the pathMeditation on goodwill also gives rise to a sense of great wellbeing and selfworthOn the one hand it reminds you that you do deserve to find true happinessI dont know about France but in America many people say that they have trouble feeling goodwill for themselvesThey dont feel worthy of true happinessIf you have that attitude it saps the strength you need to follow the pathBut if you can remind yourself that true happiness isnt selfish or selfindulgent  it doesnt harm anyone and it also puts you in a better position to help other people  this gives you a healthy motivation to practiceOn the other hand the ability to extend thoughts of goodwill to large numbers of people even those you dont like creates a spacious sense of your own nobility  the nobility that comes from not carrying grudges or playing favoritesAll of these ways of practice give training in being more skillful and more mature in how you create your sense of I and mine At the same time they give you practice in learning how to disidentify with less skillful intentions such the desire to be stingy hurtful or meanIn this way youre gaining practice in developing the perceptions of self and notself in a skillful wayNow the Buddha realized that simply giving instructions in generosity virtue and meditation would not cover every situation in lifeIts important that you also learn the skills to judge for yourself what is skillful in the areas where clearcut rules dont apply or two good general principles would pull you in opposite directionsSo he also gave instructions on how to train yourself to judge situations wisely for yourselfIll give an illustration of this principleIf you ever go to Alaska youll discover that there are bearsMost of the people who encounter bears in Alaska have no previous experience with bearsThey dont understand bears habits or the etiquette of bearsBears do have their etiquette you knowSo in order to train strangers in how to deal with bears the Alaskan government used to post big signs around the state entitled Bear Awareness Its joke in English that doesnt work in French because the word bear in bear awareness can also be bare The signs listed ten points to remember when encountering bearsI cant remember all ten but the first nine gave specific dos and dontsFor example if you see a bear do not run awayEven if the bear runs at you do not run offInstead raise your hands so that you look large to the bear  bears have very poor eyesight  and stand your groundAt the same time speak to the bear in a calm reassuring voice to let the bear know that you mean it no harmIf the bear attacks you lie down and play deadUsually the bear will lose interest and walk awayThat was as far as the specific instructions took youThen the sign told you that theres a situation where it couldnt tell you what to do  which is if the bear starts to chew on you  because the bear may have two different intentionsOne it simply may be curious to see if you really are deadThe other is if the bear is hungrySo while youre lying there with the bear nibbling on you you have to decide which is the bears motivationIf the bear is simply nibbling out of curiosity continue to play dead the bear will lose interest and walk awayHowever if the bear is hungry fight for all of your lifePoke your finger in its eyes and do whatever else you can think of to scare it awayNow to decide the bears motivation in a situation like that requires a lot of mindfulness and alertnessIn the same way as youre facing your daytoday life there will be areas where the Buddhas instructions on generosity virtue and goodwill give clear guidance and areas where they dontIn areas where they dont you have to develop your own mindfulness alertness and many other skillful qualities to determine the right thing to doThis principle is so important that it was the first thing the Buddha taught to his sonWhat do you think Rāhula What is a mirror forFor reflection sirIn the same way Rāhula bodily actions verbal actions  mental actions are to be done with repeated reflectionWhenever you want to perform a bodily action you should reflect on it This bodily action I want to perform  would it lead to selfaffliction to the affliction of others or to bothIs it an unskillful bodily action with painful consequences painful results If on reflection you know that it would lead to selfaffliction to the affliction of others or to both it would be an unskillful bodily action with painful consequences painful results then any bodily action of that sort is absolutely unfit for you to doBut if on reflection you know that it would not cause affliction it would be a skillful bodily action with happy consequences happy results then any bodily act of that sort is fit for you to doWhile you are performing a bodily action you should reflect on it This bodily action I am doing  is it leading to selfaffliction to the affliction of others or to bothIs it an unskillful bodily action with painful consequences painful results If on reflection you know that it is leading to selfaffliction to affliction of others or both you should give it upBut if on reflection you know that it is not you may continue with itHaving performed a bodily action you should reflect on it If on reflection you know that it led to selfaffliction to the affliction of others or to both it was an unskillful bodily action with painful consequences painful results then you should confess it reveal it lay it open to the Teacher or to a knowledgeable companion in the holy lifeHaving confessed it you should exercise restraint in the futureBut if on reflection you know that it did not lead to affliction it was a skillful bodily action with happy consequences happy results then you should stay mentally refreshed  joyful training day  night in skillful mental qualitiesHaving performed a mental action you should reflect on it If on reflection you know that it led to selfaffliction to the affliction of others or to both it was an unskillful mental action with painful consequences painful results then you should feel distressed ashamed  disgusted with itFeeling distressed you should exercise restraint in the futureBut if on reflection you know that it did not lead to affliction it was a skillful mental action with happy consequences happy results then you should stay mentally refreshed  joyful training day  night in skillful mental qualitiesRāhula all those contemplatives  brahmans in the course of the past who purified their bodily actions verbal actions  mental actions did it through repeated reflection on their bodily actions verbal actions  mental actions in just this wayAll those contemplatives  brahmans in the course of the future who will purify their bodily actions verbal actions  mental actions will do it through repeated reflection on their bodily actions verbal actions  mental actions in just this wayAll those contemplatives  brahmans at present who purify their bodily actions verbal actions  mental actions do it through repeated reflection on their bodily actions verbal actions  mental actions in just this wayThus Rāhula you should train yourself I will purify my bodily actions through repeated reflectionI will purify my verbal actions through repeated reflectionI will purify my mental actions through repeated reflection Thats how you should train yourselfNotice the qualities of heart and mind that are developed by this kind of practiceFirst it teaches you to be observant  and in particular to be observant of your own actions their motivation and their results  because this is one area where we tend to engage in a lot of denialThe area of our motivations our actions and their results is the first area where we learn denial when were children  as when we might have said It was already broken when I lay down on it The Buddha here is teaching you not to develop that attitudeIf you actually broke it by stepping on it you should admit that you were the one who broke itThe Buddhas instructions here also teach you to have a healthy attitude toward your mistakes what we would call a healthy sense of shame one that comes with a high sense of selfesteemYoure not ashamed of yourself as a person but you are ashamed of any of your actions that have caused harm because you regard them as beneath youThis healthy shame is actually very helpful on the path because it enables you to see your mistakes as mistakes and it makes you want to stop making them the first steps in being able to learn from themThe Buddhas instructions also teach other healthy attitudesFor example compassion You want to make sure that your actions harm no oneTruthfulness If you make a mistake you should be willing to admit it to other peopleIntegrity Take responsibility for your actionsIn particular however the Buddhas instructions here teach the most skillful sense of self to help you on the path a self thats always willing to learnIf your sense of pride or selfworth is built on the idea that youre already good youll have trouble learning and trouble admitting mistakesBut if your pride or selfworth is built on the idea that youre always willing to learn then it opens many possibilities for developing more skillIts the best kind of pride there is the most useful basis for skillful Imaking and mymakingThis is the kind of pride that can use a sense of shame integrity and all the other attitudes the Buddha is teaching here as means to negotiate with your less skillful selves the less skillful members of the committee and win them over to the path to true happinessIn the factors of the path this comes under right effort the ability to generate desire within yourself to do the right thingFinally these instructions teach an important lesson about happiness that it is possible to find a happiness that also offers happiness to othersIn other words your happiness does not have to depend on the pain of othersIf its gained through generosity virtue and goodwill it actually fosters their happiness tooIn this way you learn not to draw a sharp line between your happiness and the happiness of those around youAnd as a result you focus less on the word my in my happiness and take more interest in trying to master cause and effect what actions actually cause happiness both for yourself and for those around youIn this way the sense of self fades into the background and your sensitivity to cause and effect comes more to the foreThis is what enables you to get more and more skillful on the path  so that when bears attack you youll be able to tell whether theyre eating you out of curiosity or out of hungerAnd that way you can deal skillfully with any situation you encounter on the pathLast night we discussed some of the traditional ways in which the Buddha taught a skillful sense of self  the self as the agent or producer of happiness and the self as the consumer of happiness  through the development of generosity virtue and meditation on goodwillWe also talked about some of the qualities the Buddha recommends for skillfully negotiating with the less skillful members of the minds committee and motivating them to do the right thingTonights talk approaches the same topics from a slightly different angle looking at them in terms of what modern psychology has to say about mature ego functioningSometimes you hear that the Buddhas teaching on notself is a teaching on nonegoThis is actually a misunderstanding and it has two unfortunate consequencesThe first is that for those who like the idea of nonego it becomes an excuse for selfhatred and for the practice of spiritual bypassingAn example of spiritual bypassing is this Suppose you have troubles in your life and you dont want to engage in the difficult business of trying to become more mature in dealing with others or negotiating the conflicting desires in your own mindInstead you simply go and meditate you do prostrations you do chanting and you hope that those practices will magically make the problems in your life go awayThis is called spiritual bypassing  an unskillful way of clinging to habits and practicesAs you can imagine its not very healthy  and not very effectivePeople often come back from meditation retreats and they still have the same problems they had beforeThe other problem in thinking that Buddhism teaches nonego is that those who understand the healthy functions of the ego believe that Buddhism lacks a proper appreciation of these functionsThey think that Buddhist teachings are incomplete and need help from Western psychology in order to become a complete training of the mindActually the Buddhas teachings contain all the elements of healthy ego functioningEven the notself teaching is treated by the Buddha as a type of healthy ego functioningTo explain these points Id first like to touch a little bit on Freuds teaching on the egoFreud divided mental functions into three typesThe first is the idId functions are basically your brute wants and desires for pleasureThe second mental function is what he called the superegoSuperego functions are basically your ideas about what you should do  the duties you believe you ought to fulfillThese are usually ideas youve picked up from society around you your parents your teachers your schools your churchNow in Freuds belief there is always going to be a conflict between these two types of functionsAnd if you were to give in totally to either id functions or superego functions you would dieAt the same time theres an inevitable conflict between your id and the id of everyone around youSo in order to survive you need a third type of mental function ego functions which try to negotiate as best as possible between these two other incompatible functions  between what you want to do and what you believe society or God or whatever demands of youNow the Buddhas teachings on the functions of the mind differ from Freuds in several waysYou have to remember that when Freud was practicing in nineteenth century Europe most of his patients had very unfriendly superegos because their ideas about what they should do had very little to do with their own happinessThese ideas mostly took the form of commands from a demanding competitive society or from God who could be very arbitrary and harshBut in the Buddhas teaching every idea about what you should do depends on your desire for happinessThe Buddha was not the sort of person who simply saddled you with commandments about what you should and shouldnt doInstead he placed a condition on his shouldsHe said that if you want true happiness this is what you need to do based on how cause and effect workThe duties he teaches are the duties in the four noble truths to comprehend suffering to abandon its cause to realize the cessation and to develop the path to that cessationThese are friendly duties because they aim at your genuine happinessThis changes the dynamic in the mindTo follow the Buddhas version of the superego would not kill youAs a result ego functioning in the Buddhas picture is not just a series of defense mechanisms for survivalIts actually the part of the mind that strategizes for longterm happiness to figure out ways to get the id to listen to a superego thats been trained to be genuinely wiseRemember that question that we asked earlier in the retreat What when I do it will lead to longterm welfare and happiness This is the question that informs both superego and ego functioning enabling them to work together in a friendly wayAnother difference between the Buddhas teachings and Freuds is that the Buddha sees less inherent conflict between the needs of the id and the needs of the superegoAs he says your true happiness doesnt need to conflict with the true happiness of society at largeAlso unlike Freud the Buddha doesnt necessarily believe in brute irrational desireEach desire comes with its own reasoningAnd although its reasoning may be weak and faulty it nevertheless aims at happinessAt the same time each reason of the mind is associated with its own desire which is also aimed at happinessTherefore there is no clear distinction between reason and desireAnd because every desire is aimed at happiness there is a common ground where all desires can begin to negotiate to sort out which ones are more or less skillful in achieving their common aimThis means that from the Buddhist point of view the functions that Freud labeled as id ego and superego are different ways of defining your strategies for happinessEach is a different sort of self The id is a foolish self thats very shortsightedThe superego is the wise self that looks for longterm happinessAnd the ego is the negotiating self that tries to train the id to reason with it so that itll be willing to listen to the wise superegoWhen these functions are brought together in a skillful way then  for example  the practice of generosity virtue and meditation brings a happiness that doesnt create clear boundaries between you and other peopleEveryone benefits when you follow these strategiesIn the Buddhas eyes one of the reasons that genuine happiness is genuine is because it doesnt need to take anything away from anyone else and can actually help contribute to other peoples happiness tooThose are the differencesAs for the similarities from the Freudian point of view there are five healthy ego functions suppression sublimation anticipation altruism and humorAs I explain each of these Ill show the ways in which the Buddha teaches all five as wellThe first one is suppressionSuppression is when you realize that a desire is unhealthy or unskillful and you learn how to say No to itThis is different from repressionIn repression you deny that you have the desire to begin withIn suppression you know you have the desire but you simply learn how to say NoIn the Buddhas teachings this principle is similar to restraintTheres a famous passage in the Dhammapada where the Buddha says that if you see a greater happiness that comes from abandoning a lesser happiness you should be willing to let go of the lesser happiness in order to gain the greater happinessThis sounds very simple and commonsensical but its not easy to practice and many people even resist the idea of practicing itI have a friend who writes novels and teaches at a universityEvery time she writes a new novel shes invited to read passages from her new novel at some of the universitys alumni clubsSo each time she has to choose a selfcontained story from the novel to read to these groupsIn her last novel the story she chose was about a young woman in th century ChinaThe womans mother had died and the father had promised that he would not remarryBut you know how fathers areAfter two years he did remarryNot only that he married a courtesanNow the courtesan was very intelligent and she wanted to be a good stepmother to the girlOne night they were playing chessAs they were playing the stepmother was also using the occasion to teach the daughter an important lesson in lifeThe lesson was this If you want true happiness in life you have to decide that theres one thing you want more than anything else and that youre willing to sacrifice everything else for that one thingOf course the daughter was half listening and half not listening as children often do to lessons like these but she began to notice that her stepmother was a sloppy chess player losing pieces all over the chessboardSo the daughter became more aggressive in her gameWell it turned out that the stepmother had done this as a trap and soon checkmateThe stepmother wonAnd of course the way she played chess was illustrating the lesson she was trying to teach the daughter You have to sacrifice some of your pieces in order to winMy friend read this story to three different groups and then had to stopNobody liked the storyNow maybe this tells you something about the attitudes of modern consumer culture but I think that its also a general human characteristicWe want to win at chess and keep all our piecesThat is not a healthy ego functionThe wisdom of suppression lies in realizing this that you have to sacrifice some things in order to gain what you really wantAnd this is what the Buddha teaches in restraintIf you see that any actions are unskillful you learn how to avoid them for the sake of a greater happinessIts a tradeThats the first healthy ego functionThe second one is sublimationThis is where when you realize that you have an unhealthy or an unskillful desire for happiness you dont just suppress itYou replace it with a more skillful way of finding happinessThis in the Buddhas teaching is precisely what concentration practice is aboutIf you can learn how to develop a sense of wellbeing refreshment and pleasure right here and now simply by focusing on your breath you find it much easier to let go of unskillful desires for happinessThats the second healthy ego functionThe third is anticipationAnticipation is when you see future dangers and you prepare for themThe Buddha also teaches this principle in his teaching on the importance of heedfulness which is essentially a teaching that your actions do matterThere are dangers in life not only outside but also inside the mindBut you can also train the mind to act in a way that avoids those dangersAs the Buddha says a strong sense of heedfulness is what underlies all skillful behaviorNotice He doesnt say that our behavior is good because were innately goodHe says we behave well when were heedfulWe sense the dangers in life and we do what we can to avoid themThats the third healthy ego functioningThe fourth is altruism which is the realization that you cannot look only for your own happiness but that your happiness has to also depend to some extent on the happiness of othersThis principle in Buddhism is called compassionTheres a story from the Canon that shows how this quality is derived from heedfulnessOne evening King Pasenadi is alone in his bedroom with his queen MallikāAt a tender moment the king turns to the queen and asks her Is there anyone you love more than yourself Now you know what the king is thinkingHe wants the queen to say Yes your majesty I love you more than I love myself And if this were a Hollywood movie thats what she would sayBut this is not HollywoodThis is the Pali CanonThe queen says NoTheres no one I love more than myselfAnd how about youIs there anyone you love more than yourself And the king has to admit Well no Thats the end of the sceneThe king leaves the palace and goes to see the Buddha to tell him what happened and the Buddha says The queen is rightYou can search the entire world and you will never find anyone you love more than yourselfIn the same way all other beings love themselves fiercely But the conclusion the Buddha draws from this is interestingHe doesnt cite this as an excuse for selfishnessInstead he uses it as a rationale for compassionHe says that because all beings love themselves so fiercely if you really want happiness then you shouldnt harm others because otherwise your happiness wont lastThere are two principles behind his reasoning hereOne is that if your happiness depends on other peoples suffering they wont stand for itTheyll try to destroy your happiness whenever they get the chanceSecond the principle of sympathy If you see that your own happiness depends on other peoples suffering deep in your heart you cant really be happySo this is the basis for compassionThats the fourth healthy ego functionThe fifth healthy ego function is humorThe Buddha doesnt talk explicitly about this topic but there are many stories in the Canon that show his good sense of humorIll tell you two of themThe first is a story told by the Buddha concerning a monk who gains a vision of devas while meditatingThe monk asks them Do you know where the end of the physical universe is And the devas say No we dont know but there is a higher level of devasMaybe they know So the monk continues meditating and he gets to the next level of devasHe asks them the same question and he gets the same answer Theres a higher levelMaybe they know This goes on for ten levels or soFinally the last level of devas say No we dont know the end of the physical universe but there is the Great BrahmaHe must knowIf you meditate hard you may get to see himThe monk continues meditating until the Great Brahma appears in a flash of lightHe asks his question of the Great Brahma and the Great Brahma responds I monk am Brahma the Great Brahma the Conqueror the Unconquered the AllSeeing AllPowerful the Sovereign Lord the Maker Creator Chief Appointer and Ruler Father of All That Have Been and Shall Be Now if this were the book of Job the monk would say I understand But again this is the Pali CanonThe monk says Thats not what I asked youI asked you where the end of the physical universe is Again the Great Brahma says I monk am Brahma the Great Brahma etcThree timesFinally the Great Brahma pulls the monk aside by the arm and says Look I dont know but I have all of these devas in my entourage who believe that I know everythingThey would be very disillusioned if they learned that I cant answer your question So he sends the monk back to the Buddha who answers the question after rephrasing it pointing to where the physical universe has no footing in the mindThats one example of the Buddhas humor in the CanonAnother example concerns a monk Sāgata who had great psychic powerOne day he did battle with a great firebreathing serpent and wonHe ended up capturing the serpent in his bowlPeople heard about this and were very impressedThey wanted to give him a very special gift so they went to ask a group of monks What is something that monks dont usually get But they asked the wrong group of monksThese monks said We dont usually get hard liquor So the next morning all the laypeople in the city prepared liquor for SāgataAfter drinking hard liquor at every house he passed out at the city gateThe Buddha came along with a group of monks saw Sāgata and told the monks to pick him up and take him back to the monasteryThey laid him down on the ground with his head to the Buddha and his feet in the other directionNow Sāgata didnt know where he was so he started turning around back and forth back and forth until finally his feet were pointed at the BuddhaThe Buddha asked the monks Before didnt he show respect to us And the monks said Yes Is he showing respect now No And before didnt he do battle with a firebreathing serpent Yes Could he do battle with a salamander now No This is why we have a rule against drinking alcoholMost of the humorous stories in the Canon are found in the Vinaya the section explaining the rules for the monksI think this is very importantIt shows a very humane approach to moralityIf you live under a group of rules that lacks a sense of humor it can be very oppressiveThose rules can be very difficult to follow while maintaining a sense of reasonable and intelligent selfrespectBut when a sense of morality is based on a wise sense of humor it reveals an understanding of the foibles of human nature and the rules are easier to follow with dignityThis is why humor is a healthy ego functionIf you can laugh at yourself in a goodnatured way its a lot easier to drop your old unskillful habits without any selfrecriminationThat makes it a lot easier to practiceSo as we can see the Buddha teaches all the five types of healthy ego functioningThis means that we cannot say that he is teaching nonego or egolessnessIn fact these teachings on these five qualities are another way in which he teaches a healthy sense of selfWe can also see that these teachings on developing a healthy ego include some of the basic virtues of the Buddha  discernment compassion and purity the discernment in anticipation sublimation and humor the compassion in altruism and the purity in suppressionIn this way these three qualities of the Buddha come from healthy ego functioning in the intelligent pursuit of happinessUnlike some religious teachers the Buddha doesnt encourage you to feel ashamed of your desire for happiness or to deny itInstead he shows you how to train that desire so that it leads to true happiness and develops noble qualities of heart and mind along the wayHe shows you how your ego can become wise compassionate and pureEven the perception of notself if we apply it the right way is a healthy ego functionRemember were not trying to let go of our sense of self because we hate it for that would encourage a form of neurosisWere letting it go because weve come to understand through developing our skills on the path both the uses and the limitations of healthy perceptions of selfWere letting go to find a higher level of happiness  which is what healthy ego functioning is all aboutThe Buddha himself makes the point that the notself perception is to be used for the sake of happinessMonks do you see any clinging in the form of a doctrine of self which when you cling to it there would not arise sorrow lamentation pain grief and despairAnd the monks respond No LordAnd the Buddha says Neither do What do you think if a person were to gather or to burn or do as he likes with the grass twigs branches and leaves here in Jetas Grove would the thought occur to you Its us that this person is gathering burning or doing with as he likesThe monks say No LordWhy is thatBecause those things are not our self nor do they pertain to our selfAnd then the Buddha says Even so monks whatever is not yours let go of itYour letting go of it will be for your longterm welfare  happinessWhat is not yoursForm is not yoursLet go of itYour letting go of it will be for your longterm welfare  happinessFeeling is not yoursLet go of itPerception is not yoursLet go of itFabrications are not yoursLet go of themConsciousness is not yoursLet go of itYour letting go of it will be for your longterm welfare  happinessThis is a healthy and fruitful application of the perception of notself the topic were going to take up tomorrowFor the past three days weve been talking about a skillful perception of selfTonight and tomorrow night well be talking about the skillful perception of notselfThese two perceptions actually go together because when you develop healthy self perceptions they help to ensure that you use notself perceptions in a healthy and mature wayYoure not depriving yourself of your means for finding happinessYoure actually adding a new set of strategies that can help you find greater happinessYou realize that certain things lie beyond your control and that through accepting that fact and letting go of your identification with those things you can find happiness more easily and effectivelyAs the Buddha indicated in the passage we ended with last night we already have experience in applying the perception of notself to everyday experienceIf you see people burning leaves and twigs and you know that those leaves and twigs dont belong to you you dont get upsetIn fact if you think back to your childhood you realize that the perception of notself is something youve been developing all along and for this very reason It aids in your pursuit of happinessThe times when you learned that something was not under your control and you accepted the fact that it was futile to try to control it That enabled you to let it go as notself as not yours so that you could focus your efforts in areas where you could exert controlFor example if one of your toys got broken and couldnt be fixed you learned that you could be happier if you stopped carrying it around and instead focused your attention on the toys that were still in goodenough shape to play withIn this way the perception of notself is the other side of the coin of the perception of selfOnce you define self you draw a boundary around self what lies outside of that boundary is notselfIf you do this skillfully it can focus your attention on the areas where your efforts can bear fruit and can help you avoid trying to control things that you cantThe general difficulty here is that some things lie to some extent under your control but not totallyThere are also things that once were under your control but now no longer are  for example as in a relationship that has diedAnother difficulty is when you feel a need for something even though you cant control it  as in a relationship thats very unstableThat sort of thing is difficult to accept as notselfNow these difficulties are made easier when you talk with other people who help you realize that these limits on your control are normal for everyoneIn other words theres nothing particularly wrong with youThe other way of making this process easier is to find something else to controlFor example when one relationship dies you find another oneStill we have the problem that sometimes we listen to the wrong people who encourage us to try to control things that we really cannot control perhaps through magical thinkingMagical thinking is the belief that something can be made good simply through the power of your thought or through the power of a ritual practiceAnother frequently unskillful way to try to control things is through prayerAs the Buddha once said if prayer really worked there would be no poor people in the world no ugly people in the world no untimely deathsThe other extreme is when other people encourage you to give up exerting any control over anything at allThey tell you to try not to have desire for anything just accept everything as it is and be content that thats all you can doThis of course makes it impossible to practice the pathYou simply try to clone awakening You hear that an awakened person has no desire so you tell yourself to have no desire an awakened person has no preferences so you tell yourself to have no preferencesThis is twisting the horns of a cow in trying to get milk and seeing that no milk is coming out so you say Oh well there must be no way of getting milk because Ive been twisting the horn for a long timeSo I should just accept the fact that milk is unattainableThats an unskillful use of the notself perceptionThe Buddhas strategy in using the perception of notself is to train you to understand accurately what does lie under your control and what doesnt abandoning what doesnt and then using what level of control you do have in a skillful direction so that you can ultimately put an end to sufferingNow just as there are two levels of right view  right view aimed at a happy rebirth and right view aimed at gaining total release  there are two levels in the Buddhas strategy in skillfully using the perception of notselfTonight well talk about the first level  the skillful notself perceptions that will result in a happy rebirth  and well discuss the second level tomorrowSome Western people have trouble with the teaching on rebirth but usually thats because we dont know how to use the teaching skillfullyTo begin with its important to understand that in teaching rebirth the Buddha was not just adopting a cultural assumption from his timeRebirth was a hot topic in ancient IndiaSome people argued that it did happen others argued very strongly that it didnt with the argument centering around how you defined what a person was and then showing how what you were could or couldnt take birthSo when the Buddha was teaching rebirth he was consciously taking sides on the issueBut he did it in a novel wayInstead of trying to define what does or doesnt take rebirth  things you cant even see  he talked about rebirth as a process that happens through clinging and craving mental actions you can observe and can exert some control overNow the Buddha never said that he could prove rebirth but he did say that its a useful working hypothesis  and for two reasonsOne is that the practice will ultimately confirm that it is true and second that its useful for fostering skillful attitudes that help in developing the pathThe idea of repeated rebirth might seem to be an extreme example of creating a large sense of selfAfter all theres a lot of I in thinking If Im going to survive death I should plan for how and where Im going to be reborn However the act of assuming rebirth is also an important lesson in notself because you cant assume that you can take everything with youTheres a lot of whats currently you and yours that youre going to have to leave behindSo you have to focus carefully on learning what you can and cant take with youThe things you cant take with you you have to let go as notselfThis forces you to take a long hard look at what in this lifetime will be of value not only now but also after you dieThis realization also forces heedfulnessYour only guarantee of a safe rebirth is when youve had your first taste of awakeningAs long as you havent yet had that taste your old kamma can drag you down to the lower realms at any timeSo you have to develop a sense of urgency in the practice if you really want to find a happiness thats secureYou have to be prepared to go at any momentAjaan Lee often compared the process of preparing for rebirth to the process of preparing for a trip  or for a sudden forced emigrationYou need to know whats good to take with you and whats best left behind and keep the things youll really need close at handAs when you go camping If you try to take too many things you weigh yourself downIf you dont take enough you starve and suffer other hardshipsSo you have to know what you really needA story about Ajaan Lee illustrates this pointOnce he was going to take a number of his students  both lay people and monks  on a trip into the forestThey were going to meet at the main train station in Bangkok take the train up to Lopburi and then go into the forest from thereNow Ajaan Fuang went along on the trip and he knew that if you went with Ajaan Lee you had to take as little as possible so he packed only a very small bagBut many of the other students didnt know thisSome of them brought three or four bags and large ones at thatPerhaps they thought they would hire porters in Lopburi to carry them into the forestAt any rate when they got to Hua Lampong the main station in Bangkok Ajaan Lee saw all of the bags that everyone had brought so instead of getting on the train he started walking up the train tracksNow if the ajaan is walking on the tracks everyone else has to walk on the tracksSo very quickly people started walking behind him struggling to carry all their bagsAfter a while many of them started complaining that the bags were too heavyAt first Ajaan Lee said nothing and just kept walkingAfter a while as the complaints got more insistent all he said was If its heavy throw it awaySo one by one the students stopped to sort out their bagsWhatever they really needed they put in one bagAnd as for the remaining bags they threw them into the lotus ponds on either side of the tracksWhen they got to the railroad station at Saam Sen which is the next railroad station north of Hua Lampong Ajaan Lee saw that everybodys bags were small and manageable so he let them all get on the trainIn this way he taught them an important lesson that you have to be very careful and selective about what you try to take with youAnd what can you take with youTwo thingsOne is your actions the other is the qualities of the mindTraditionally there are seven treasures you can take with you conviction virtue shame compunction learning the Dhamma generosity and discernmentThese are inner treasures that can carry over into the next lifeThink again of going on a camping tripOne way of keeping your baggage light is by having lots of skills knowing how to find what you need in the forest how to forage for food how to start a fire without matches how to build a shelter if you dont have a tentIn the same way by developing these seven inner treasures you take skills with you  skills you can use  and you dont have to load yourself downThe Canon gives other lists of qualities you can take with you as well such as the ten perfections generosity virtue renunciation discernment persistence endurance truth determination goodwill and equanimityNotice that these lists contain the basic acts of merit generosity virtue and the development of goodwillAs we have already noted each of these meritorious actions gives lessons in developing a skillful sense of selfAt the same time each also gives practice in developing a skillful sense of notself for each involves giving up something of lesser worth for the sake of something of greater worthEach requires that you see the things of lesser worth as notselfFor instance the Buddha recommends seeing generosity as a tradeEvery time you give you gain something in returnYou gain a higher state of mind the respect of others a sense of fellowship with the people around you and a more spacious sense of your lifeYou learn how to see that the item you give away is not yours and that the quality of mind developed through giving is more worth holding on toThe other forms of meritorious action also teach important lessons in notselfWhen you try to develop virtue youll find voices in the committee of your mind that resist the preceptsYou have to learn how not to identify with them  and how to do it skillfully  as part of developing virtue as a treasure or a perfectionSimilarly with the practice of goodwill You learn to see ill will as something you dont want to identify withAs Ajaan Lee said if you have ill will for someone its like leaving a magnet in the worldItll pull you back to that person when you get rebornSo you want to learn to see thoughts of ill will as notselfTheres another list of teachings that helps you take a longterm view of whats worth identifying with and whats notIts called the eight worldly dhammas wealth loss of wealth status loss of status praise criticism pleasure painThese the Buddha says are basically what the world has to offer  and its not much is itYou notice that they come in pairsIts impossible to have one without the otherIf you try to hold onto your wealth you lose it anyhowIf you try to identify with whatever status you have it makes it difficult when you lose that statusThe same with praise and criticism pleasure and painSo its best not to try to hold on to these things but it is possible to get good use out of them while you have them to use the things you cant take with you as means for developing qualities of mind that you canFor instance take a look at the money in your walletIs your name written on itNo its the name of the governmentThey can take it back whenever they want toIts not really yoursEven with your credit card It may have your name on it but it also has the banks name and we know whos really in charge of itSo while you have that wealth try to make good use of itUse it in a way that gives rise to virtues in the mind such as generosity and goodwillSimilarly with status Try to use the power that comes with status to do good for the worldWhen you suffer loss of wealth and loss of status learn how to take advantage of what they have to offer tooFor example when you lose wealth and status you find out who your true friends areYoure also forced to become more ingenious in making do with littleThis develops your discernment and ingenuityWhen praise comes try to use the praise in a skillful wayRemember that the people praising you are trying to encourage you to keep on doing somethingDont let the praise go to your head thinking that youre already good enough and that you dont have to try to do betterAt the same time though you have to remember that when people praise you they sometimes have ulterior motivesThey may be encouraging you to do something that isnt really right so you have to be carefulAs for criticism if the criticism is true youve learned something important about yourself something that you can learn to correct within yourselfYour faults are easy to hide from yourself which is why the Buddha says that if someone points them out to you think of that person as someone whos pointing out treasureIf the criticism is false youve learned something about the other personIt may not be something you want to learn but its good to knowAjaan Lee also said to watch out for status and praiseOnce you have a high status and people praise you they confine you with their desiresIf on the other hand you have no status and people call you a dog remember that dogs have no lawsThey can go wherever they wantWhat this means is that you learn how to take advantage of all of these things when they come whether theyre good or bad and realize that none of them will last permanentlyYou cant really hold to them as yours you have to see them as notself but if you use them to develop good qualities of the mind youve gotten the best use out of them developing good qualities that you can use in this lifetime and that will carry over after deathYouve made a wise tradeThe Buddha also says that when you learn how to look at gain and loss over the very longterm over many lifetimes it helps you to overcome your attachment both to wealth and to disappointment and griefHe says to remind yourself that you have already experienced extremes of wealth and poverty many times in many different lifetimes so you shouldnt get carried away with whatever wealth you have in this lifetime or jealous of other peoples wealth or upset about whatever poverty you fall intoRealize that material things come and go but the state of your mind is the most important thing you haveThis is how you develop the discernment to deal skillfully with whatever comes your way both in this life and in the nextIn other words the Buddha has you look at life and death over the long term realizing that in order to develop good qualities in the mind you have to abandon your attachments your sense of self around many thingsBut this is a trade a very wise and advantageous tradeYou gain many important skillful mental qualities in returnNow this is not just an exercise in delayed gratification because even in the present moment you gain a healthy sense of self one thats always trying to learn how to do what is skillful always trying to learn from mistakes and always willing to learn how to let go of unhealthy ways of identificationContemplating these facts gives you a sense of empowerment of commandYou can shape the life that you want the life that will give rise to longterm happiness both now and in the futureHowever this contemplation also gives rise to a sense of heedfulnessYou see that you need to be careful in how you order your prioritiesEventually though it gives rise to a sense of disenchantmentYou realize that things like wealth and status praise and pleasure come and go come and go and they begin to lose their allureYou dont want to make them your top priorityThis combined sense of empowerment heedfulness and disenchantment is a healthy combinationOn the one hand the element of empowerment keeps you from trying to take the shortcut of giving up at the beginning of the pathIn other words you dont just say Ill just accept the way things are and not really strive for anything better and try to find peace that way Instead you try to find peace by developing your powers and you discover that a great measure of happiness can be found in this wayYou gain discernment in deciding what is really important in life and what sorts of happiness are more valuable than othersIn this way youre actually pushing against the characteristics of inconstancy stress and notselfYou try to find a sense of happiness that is somewhat constant easeful and to some extent under your controlBut then you run up against the limitations of this sort of activityYou work hard to get good things in life but then to develop generosity you have to give them awayBy following the precepts you gain a good lifetime but even a good lifetime involves aging illness and deathEven heavenly beings have to dieYou also realize that over the long term the comfort that comes from good actions can often lead to heedlessness and complacency People born into good conditions all too easily take them for granted and get lazyThey start abusing their good fortuneSo even the good things in life contain their dangersAnd when you take a longterm view whatever narratives you plan for your next lifetime begin to seem petty because given that theres all that aging illness and death there are going to be many many tearsAs the Buddha once said which do you think is greaterThe tears you have shed over many lifetimes or the water in the oceanAnd the answer is the tearsTheres another sutta that makes a similar point but more graphicallyThe Buddha once asked some monks Which do you think is greaterAll the water in the oceans or the blood you have shed from having your head cut offThink of all the times youve been a cow and you had your head cut offThink of all the times youve been a sheep and had your head cut offAll the times youve been a pig and had your head cut offAll the many times youve been a human being but you were a thief and had your head cut offAll the many times you were a highway robber and had your head cut offThe many times you committed adultery and had your head cut offFor each case the blood is more than all the water in the oceansThe monks who heard this talk all became arahants right awayWhen you think about things like this you start looking for releaseYou see that even the greatest happiness in the realms of rebirth has its limitations and that the only really true happiness is freedomThats when youre ready for the transcendent level of the Buddhas teaching on notselfWhich is what well discuss tomorrow nightLast night we talked about the teaching on notself on the mundane level as it relates to the issue of rebirth and kammaOn this level you apply the perception of notself in a selective wayYou look at the skills you can take with you you figure out what things would prevent you from taking good skills with you and you try to perceive the second set of things as notselfIn this way you can develop the conditions for a good rebirth and the ability to deal with whatever you may encounter as you go through the cycle of death and rebirthBut as you contemplate the issue of rebirth you begin to see that even if you develop good mental qualities the whole process is still very risky and uncertainWhen things get comfortable its very easy to get complacent and to forget to keep working at developing good qualitiesAnd even the best life in the cosmos has to end in separation and deathYouve experienced these sufferings countless times in the past and if you dont gain release from the process of rebirth youll have to endure the same sufferings countless times in the futureWhen this realization goes deeply into the heart youre ready for the transcendent teaching on notselfThats the topic for tonights talkThe transcendent teaching on notself derives from transcendent right view and transcendent right view comes in two stagesThe first stage sees experience in terms of the four noble truths of suffering its origination its cessation and the path of practice leading to its cessationAs you may remember each of these truths carries a duty If you want to put an end to suffering suffering should be comprehended its cause should be abandoned its cessation should be realized and the path to its cessation should be developed as a skillThe purpose of the transcendent teaching on notself is to help you perform each of these dutiesIn the first noble truth the Buddha identifies suffering with the five clingingaggregatesNotice that the aggregates themselves are not sufferingThe mind suffers because it clings to themAs Ive already mentioned clinging is also similar to the process of feedingWe keep doing something again and again  thats the clinging  as a means of finding happiness Thats the feedingA good example of this is an experiment some neurobiologists once did with miceThey located the pleasure center in each mouses brain and planted a little electrode in thereWhen the mice pushed their heads against a little bar the bar would give a mild electric stimulation to the pleasure centerThey got so addicted to pressing their heads against the bar  doing it again and again and again  that they forgot to eat and they diedThey were feeding on a pleasure that was very immediate and intense but provided no nourishmentThats why they diedThe same principle applies to the human mindWe usually feed on the aggregates in a way that provides no real nourishment and so our goodness diesOn the transcendent level of right view the Buddha has us use the perception of notself as a means for comprehending this clinging and feeding to the point where we feel no more passion for itBut his approach is a little indirectAs weve already seen instead of telling you simply to stop feeding on the aggregates he has you turn them into a path the health food that gives strength to the mind to the point where it no longer needs to feedThe primary example of this is the practice of right concentrationAs weve already said right concentration is composed of the five aggregates and the feelings of ease rapture and refreshment that come from right concentration are health food for the mindYou learn through this practice that you can find a sense of happiness that comes from within and you no longer need to go looking for nourishment outsideTo develop this sort of concentration you have to apply the perception of notself in a selective wayYou hold on to your concentration and apply the perception of notself to any distracting thoughts that would pull you away from the object of your concentrationAs you gain skill and maturity in applying this perception in this way it can enable you to let go of many attachments to other lesser forms of happiness that you now realize you no longer need in particular the pleasures of sensualityWhen you realize you no longer need them you find that there was nothing really thereOne of my favorite cartoons shows a group of cows in a pastureOne of the cows is jerking its head up in a sudden state of surprise and realization saying Hey wait a minuteThis is grassWeve been eating grassThe Canon has a similar storyA blind man has been given an old dirty rag and told that its a clean white clothHes very protective of his clean white clothBut then his relatives take him to a doctor and the doctor cures his blindnessHe looks at the cloth and realizes that he was fooled Its just a dirty old ragThe Dhamma point both in the cartoon and in the story is that we often blindly look for pleasure in things that  when we come to our senses  we realize were never all that satisfying to begin withIn some cases the pleasure is actually unhealthy causing you to do things you later regretThe practice of jhāna provides the perspective that allows you to step back from your sensual passions and all your other unskillful ways of looking for pleasure to see that they werent worth the effort put into gaining themThis forces you to step back from the unskillful committee members that push for those ways of looking for pleasure and to ask whether you want to continue associating and identifying with them or notThis process isnt always easyYou tend to identify with those unskillful committee members because you associate them with pleasureBut the practice of jhāna helps make this process of disidentification possibleWhen you can see that  in comparison to the blameless pleasure of jhāna  these other committee members also bring you stress and pain you can more easily regard them as notselfYou can let them goAs the practice of jhāna matures there eventually comes a point when you realize that only one attachment remains blocking unconditioned happiness and thats attachment to the path itself in particular to the practice of concentration and the development of discernmentThis is where the Buddha starts having you apply the transcendent teaching on notself all around and not just selectivelyIn other words you apply the perception of notself to every instance of clinging to the aggregates even to the aggregates that go into jhāna and discernmentThis is how the notself teaching helps you with the duties of comprehending stress and abandoning every form of craving clinging passion or delight that would give rise to stressThe following passage shows the main stages in this processFirst you master the state of jhānaThen you try to develop perceptions that give rise to a sense of dispassion for the jhānaOnce youve developed that sense of dispassion you develop the perception in which you see allaround dispassion and cessation as desirableThen you learn how to drop even that perception and stay right thereThat the Buddha says is where full awakening can occurSuppose that an archer or archers apprentice were to practice on a straw man or mound of clay so that after a while he would become able to shoot long distances to fire accurate shots in rapid succession and to pierce great massesIn the same way there is the case where a monk enters  remains in the first jhāna rapture  pleasure born of seclusion accompanied by directed thought  evaluationHe regards whatever phenomena there that are connected with form feeling perception fabrications  consciousness as inconstant stressful a disease a cancer an arrow painful an affliction alien a disintegration an emptiness notselfHe turns his mind away from those phenomena and having done so inclines his mind to the property of deathlessness This is peace this is exquisite  the resolution of all fabrications the relinquishment of all acquisitions the ending of craving dispassion cessation UnbindingStaying right there he reaches the ending of the fermentationsOr if not then  through this very Dhammapassion this Dhammadelight and from the total wasting away of the first five fetters  he is due to be reborn there to be totally unbound never again to return from that worldA couple of points in this passage need to be explainedFirst When the Buddha talks about the ending of fermentation hes talking about awakeningThe fermentations are the defilements that come bubbling up in the mindSecond  with regard to the second stage where the Buddha says to perceive the aggregates in the jhāna as inconstant stressful etc there are other passages in the Canon that expand on this pointIn these passages the Buddha recommends that you apply three questions derived from the original question that he said was the basis of discernment What when I do it will lead to my longterm welfare and happiness At this point in the practice he recommends looking more closely at the idea of longterm happinessFocus on the word longterm You know that jhāna is a longterm happiness but now you realize that longterm is no longer good enoughIts inconstantThe Pali term here anicca is sometimes translated as impermanent but thats not what it really meansIts opposite nicca describes something thats done constantly and reliablyYou can depend on itBut if something is anicca its unreliableIt waversIf you try to base your happiness on it you have to keep tensing up around it  like trying to find some rest while sitting on a chair with wobbly uneven legsSo when you see that even the longterm happiness of jhāna is inconstant  unreliable and wavering  you realize that its not really all that pleasantEven in what pleasure it does offer there is stressAnd because theres stress why would you want to claim it as yoursThis line of thinking corresponds to the three questions that the Buddha has you ask at this stage in the practiceThe first is Is this constant And the answer is NoThat leads to the next question If its inconstant is it pleasant Again the answer is NoThat leads to the third question If something is inconstant and stressful is it fitting to say that This is me this is myself this is what I am In other words Is it skillful to lay claim to this And the answer again is NoNow notice that the Buddha is not asking you to come to the conclusion that there is no selfHes simply asking you to see if this way of creating a sense of self is skillfulHis method of analysis when its consistently applied to all of the aggregates gives rise to a sense of disenchantment and dispassion for any possible type of clingingBut notice Youre not doing this out of pessimismYoure doing this for the sake of your own true happiness but now its better than longterm longer than longtermYou want something totally timeless and reliableAs that passage just now indicated sometimes this series of questions leads to full awakening but sometimes it doesntIt leads instead to the state of nonreturnNow the level of awakening at nonreturn is not badA group of people once came to see my teacher Ajaan FuangThey had been studying Buddhist philosophy and had heard that he was a good teacher but they didnt know what he taughtSo they came and asked him to teach themHe said OK close your eyes and focus on your breath And they said No no no we cant do that He asked Why And they said If we focus on the breath well get stuck on jhāna and then well be reborn as brahmās And Ajaan Fuang responded Whats wrong with being reborn as a brahmāEven nonreturners are born as brahmāsAnd being reborn as a brahmā is better than being reborn as a dogIn other words if you havent attained jhāna its hard to let go of sensual passionsAnd people stuck on sensual passions  even if theyve studied Buddhist philosophy  can easily be reborn as dogsSo the dangers of jhāna and nonreturn are much slighter than the dangers of not reaching those attainmentsStill if possible the Buddha does encourage you to try to go beyond the level of nonreturn and gain full awakeningThis is where he brings in another teaching another perceptionIn Pali the phrase is Sabbe dhammā anattā which means All phenomena are notself This applies both to fabricated phenomena and unfabricated phenomenaAnd its important to note here that this perception is part of the path not the goalIn other words its not the conclusion you come to when you arrive at awakening its a perception you use to get beyond your last attachmentsAs the above passage states what keeps a nonreturner from gaining total awakening is a type of passion and delight passion for the deathless and delight in the deathlessPassionanddelight is another term for clingingEven when the mind lets go of its clinging and passion for the aggregates there still is something it may cling to the experience of the deathless that follows after letting go of the aggregatesThe mind can regard its experience of the deathless as a phenomenon as an object of the mindWhere there is an object there is a subject  the knowing self the sense of I am  and this provides a foothold for passion and delight to arise You instinctively want to control whatever you like and so you try to control the experience of the deathless even though the idea of control here is superfluous  the deathless isnt going to change on you  and counterproductive The self created around this desire for control actually gets in the way of total freedomTo counter this tendency toward control the Buddha here has you apply the perception that all phenomena are notself even to the experience of the deathlessThis is what gets rid of the I in I amTheres another passage relevant to this point where the Buddha says that when you see all phenomena arising and passing away  and this includes everything including the path and your clinging to the deathless  when you watch everything arising arising arising all the time the idea of nonexistence doesnt occur to the mindWhen you see these things passing away passing away passing away the idea of existence doesnt occur to the mindAt that point the ideas of existence and nonexistence are irrelevant to your experienceAll you see is stress arising stress passing awayThis has several ramificationsIf ideas of existence and nonexistence dont occur to you then the question of whether the self exists or doesnt exist wouldnt occur to you eitherThis gets rid of the am in I am This also does away with your fear of going out of existence if things are let go because the mind isnt thinking in those termsAt the same time youre reaching the higher stage of transcendent right view with a higher and more refined level of dutyAs you remember with the four noble truths each of the truths has a duty but in this case  when you see everything arising and passing away simply as stress  all the duties are reduced to one You comprehend things to the point of dispassionThis means that you let go let go let go even of concentration even of discernment even of the act of clinging to the deathlessIn the words of Ajaan Mun all four noble truths are turned into oneThey all carry the same duty which is to let go of everythingThis allows the mind to experience nibbāna not as a phenomenon but as a total experienceAt this point youve found total happiness which no longer needs any protection no longer needs to be maintainedTheres no longer any issue of control or noncontrolTheres no need for the strategy of self to create this happiness and no need for a sense of self to consume or experience itWhere you dont draw a line to define self theres no line to define notselfWhere theres no clinging theres no need for the strategy of notselfSo strategies of self or notself are all put asideEven the strategy of dispassion itself gets put asideAt this point the mind no longer has need for any strategies at all because it has found a happiness thats truly solidIts not a phenomenon its a happinessThe Buddha calls it a special form of consciousness that doesnt need to be experienced through the six senses or what he calls the allIts directly experienced as total freedomAnd at the moment of awakening theres no experience of the six sensesHowever after the moment of awakening when the mind returns to the experience of the senses this sense of freedom staysThe Canon illustrates this with an image  not a pretty image but very memorableThe image is this Suppose theres a dead cowYou take a knife and remove the skin cutting all of the tendons and tissues that connect the skin to the cowThen you put the skin back onThe question is Is the skin still attached to the cow as it was beforeAnd the answer is NoEven though its right next to the cow its no longer attachedIn the same way the practice of discernment is like a knifeIt cuts through all of the attachments between the senses and their objectsOnce the attachments are gone then even if you put the knife away you cannot connect things in the way they were beforeThe eye still sees forms the ear hears sounds but theres a sense that these things are no longer joinedAs I said the image isnt pretty but it conveys the point that once total freedom is found its never lostOne final pointAs we said in one of the earlier talks you are limited by what you are obsessed withYou define yourself by your obsessions and attachments and that sort of definition places limitations on youWhen there are no longer any attachments or obsessions you are no longer definedAnd because you are no longer defined you cant be described as existing not existing neither or bothIn other words ideas of the existence of the self and the nonexistence of the self no longer applyAs for perceptions of self and notself those are like the knife that has been used to cut things through but now has been put asideSeveral years ago I was reading an article in a magazine in which a man was describing his childhood in New York CityHis parents had come from Eastern Europe to live in America and because the family was poor they put a lot of emphasis on his educationThey encouraged him to get as much education as he couldOne detail in their encouragement I found very insightfulEvery day when the young boy came home from school the mother didnt ask him what he had learned that dayInstead she asked him What questions did you ask today The mother was very wise because she realized that its through questions that we give shape to our knowledge to understand how one piece of knowledge relates to other pieces of knowledge and to figure out the best way to use our knowledgeThis is why its important to shape our questions skillfully for if we dont we give the wrong shape to everything else we know and we wont get the best use out of our knowledgeThis principle applies very directly to the Buddhas teachings  which are all strategic  and in particular to the teaching on notselfTo understand this teaching we have to understand what questions its answeringIf youve ever been in an introductory course on Buddhism youve probably heard this question If there is no self what does the action and what receives the results of the action Our discussions this week show that this question is misconstrued in two waysThe first is that the Buddha never said that there is no self and he never said that there is a selfThe question of whether a self does or doesnt exist is a question he put asideThe second reason for why the question is misconstrued is because it has the framework backwardsIts taking the teaching of notself as the framework and kamma as something thats supposed to fit inside the frameworkActually the relationship is the other way aroundKamma is the framework and the teaching of notself is meant to fit in the frameworkIn other words the Buddha takes the teachings on skillful and unskillful kamma as his basic categorical teachingWithin that context the question on self and notself becomes When is a perception of self skillful kamma and when is a perception of notself skillful kammaAnd when are they not skillfulSo to get the most use out of the teachings on self and notself we have to approach them with these questions in mindThe Buddha is not trying to define what you areHes not trying to fit you into a boxHes more concerned with helping youHe tries to show you how you define yourself so that you can learn how to use that process of selfdefinition in a way that leads to the ultimate goal of his teaching the end of suffering and the attainment of ultimate freedom ultimate happinessIn this way the teachings on self and notself are part of the answer to the question What when I do it will lead to my longterm welfare and happinessIn this context the Buddha talks about the process of what he calls Imaking and mymaking with the purpose of showing you how to engage in these actions in a skillful wayNormally we engage in these processes all of the timeWe create a sense of I in two ways around what we can control in order to attain happiness and around the aspects of our experience  our mind our body  that we hope will taste happinessIn other words we have a sense of our self as the agent or producer of happiness and our self as the consumer of happinessWe start out very early in life developing our sense of self in these waysAnd we create many different selvesRemember the story I told about your little sisterWhen bullies down the street are threatening her she is very much your sisterWhen you get her home safely and she takes your toy car she is no longer your sisterShes the OtherThis shows that your sense of self is changing all the time  like an amoeba taking on many different formsSo its good to understand that the sense of self is a strategy and that we engage in this strategy making many selves all the timeSometimes theyre mutually coherent sometimes notSometimes theyre honest and straightforward and sometimes notThis is something that becomes very apparent during meditationAs weve been mentioning throughout this week your mind is like a committeeEach member of the committee is a different self that youve created and nurtured at some point during your life as a particular strategy for attaining a particular happinessSometimes they get along sometimes they dontSometimes they tell the truth sometimes they lieWhen you start meditating you encounter them allThe skill of meditation lies in learning how to achieve some order and honesty among the members of the committee identifying with the more skillful ones trying to keep the unskillful ones under control and bringing some truth to their interactions so that you can bring the mind into jhānaThe idea of notself is also a strategy that weve used many timesWeve learned that after identifying with some things for one purpose or to fulfill one desire we have to disidentify with them for the purpose of fulfilling another desireFor example you may identify with your fingernails when they look attractive but when they get too long you have to cut them and throw the cutoff pieces awayAs with our various perceptions of self our perceptions of notself can be either skillful or unskillfulSometimes we try to lay claim to things that we cannot control and sometimes we try to deny that we have any responsibility for things that we can controlIn the Buddhas teaching on how to put an end to suffering he asks you to make skillful use of both kinds of strategies  self strategies and notself strategies  and to learn how to employ them ever more skillfully with more awareness more discernment to help with the duties of the four noble truthsThe line between what you think is self and notself is determined by your sense of controlIf you look carefully at the aggregates  form feeling perception fabrication and consciousness  you can see that you have no absolute control over them but you do have relative controlFor example when you tell your body to move it moves when you tell your mind to think about certain things itll think about themBut your control here is not absoluteSomeday youll tell the body to move and it wont budgeTheres the story in the Canon of a king eighty years old who tells a young monk When I was young it was as if I had the strength of two menBut now when I mean to put my foot in one place it goes someplace else The same happens with your mindThere are times when you want it to think and it wont think or itll think about things you dont want to think aboutThis lesson has been impressed on me very strongly this weekWhen I was studying French in high school I actually got an award as the best French student in my classBut now when I try to say something in French nothing comes outThis may tell you something about the American education system but it also has to do with the fact that the mind is never totally under ones controlAnd the situation gets worse as you get olderSo the Buddha recommends while you have some control over the body and mind that you make use of that control to help put an end to sufferingWhen the body and mind are relatively healthy and strong you have enough control to use them as a path to the end of sufferingYou start with the Buddhas first set of categorical teachings to abandon unskillful actions and develop skillful ones in their placeYou use the aggregates to be generous to develop virtue and to develop the mind through meditationAs youre trying to gain skill in these practices you come facetoface with the committee insideFor example when you want to be generous some of the members of the committee like the idea of making bread to give to your friends and some dontSimilarly with the precepts Some of the committee members like the idea of letting the mosquito live and others want to slap it deadAnd with meditation Some members of the committee want to focus on the breath and some want to think about what to do tomorrowSo part of the skill of the practice lies in learning how to sort out the members of the committee and to develop strategies for dealing with them effectivelyYou learn to use the healthy ego functions of anticipation suppression sublimation altruism and humor to train the less skillful members of the committeeAs you do this you begin to gain skill in creating a useful sense of self and notselfNow there are stages in the practiceAfter the first set of categorical teachings you move to the second the four noble truthsAs we mentioned last night when you put the mind on the path you take the raw material of the aggregates and turn them into jhānaThis is an important step in the practice because as the mind gets into a state of jhāna it finds new ways of feeding and new ways of understanding what is and isnt necessary for happinessThis focuses your attention more and more on your ability to create a sense of wellbeing inside and helps you to see lesser forms of pleasure as notselfYou have a solid foundation for letting them goWhen your skill is secure youre ready for the higher level of right view where you start applying the perception of notself across the boardThis is the step where you see that even though the levels of jhāna are a form of longterm welfare and happiness nevertheless they are still uncertain and inconstantThis is a sign that your sense of happiness has become more refined and your standards for happiness have become higherThis is when the Buddha recommends that you develop the perception that even the pleasure of jhāna is inconstant stressful and notselfThis gives rise to a sense of dispassionTo do this he recommends refining the question that lies at the beginning of wisdom What when I do it will lead to my longterm welfare and happiness At this stage your sensitivity to pleasure and happiness leads you to the realization that longterm happiness is no longer good enoughIts no longer good enough for you to want to call it my So now regardless of whatever comes up in the mind the questions become Is this constant NoIf something is inconstant is it easeful or stressful StressfulAnd if its stressful is it fitting to call it me or mine Here again the answer is NoYou apply these questions to all things even to any perception you may have about the deathlessThis is what inclines the mind to a state of unfabricated happinessWhat this means is that at the beginning of the path you dont just say that everything is notself and leave it at thatYou dont try to clone awakening telling yourself that Awakened people have no desire so Ill have no desire tooI wont even desire awakeningAwakened people are beyond good and evil so Ill go beyond good and evil too This kind of thinking doesnt get you on the pathIn fact it keeps you off the pathSo instead of starting out by saying that everything is notself you try to develop your powers over what you can controlYou push against the characteristics of inconstancy stress and notself and you see how far you can push before they push backAnd you discover that as you push you can gain a large measure of pleasure and happinessYou develop discernment and wisdom in deciding whats really important in life which sorts of happiness are more valuable than othersThis is how the mind develops the noble treasures of conviction virtue shame compunction learning the Dhamma generosity and discernmentYou learn how to hold on to these qualities for the time being and you regard as notself whatever goes against themSimilarly you develop the pleasure of concentration because you see that this is much more longterm than any other pleasureThis gives you a solid foundation from which you can let go of lesser pleasures in particular the pleasures of sensualityHaving access to this higher form of pleasure also enables you to look at suffering and pain without being afraid of themThat way you can look at them for the purpose of comprehending themNormally when we look at pain we look at it with the idea either of trying to do away with it or of running away from itIn neither way though do we get to comprehend the suffering or the painBut if you have a sense of confidence and good humor in the face of pain  the confidence and good humor that can come from a state of good solid concentration  then you can look carefully at the pain to the point where you really understand itThis enables you to perform the task with regard to the first noble truth which is to comprehend itIn addition to confidence the practice of jhāna also gives you a sense of competenceYouve mastered an important skill and learned how to bring some order to your committeeThis way  when you run into the limitations of even the most skillfully constructed mental states and start applying the perception of notself to everything including the path  its not through selfhatredIts simply through the mature realization that this is as far as intention can take youAt that point the mind is truly ready for an unconditioned happinessAnd here is where you see the genius of the Buddhas strategyWhen the mind becomes more and more focused on the pleasures of jhāna all of your clinging gets focused in one place a place of great stability and clarity so that you can watch clinging in actionBecause you see that the state of concentration is the one thing worth controlling your sense of self is focused there as well so you can clearly see it in action tooOnce all your clinging is focused here then when youre finally ready to cut this one last form of clinging theres no further clinging to any fabricated phenomena at allThis is why when you learn how to apply the perception of notself even to jhāna theres an opening to the deathlessAnd when you can apply the perception of notself to the phenomenon of the deathless the mind goes beyond all phenomena and arrives at ultimate freedom and ultimate happiness  total freedom total happiness  as a direct pure experienceAt this point you can put all your strategies downBecause this happiness is totally unconditioned you dont need a producer and you dont need a consumerTheres no issue of control or no controlTheres just the absolute unshakable experience of freedomMany of the forest ajaans have emphasized this point in their teachings that in the attainment of awakening you put aside both self and notselfSeveral years back there was a controversy in Thailand as to whether nibbāna was self or notselfThe issue was even argued in the newspapersSo one day someone went to ask Ajaan Mahā Boowa Is nibbāna self or notself And his answer was Nibbāna is nibbāna That was itHe then went on to explain how self and notself are tools on the path how both are put down when the path has done its work and how neither applies to the experience of nibbānaAjaan Suwat one of my teachers also said that when youve experienced deathless happiness you dont really care if theres something experiencing it or notThe experience is sufficient in and of itselfWhat weve been describing here is a special kind of consciousness that lies beyond the aggregates The texts call it consciousness without surface Once its been attained then freedom is never lostThe mind no longer tries to define itself and because its not defined it cant be describedWhat we can learn from all of these points is how to employ questions in the practiceYou try to avoid questions that are not helpful in putting an end to suffering and you adopt questions that areThese are the questions that lead to discernment and you refine discernment by refining these questions as you use them strategicallyFor example you start with the question about what leads to longterm welfare and happinessThen you refine it to the questions that apply the three perceptions of inconstancy stress and notself to all the aggregatesThen you refine that perception even further to the perception that all phenomena are notself and then you finally drop that perception as well to abandon clinging in all its formsEven the perception of dispassion that results from those perceptions is something you ultimately put asideSo its through these skillful questions that discernment is developedThis was the way that the Buddha himself found awakeningHe looked at his actions and noticed that he was actually creating sufferingThat is to say he was looking both at the actions and at the resultsThen he said Im trying to act for the purpose of happiness but why am I creating sufferingIs it actually possible to act in a way that does lead to happiness And he had the courage to ask that question continually and to keep testing his answers to that question to see how far it would take himThis inquiry involves two qualities that are absolutely essential to any successful meditationThe first is learning how to be observant  and not just observant in general but being particularly observant of your actions and their resultsWhen youre looking into the present moment this is what you should look for What am I doingWhats the result of what Im doingIs this acceptable or not If its not thats when you bring in the other quality which is ingenuity Is there some other way that I can act that would be more skillfulThis means that as we practice we have to be willing to experiment  which means willing to take risks and make mistakes but always willing to learn from those mistakesThis relates to the most skillful form of selfidentity you can take along the path  the self that takes pride in always being willing to learn from its actions  because this is how you see the noble truthsAfter all all the truths are actions and resultsWhen youre acting on craving youre engaged in the second noble truthWhen youre developing mindfulness concentration and discernment youre engaged in the fourth noble truth the pathAnd when you master as skills the duties appropriate to each of the truths thats when you really know the truths  and as Ajaan Lee says only when you really know things in practice like this can you let them goThis is how you find awakeningThe more you exercise your freedom to act skillfully the more you understand what it means to have freedom of choiceThe more closely you look at and understand this freedom through exercising it day by day in all of your actions both inner and outer the closer you come to a freedom thats absolute  and that answers every really burning question you haveBoth formerly  now it is only stress that I describe and the cessation of stressAnd what is the result of stressThere are some cases in which a person overcome with stress his mind exhausted grieves mourns laments beats his breast  becomes bewilderedOr one overcome with stress his mind exhausted comes to search outside Who knows a way or two to stop this stress I tell you monks that stress results either in bewilderment or in searchIts just as if a man were wounded with an arrow thickly smeared with poisonHis friends  companions kinsmen  relatives would provide him with a surgeon and the man would say I wont have this arrow removed until I know whether the man who wounded me was a noble warrior a brahman a merchant or a worker He would say I wont have this arrow removed until I know the given name  clan name of the man who wounded me until I know whether he was tall medium or short until I know whether he was dark ruddybrown or goldencolored until I know his home village town or city until I know whether the bow with which I was wounded was a long bow or a crossbow until I know whether the bowstring with which I was wounded was fiber bamboo threads sinew hemp or bark until I know whether the shaft with which I was wounded was wild or cultivated until I know whether the feathers of the shaft with which I was wounded were those of a vulture a stork a hawk a peacock or another bird until I know whether the shaft with which I was wounded was bound with the sinew of an ox a water buffalo a langur or a monkey He would say I wont have this arrow removed until I know whether the shaft with which I was wounded was that of a common arrow a curved arrow a barbed a calftoothed or an oleander arrow The man would die and those things would still remain unknown to himIn the same way if anyone were to say I wont live the holy life under the Blessed One as long as he does not declare to me that The cosmos is eternal or that The cosmos is not eternal The cosmos is finite The cosmos is infinite The soul is the same thing as the body The soul is one thing and the body another After death a Tathāgata exists After death a Tathāgata does not exist After death a Tathāgata both exists  does not exist or that After death a Tathāgata neither exists nor does not exist the man would die and those things would still remain undeclared by the TathāgataSo Māluṅkyaputta remember what is undeclared by me as undeclared and what is declared by me as declaredAnd what is undeclared by meThe cosmos is eternal is undeclared by meThe cosmos is not eternal is undeclared by meThe cosmos is finite The cosmos is infinite The soul is the same thing as the body The soul is one thing and the body another After death a Tathāgata exists After death a Tathāgata does not exist After death a Tathāgata both exists  does not exist After death a Tathāgata neither exists nor does not exist is undeclared by meAnd why are they undeclared by meBecause they are not connected with the goal are not fundamental to the holy lifeThey do not lead to disenchantment to dispassion to cessation to calm to direct knowledge to selfawakening to unbindingThats why they are undeclared by meAnd what is declared by meThis is stress is declared by meThis is the origination of stress is declared by meThis is the cessation of stress is declared by meThis is the path of practice leading to the cessation of stress is declared by meAnd why are they declared by meBecause they are connected with the goal are fundamental to the holy lifeThey lead to disenchantment to dispassion to cessation to calm to direct knowledge to selfawakening to unbindingThats why they are declared by meAs Vennanda was sitting there the Blessed One said to him I say categorically nanda that bodily misconduct verbal misconduct  mental misconduct should not be doneGiven that the Blessed One has declared lord that bodily misconduct verbal misconduct  mental misconduct should not be done what drawbacks can one expect when doing what should not be done One can fault oneself observant people on close examination criticize one ones bad reputation gets spread about one dies confused and  on the breakup of the body after death  one reappears in the plane of deprivation the bad destination the lower realms in hellI say categorically nanda that good bodily conduct good verbal conduct  good mental conduct should be doneGiven that the Blessed One has declared lord that good bodily conduct good verbal conduct  good mental conduct should be done what rewards can one expect when doing what should be done One doesnt fault oneself observant people on close examination praise one ones good reputation gets spread about one dies unconfused and  on the breakup of the body after death  one reappears in the good destinations in the heavenly worldCunda there are three ways in which one is made impure by bodily action four ways in which one is made impure by verbal action and three ways in which one is made impure by mental actionAnd how is one made impure in three ways by bodily actionThere is the case where a certain person takes life is brutal bloodyhanded devoted to killing  slaying showing no mercy to living beingsHe takes what is not givenHe takes in the manner of a thief things in a village or a wilderness that belong to others and have not been given by themHe engages in sexual misconductHe gets sexually involved with those who are protected by their mothers their fathers their brothers their sisters their relatives or their Dhamma those with husbands those who entail punishments or even those crowned with flowers by another manThis is how one is made impure in three ways by bodily actionAnd how is one made impure in four ways by verbal actionThere is the case where a certain person engages in false speechWhen he has been called to a town meeting a group meeting a gathering of his relatives his guild or of the royalty if he is asked as a witness Come  tell good man what you know If he doesnt know he says I know If he does know he says I dont know If he hasnt seen he says I have seen If he has seen he says I havent seen Thus he consciously tells lies for his own sake for the sake of another or for the sake of a certain rewardHe engages in divisive speechWhat he has heard here he tells there to break those people apart from these people hereWhat he has heard there he tells here to break these people apart from those people thereThus breaking apart those who are united and stirring up strife between those who have broken apart he loves factionalism delights in factionalism enjoys factionalism speaks things that create factionalismHe engages in harsh speechHe speaks words that are harsh cutting bitter to others abusive of others provoking anger and destroying concentrationHe engages in idle chatterHe speaks out of season speaks what isnt factual what isnt in accordance with the goal the Dhamma  the Vinaya words that are not worth treasuringThis is how one is made impure in four ways by verbal actionAnd how is one made impure in three ways by mental actionThere is the case where a certain person is covetousHe covets the belongings of others thinking O that what belongs to others would be mine He bears ill will corrupt in the resolves of his heart May these beings be killed or cut apart or crushed or destroyed or may they not exist at all He has wrong view is warped in the way he sees things There is nothing given nothing offered nothing sacrificedThere is no fruit or result of good or bad actionsThere is no this world no next world no mother no father no spontaneously reborn beings no brahmans or contemplatives who faring rightly  practicing rightly proclaim this world  the next after having directly known  realized it for themselves This is how one is made impure in three ways by mental actionThese Cunda are the ten courses of unskillful actionNow Cunda there are three ways in which one is made pure by bodily action four ways in which one is made pure by verbal action and three ways in which one is made pure by mental actionAnd how is one made pure in three ways by bodily actionThere is the case where a certain person abandoning the taking of life abstains from the taking of lifeHe dwells with his rod laid down his knife laid down scrupulous merciful compassionate for the welfare of all living beingsAbandoning the taking of what is not given he abstains from taking what is not givenHe does not take in the manner of a thief things in a village or a wilderness that belong to others and have not been given by themAbandoning sensual misconduct he abstains from sexual misconductHe does not get sexually involved with those who are protected by their mothers their fathers their brothers their sisters their relatives or their Dhamma those with husbands those who entail punishments or even those crowned with flowers by another manThis is how one is made pure in three ways by bodily actionAnd how is one made pure in four ways by verbal actionThere is the case where a certain person abandoning false speech abstains from false speechWhen he has been called to a town meeting a group meeting a gathering of his relatives his guild or of the royalty if he is asked as a witness Come  tell good man what you know If he doesnt know he says I dont know If he does know he says I know If he hasnt seen he says I havent seen If he has seen he says I have seen Thus he doesnt consciously tell a lie for his own sake for the sake of another or for the sake of any rewardAbandoning false speech he abstains from false speechHe speaks the truth holds to the truth is firm reliable no deceiver of the worldAbandoning divisive speech he abstains from divisive speechWhat he has heard here he does not tell there to break those people apart from these people hereWhat he has heard there he does not tell here to break these people apart from those people thereThus reconciling those who have broken apart or cementing those who are united he loves concord delights in concord enjoys concord speaks things that create concordAbandoning harsh speech he abstains from harsh speechHe speaks words that are soothing to the ear that are affectionate that go to the heart that are polite appealing  pleasing to people at largeAbandoning idle chatter he abstains from idle chatterHe speaks in season speaks what is factual what is in accordance with the goal the Dhamma  the VinayaHe speaks words worth treasuring seasonable reasonable circumscribed connected with the goalThis is how one is made pure in four ways by verbal actionAnd how is one made pure in three ways by mental actionThere is the case where a certain person is not covetousHe does not covet the belongings of others thinking O that what belongs to others would be mine He bears no ill will and is not corrupt in the resolves of his heartMay these beings be free from animosity free from oppression free from trouble and may they look after themselves with ease He has right view and is not warped in the way he sees things There is what is given what is offered what is sacrificedThere are fruits  results of good  bad actionsThere is this world  the next worldThere is mother  fatherThere are spontaneously reborn beings there are brahmans  contemplatives who faring rightly  practicing rightly proclaim this world  the next after having directly known  realized it for themselves This is how one is made pure in three ways by mental actionThese Cunda are the ten courses of skillful actionAnd which have I taught and declared to be categorical teachingsThis is stress I have taught and declared to be a categorical teachingThis is the origination of stress This is the cessation of stress This is the path of practice leading to the cessation of stress I have taught and declared to be a categorical teachingAnd why have I taught and declared these teachings to be categoricalBecause they are conducive to the goal conducive to the Dhamma and basic to the holy lifeThey lead to disenchantment to dispassion to cessation to calm to direct knowledge to selfawakening to unbindingThats why I have taught and declared them to be categoricalNow this monks is the noble truth of stress Birth is stressful aging is stressful death is stressful sorrow lamentation pain distress  despair are stressful association with the unbeloved is stressful separation from the loved is stressful not getting what is wanted is stressfulIn short the five clingingaggregates are stressfulAnd this monks is the noble truth of the origination of stress the craving that makes for further becoming  accompanied by passion  delight relishing now here  now there  ie craving for sensuality craving for becoming craving for nonbecomingAnd this monks is the noble truth of the cessation of stress the remainderless fading  cessation renunciation relinquishing release  letting go of that very cravingAnd this monks is the noble truth of the way of practice leading to the cessation of stress precisely this noble eightfold path  right view right resolve right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness right concentrationThis noble truth of stress is to be comprehended This noble truth of the origination of stress is to be abandoned This noble truth of the cessation of stress is to be realized This noble truth of the way of practice leading to the cessation of stress is to be developedThis is the way leading to discernment when visiting a contemplative or brahman to ask What is skillful venerable sirWhat is unskillfulWhat is blameworthyWhat is blamelessWhat should be cultivatedWhat should not be cultivatedWhat having been done by me will be for my longterm harm  sufferingOr what having been done by me will be for my longterm welfare  happinessThere are these four ways of answering questionsWhich fourThere are questions that should be answered categoricallyThere are questions that should be answered with an analytical answerThere are questions that should be answered with a counterquestionThere are questions that should be put asideThese are the four ways of answering questionsThere is the case where an uninstructed runofthemill person  who has no regard for noble ones is not wellversed or disciplined in their Dhamma who has no regard for men of integrity is not wellversed or disciplined in their Dhamma  doesnt discern what ideas are fit for attention or what ideas are unfit for attentionThis being so he doesnt attend to ideas fit for attention and attends to ideas unfit for attentionThis is how he attends inappropriately Was I in the pastWas I not in the pastWhat was I in the pastHow was I in the pastHaving been what what was I in the pastShall I be in the futureShall I not be in the futureWhat shall I be in the futureHow shall I be in the futureHaving been what what shall I be in the future Or else he is inwardly perplexed about the immediate present Am IAm I notWhat am IHow am IWhere has this being come fromWhere is it boundAs he attends inappropriately in this way one of six kinds of view arises in him The view I have a self arises in him as true  established or the view I have no self or the view It is precisely by means of self that I perceive self or the view It is precisely by means of self that I perceive notself or the view It is precisely by means of notself that I perceive self arises in him as true  established or else he has a view like this This very self of mine  the knower that is sensitive here  there to the ripening of good  bad actions  is the self of mine that is constant everlasting eternal not subject to change and will endure as long as eternityThis is called a thicket of views a wilderness of views a contortion of views a writhing of views a fetter of viewsBound by a fetter of views the uninstructed runofthemill person is not freed from birth aging  death from sorrow lamentation pain distress  despairHe is not freed I tell you from suffering  stressThe wellinstructed disciple of the noble ones  who has regard for noble ones is wellversed  disciplined in their Dhamma who has regard for men of integrity is wellversed  disciplined in their Dhamma  discerns what ideas are fit for attention and what ideas are unfit for attentionThis being so he doesnt attend to ideas unfit for attention and attends to ideas fit for attentionHe attends appropriately This is stress This is the origination of stress This is the cessation of stress This is the way leading to the cessation of stressAs he attends appropriately in this way three fetters are abandoned in him identityview doubt and grasping at habits  practicesThese are called the fermentations to be abandoned by seeingTo what extent nanda does one delineate when delineating a selfEither delineating a self possessed of form and finite one delineates that My self is possessed of form and finite Or delineating a self possessed of form and infinite one delineates that My self is possessed of form and infinite Or delineating a self formless and finite one delineates that My self is formless and finite Or delineating a self formless and infinite one delineates that My self is formless and infiniteNow the one who when delineating a self delineates it as possessed of form and finite either delineates it as possessed of form and finite in the present or of such a nature that it will become possessed of form and finite or he believes that Although it is not yet that way I will convert it into being that way This being the case it is proper to say that a fixed view of a self possessed of form and finite obsesses himMonks where there is a self would there be belonging to my selfYes lordOr monks where there is what belongs to self would there be my selfYes lordMonks where a self or what belongs to self are not pinned down as a truth or reality then the viewposition  This cosmos is the selfAfter death this I will be constant permanent eternal not subject to changeI will stay just like that for an eternity  Isnt it utterly  completely a fools teachingMonks I can imagine no one group of beings more variegated than that of common animalsCommon animals are created by mindAnd the mind is even more variegated than common animalsThus one should reflect on ones mind with every moment For a long time has this mind been defiled by passion aversion  delusion From the defilement of the mind are beings defiledFrom the purification of the mind are beings purifiedJust as a dog tied by a leash to a post or stake keeps running around and circling around that very post or stake in the same way an uninstructed runofthemill person  who has no regard for noble ones is not wellversed or disciplined in their Dhamma who has no regard for people of integrity is not wellversed or disciplined in their Dhamma  assumes form to be the self or the self as possessing form or form as in the self or the self as in formHe assumes feeling to be the self or the self as possessing feeling or feeling as in the self or the self as in feelingHe assumes perception to be the self or the self as possessing perception or perception as in the self or the self as in perceptionHe assumes fabrications to be the self or the self as possessing fabrications or fabrications as in the self or the self as in fabricationsHe assumes consciousness to be the self or the self as possessing consciousness or consciousness as in the self or the self as in consciousnessHe keeps running around and circling around that very form that very feeling that very perception those very fabrications that very consciousnessHe is not set loose from form not set loose from feeling from perception from fabrications not set loose from consciousnessHe is not set loose from birth aging  death from sorrows lamentations pains distresses  despairsHe is not set loose I tell you from suffering  stressAnd why do you call it formBecause it is afflicted thus it is called form Afflicted with whatWith cold  heat  hunger  thirst with the touch of flies mosquitoes wind sun  reptilesBecause it is afflicted it is called formAnd why do you call it feelingBecause it feels thus it is called feeling What does it feelIt feels pleasure it feels pain it feels neitherpleasurenorpainBecause it feels it is called feelingAnd why do you call it perceptionBecause it perceives thus it is called perception What does it perceiveIt perceives blue it perceives yellow it perceives red it perceives whiteBecause it perceives it is called perceptionAnd why do you call them fabricationsBecause they fabricate fabricated things thus they are called fabrications What do they fabricate as a fabricated thingFor the sake of formness they fabricate form as a fabricated thingFor the sake of feelingness they fabricate feeling as a fabricated thingFor the sake of perceptionhood For the sake of fabricationhood For the sake of consciousnesshood they fabricate consciousness as a fabricated thingBecause they fabricate fabricated things they are called fabricationsAnd why do you call it consciousnessBecause it cognizes thus it is called consciousnessWhat does it cognizeIt cognizes what is sour bitter pungent sweet alkaline nonalkaline salty  unsaltyBecause it cognizes it is called consciousnessThus an instructed disciple of the noble ones reflects in this way I am now being chewed up by formBut in the past I was also chewed up by form in the same way I am now being chewed up by present formAnd if I delight in future form then in the future I will be chewed up by form in the same way I am now being chewed up by present form Having reflected in this way he becomes indifferent to past form does not delight in future form and is practicing for the sake of disenchantment dispassion and cessation with regard to present formIf one stays obsessed with form monk thats what one is measured byWhatever one is measured by thats how one is classifiedIf one stays obsessed with feeling perception fabricationsIf one stays obsessed with consciousness thats what one is measured byWhatever one is measured by thats how one is classifiedBut if one doesnt stay obsessed with form monk thats not what one is measured byWhatever one isnt measured by thats not how one is classifiedIf one doesnt stay obsessed with

which craving is the ensnarer that has flowed along spread out and caught hold with which this world is smothered  enveloped like a tangled skein a knotted ball of string like matted rushes and reeds and does not go beyond transmigration beyond the planes of deprivation woe  bad destinationsThese cravingverbalizations dependent on what is internal and cravingverbalizations dependent on what is

cravingverbalizations dependent on what is internal and cravingverbalizations dependent on what is externalThese are called the cravingverbalizationsThus with cravingverbalizations of this sort in the past in the future and in the present there are cravingverbalizationsThis monks is craving the ensnarer that has flowed along spread out and caught hold with which this world is smothered  enveloped like a tangled skein a knotted ball of string like matted rushes and reeds and does not go beyond transmigration beyond the planes of deprivation woe  bad destinationsForm monks is notselfIf form were self this form would not lend itself to diseaseIt would be possible with regard to form Let my form be thusLet my form not be thus But precisely because form is notself this form lends itself to diseaseAnd it is not possible with regard to form Let my form be thusLet my form not be thusFeeling is not selfPerception is not selfFabrications are not selfConsciousness is notselfIf consciousness were self this consciousness would not lend itself to diseaseIt would be possible with regard to consciousness Let my consciousness be thusLet my consciousness not be thus But precisely because consciousness is notself consciousness lends itself to diseaseAnd it is not possible with regard to consciousness Let my consciousness be thusLet my consciousness not be thusNow at that moment this line of thinking appeared in the awareness of a certain monk So  form is notself feeling is notself perception is notself fabrications are notself consciousness is notselfThen what self will be touched by the actions done by what is notselfThen the Blessed One realizing with his awareness the line of thinking in that monks awareness addressed the monks Its possible that a senseless person  immersed in ignorance overcome with craving  might think that he could outsmart the Teachers message in this way So  form is notself feeling is notself perception is notself fabrications are notself consciousness is notselfThen what self will be touched by the actions done by what is notself Now monks havent I trained you in counterquestioning with regard to this  that topic here  thereWhat do you think  Is form constant or inconstant Inconstant lord And is that which is inconstant easeful or stressful Stressful lord And is it fitting to regard what is inconstant stressful subject to change as This is mineThis is my selfThis is what I am No lord Is feeling constant or inconstant Inconstant lord Is perception constant or inconstant Inconstant lord Are fabrications constant or inconstant Inconstant lordWhat do you think monks  Is consciousness constant or inconstant Inconstant lord And is that which is inconstant easeful or stressful Stressful lord And is it fitting to regard what is inconstant stressful subject to change as This is mineThis is my selfThis is what I am No lordThus monks any form whatsoever that is past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or near Every form is to be seen with right discernment as it has come to be This is not mineThis is not my selfThis is not what I amAny feeling whatsoeverAny perception whatsoeverAny fabrications whatsoeverAny consciousness whatsoever that is past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or near Every consciousness is to be seen with right discernment as it has come to be This is not mineThis is not my selfThis is not what I amSeeing thus the instructed disciple of the noble ones grows disenchanted with form disenchanted with feeling disenchanted with perception disenchanted with fabrications disenchanted with consciousnessDisenchanted he becomes dispassionateThrough dispassion he is releasedWith release there is the knowledge Released He discerns that Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task doneThere is nothing further for this world That is what the Blessed One saidGratified the monks delighted in the Blessed Ones wordsAnd while this explanation was being given the minds of sixty monks through lack of clinging were fully released from fermentationsTo what extent nanda does one assume when assuming a selfAssuming feeling to be the self one assumes that Feeling is my self Feeling is not my self My self is oblivious  Neither is feeling my self nor is my self oblivious to feeling but rather my self feels in that my self is subject to feelingNow one who says Feeling is my self should be addressed as follows There are these three feelings my friend  feelings of pleasure feelings of pain and feelings of neither pleasure nor painWhich of these three feelings do you assume to be the selfAt a moment when a feeling of pleasure is sensed no feeling of pain or of neither pleasure nor pain is sensedOnly a feeling of pleasure is sensed at that momentAt a moment when a feeling of pain is sensed no feeling of pleasure or of neither pleasure nor pain is sensedOnly a feeling of pain is sensed at that momentAt a moment when a feeling of neither pleasure nor pain is sensed no feeling of pleasure or of pain is sensedOnly a feeling of neither pleasure nor pain is sensed at that momentNow a feeling of pleasure is inconstant fabricated dependent on conditions subject to passing away dissolution fading and cessationA feeling of pain is inconstant fabricated dependent on conditions subject to passing away dissolution fading and cessationA feeling of neither pleasure nor pain is inconstant fabricated dependent on conditions subject to passing away dissolution fading and cessationHaving sensed a feeling of pleasure as my self then with the cessation of ones very own feeling of pleasure my self has perishedHaving sensed a feeling of pain as my self then with the cessation of ones very own feeling of pain my self has perishedHaving sensed a feeling of neither pleasure nor pain as my self then with the cessation of ones very own feeling of neither pleasure nor pain my self has perishedThus he assumes assuming in the immediate present a self inconstant entangled in pleasure and pain subject to arising and passing away he who says Feeling is my self Thus in this manner nanda one does not see fit to assume feeling to be the selfAs for the person who says Feeling is not the self My self is oblivious he should be addressed as follows My friend where nothing whatsoever is sensed at all would there be the thought I am No lordThus in this manner nanda one does not see fit to assume that Feeling is not my self My self is obliviousAs for the person who says Neither is feeling my self nor is my self oblivious but rather my self feels in that my self is subject to feeling he should be addressed as follows My friend should feelings altogether and every way stop without remainder then with feeling completely not existing owing to the cessation of feeling would there be the thought I am No lordThus in this manner nanda one does not see fit to assume that Neither is feeling my self nor is my self oblivious but rather my self feels in that my self is subject to feelingNow nanda in as far as a monk does not assume feeling to be the self nor the self as oblivious nor that My self feels in that my self is subject to feeling then not assuming in this way he does not cling to anything in the worldNot clinging he is not agitatedUnagitated he is totally unbound right withinHe discerns that Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task doneThere is nothing further for this worldIf anyone were to say with regard to a monk whose mind is thus released that The Tathāgata exists after death is his view that would be mistaken that The Tathāgata does not exist after death that The Tathāgata both exists and does not exist after death that The Tathāgata neither exists nor does not exist after death is his view that would be mistakenWhyHaving directly known the extent of designation and the extent of the objects of designation the extent of expression and the extent of the objects of expression the extent of description and the extent of the objects of description the extent of discernment and the extent of the objects of discernment the extent to which the cycle revolves Having directly known that the monk is releasedThe view that Having directly known that the monk released does not see does not know would be mistakenEven though a disciple of the noble ones has clearly seen with right discernment as it has come to be that sensuality is of much stress much despair  greater drawbacks still  if he has not attained a rapture  pleasure apart from sensuality apart from unskillful mental qualities or something more peaceful than that  he can be tempted by sensualityBut when he has clearly seen with right discernment as it has come to be that sensuality is of much stress much despair  greater drawbacks and he has attained a rapture  pleasure apart from sensuality apart from unskillful mental qualities or something more peaceful than that he cannot be tempted by sensualityJust as the royal frontier fortress has a gatekeeper  wise experienced intelligent  to keep out those he doesnt know and to let in those he does for the protection of those within and to ward off those without in the same way a disciple of the noble ones is mindful highly meticulous remembering  able to call to mind even things that were done  said long agoWith mindfulness as his gatekeeper the disciple of the ones abandons what is unskillful develops what is skillful abandons what is blameworthy develops what is blameless and looks after himself with purityJust as a royal frontier fortress has large stores of grass timber  water for the delight convenience  comfort of those within and to ward off those without in the same way the disciple of the noble ones quite secluded from sensuality secluded from unskillful qualities enters  remains in the first jhana  rapture  pleasure born of seclusion accompanied by directed thought  evaluation  for his own delight convenience  comfort and to alight on UnbindingJust as a royal frontier fortress has large stores of rice  barley for the delight convenience  comfort of those within and to ward off those without in the same way the disciple of the noble ones with the stilling of directed thoughts  evaluations enters  remains in the second jhana  rapture  pleasure born of concentration unification of awareness free from directed thought  evaluation  internal assurance  for his own delight convenience  comfort and to alight on UnbindingJust as a royal frontier fortress has large stores of sesame green gram  other beans for the delight convenience  comfort of those within and to ward off those without in the same way the disciple of the noble ones with the fading of rapture remains equanimous mindful  alert and senses pleasure with the bodyHe enters  remains in the third jhana  of which the noble ones declare Equanimous  mindful he has a pleasant abiding  for his own delight convenience  comfort and to alight on UnbindingJust as a royal frontier fortress has large stores of tonics  ghee fresh butter oil honey molasses  salt  for the delight convenience  comfort of those within and to ward off those without in the same way the disciple of the noble ones with the abandoning of pleasure  pain as with the earlier disappearance of joy  distress enters  remains in the fourth jhana  purity of equanimity  mindfulness neitherpleasurenorpain  for his own delight convenience  comfort and to alight on UnbindingVennanda This body comes into being through conceitAnd yet it is by relying on conceit that conceit is to be abandoned Thus it was saidAnd in reference to what was it saidThere is the case sister where a monk hears The monk named suchandsuch they say through the ending of the fermentations has entered  remains in the fermentationfree awarenessrelease  discernmentrelease having directly known  realized them for himself right in the here  now The thought occurs to him The monk named suchsuch they say through the ending of the fermentations has entered  remains in the fermentationfree awarenessrelease  discernmentrelease having directly known  realized them for himself right in the here  nowThen why not me Then at a later time he abandons conceit having relied on conceitAnd what is the self as a governing principleThere is the case where a monk having gone to a wilderness to the foot of a tree or to an empty dwelling reflects on this Its not for the sake of robes that I have gone forth from the home life into homelessness its not for the sake of almsfood for the sake of lodgings or for the sake of this or that state of becoming that I have gone forth from the home life into homelessnessSimply that I am beset by birth aging  death by sorrows lamentations pains distresses  despairs beset by stress overcome with stress Perhaps the end of this entire mass of suffering  stress might be known Now if I were to seek the same sort of sensual pleasures that I abandoned in going forth from home into homelessness  or a worse sort  that would not be fitting for me So he reflects on this My persistence will be aroused  not lax my mindfulness established  not confused my body calm  not aroused my mind centered  unified Having made himself his governing principle he abandons what is unskillful develops what is skillful abandons what is blameworthy develops what is unblameworthy and looks after himself in a pure wayThis is called the self as a governing principleJust as the footprints of all legged animals are encompassed by the footprint of the elephant and the elephants footprint is reckoned the foremost among them in terms of size in the same way all skillful qualities are rooted in heedfulness converge in heedfulness and heedfulness is reckoned the foremost among themI have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Sāvatthī in Jetas Grove Anāthapiṇḍikas monasteryNow at that time King Pasenadi Kosala was together with Queen Mallikā in the upper palaceThen he said to her Mallikā is there anyone more dear to you than yourselfNo your majesty she answeredThere is no one more dear to me than myselfAnd what about you your majestyIs there anyone more dear to you than yourselfNo MallikāThere is no one more dear to me than myselfThen the king descending from the palace went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one sideAs he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One Just now I was together with Queen Mallikā in the upper palaceI said to her Is there anyone more dear to you than yourselfNo your majesty she answeredThere is no one more dear to me than myselfAnd what about you your majestyIs there anyone more dear to you than yourselfNo MallikāThere is no one more dear to me than myself Then on realizing the significance of that the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimedSearching all directionswith your awarenessyou find no one dearerthan yourselfIn the same way othersare fiercely dear to themselvesSo you shouldnt hurt othersif you love yourselfThen Anāthapiṇḍika the householder went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one sideAs he was sitting there the Blessed One said to him These five things householder are welcome agreeable pleasant  hard to obtain in the worldWhich fiveLong life is

There is right view with fermentations siding with merit resulting in the acquisitions and there is noble right view without fermentations transcendent a factor of the pathAnd what is the right view that has fermentations sides with merit  results in acquisitionsThere is what is given what is offered what is sacrificedThere are fruits  results of good  bad actionsThere is this world  the next worldThere is mother  fatherThere are spontaneously reborn beings there are contemplatives  brahmans who faring rightly  practicing rightly proclaim this world  the next after having directly known  realized it for themselves This is the right view that has fermentations sides with merit  results in acquisitionsAnd what is the right view that is without fermentations transcendent a factor of the pathThe discernment the faculty of discernment the strength of discernment analysis of qualities as a factor for awakening the path factor of right view in one developing the noble path whose mind is noble whose mind is free from fermentations who is fully possessed of the noble pathThis is the right view that is without fermentations transcendent a factor of the pathMonks there are these seven treasuresWhich sevenThe treasure of conviction the treasure of virtue the treasure of shame the treasure of compunction the treasure of listening the treasure of generosity the treasure of discernmentAnd what is the treasure of convictionThere is the case where a disciple of the noble ones has conviction is convinced of the Tathāgatas awakening Indeed the Blessed One is pure and rightly selfawakened consummate in knowledge  conduct wellgone an expert with regard to the world unexcelled as a trainer for those people fit to be tamed the Teacher of divine  human beings awakened blessed This is called the treasure of convictionAnd what is the treasure of virtueThere is the case where a disciple of the noble ones abstains from taking life abstains from stealing abstains from illicit sexual conduct abstains from lying abstains from taking intoxicants that cause heedlessnessThis monks is called the treasure of virtueAnd what is the treasure of shameThere is the case where a disciple of the noble ones feels shame at bodily misconduct verbal misconduct mental misconductThis is called the treasure of shameAnd what is the treasure of compunctionThere is the case where a disciple of the noble ones feels compunction at bodily misconduct verbal misconduct mental misconductThis is called the treasure of compunctionAnd what is the treasure of listeningThere is the case where a disciple of the noble ones has heard much has retained what heshe has heard has stored what heshe has heardWhatever teachings are admirable in the beginning admirable in the middle admirable in the end that  in their meaning  expression  proclaim the holy life that is entirely complete  pure Those heshe has listened to often retained discussed accumulated examined with hisher mind and wellpenetrated in terms of hisher viewsThis is called the treasure of listeningAnd what is the treasure of generosityThere is the case of a disciple of the noble ones his awareness cleansed of the stain of stinginess living at home freely generous openhanded delighting in being magnanimous responsive to requests delighting in the distribution of almsThis is called the treasure of generosityAnd what is the treasure of discernmentThere is the case where a disciple of the noble ones is discerning endowed with discernment of arising  passing away  noble penetrating leading to the right ending of stressThis is called the treasure of discernmentThese monks are the seven treasuresAnd what is comprehensionAny ending of passion ending of aversion ending of delusion This is called comprehensionWhen you see with discernmentAll fabrications are inconstantAll fabrications are stressfulAll phenomena are notself you grow disenchanted with stress This is the path to purityThen VenKhemaka leaning on his staff went to the elder monks and on arrival exchanged courteous greetings with themAfter an exchange of friendly greetings  courtesies he sat to one sideAs he was sitting there the elder monks said to him Friend Khemaka this I am of which you speak What do you say I amDo you say I am form or do you say I am something other than formDo you say I am feeling perception fabrications consciousness or do you say I am something other than consciousnessThis I am of which you speak What do you say I amFriends its not that I say I am form nor do I say I am something other than form Its not that I say I am feeling perception fabrications consciousness nor do I say I am something other than consciousness With regard to these five clingingaggregates I am has not been overcome although I dont assume that I am thisIts just like the scent of a blue red or white lotus If someone were to call it the scent of a petal or the scent of the color or the scent of a filament would he be speaking rightlyNo friendThen how would he describe it if he were describing it rightlyAs the scent of the flower Thats how he would describe it if he were describing it rightlyIn the same way friends its not that I say I am form nor do I say I am other than form Its not that I say I am feeling perception fabrications consciousness nor do I say I am something other than consciousness With regard to these five clingingaggregates I am has not been overcome although I dont assume that I am thisFriends even though a noble disciple has abandoned the five lower fetters he still has with regard to the five clingingaggregates a lingering residual I am conceit an I am desire an I am obsessionBut at a later time he keeps focusing on the phenomena of arising  passing away with regard to the five clingingaggregates Such is form such its origin such its disappearanceSuch is feeling Such is perception Such are fabrications Such is consciousness such its origin such its disappearance As he keeps focusing on the arising  passing away of these five clingingaggregates the lingering residual I am conceit I am desire I am obsession is fully obliteratedJust like a cloth dirty  stained Its owners give it over to a washerman who scrubs it with salt earth or lye or cowdung and then rinses it in clear waterNow even though the cloth is clean  spotless it still has a lingering residual scent of salt earth or lye or cowdungThe washerman gives it to the owners the owners put it away in a scentinfused wicker hamper and its lingering residual scent of salt earth lye or cowdung is fully obliteratedIn the same way friends even though a noble disciple has abandoned the five lower fetters he still has with regard to the five clingingaggregates a lingering residual I am conceit an I am desire an I am obsessionBut at a later time he keeps focusing on the phenomena of arising  passing away with regard to the five clingingaggregates Such is form such its origin such its disappearanceSuch is feeling Such is perception Such are fabrications Such is consciousness such its origin such its disappearance As he keeps focusing on the arising  passing away of these five clingingaggregates the lingering residual I am conceit I am desire I am obsession is fully obliteratedWhen this was said the elder monks said to VenKhemaka We didnt crossexamine VenKhemaka with the purpose of troubling him just that VenKhemaka is capable of declaring the Blessed Ones message teaching it describing it setting it forth revealing it explaining it making it plain  just as he has in fact declared it taught it described it set it forth revealed it explained it made it plainThat is what VenKhemaka saidGratified the elder monks delighted in his wordsAnd while this explanation was being given the minds of sixtysome monks through no clinging were fully released from fermentations  as was VenKhemakasAs he was sitting to one side VenKaccāyana Gotta said to the Blessed One Lord Right view right view it is saidTo what extent is there right viewBy  large Kaccāyana this world is supported by a polarity that of existence  nonexistenceBut when one sees the origination of the world as it actually is with right discernment nonexistence with reference to the world doesnt occur to oneWhen one sees the cessation of the world as it actually is with right discernment existence with reference to the world doesnt occur to oneBy  large Kaccāyana this world is in bondage to attachments clingings  biasesBut one such as this doesnt get involved with or cling to these attachments clingings fixations of awareness biases or obsessions nor is he resolved on my self He has no uncertainty or doubt that mere stress when arising is arising stress when passing away is passing awayIn this his knowledge is independent of othersIts to this extent Kaccāyana that there is right viewEverything exists That is one extremeEverything doesnt exist That is a second extremeAvoiding these two extremes the Tathāgata teaches the Dhamma via the middle From ignorance as a requisite condition come fabricationsFrom fabrications as a requisite condition comes consciousnessFrom consciousness as a requisite condition comes nameformFrom nameform as a requisite condition come the six sense mediaFrom the six sense media as a requisite condition comes contactFrom contact as a requisite condition comes feelingFrom feeling as a requisite condition comes cravingFrom craving as a requisite condition comes clingingsustenanceFrom clingingsustenance as a requisite condition comes becomingFrom becoming as a requisite condition comes birthFrom birth as a requisite condition then aging  death sorrow lamentation pain distress  despair come into playSuch is the origination of this entire mass of stress  sufferingNow from the remainderless fading  cessation of that very ignorance comes the cessation of fabricationsFrom the cessation of fabrications comes the cessation of consciousnessFrom the cessation of consciousness comes the cessation of nameformFrom the cessation of nameform comes the cessation of the six sense mediaFrom the cessation of the six sense media comes the cessation of contactFrom the cessation of contact comes the cessation of feelingFrom the cessation of feeling comes the cessation of cravingFrom the cessation of craving comes the cessation of clinging sustenanceFrom the cessation of clingingsustenance comes the cessation of becomingFrom the cessation of becoming comes the cessation of birthFrom the cessation of birth then aging  death sorrow lamentation pain distress  despair all ceaseSuch is the cessation of this entire mass of stress  sufferingConsciousness without surface endless radiant all around has not been experienced through the earthness of earth the liquidity of liquid the fieriness of fire the windiness of wind the allness of the allJust as if a skilled butcher or butchers apprentice having killed a cow were to carve it up with a sharp carving knife so that  without damaging the substance of the inner flesh without damaging the substance of the outer hide  he would cut sever  detach only the skin muscles connective tissues  attachments in betweenHaving cut severed  detached the outer skin and then covering the cow again with that very skin if he were to say that the cow was joined to the skin just as it had been Would he be speaking rightlyNo venerable sirWhy is thatBecause if the skilled butcher or butchers apprentice having killed a cow were to cut sever  detach only the skin muscles connective tissues  attachments in between and having covered the cow again with that very skin then no matter how much he might say that the cow was joined to the skin just as it had been the cow would still be disjoined from the skinThis simile sisters I have given to convey a messageThe message is this The substance of the inner flesh stands for the six internal media the substance of the outer hide for the six external mediaThe skin muscles connective tissues  attachments in between stand for passion  delightAnd the sharp knife stands for noble discernment  the noble discernment that cuts severs  detaches the defilements fetters  bonds in betweenThere is the case where a monk has heard All things are unworthy of attachment Having heard that all things are unworthy of attachment he directly knows every thingDirectly knowing every thing he comprehends every thingComprehending every thing he sees all themes as something separateHe sees the eye as something separateHe sees forms as something separateHe sees eyeconsciousness as something separateHe sees eyecontact as something separateAnd whatever arises in dependence on eyecontact  experienced either as pleasure as pain or as neitherpleasurenorpain  that too he sees as something separateHe sees the ear as something separateHe sees the nose as something separateHe sees the tongue as something separateHe sees the body as something separateHe sees the intellect as something separateHe sees ideas as something separateHe sees intellectconsciousness as something separateHe sees intellectcontact as something separateAnd whatever arises in dependence on intellectcontact  experienced either as pleasure as pain or as neitherpleasurenorpain  that too he sees as something separateThis is how a monk knows this is how a monk sees so that ignorance is abandoned and clear knowing arisesSensing a feeling of pleasure one discerns that it is fleeting not grasped at not relishedSensing a feeling of pain Sensing a feeling of neither pleasure nor pain one discerns that it is fleeting not grasped at not relishedSensing a feeling of pleasure one senses it disjoined from itSensing a feeling of pain Sensing a feeling of neither pleasure nor pain one senses it disjoined from itWhat do you think Anurādha Do you regard form as the Tathāgata  No lordDo you regard feeling as the Tathāgata  No lordDo you regard perception as the Tathāgata  No lordDo you regard fabrications as the Tathāgata  No lordDo you regard consciousness as the Tathāgata  No lordWhat do you think Anurādha Do you regard the Tathāgata as being in form Elsewhere than form In feeling Elsewhere than feeling In perception Elsewhere than perception In fabrications Elsewhere than fabrications In consciousness Elsewhere than consciousness  No lordWhat do you think Do you regard the Tathāgata as formfeelingperceptionfabricationsconsciousness  No lordDo you regard the Tathāgata as that which is without form without feeling without perception without fabrications without consciousness  No lordAnd so Anurādha  when you cant pin down the Tathāgata as a truth or reality even in the present life  is it proper for you to declare Friends the Tathāgata  the supreme man the superlative man attainer of the superlative attainment  being described is described otherwise than with these four positions The Tathāgata exists after death does not exist after death both does  does not exist after death neither exists nor does not exist after deathNo lordVery good AnurādhaVery goodBoth formerly  now it is only stress that I describe and the cessation of stressIn the same way Vaccha any form by which one describing the Tathāgata would describe him That the Tathāgata has abandoned its root destroyed made like a palmyra stump deprived of the conditions of existence not destined for future arisingFreed from the classification of form Vaccha the Tathāgata is deep boundless hard to fathom like the seaReappears doesnt applyDoes not reappear doesnt applyBoth does  does not reappear doesnt applyNeither reappears nor does not reappear doesnt applyAny feeling Any perception Any fabricationAny consciousness by which one describing the Tathāgata would describe him That the Tathāgata has abandoned its root destroyed made like a palmyra stump deprived of the conditions of existence not destined for future arisingFreed from the classification of consciousness Vaccha the Tathāgata is deep boundless hard to fathom like the seaFreed dissociated  released from ten things Bāhuna the Tathāgata dwells with unrestricted awarenessWhich tenFreed dissociated  released from form the Tathāgata dwells with unrestricted awarenessFreed dissociated  released from feeling Freed dissociated  released from perception Freed dissociated  released from fabrications Freed dissociated  released from consciousness Freed dissociated  released from birth Freed dissociated  released from aging Freed dissociated  released from death Freed dissociated  released from stress Freed dissociated  released from defilement the Tathāgata dwells with unrestricted awarenessJust as a red blue or white lotus born in the water and growing in the water rises up above the water and stands with no water adhering to it in the same way the Tathāgata  freed dissociated  released from these ten things  dwells with unrestricted awarenessThis analysis of the Path is intended as a guide to lead practicing Buddhists to peace and wellbeing in terms both of the world and of the DhammaWellbeing in terms of the world includes such things as fortune status praise and pleasureThese four things depend on our conducting ourselves properly along the right pathIf we follow the wrong path though we are bound to meet with loss of fortune loss of status censure and criticism suffering and painThe fact that we experience these things may well be due to deficiencies in our own conductSo if our practice of the right path  the Noble Eightfold Path  is to lead us to peace in terms both of the world and of the Dhamma we will first have to study it so that we understand it rightly and then conduct ourselves in line with its factorsThen if we have aims in terms of the world well get good resultsOur fortune status good name and pleasure will be solid and lastingEven after we die they will continue to appear in the worldIf however we see that fortune status praise and pleasure are inconstant undependable and subject to change we should immediately start trying to study and develop the qualities that will lead our hearts in the direction of peaceWe are then sure to meet with results that parallel those of the worldFor example status  the paths of streamentry oncereturning nonreturning and arahantship fortune  the gaining of the fruition of streamentry oncereturning nonreturning and arahantship These forms of status and fortune dont deteriorateThey stay with us alwaysAt the same time well receive praise and pleasure in full measure inasmuch as Buddhists chant in praise virtually every night and day that The followers of the Blessed One conduct themselves well conduct themselves uprightly conduct themselves for the sake of knowledge conduct themselves masterfully Similarly our pleasure will be solid and lasting steeping and refreshing the heart with the Dhamma not subject to death or decayThis is called niramisa sukha pleasure free from the baits of the world quiet and cool genuine and unchanging the pleasure for which people who practice the Buddhas teachings aspireLike gold No matter in what land or nation it may fall it remains gold by its very nature and is bound to be desired by people at largeIn the same way the mental traits of people who follow the right path in terms of the Dhamma are bound to give rise to genuine pleasure and easeEven when they die from this world their fortune status good name and pleasure in terms of the Dhamma will not leave themThus Buddhists who aim at progress and happiness should study ponder and put into practice  as far as they can  all eight factors of the Noble Path set out here as a guide to practiceThere may however be some mistakes in what is written here because I have aimed more at the meaning and practice than at the letter of the scripturesSo wherever there may be mistakes or deficiencies please forgive meI feel certain though that whoever practices in line with the guidelines given here is sure to meet  to at least some extent  with ease of body and mind in terms both of the world and of the Dhamma in accordance with his or her own practice and conductMay each and every one of you meet with progress and happinessAll of the Buddhas teachings and their practice can be summed up in a mere eight factors Right Resolve thinking in ways that will lead to wellbeingRight Speech speaking in line with the truthRight Action being correct and upright in ones activitiesRight Livelihood maintaining oneself in ways that are honest and properRight Effort exerting oneself in line with all that is goodRight Mindfulness always being mindful of the person or topic that forms ones point of referenceRight Concentration keeping the mind correctly centered in line with the principles of the truth not letting it fall into the ways of Wrong ConcentrationRight View Seeing in line with the truth means seeing the four Noble Truths  BSamudaya the origin of physical and mental stress ie ignorance and such forms of craving as sensual desireRight View sees that these are the causes of all stressNirodha the ending and disbanding of the causes of stress causing stress to disband as well leaving only the unequaled ease of nibbanaDMagga the practices that form a path leading to the end of the causes of stress ie ignorance  false knowledge partial and superficial and craving  struggling that goes out of proportion to the way things areBoth of these factors can be abandoned through the power of the Path the practices we need to bring to maturity within ourselves through circumspect discernmentDiscernment can be either mundane or transcendent but only through the development of concentration can transcendent discernment or insight arise seeing profoundly into the underlying truth of all things in the worldIn short there are two sides to Right View and that good knowing properly giving rise to good in our thoughts words and deeds leads to ease of body and mind for ourselves and othersIn other words Right View sees that shoddiness is something that good people dont like and that shoddy people dont like it eitherThis is what is meant by seeing in line with the truthFor this reason people of discernment should always act in ways that are good and true if they are to qualify as having Right ViewRight Resolve There are three ways of thinking that will lead to wellbeing BAbyapadasankappa resolving to weaken dismantle and destroy any evil in our thoughts in other words trying to shed from the heart and mind any thoughts of ill will we may have toward people who displease usAvihinsasankappa resolving not to think in ways that aim at punishing or doing violence to others or in ways that would lead to harm for other people or living beingsNo matter how good or evil other people may be we dont give rein to thoughts of envy jealousy or competitivenessWe can shed these things from the heart because they are harmful to us  and when we can do ourselves harm there is nothing to keep us from harming othersIn short there are two sides to Right Resolve the intention to develop within ourselves whatever will give rise to ease comfort and pleasure for the mind until we reach the point where peace and ease are absolute This is classed as having good will toward ourselvesOnly then can we qualify as having Right ResolveRight Speech Speaking in line with the truth has four forms BNot speaking divisively eg talking about this person to that person so as to give rise to misunderstandings leading to a fallingout between the twoNot speaking harsh or vulgar words casting aspersions on a persons family race or occupation in ways that are considered base by the conventions of the worldDNot speaking idly ie in ways that are of no benefit to the listener  for instance criticizing or gossiping about the faults of other people in ways that dont serve to remind our listeners to correct their own faults or grumbling ie complaining over and over about something until our listeners cant stand it any longer the way a drunkard grumbles repeatedly without saying anything worthwhile or speaking extravagantly  even if what we say may be good if it goes over our listeners heads it serves no purpose or babbling ie speaking excessively without any aim Talking at great length without really saying anything serves no purpose at all and fits the phrase A waste of words a waste of breath a waste of timeIn short Say only things that are true and good that will give knowledge to our listeners or bring them to their sensesEven then though we should have a sense of time place and situation if our words are to qualify as Right SpeechDont hope to get by on good words and good intentions aloneIf what you say isnt right for the situation it can cause harmSuppose for instance that another person does something wrongEven though you may mean well if what you say strikes that person the wrong way it can cause harmTheres a story they tell about a monk who was walking across an open field and happened to meet up with a farmer carrying a plow over his shoulder and a hoe in his hand wearing a palmleaf hat and a waistcloth whose ends werent tucked inOn seeing the monk the farmer raised his hands in respect without first putting himself in orderThe monk meaning well wanted to give the farmer a gentle reminder and so said Now thats not the way you pay respect to a monk is it If it isnt the farmer replied then to hell with it As a result the gentle reminder ended up causing harmRight Action being upright in our activitiesWith reference to our personal actions this means adhering to the three principles of virtuous conduct BNot stealing concealing embezzling or misappropriating the belongings of other peopleNot engaging in immoral or illicit sex with the children or spouses of other peopleWith reference to our work in general Right Action means this Some of our undertakings are achieved through our physical activityBefore engaging in them we should first evaluate them to see just how beneficial they will be to ourselves and others and to see whether or not they are clean and pureIf we see that they will cause suffering or harm we should refrain from them and choose only those activities that will lead to ease convenience and comfort for ourselves and othersAction here includes every physical action we take sitting standing walking and lying down the use of every part of the body eg grasping or taking with our hands as well as the use of our senses of sight hearing smell taste and feelingAll of this counts as physical activity or actionExternal action can be divided into five sortsbAgriculture putting the land to use eg growing crops running farms and orchards so as to gain wealth and prosperity from what is termed the wealth in the soilcIndustry extracting and transforming the resources that come from the earth but in their natural state cant give their full measure of ease and convenience and thus need to be transformed eg making rice into flour or sweets turning fruits or tubers into liquid  for instance making orange juice making solids into liquids  eg smelting ore or liquids into solidsAll of these activities have to be conducted in honesty and fairness to qualify as Right ActiondCommerce the buying selling and trading of various objects for the convenience of those who desire them as a way of exchanging ease convenience and comfort with one another  on high and low levels involving high and lowquality goods between people of high low and middling intelligenceThis should be conducted in honesty and fairness so that all receive their share of justice and convenienceeLabor working for hire searching for wealth in line with the level of our abilities whether low middling or highOur work should be up to the proper standards and worthy  in all honesty and fairness  of the wages we receiveIn short Right Action means improving the objects with which we deal so that they can become clean and honest tooClean things  whether many or few  are always good by their very natureOther people may or may not know but we cant help knowing each and every timeThus before we engage in any action so as to make it upright and honest we first have to examine and weigh things carefully being thoroughly circumspect in using our judgment and intelligenceOnly then can our actions be in line with right moral principlesRight LivelihoodIn maintaining ourselves and supporting our families expending our wealth for the various articles we use or consume we must use our earnings  coming from our Right Actions  in ways that are in keeping with moral principlesOnly then will they provide safety and security fostering the freedom and peace in our life that will help lead to inner calmFor example there are four ways of using our wealth rightly so as to foster our own livelihood and that of others providing happiness for all BSupport expending what wealth we can afford to provide for the ease and comfort of our family and close friendsAid expending our wealth or our energies for the sake of the common good  for example by helping the government either actively or passivelyActively means donating a sum of money to a branch of the government such as setting up a fund to foster any of its various activitiesPassively means being willing to pay our taxes for the sake of the nation not trying to be evasive or uncooperativeOur wealth will then benefit both ourselves and othersDOfferings This means making gifts of the four necessities of life to support BuddhismThis is a way of paying homage to the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha that will serve the purposes of the religionAt the same time its a way of earning inner wealth termed ariyadhana A person observing the principles of Right Livelihood who does this will reap benefits both in this life and in the nextThe wealth we have rightfully earned though if we dont have a sense of how to use it properly can cause us harm both in this life and in lives to comeThus in expending our wealth in the area of charity we should do so honestlyIn the area of support we should use forethought and careThe same holds true in the areas of aid and offeringsBefore making expenditures we should consider the circumstances carefully to see whether or not theyre appropriateIf they arent then we shouldnt provide assistanceOtherwise our wealth may work to our harmIf we provide help to people who dont deserve it  for instance giving assistance to thieves  the returns may be detrimental to our own situationThe same holds true in making offerings to the religionIf a monk has no respect for the monastic discipline doesnt observe the principles of morality neglects his proper duties  the threefold training  and instead behaves in ways that are deluded misguided and deceitful then whoever makes offerings to such a monk will suffer for it in the end as in the sayingNow we may think that a monks evil is his own business as long as were doing goodThis line of thinking ought to be right but it may turn out to be wrongSuppose for instance that a group of people is playing cards in defiance of the lawYoure not playing with them youre just sitting at the table watchingBut if the authorities catch you theyre sure to take you along with the group no matter how much you may protest your innocenceIn the same way whoever makes offerings without careful forethought may end up reaping harm and such a person cant be classified as maintaining Right LivelihoodIn short there are two sides to Right Livelihood We should give help to other people as we are able so as to provide them with comfort and wellbeingThis is what it means to maintain Right LivelihoodRight EffortThere are four ways of exerting ourselves in line with the Dhamma BMake a persistent effort to prevent evil from arising and use restraint to put a halt to whatever evil may be in the process of arising  as when greedy desires that go against the principles of fairness appear within youFor instance suppose you have a tenacre plot of land that you havent utilized fully and yet you go infringing on other peoples property This is classed as greedy desire a path to trouble and suffering for yourself and othersNow this doesnt mean that you arent allowed to eat and live or that you arent allowed to work and search for wealthActually those who have the enterprise to make whatever land or wealth they own bear fruit or even increasing fruit were praised by the Buddha as utthanasampada enterprising industrious people who will gain a full measure of welfare in this lifetimeGreedy desires here mean any desires that go beyond our proper limits and infringe on other peopleThis sort of desire is bound to cause harm and so is classed as a kind of evilWhen such a desire arises in the heart you should use restraint to put a halt to itThis is what is meant by preventing evil from arisingAnother example is anger arising from either good or bad intentions that when unfulfilled lead to feelings of irritation and dissatisfactionSuch feelings should be stilledDont let them flare up and spread for anger is something you dont like in other people and they dont like it in youThus its classed as a kind of evilYou should exert restraint and keep your mind on a steady and even keelYour anger wont then have a chance to grow and will gradually fade awayThis is whats meant by making a persistent effort to keep evil from taking root and sprouting branchesOr take delusion  knowledge that doesnt fit the truth You shouldnt jump to conclusionsRestrain yourself from making snap judgments so that you can first examine and consider things carefullyFor instance sometimes you understand right to be wrong and wrong to be right This is delusionWhen right looks wrong to you your thoughts words and deeds are bound to be wrong out of line with the truth and so can cause you to slip into ways that are evilWhen wrong looks right to you your thoughts words and deeds are also bound to be wrong and out of line with the truthSuppose that a black crow looks white to you or an albino buffalo black When people who see the truth meet up with you disputes can resultThis is thus a form of evilOr suppose that you have good intentions but act out of delusion If you happen to do wrong  for example giving food to monks at times when they arent allowed to eat all because of your own ignorance and delusion  youll end up causing harmTherefore you should be careful to observe events and situations searching for knowledge so as to keep your thoughts and opinions in lineDelusion then wont have a chance to ariseThis is classed as making an effort to exercise restraint so that evil wont ariseAs for whatever evil youve already abandoned dont let it returnCut off the evil behind you and fend off the evil before youEvil will thus have a chance to fade awayMake a persistent effort to give rise to the good within yourselfFor example Silasampada Be a person of mature virtue whose words and deeds are in proper order whose behavior is in line with the principles of honesty leading to purityThese are truly human values that we should foster within ourselvesCagasampada Be magnanimous and generous in making donations and offerings to others finding reward in the fruits of generosityFor example we may give material objects so as to support the comfort and convenience of others in general The fruits of our generosity are bound to find their way back to usOr we may be magnanimous in ways that dont involve material objectsFor instance when other people mistreat or insult us through thoughtlessness or carelessness we forgive them and dont let our thoughts dwell on their faults and errorsThis is called the gift of forgiveness or the gift of justiceIt brings the highest rewardsPaññasampada Be a person of mature discernment whose thinking is circumspect and whose sense of reason is in line with the truthAll four of these qualities are classed as forms of goodnessIf they havent yet arisen within you you should give rise to themThey will reward you with wellbeing in body and mindDMake a persistent effort to maintain the good in both of its aspects cause and effectIn other words keep up whatever good you have been doing and as for the results  mental comfort ease and lightheartedness  maintain that sense of ease so that it can develop and grow just as a mother hen guards her eggs until they turn into baby chicks with feathers tails sharp beaks and strong wings able to fend for themselvesThe results of the good we have done if we care for them well are bound to develop until they take us to higher levels of attainmentFor instance when our hearts have had their full measure of mundane happiness so that we develop a sense of enough were bound to search for other forms of happiness in the area of the Dhamma developing our virtue concentration and discernment to full maturity so as to gain release from all suffering and stress meeting with the peerless ease described in the phraseWhen we have done good in full measure and have maintained it well until its firmly established within us we should then make the effort to use that good with discretion so as to benefit people in generalIn short Do whats good maintain whats good and have a sense of how to use whats good  in keeping with time place and situation  so as to give rise to the greatest benefit and happinessWhoever can do all of this ranks as a person established in Right EffortRight MindfulnessThere are four foundations of mindfulness or frames of reference for establishing the mind in concentration AContemplation of the body as a frame of reference Focus mindfulness on the body as your frame of referenceThe word body refers to what is produced from the balance of the elements or properties earth  the solid parts such as hair of the head hair of the body nails teeth skin etc water  the liquid parts eg saliva catarrh blood etc fire  warmth eg the fires of digestion wind  eg the breath space  the empty places between the other elements that allow them to come together in proper proportion consciousness  the awareness that permeates and brings together the other elements in a balanced way so that they form a bodyThere are four ways of looking at the body The inner body the meeting place of the six elements  earth water fire wind space and consciousness  the body itself forming the first fourCenter your mindfulness in the body considering it from four anglesbSeparate it into its partscConsider how the mingling of the elements leads to such forms of filthiness as saliva mucus blood lymph and pus which permeate throughout the bodydConsider it as inconstant  its unstable always changing and deteriorating as stressful  it cant last  no matter what good or evil you may do it changes with every inandout breath and as notself  some of its aspects no matter how you try to prevent them cant help following their own inherent natureThe body viewed from any of these four aspects can serve as a frame of referenceBut although our frame of reference may be right if we arent circumspect and fully aware or if we practice in a misguided way we can come to see wrong as right to the point where our perceptions become skewedFor example if we see an old person a sick person or a dead person we may become so depressed and despondent that we dont want to do any work at all on the level of either the world or the Dhamma and instead want simply to die so as to get away from it allOr in examining the elements  earth water fire wind space and consciousness  we may come to the conclusion that whats inside is nothing but elements whats outside is nothing but elements and we cant see anything above and beyond this so that our perception of things becomes skewed seeing that theres no man no woman This is what can lead monks to sleep with women and abandon their precepts eating food in the evening and drinking alcohol thinking that its only elements eating elements so there shouldnt be any harmOr we may consider the filthy and unattractive aspects of the body until weve reach a point where things seem so foul and disgusting that we cant eat at all and simply want to escapeSome people on reaching this point want to jump off a cliff or into the river to drownOr we may view things as inconstant stressful and notself but if we act deludedly without being circumspect in our discernment the mind can become a turmoilIf our foundation  our concentration  isnt strong enough for this sort of investigation it can lead to a distressing sense of alienation of being trapped in the bodyThis is called skewed perception and it can lead to corruptions of insight all because we arent circumspect and skilled in training the mindWe may feel that we already know but knowledge is no match for experience as in the old sayingSo in dealing with this frame of reference if we want our path to be smooth and convenient with no stumps or thorns we should focus on the sensation of the body in and of itself ie on one of the elements as experienced in the body such as the breathThe body in and of itself Focus on a single aspect of the body such as the inandout breathDont pay attention to any other aspects of the bodyKeep track of just the breath sensationsFor example when the breath comes in long and goes out long be aware of itFocus on being aware at all times of whether your breathing feels easy or difficultIf any part of the body feels uncomfortable adjust your breathing so that all parts of the body feel comfortable with both the inbreath and the out and so that the mind doesnt loosen its hold and run after any outside allusions to past or future which are the sources of the HindrancesBe intent on looking after the inandout breath adjusting it and letting it spread so as to connect and coordinate with the other aspects of the breath in the body just as the air stream in a Coleman lantern spreads kerosene throughout the threads of the mantleOne of the preliminary signs of the breath will then appear a sense of reliefgiving brightness filling the heart or a lump or ball of white like cottonwoolThe body will feel at peace  refreshed and fullThe properties of the body will be balanced and wont interfere or conflict with one anotherThis is termed kayapassaddhi kayaviveka  serenity and solitude of the bodyAs for awareness its expanded and broad  mahaggatam cittam  sensitive throughout to every part of the bodyMindfulness is also expanded spreading throughout the bodyThis is called the great frame of reference enabling you to know how cause and effect operate within the bodyYoull see which kinds of breath create which kinds maintain and which kinds destroyYoull see feelings of breath arising remaining and disbanding liquid feelings arising remaining and disbanding solid feelings arising remaining and disbanding feelings of warmth arising remaining and disbanding feelings of space arising remaining and disbanding youll see consciousness of these various aspects arising remaining and disbandingAll of this you will know without having to drag in any outside knowledge to smother the awareness that exists on its own by its very nature within you and is always there to tell you the truthThis is termed mindfulness and alertness in full measureIt appears as a result of selftraining and is called paccattam something that exists on its own knows on its own and that each person can know only for him or her selfThe body in the mind When the breath is in good order clean and bright and the heart is clear then internal visions may appear from the power of thoughtWhatever you may think of you can make appear as an image  near or far subtle or gross giving rise to knowledge or completely lacking in knowledge true or falseIf youre circumspect mindful and alert these things can give rise to knowledge and cognitive skillIf you arent you may fall for the images you seeFor example you may think of going somewhere and then see an image of yourself floating in that directionYou center your awareness in the image and float along with your thoughts until you get carried away losing track of where you originally wereThis way you get engrossed in traveling through heaven or hell meeting with good things and bad being pleased or upset by what you seeAs a result your concentration degenerates because you arent wise to the nature of the image of the body in the mindIf though you can think to restrain your train of thought and focus on the image as a phenomenon in the present the image will return to join your primary sense of the bodyYoull then see that they are equal in natureNeither is superior to the otherThe nature of each is to arise remain and then dissolveAwareness is simply awareness and sensations are simply sensationsDont fasten onto eitherLet go of them and be neutralBe thoroughly mindful and alert with each mental momentThis level of sensation if youre adept and knowledgeable can lead to knowledge of previous lives knowledge of where living beings are reborn after death and knowledge that does away with the fermentations of defilementIf you arent wise to this level of sensation though it can lead to ignorance craving and attachment causing the level of your practice to degenerateThe image or sensation that arises through the power of the mind is sometimes called the rebirth body or the astral bodyBut even so you shouldnt become attached to itOnly then can you be said to be keeping track of the body as a frame of reference on this levelBContemplation of feelings as a frame of reference The mental act of tasting or savoring the objects of the mind  eg taking pleasure or displeasure in them  is termed vedana or feelingIf we class feelings according to flavor there are three Dukkhavedana stress and pain for body and mindUpekkhavedana neutral feelings neither pleasure nor painIf we class them according to range or source there are fourInner feelings feelings that arise within the body as when any of the four properties  earth water fire or wind  change either through our present intentions or through the results of past actions giving rise to pleasure pain or neutral feelingsFeelings in and of themselves feelings regarded simply as part of the stream of feelingsFor example pleasure pain and neutral feelings occur in different mental moments they dont all arise in the same momentWhen one of them arises such as pain focus right on what is presentIf pleasure arises keep the mind focused in the pleasureDont let it stray to other objects that may be better or worseStay with the feeling until you know its truth in other words until you know whether its physical pleasure or mental pleasure whether it results from past actions or from what you are doing in the presentOnly when your mindfulness is focused in this way can you be said to be viewing feelings in and of themselvesFeelings in the mind moods that arise in the mind independent of any objectSimply by thinking we can give rise to pleasure or pain good or bad accomplished entirely through the heartEach of these four kinds of feelings can serve as an object for tranquillity and insight meditationEach can serve as a basis for knowledgeContemplation of the mind as a frame of reference taking as our preoccupation states that arise in the mindThe term mind refers to two conditions  awareness and thinkingAwareness of thinking can cause the mind to take on different states good or badIf we classify these states by their characteristics there are three good bad and neutralbVitadosacitta the mind when it isnt incited or roused to irritation by its objectscVitamohacitta the mind when it isnt deluded intoxicated or outwitted by its objectsBad mental states are also of three sorts  bSadosacitta the mind irritated or aroused to angercSamohacitta the mind deluded and ignorant of the truthNeutral mental states which arise from being neither pleased nor displeased or when mental activity occurs without affecting the condition of awareness for good or bad  are called avyakata indeterminateIf we classify mental states according to their range or source there are three  Inner mental states thoughts that arise within us with reference to the present either right or wrong good or badMental states in and of themselves mental fashioning  the act of thinking arising from awareness the act of awareness arising from thinking taking such forms as consciousness intellect mindfulness alertness discernment knowledgeWhichever one of these mental states may be arising and remaining in the present moment focus your attention exclusively on itFor example knowledge of a certain sort may appear either on its own or as the result of deliberation it may or may not be intendedWhatever arises focus your mindfulness and alertness on it until you know the stages in the workings of the mind knowing for instance which mental state is the intentional act which the result and which mere activityKeep focused exclusively on these states until you can see mental states simply as mental states knowledge simply as knowledge intelligence as intelligenceBe thoroughly circumspect mindful and discerning at each mental moment until you are able to let go of all mental states without being caught up on what they are supposed to refer to mean or representOnly then can you be said to be keeping track of mental states in and of themselves as a frame of referenceDContemplation of mental qualities as a frame of reference Mental qualities that can serve as bases for mindfulness leading to peace and respite for the mind are of three kinds  Byapada illwill stepping into a mood of discontent that arises from certain sorts of individuals or situations that when we brood on them cause the mind to focus on what we find displeasing until it becomes irritated and arousedThinamiddha drowsiness torpor dullness giving rise to laziness apathy and discouragementUddhaccakukkucca restlessness and anxiety thinking more than we want to or need thoughts that go out of control drifting further and further away until we may even lose sense of our own bodyThinking that has no order or bounds is sure to cause harmVicikiccha doubt hesitancy uncertainty about issues dealing with the world or the Dhamma doubt about certain individuals about their teachings about our own conduct and practicesThis comes from not having enough mindfulness or alertness to keep the mind in check and from not knowing where the Hindrances come fromWe should realize that  to put it briefly  the Hindrances come from concepts that allude to either the past or the futureSo when we want to ward them off we should let go of these concepts and focus our attention in on the present and the Hindrances will weaken awayInner mental qualities The skillful mental qualities we should foster within ourselves are five counting their component factors and four counting their levels in other words   Vicara evaluating and adjusting the breath so that it becomes comfortable to the point where it spreads throughout the entire body coordinating and connecting the various breathsensations existing within us Piti rapture refreshment fullness of body and mind Sukha pleasure ease of body and mind Ekaggata The mind enters into a single object such as the breath ie all five of these factors deal with a single topicThe second jhana has three factors Sukha The sense of ease for body and mind becomes greater so that it can relieve mental discomfortThis leads the mind to abandon its evaluating and adjusting Ekaggata The mind enters into a subtle and gentle level of breath with a feeling of spaciousness and relief throughout the bodyThis subtle breath bathes and pervades the entire body so that the mind becomes absolutely snug with its one objectThe third jhana The singleness of the minds object becomes even more refined leaving just a feeling of ease of body and mind the result of steadying the mind in a single objectThis is called ekaggatasukha  all that remains is singleness and easeThe fourth jhana Upekkha  the breath sensations in the body are still so that we can do without the inandout breathThe still breath fills all the various parts of the bodyThe four physical properties are all quiet and stillThe mind is still having abandoned past and future entering into its object that forms the presentThe mind is firmly focused on one object This is ekaggata the second factor of the fourth jhanaMindfulness and alertness are present in full measure and thus give rise to mental brightnessWhen mindfulness is strong it turns into cognitive skill when alertness is strong it turns into intuitive insight seeing the truth of physical sensations and mental acts whether near or far gross or subtle our own or those of othersThis knowledge appears exclusively within our own body and mind and we can realize it on our own This is what is meant by the word paccattamMental qualities in and of themselvesThis refers to mental qualities of another level that appear after the above qualities have been developedIntuitive knowledge arises eg  anam udapadi intuitive sensitivity thoroughly penetratingThis refers to the three forms of intuitive knowledge beginning with the ability to remember previous livesPañña udapadi Liberating discernment arisesVijja udapadi Cognitive skill  clear open penetrating and true  arises within oneThese forms of knowledge arise on their own  not for ordinary people but for those who have developed concentrationDiscernment here refers to the discernment that comes from mental training and development not to the ordinary discernment coming from concepts weve remembered or thought outThis is discernment that arises right at the heartCognitive skill here is a high level of knowledge termed pariññaya dhamma thorough comprehension that arises within from having explored the four Noble Truths beginning with stress which is the result of such causes as ignorance and cravingKnowledge arises enabling us to cut the tap root of stress by performing the task of abandoning the causeWhen this is done stress disbands and ceases the cause doesnt flare up again This is nirodhaAnd the knowledge that steps in to eliminate the cause of stress is the Path the way leading to release from all stress and suffering made possible by the eye of the mind composed of  This is the eye of the mindIn short we have dukkha physical and mental stress and samudaya the cause of stressThese two are one pair of cause and effect functioning in the worldAnother pair is nirodha the disbanding and cessation of all stress and maggacitta the mind following the right path causing the causes of stress  ignorance and craving  to disbandIn other words when the physical and mental stress from which we suffer is ended through the power of the mind on the Path the mind is freed from all disruptions and fermentations and doesnt latch onto cause or effect pleasure or pain good or evil the world or the DhammaIt abandons all supposings assumptions wordings and conventionsThis is deathlessness a quality that doesnt arise doesnt change doesnt vanish or disband and that doesnt fasten onto any quality at allIn other words it can let go of conditioned phenomena and doesnt fasten onto unconditioned phenomenaIt lets go of each phenomenon in line with that phenomenons own true natureThus the saying Sabbe dhamma anatta  No phenomenon is the self the self isnt any phenomenonAll supposings and assumptions  all meanings  are abandonedThis is nibbanaAll of this is called seeing mental qualities in and of themselves  ie seeing the higher aspect of mental qualities that arises from their more common sideRight Concentration the way to discernment knowledge and release If we class concentration according to how its practiced in general there are two sorts right and wrongAWrong Concentration Why is it called wrongBecause it doesnt give rise to the liberating insight that leads to the transcendent qualitiesFor example after attaining a certain amount of concentration we may use it in the wrong way as in magic  hypnotizing other people or spirits of the dead so as to have them in our power or exerting magnetic attraction so as to seduce or dupe other people  all of which causes the heart to become deceitful and dishonestOr we may use concentration to cast spells and practice sorcery displaying powers in hopes of material rewardAll of these things are based on nothing more than momentary concentrationAnother type of Wrong Concentration is that used to develop forms of knowledge falling outside of the Buddhas teachings and belonging to yogic doctrines and practices for example staring at an external object  such as the sun or the moon  or at certain kinds of internal objectsWhen the mind becomes steady for a moment you lose your sense of the body and become fastened on the object to the point where your mindfulness and alertness lose their mooringsYou then drift along in the wake of the object in whatever direction your thoughts may take you up to see heaven or down to see hell seeing true things and false mixed together liking or disliking what you see losing your bearings lacking the mindfulness and alertness that form the presentAnother instance of Wrong Concentration is when  after youve begun practicing to the point where youve attained threshold concentration  you then stare down on the present focusing say on the properties of breath fire or earth forbidding the mind to think staring down getting into a trance until the property becomes more and more refined the mind becomes more and more refined using force to suppress the mind until awareness becomes so dim that you lose mindfulness and alertness and all sense of the body and mind Everything is absolutely snuffed out and still with no selfawarenessThis is called the plane of nonperception where you have no perception of anything at allYour awareness isnt wellrounded your mindfulness lacks circumspection and as a result discernment has no chance to ariseThis is called Wrong Concentration Wrong Release a mental blank  no awareness of past present or futureAnother instance of Wrong Concentration is when we can give rise to momentary concentration threshold concentration all the way to the four levels of jhana but arent adept at entering and leaving these levels so that we focus in until only the property of consciousness is left with no sense of the body This is called arupa jhanaBodily processes disappear leaving only the four types of mental acts which form the four levels of arupa jhana the first being when we focus on a feeling of space or emptinessThe mind attains such a relaxed sense of pleasure that we may take it to be a transcendent state or nibbana and so we search no further becoming idle and lazy making no further effort because we assume that weve finished our taskIn short we simply think or focus without having any finesse in what were doing  entering leaving or staying in place  and as a result our concentration becomes wrongBRight Concentration This starts with threshold concentration which acts as the basis for the four levels of jhana beginning with the first vitakka thinking of whichever aspect of the body you choose to take as your object such as the four physical properties starting with the inandout breathAnd then vicara adjusting expanding letting the breath sensations flow throughout the body and at the same time evaluating the results you obtainFor instance if the body feels uncomfortable or constricted adjust the breath until it feels right throughout the bodyThe mind then sticks to its single object This is termed ekaggataWhen mindfulness enters into the body keeping the breath in mind and alertness is present in full measure keeping track of the causes that produce results congenial to body and mind then your sense of the body will benefitBathed with mindfulness and alertness it feels light malleable and full  saturated with the power of mindfulness and alertnessThe mind also feels full This is termed pitiWhen both body and mind are full they grow quiet like a child who having eaten his fill rests quiet and contentThis is the cause of pleasure on the level of the Dhamma termed sukhaThese factors taken together form one stage of Right ConcentrationAs you continue practicing for a length of time the sense of fullness and pleasure in the body becomes greaterEkaggata  interest and absorption in your one object  becomes more intense because you have seen the results it producesThe mind becomes steady and determined focused with full mindfulness and alertness thoroughly aware of both body and mind and thus you can let go of your thinking and evaluating and enter the second jhanaThe second jhana has three factorsEkaggata Keep the mind with its one object the breath which is now more subtle and refined than before leaving simply a feeling of piti fullness of body and mindThe sensations of the body dont clash with one anotherThe four properties  earth water fire and wind  are properly balancedThe mind and body dont interfere with each other so both feel full and satisfiedThe body feels pleasant  solitary and quietThe mind too feels pleasant and at ease  solitary and quietWhen youre mindful alert and adept at doing this  entering staying in place and withdrawing  sidebenefits will resultFor example knowledge of certain matters will arise either on its own or after youve posed a question in the mindDoubts about certain issues will be put to restAs the sense of bodily pleasure grows stronger the sense of mental pleasure and ease grows stronger as well and thus you can let go of the sense of fullnessAwareness at this point becomes refined and so can detect a subtle level of the breath that feels bright open soothing and spaciousThis enables you to go on to the third jhanaThe third jhana has two factors pleasure and singleness of preoccupationThe pleasure youve been experiencing begins to waver in flashes as it reaches saturation point and begins to changeYou thus become aware of another subtler level of sensation and so the mind shifts to a sense of openness and emptinessThe breath grows still with no moving in or out full in every part of the bodyThis allows you to let go of the sense of pleasureThe mind enters this stage through the power of mindfulness and alertnessAwareness is tranquil and still bright in the present steady and on its ownIt lets go of the breath and is simply observantThe mind is still with no shifting back and forthBoth breath and mind are independentThe mind can let down its burdens and caresThe heart is solitary and one infused with mindfulness and alertnessWhen you reach this stage and stay with it properly youre practicing the fourth jhanaThe fourth jhana has two factorsEkaggata Your object becomes absolutely oneUpekkha You can let go of all thoughts of past and future the five Hindrances are completely cut awayThe mind is solitary clear and radiantThe six properties  earth water fire wind space and consciousness  become radiantThe heart feels spacious and clear thoroughly aware all around through the power of mindfulness and alertnessAs mindfulness becomes tempered and strong it turns into intuitive knowledge enabling you to see the true nature of body and mind sensations and mental acts past present and futureWhen this happens if you arent skilled you can become excited or upsetIn other words you may develop pubbenivasanussatiñana the ability to remember previous livesIf what you see is good you may get engrossed which will cause your mindfulness and alertness to weakenIf what you see is bad or displeasing you may get upset or distressed so intent on what you remember that your sense of the present is weakenedOr you may develop cutupapatañana The mind focuses on the affairs of other individuals and you see them as they die and are reborn on differing levelsIf you get carried away with what you see your reference to the present will weakenIf you find this happening you should take the mind in handIf anything pleasing arises hold back and keep mindfulness firmDont let yourself fall into kamasukhallikanuyoga contentment and delightIf anything bad or displeasing arises hold back  because it can lead to attakilamathanuyoga discontentment and distressDraw the mind into the present and guard against all thoughts of approval and disapprovalKeep the mind neutralThis is the middle way the mental attitude that forms the Path and gives rise to another level of awareness in which you realize for instance how inconstant it is to be a living being When things go well youre happy and pleased when things go badly youre pained and upsetThis awareness enables you truly to know the physical sensations and mental acts youre experiencing and leads to a sense of disenchantment termed nibbidañanaYou see all fashionings as inconstant harmful stressful and hard to bear as lying beyond the control of the heartAt this point the mind disentangles itself This is termed viragadhamma dispassionIt feels no desire or attraction it doesnt gulp down or lie fermenting in sensations or mental acts past present or futureIt develops a special level of intuition that comes from withinWhat you never before knew now you know what you never before met with now you see through the power of mindfulness and alertness gathering in at a single point and turning into asavakkhayañana enabling you to disentangle and free yourself from mundane states of mind  in proportion to the extent of your practice  and so attain the transcendent qualities beginning with streamentryAll of this is termed Right Concentration being skilled at entering staying in place and withdrawing giving rise to Right View correct views in line with the truthRight Practice in which you conduct yourself with full circumspection in all aspects of the triple training with virtue concentration and discernment coming together in the heartThis then is Right ConcentrationFor the most part people who have attained true insight have done so in the four levels of jhanaAlthough there may be others who have gone wrong in the practice of jhana well achieve the proper results if we study so as to gain an understanding and adjust our practice so as to bring it into lineThis ends the discussion of Right ConcentrationAll that we have discussed so far can be summarized under three headings Right View and Right Resolve come under the heading of discernment Right Speech Right Action and Right Livelihood under the heading of virtue and Right Effort Right Mindfulness and Right Concentration under the heading of concentrationSo altogether we have virtue concentration and discernmentThere are three levels of virtue Observance of these precepts or rules  dealing merely with words and deeds  forms the lower or preliminary level of virtue which is what makes us into fullfledged human beingsMajjhimasila the medium level of virtue ie keeping watch over your words and deeds so that they cause no harm and in addition keeping watch over your thoughts so as to keep our mental kamma upright in three ways bAbyapada abandoning thoughts of ill will hatred and vengeance and developing thoughts of good will instead thinking of the good aspects of the people who have angered usWhen people make us angry it comes from the fact that our dealings with them  in which we associate with and assist one another  sometimes lead to disappointmentThis gives rise to dislike and irritation which in turn cause us to brood so that we develop hurt feelings that grow into anger and thoughts of retaliationThus we should regard such people from many angles for ordinarily as human beings they should have some good to themIf they dont act well toward us they may at least speak well to usOr if they dont act or speak well to us perhaps their thoughts may be wellmeaning to at least some extentThus when you find your thoughts heading in the direction of anger or dislike you should sit down and think in two ways Anger is something worthless like the scum floating on the surface of a lakeIf were stupid we wont get to drink the clean water that lies underneath or if we drink the scum we may catch a diseaseA person who is bad to you is like someone sunk in filthIf youre stupid enough to hate or be angry with such people its as if you wanted to go sit in the filth with themIs that what you wantThink about this until any thoughts of ill will and anger disappearcSammaditthi abandoning wrong views and mental darknessIf our minds lack the proper training and education we may come to think that we and all other living beings are born simply as accidents of nature that father and mother have no special meaning that good and evil dont existSuch views deviate from the truth and can dissuade us from restraining the evil that lies within us and from searching for and fostering the goodTo believe that theres no good or evil that death is annihilation is Wrong View  a product of shortsighted thinking and poor discernment seeing things for what they arentSo we should abandon such views and educate ourselves searching for knowledge of the Dhamma and associating with people wiser than we so that they can show us the bright pathWell then be able to reform our views and make them Right which is one form of mental uprightnessVirtue on this level when we can maintain it well will qualify us to be heavenly beingsThe qualities of heavenly beings which grow out of human values will turn us into human beings who are divine in our virtues for to guard our thoughts words and deeds means that we qualify for heaven in this lifetimeThis is one aspect of the merit developed by a person who observes the middle level of virtueUparimasila higher virtue where virtue merges with the Dhamma in the area of mental activityThere are two sides to higher virtue  Ill will lies at the essence of killing for it causes us to destroy our own goodness and that of others  and when our minds can kill off our own goodness whats to keep us from killing other people and animals as wellRestlessness lies at the essence of taking what isnt givenThe mind wanders about taking hold of matters concerning other people sometimes their good points sometimes their badTo fasten onto their good points isnt too serious for it can give us at least some nourishmentAs long as were going to steal other peoples business and make it our own we might as well take their silver and goldTheir bad points though are like trash theyve thrown away  scraps and bones with nothing of any substance  and yet even so we let the mind feed on themTo know that other people are possessive of their bad points and guard them well and yet still to take hold of these things to think about should be classed as a form of taking what isnt givenSensual desires lie at the essence of sensual misconductThe mind feels an attraction for sensual objects  thoughts of past or future sights sounds smells tastes or tactile sensations  or for sensual defilements  passion aversion or delusion  to the point where we forget ourselvesMental states such as these can be said to overstep the bounds of propriety in sensual mattersDoubt lies at the essence of lyingIn other words our minds are unsure with nothing reliable or true to themWe have no firm principles and so drift along under the influence of all kinds of thoughts and preoccupationsDrowsiness is intoxication  discouragement dullness forgetfulness with no mindfulness or restraint watching over the mindThis is what it means to be drugged or drunkAll of these unskillful qualities are things we should eliminate by training the heart along the lines ofbBhavanakicca qualities to be developed Vicara Evaluate and be observantBe sensitive to whether or not youve received a sense of comfort and relaxation from your in and outbreathingIf not tend to the breath and adjust it in a variety of ways eg in long and out long in long and out short in short and out short in short and out long in slow and out slow in fast and out fast in gently and out gently in strong and out strong in throughout the body and out throughout the bodyAdjust the breath until it gives good results to both body and mind and youll be able to kill off feelings of ill will and hatredPiti When you get good results  for instance when the subtle breath sensations in the body merge and flow together permeating the entire sense of the body  the breath is like an electric wire the various parts of the body such as the bones are like electricity poles mindfulness and alertness are like a power source and awareness is thus bright and radiantBoth body and mind feel satisfied and fullThis is piti or rapture which can kill off feelings of drowsinessSukha Now that feelings of restlessness and anxiety have disappeared a sense of pleasure and ease for body and mind arisesThis pleasure is what kills off restlessnessEkaggata Doubts and uncertainty fade into the distanceThe mind reaches oneness of object in a state of normalcy and equilibriumThis normalcy of mind which is maintained through the power of the discipline of mindfulness forms the essence of virtue firmness steadiness stabilityAnd the resulting flavor or nourishment of virtue is tranquillity lightheartedness and a sense of independence for the mindWhen freedom of this sort arises within us this is called the development of silanussati the mindfulness of virtueThis is virtue that attains excellence  leading to the paths their fruitions and nibbana  and thus can be called uparimasila higher virtueTo summarize there are three levels of virtue external intermediate and internalIn ultimate terms however there are two  Transcendent virtue virtue thats constant and sure going straight to the heart bathing the heart with its nourishmentThis arises from the practice of tranquillity meditation and insight meditationTranquillity meditation forms the cause and insight meditation the result discovering the true nature of the elements aggregates and senses seeing clearly the four Noble Truths in proportion to our practice of the Path abandoning the first three of the Fetters bVicikiccha doubt concerning whats genuine and true and whats counterfeit and falseThe power of Right View allows us to see that the quality to which we awaken exists at all times and that the true qualities enabling us to awaken also exist and are made effective through the power of the practices were followingOur knowledge is definite and trueOur doubts concerning the virtues of the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha are cleared up for goodThis is called becoming a niyatapuggala a person who is certain and surecSilabbataparamasa When the heart abandons this Fetter it no longer fondles theories concerning moral virtue its no longer stuck merely on the level of manners and activitiesGood and evil are accomplished through the heart activities and actions are something separateEven though people who reach this level do good  taking the precepts making gifts and offerings or meditating in line with the good customs of the world  theyre not caught up on any of these things because their hearts have reached the nourishment of virtueThey arent stuck on the particulars ie their actions and activities nor are they stuck on the purpose ie the meaning or intent of their various good mannersTheir hearts dwell in the nourishment of virtue tranquillity stability normalcy of mindJust as a person who has felt the nourishment that comes from food permeating his body isnt stuck on either the food or its flavor  because hes received the benefits of the nourishment it provides  in the same way the hearts of people who have reached the essence of virtue are no longer stuck on manners or activities particulars or purposes because theyve tasted virtues nourishmentThis is thus classed as transcendent virtue the first stage of nibbanaEven though such people may be destined for further rebirth theyre special people apart from the ordinaryAny person whose practice reaches this level can be counted as fortunate as having received dependable wealth like ingots of goldJust as gold can be used as currency all over the world because it has special value for all human beings  unlike paper currency whose use is limited to specific countries  in the same way a heart thats truly attained virtue has a value in this life that will remain constant in lives to comeThus a person who has reached this level has received part of the Noble Wealth of those who practice the religionConcentration has three levels Kamavacarakhanikasamadhi The mind keeps thinking coming to rest and running along after skillful preoccupations  either internal or external  on the sensory level sights sounds smells flavors tactile sensations or ideasAn example of this is when the mind becomes quiet and rested for a moment as we sit chanting or listening to a sermonIn other words the mind grows still for momentary periods in the same way that a person walks One foot takes a step while the other foot rests on the ground providing the energy needed to reach ones goalThis is thus called momentary concentration something possessed by people all over the worldWhether or not we practice concentration the mind is always behaving this way by its very natureThis is what is called the bhavangacitta or bhavangapada The mind stops for a moment and then moves onIn developing higher levels of concentration we have to start out with this ordinary level as our basisOtherwise the higher levels probably wouldnt be possibleStill this level of concentration cant be used as a basis for discernment which is why we have to go further in our practiceRupavacaraupacarasamadhi This refers to the first jhana in which the mind comes inward to rest on a single preoccupation within the body fixing its attention for example on the inandout breathWhen the mind stays with its one object this is called ekaggataAt the same time theres mindfulness keeping the breath in mind This is called vitakkaThe mind then adjusts and expands the various aspects of the breath throughout the entire body evaluating them mindfully with complete circumspection This is called alertness or vicara which is what is aware of causes and resultsMindfulness the cause is what does the workThus vitakka and vicara cooperate in focusing on the same topicWe are then aware of the results as they arise  feelings of fullness pleasure and ease for body and mindAt this point the mind lets down its burdens and concerns to rest for a while like a person walking along who meets with something pleasing and attractive and so stops to look Both feet are standing still stepping neither forward nor backIf we arent skilled enough to go on any further well then retreatIf we see results  such as signs and visions  arising in the mind we may get excited and so cause our original preoccupation to waver or fadeLike a person sitting on a chair If he sees something appealing in front of him he may become so interested that he leans forward and reaches out his hand he may even begin to budge a bit from his seat or stand up completelyIn the same way if we get engrossed in visions thoughts or views while were engaged in threshold concentration we can become excited and pleased  we may even think that weve reached the transcendent  and this can cause our concentration to degenerateIf we try to do it again and cant we may then seize the opportunity to say that weve gone beyond the practice of concentration so that we can now take the way of discernment  thinking pondering and letting go in line with nothing more than our own views and ideasThis though is not likely to succeed because our knowledge has no firm basis or core like a wheel with no axle or hub How can it get anywhereThe power of threshold concentration if we dont watch after it well is bound to deteriorate and well be left with nothing but old leftover conceptsRupavacaraappanasamadhi This refers to the practice of all four levels of rupa jhanaThe first jhana has five factors directed thought evaluation fullness pleasure and singleness of preoccupationThe second level has three fullness pleasure and singleness of preoccupationThe third has two pleasure and singleness of preoccupation and the fourth has two equanimity and singleness of preoccupationFixed penetration in the realm of form means that the mind focuses on the internal sense of the body remaining steadily with a single object  such as the inandout breath  until it reaches jhana beginning with the first level which is composed of directed thought evaluation fullness pleasure and singleness of preoccupationWhen you see results arising focus in on those results and they will then turn into the second level which has three factors fullness pleasure and singleness of preoccupationAs your focus becomes stronger it causes the sense of fullness to waver so you can now let go of that sense of fullness and your concentration turns into the third jhana in which only two factors are left pleasure and singleness of preoccupationThe mind has few burdens its focus is strong and the sense of inner light is radiantThis causes the feeling of pleasure to waver so that you can let go of that sense of pleasure and the mind attains oneness in a very subtle preoccupationThe preoccupation doesnt waver and neither does the mindIt stands firm in its freedomThis is called equanimity and singleness of preoccupation which form the fourth jhanaMindfulness is powerful alertness completeBoth are centered on a single preoccupation without getting snagged on any other allusions or perceptionsThis mental state is called the fourth jhana which has two factors Equanimity is the external attitude of the mind as for the real factors theyre mindfulness and singleness steady and firmThe mind experiences a sense of brightness the radiance that arises from its state of fixed penetrationMindfulness and alertness are circumspect and allround and so give rise to skill and proficiency in practicing jhana  in focusing staying in place stepping through the various levels withdrawing going back and forthWhen the mind behaves as you want it to no matter when you practice only then does this truly qualify as fixed penetration the basis for the arising of three qualities intuitive knowledge discernment and cognitive skillIntuitive knowledge here refers to knowledge or sensitivity of a deep and extraordinary sortFor example Cutupapatañana the ability to focus on the death and rebirth of other living beings  sometimes in good destinations sometimes in bad  together with the causes that lead them to be reborn in such waysThis gives rise to a sense of weariness and disenchantment with sensations and mental acts body and mindAsavakkhayañana knowing how to put an end to the defilements of the heart in accordance with the knowledge  the clear vision of the four Noble Truths  that accompanies the particular transcendent path reachedAnd there are still other forms of extraordinary knowledge such as iddhividhi the ability to display supernormal powers to make an image of oneself appear to other people dibbasota clairaudience dibbacakkhu clairvoyance  ie the ability to see objects at tremendous distancesDiscernment refers to discriminating knowledge clear comprehension knowledge in line with the truthFor example  Dhammapatisambhida acumen with regard to mental qualities knowing how to explain deep and subtle points so that other people will understandNiruttipatisambhida acumen with regard to different languagesAccording to the texts this includes knowing foreign languages and the languages of various other living beings by means of the eye of discernmentPatibhanapatisambhida acumen with regard to expression being fluent in making explanations and quickwitted in debate knowing the most strategic way to express thingsAll of these forms of discernment can arise from training the mind to attain fixed penetrationVijja  clear open knowledge free from any further concealments and aloka  brilliance radiance streaming out in all directions  enable us to see the true nature of sensations and mental acts in accordance with our powers of intuitive discernmentCognitive skill refers to clear uncanny knowledge that arises from the minds being firmly fixed in jhanaThere are eight sorts Manomayiddhi psychic powers influencing events through the power of thoughtIddhividhi the ability to display powers making ones body appear in a variety of waysDibbacakkhu clairvoyanceDibbasota clairaudienceCetopariyañana the ability to know the mental states of other peoplePubbenivasanussatiñana the ability to remember previous livesAsavakkhayañana the ability to put an end to the fermentations that defile the heartThus jhana on the level of fixed penetration is extremely importantIt can give us support on all sides  on the level of the world and of the Dhamma  and can bring success in our various activities both in our worldly affairs and in our Dhamma duties leading us on to the transcendentTo summarize there are two kinds of concentrationThat which helps us to fulfill our duties on the level of the Dhamma leading to vipassanañana or asavakkhayañana the knowledge that enables us  in accordance with the discernment and cognitive skills that arise  to abandon or cut off completely the mental currents that tend in the direction of the Fetters This is termed transcendent concentrationDiscernment is of three kinds Cintamayapañña discernment that comes from reflectingBhavanamayapañña discernment that comes from developing the mindSutamayapañña is the discernment that comes from having listened a great deal like the Venerable AnandaListening here though includes studying and taking interest in a variety of ways paying attention taking notes asking questions and taking part in discussions so as to become quickwitted and astuteEducation of all kinds comes down to two sorts learning the basic units such as the letters of the alphabet their sound and pronunciation so as to understand their accepted usage and learning how to put them together  for instance how to combine the letters so as to give rise to words and meanings  as when we complete our elementary education so that we wont be at a loss when were called on to read and write in the course of making a livingIn the area of the religion we have to study the letters of the Pali alphabet their combinations their meanings and pronunciationIf we dont understand clearly we should take an interest in asking questionsIf we have trouble memorizing we should jot down notes as a way of aiding our memory and expanding our conceptsIn addition we have to study by means of our sensesFor example when we see a visual object we should find out its truthWhen we hear sounds or words we should find out their truthWhen we smell an aroma we should consider it to see what it comes fromWe should take an interest in flavors so that we know what they come from and in tactile sensations  the heat and cold that touch the body  by studying such things as the way weather behavesAll of these forms of education are ways of giving rise to astuteness  both in the area of the world and in the area of the Dhamma  because they constitute a basic level of knowledge like the primary education offered in schoolsCintamayapañña refers to thinking and evaluating so as to learn the meaning and truth of ones beginning educationThis level of education draws out the meaning of the knowledge we have gained through studyingWhen we gain information we should reflect on it until we understand it so that we will be led by our sense of reason and not by gullibility or ignoranceThis is like a person who has used his knowledge of the alphabet to gain knowledge from books to complete his secondary educationSuch a person has reached the level where he can think things through clearlyIn the area of the Dhamma the same holds trueOnce we have learned the basics we should research and think through the content of the Teaching until we give rise to an understanding so that we can conduct ourselves correctly in line with the methods and aims taught by the sages of the pastThis level of discernment is what prepares us to conduct ourselves properly in line with the truths of the Doctrine and DisciplineThis is classed as an aspect of pariyatti dhamma Dhamma on the level of theoryBy learning the language and meaning of the Teaching we can become astute as far as theory is concerned but if we dont use that knowledge to train ourselves its as if we studied a profession  such as law  but then went out to become bandits so that our knowledge wouldnt give its proper resultsFor this reason weve been taught still another method which is the wellspring of discernment or mastery  ie the mental activity termed bhavanamayapaññaBhavanamayapañña discernment that arises exclusively from training the mind in concentrationIn other words this level of discernment isnt related to the old observations weve gained from the past because our old observations are bound to obscure the new observations imbued with the truth that can arise only right at the mindWhen you engage in this form of practice focus exclusively on the present taking note of a single thing not getting involved with past or futureSteady the mind bringing it into the presentGather virtue concentration and discernment all into the presentThink of your meditation object and bring your powers of evaluation to bear on it  say by immersing mindfulness in the body focusing on such objects as the inandout breathWhen you do this knowledge will ariseanam udapadi Intuitive knowledge of things we have never before studied or known will appearFor example pubbenivasanussatiñana  the ability to remember our present life and past lives cutupapatañana  the ability to know living beings as they die and are reborn  well or poorly happily or miserably  knowing the causes and results of how they fare asavakkhayañana  the ability to cleanse ourselves of the fermentations that defile the mind thinning them out or eliminating them altogether as we are ableThese three forms of knowledge dont arise for people who simply study or think things through in ordinary waysThey form a mental skill that arises from the practice of concentration and are an aspect of Dhamma on the level of practiceAnother aspect  pañña udapadi Clear discernment of the true nature of the elements aggregates and senses arisesWe can focus on these things by way of the mind and know them in terms of the four Noble Truths stress which arises from a cause ie ignorance and craving and then nirodha the ceasing and disbanding of stress which occurs as the result of a cause ie the Path composed of practices for the mindThese things can be known by means of the discernment that arises exclusively and directly within us and is termed the eye of discernment or the eye of Dhamma the eye of the mind awakening from its slumbersVijja udapadi The eight forms of cognitive skill which follow the laws of cause and effect  means of practice that bring us results  can arise in a quiet mindAloko udapadi Brightness clarity relief and emptiness arise in such a mindThus the discernment that results from developing the mind differs from the beginning stages of discernment that come from studying and reflectingStudy and reflection are classed as Dhamma on the level of theory and can give only a preliminary level of knowledgeTheyre like a person who has awakened but has yet to open his eyesThe discernment that comes from developing the mind though is like waking up and seeing the truth  past present and future  in all four directionsWe can clearly see stress its cause its disbanding and the Path to its disbanding and so can absolutely abandon the first set of FettersOur hearts will then flow to nibbana just as the water in a mountain cataract is sure to flow to the seaThey will flow to their natural truth the mental fullness and completeness of a person who has practiced mental development until discernment arises withinWe will meet with a special form of skill  transcendent skill  whose power will stay with us always a quality thats certain and sure termed certain truth certain wisdom making us people certain for nibbanaSo this level of discernment  termed the discernment of liberating insight  is especially importantIt arises on its own not from cogitating along the lines of old concepts weve learned but from abandoning themOld concepts are what obscure the new knowledge thats ready to ariseThe nature of liberating insight is like an electric light Simply press the switch once and things all around are made brightIn the same way when the mind reaches a stage of readiness insight will arise in a single mental instant and everything will become clear elements aggregates and the sense mediaWell know on the one hand whats inconstant stressful and notself and on the other hand whats uncommon ie niccam  whats constant and true sukham  true happiness termed niramisasukha and atta  the selfThe eye of the mind can know both sides and let go both waysIts attached neither to whats inconstant stressful and notself nor to whats constant good and rightIt can let these things go in line with their true natureThe knowledge that comes from discernment cognitive skill and intuitive insight it can let go as wellIt isnt attached to views  for theres yet another separate sort of reality that has no this or that In other words it doesnt have the view or conceit I am It lets go of the assumptions that Thats the self Thats notself Thats constant Thats inconstant That arises That doesnt arise It can let go of these things completelyThats the Dhamma and yet it doesnt hold onto the Dhamma which is why we say that the Dhamma is notselfIt also doesnt hold on to the view that says notself It lets go of views causes and effects and isnt attached to anything at all dealing with wordings or meanings conventions or practicesThis then is discernment that arises from the development of the mindTo summarize The discernment that comes from studying and reflecting is classed as Dhamma on the level of theoryThe discernment that comes from developing the mind is classed as Dhamma on the level of practiceThe results that arise are two Transcendent discernment awareness that goes beyond the ordinary giving rise to clear realization withinPeople who reach this level are said to have awakened and opened their eyes which is what is meant by BuddhoTo summarize everything there are three main points Concentration which in terms of where its principles are found is the Suttanta PitakaDiscernment which in terms of where its principles are found is the Abhidhamma PitakaExpressed in terms of their meaning they refer to three modes of behavior to be developed  Concentration steadying the mind in a single preoccupation not latching onto thoughts of the past or future holding fast to the presentConcentration is a means of killing off bhavatanha ie mental states that stray off into thoughts of past and futureThe act of straying is craving for becoming looking for a new place to take birthThis is what is meant by sambhavesin When concentration arises the mind can let go of such cravingDiscernment circumspect knowledge that guards over the mind to keep it from being influenced involved and attachedDiscernment is what enables us to abandon vibhavatanha in that the characteristic of this form of craving is the wavering that occurs in the mental moment arising in the presentThis we can perceive through intuitive discernmentDiscernment knows stress intuitive knowledge cuts the root of stress cognitive skill  clear knowledge of past future and present  distinguishes cause result and release without being attached This is whats meant by the skill of releaseAnd that is the heart of the Buddhas teachingsOn the level of the human body diseases are explained as resulting from the aggravation or imbalance of any of these four physical propertiesDiseases are classified by how they feel Fevers are attributed to the fire property dizziness and faintness to the wind property constipation to the earth property etcWellbeing is defined as a state in which none of these properties is dominantAll are quiet unaroused balanced and stillThere are a number of lists of dhatus given in the Pali canonThe six dhatus are the four physical properties plus space and cognizanceThe dhatus are the six senses their respective objects and the acts of consciousness associated with eachIf this translation is in any way inaccurate or misleading I ask forgiveness of the author and reader for having unwittingly stood in their wayAs for whatever may be accurate  conducive to the aims intended by the author  I hope the reader will make the best use of it translating it a few steps further into the heart so as to attain those aims The translatorAjaan Fuang my teacher once discovered that a snake had moved into his roomEvery time he entered the room he saw it slip into a narrow space behind a storage cabinetAnd even though he tried leaving the door to the room open during the daytime the snake wasnt willing to leaveSo for three days they lived togetherHe was very careful not to startle the snake or make it feel threatened by his presenceBut finally on the evening of the third day as he was sitting in meditation he addressed the snake quietly in his mindHe said Look its not that I dont like youI dont have any bad feelings for youBut our minds work in different waysItd be very easy for there to be a misunderstanding between usNow there are lots of places out in the woods where you can live without the uneasiness of living with me And as he sat there spreading thoughts of metta to the snake the snake leftWhen Ajaan Fuang first told me this story it made me stop and reconsider my understanding of what metta isMetta is a wish for happiness  true happiness  and the Buddha says to develop this wish for ourselves and everyone else With metta for the entire cosmos cultivate a limitless heart But whats the emotional quality that goes along with that wishMany people define it as lovingkindness implying a desire to be there for other people to cherish them to provide them with intimacy nurture and protectionThe idea of feeling love for everyone sounds very noble and emotionally satisfyingBut when you really stop to think about all the beings in the cosmos there are a lot of them who  like the snake  would react to your lovingkindness with suspicion and fearRather than wanting your love they would rather be left aloneOthers might try to take unfair advantage of your lovingkindness reading it as a sign either of your weakness or of your endorsement of whatever they want to doIn none of these cases would your lovingkindness lead to anyones true happinessWhen this is the case youre left wondering if the Buddhas instructions on universal metta are really realistic or wiseBut as I learned from Ajaan Fuangs encounter with the snake metta is not necessarily an attitude of lovingkindnessIts more an attitude of goodwill  wishing the other person well but realizing that true happiness is something that each of us ultimately will have to find for him or herself and sometimes most easily when we go our separate waysThis understanding of metta is borne out in the Pali Canon first of all in the word itselfThe Pali language has another word for love  pema  whereas metta is related to the word mitta or friendUniversal metta is friendliness for allThe fact that this friendliness equates with goodwill is shown in the four passages in the Canon where the Buddha recommends phrases to hold in mind when developing thoughts of mettaThese phrases provide his clearest guide not only to the emotional quality that underlies metta but also to the understanding of happiness that explains why its wise and realistic to develop metta for allThe first set of phrases comes in a passage where the Buddha recommends thoughts to counter ill willThese phrases are chanted daily in Theravada communities the world overNotice that last statement May they look after themselves with ease Youre not saying that youre going to be there for all beings all the timeAnd most beings would be happier knowing that they could depend on themselves rather than having to depend on youI once heard a Dharma teacher say that he wouldnt want to live in a world where there was no suffering because then he wouldnt be able to express his compassion  which when you think about it is an extremely selfish wishHe needs other people to suffer so he can feel good about expressing his compassionA better attitude would be May all beings be happyMay they be able to look after themselves with ease That way they can have the happiness of independence and selfrelianceAnother set of metta phrases is in the Karaniya Metta SuttaThey start out with a simple wish for happinessBut then they continue with a wish that all beings avoid the causes that would lead them to unhappinessIn repeating these phrases you wish not only that beings be happy but also that they avoid the actions that would lead to bad karma to their own unhappinessYou realize that happiness has to depend on action For people to find true happiness they have to understand the causes for happiness and act on themThey also have to understand that true happiness is harmlessIf it depends on something that harms others its not going to lastThose who are harmed are sure to do what they can to destroy that happinessAnd then theres the plain quality of sympathy If you see someone suffering its painfulIf you have any sensitivity at all its hard to feel happy when you know that your happiness is causing suffering for othersSo again when you express goodwill youre not saying that youre going to be there for them all the timeYoure hoping that all beings will wise up about how to find happiness and be there for themselvesThe Karaniya Metta Sutta goes on to say that when youre developing this attitude you want to protect it in the same way that a mother would protect her only childSome people misread this passage  in fact many translators have mistranslated it  thinking that the Buddha is telling us to cherish all living beings the same way a mother would cherish her only childBut thats not what hes actually sayingTo begin with he doesnt mention the word cherish at allAnd instead of drawing a parallel between protecting your only child and protecting other beings he draws the parallel between protecting the child and protecting your goodwillThis fits in with his other teachings in the CanonNowhere does he tell people to throw down their lives to prevent every cruelty and injustice in the world but he does praise his followers for being willing to throw down their lives for their preceptsThe verses here carry a similar sentiment You should be devoted to cultivating and protecting your goodwill to make sure that your virtuous intentions dont waverThis is because you dont want to harm anyoneHarm can happen most easily when theres a lapse in your goodwill so you do whatever you can to protect this attitude at all timesThis is why as the Buddha says toward the end of the sutta you should stay determined to practice this form of mindfulness the mindfulness of keeping in mind your wish that all beings be happy to make sure that it always informs the motivation for everything you doThis is why the Buddha explicitly recommends developing thoughts of metta in two situations where its especially important  and especially difficult  to maintain skillful motivation when others are hurting you and when you realize that youve hurt othersIf others are harming you with their words or actions  even if bandits were to carve you up savagely limb by limb with a twohandled saw  the Buddha recommends training your mind in this wayIn doing this the Buddha says you make your mind as expansive as the River Ganges or as large as the earth  in other words larger than the harm those people are doing or threatening to do to youHe himself embodied this teaching after Devadattas attempt on his lifeAs he told Mara  who had come to taunt him while he was resting from a painful injury  I lie down with sympathy for all beings When you can maintain this enlarged state of mind in the face of pain the harm that others can do to you doesnt seem so overwhelming and youre less likely to respond in unskillful waysYou provide protection  both for yourself and for others  against any unskillful things you otherwise might be tempted to doAs for the times when you realize that youve harmed others the Buddha recommends that you understand that remorse is not going to undo the harm so if an apology is appropriate you apologizeIn any case you resolve not to repeat the harmful action againThen you spread thoughts of goodwill in all directionsThis accomplishes several thingsIt reminds you of your own goodness so that you dont  in defense of your selfimage  revert to the sort of denial that refuses to admit that any harm was doneIt strengthens your determination to stick with your resolve not to do harmAnd it forces you to examine your actions to see their actual effect If any of your other habits are harmful you want to abandon them before they cause further harmIn other words you dont want your goodwill to be just an ungrounded floating ideaYou want to apply it scrupulously to the nittygritty of all your interactions with othersThat way your goodwill becomes honestAnd it actually does have an impact which is why we develop this attitude to begin with to make sure that it truly animates our thoughts words and deeds in a way that leads to a happiness harmless for allFinally theres a passage where the Buddha taught the monks a chant for spreading goodwill to all snakes and other creeping thingsThe story goes that a monk meditating in a forest was bitten by a snake and diedThe monks reported this to the Buddha and he replied that if that monk had spread goodwill to all four great families of snakes the snake wouldnt have bitten himThen the Buddha taught the monks a protective chant for expressing metta not only for snakes but also for all beingsThe last statement in this expression of metta takes into consideration the truth that living together is often difficult  especially for beings of different species that can harm one another  and the happiest policy for all concerned is often to live harmlessly apartThese different ways of expressing metta show that metta is not necessarily the quality of lovingkindnessMetta is better thought of as goodwill and for two reasonsThe first is that goodwill is an attitude you can express for everyone without fear of being hypocritical or unrealisticIt recognizes that people will become truly happy not as a result of your caring for them but as a result of their own skillful actions and that the happiness of selfreliance is greater than any happiness that comes from dependencyThe second reason is that goodwill is a more skillful feeling to have toward those who would react unskillfully to your lovingkindnessThere are probably people youve harmed in the past who would rather not have anything to do with you ever again so the intimacy of lovingkindness would actually be a source of pain for them rather than joyThere are also people who when they see that you want to express lovingkindness would be quick to take advantage of itAnd there are plenty of animals out there who would feel threatened by any overt expressions of love from a human beingIn these cases a more distant sense of goodwill  that you promise yourself never to harm those people or those beings  would be better for everyone involvedThis doesnt mean that lovingkindness is never an appropriate expression of goodwillYou simply have to know when its appropriate and when its notIf you truly feel metta for yourself and others you cant let your desire for warm feelings of love and intimacy render you insensitive to what would actually be the most skillful way to promote true happiness for allOkay everyone pay attentionDont let your mind focus on this person or thatCreate the feeling that right now youre sitting alone on a mountain or in a forest somewhere all by yourselfWhat do you have sitting here right nowJust body and mind thats all only these two thingsEverything sitting in this physical lump here is body Mind is whats aware of sense impressions and is thinking in the presentThese two things are also called nama and rupaNama refers to what has no rupa or formAll thoughts and sensations such as feelings perceptions thoughtfabrications and consciousness are namaTheyre all formlessWhen the eye sees forms those forms are called rupaThe awareness of forms is called namaTogether theyre called nama and rupa or simply body and mindUnderstand that whats sitting here in the present moment is just body and mindEverything comes out of these two thingsIf you want peace these are the only things you have to knowBut the mind at present is still untrainedIts dirtyUncleanIts not the primal mindWe have to train it by making it peaceful from time to timeSome people think that concentration means sitting but the truth of the matter is that standing sitting walking and lying down are part of the practice tooYou can practice concentration at any timeConcentration literally means firm intent To practice concentration you dont have to imprison the mindSome people think I have to go look for some peace to sit without any issues arising at allI want to sit in total silence but thats a dead person not a live oneTo practice concentration is to give rise to knowledge to give rise to discernmentConcentration is a firm intent focused on a single objectWhat kind of object is a single objectThe proper objectOrdinarily we want to sit in total silencePeople come and say I try to sit in concentration but my mind wont stay putFirst it runs off one place then it runs off somewhere elseI dont know how to make it stop still Its not the sort of thing you can stopYoure not trying to stop it from running for the running is where its aware of itselfPeople complain It runs off and I pull it back again then it walks off again and I pull it back once more So they just sit there pulling back and forth like thisThey think their minds running around but actually the only things that run are our impressionsFor example look at this hall here Wow you say its so big But the hall isnt whats big just our impression of itActually this hall is just the size it is not big not small but we run around after our impressions of thingsMeditating to find peace You have to understand what this word peace isIf you dont understand it you wont be able to find itFor example suppose you brought a pen with you to the monastery today one that you love an expensive one that cost or bahtAnd suppose that on your way here you put the pen in your front pocket but later you took it out and put it somewhere else like your back pocketNow when you feel for it in your front pocket Its not thereYou panicYou panic because you dont see the truth of the matterYou get all upsetStanding walking coming and going you cant stop worrying about your lost penYour misunderstanding causes you to suffer What a shameIve only had it for a few days and now its lostBut then you remember Oh of courseWhen I went to bathe I put the pen in my back pocket As soon as you remember this you feel better already even without seeing your penSee thatYoure happy already you can stop worrying about your penYoure sure about it nowAs you walk along you run your hand over your back pocket and there it isYour mind was lying to youYour pen wasnt lost but the mind lied to you that it wasYou suffered because you didnt knowNow when you see the pen and your doubts are gone your worries calm downThis sort of peace and calm comes from seeing the cause of the problem samudaya the cause of sufferingAs soon as youre sure that the pen is in your back pocket theres nirodha the cessation of sufferingSo you have to contemplate to find peaceWhat people usually refer to as peace is simply the calming of the mind not the calming of the defilementsYoure just sitting on top of your defilements like a rock sitting on the grassThe grass cant grow because the rock is sitting on itIn three or four days you take the rock off the grass and it starts growing againThe grass didnt really dieIt was just suppressedThe same holds for sitting in concentration The mind is calmed but the defilements arent which means that concentration isnt for sureTo find real peace you have to contemplateConcentration is one kind of peace like the rock sitting on the grassYou can leave it there many days but when you pick it up the grass starts growing againThats only temporary peaceThe peace of discernment is like never picking up the rock just leaving it there where it isThe grass cant possibly grow againThats real peace the calming of the defilements for sureThats discernmentWe speak of discernment and concentration as separate things but actually theyre one and the sameDiscernment is just the movement of concentrationThey come from the same mind but go in different directions with different characteristics like this mango hereA small mango eventually grows larger and larger until its ripeIts all the same mangoTheyre not different onesWhen its small its this mangoWhen its large its this mangoWhen its ripe its this mangoOnly its characteristics changeWhen you practice the Dhamma one condition is called concentration the later condition is called discernment but in fact virtue concentration and discernment are all the same thing just like the mangoActually in practicing the Dhamma whatever happens you have to start from the mindDo you know what this mind isWhat is the mind likeWhat is itWhere is itNobody knowsAll we know is that we want to go over here or over there we want this and we want that the mind feels happy or sad but the mind itself we cant knowWhat is the mindThe mind isnt is anythingWeve come up with the supposition that whatever receives impressions both good and bad we call heart or mind Like the owner of a houseWhoever receives the guests is the owner of the houseThe guests cant receive the ownerThe owner stays put at homeWhen guests come to see him he has to receive themWho receives sense impressionsWho lets go of sense impressionsThats what we call mind But we dont understand it so we think around in circles What is the mindWhat is the heart Dont confuse the issue like thisWhat is it that receives impressionsSome impressions it likes and some it doesntWho is thatIs there something that likes and dislikesSure there is but we dont know what its likeThats what we call mind UnderstandDont go looking far awayIn our practice its not necessary to talk of concentration or vipassana just call it practicing the Dhamma thats enoughAnd start following this practice from your own mindWhat is the mindThe mind is what receives or is aware of sense impressionsWith some sense impressions theres pleasure with others theres sorrowThe thing that receives impressions leads us to happiness and suffering right and wrong but it isnt a thingWe suppose it to be a thing but its really only namadhammaIs goodness a thingIs evilDo happiness and suffering have a shapeNoAre they round or squareHow short or longDo you knowTheyre namadhammaThey cant be compared to things  but we know that theyre thereSo were told to begin the practice by calming the mindMake it awareIf the mind is aware itll be at peaceSome people dont go for awarenessThey just want to have peace to the point where theres nothing  so they never learn anythingIf we dont have this one who knows what is there to base our practice onWith no long theres no short with no right theres no wrongPeople these days keep studying looking to understand whats right and whats wrong whats good and evil but they dont know neitherrightnessnorwrongnessAll theyre looking to know is whats right and wrong Im going to take only whats rightI wont take whats wrongWhy should I If you try to take only whats right in a short while itll go wrongIts right for the sake of wrongPeople keep searching for whats right and wrong but they dont try to find whats neitherrightnessnorwrongnessThey study about good and bad they search for merit and evil but they dont study the point where theres neither merit nor evilThey study issues of long and short but the issue of neither long nor short they dont studyThis knife has a blade a back and a handleWhen you pick it up can you lift only the bladeCan you lift only the back of the blade or the handleThe handle is the handle of the knife the back the back of the knife the blade the blade of the knifeWhen you pick up the knife you pick up all three parts togetherIn the same way if you pick up whats good whats bad must followPeople search for whats good and try to throw away whats bad but they dont study whats neither good nor badIf you dont study this things never come to an endIf you pick up goodness badness comes along with itIt follows right alongIf you pick up happiness suffering follows alongTheyre connectedThe practice of clinging to whats good and rejecting whats bad is the Dhamma of children Dhamma for children to toy around withSure if you want you can take just this much but if you grab onto whats good whats bad will followThe end of this path gets all cluttered upSo its not so goodTake a simple exampleYou have childrenNow suppose you want to take only the love and not the hatredThis is the thinking of someone who doesnt understand these two thingsIf you take the love hatred will come running in its wakeSo when you set your heart on practicing the Dhamma you have to use discernmentStudy whats good to see what its likeStudy whats bad in as much detail as you canNow when youre acquainted with good and bad what will you takeIf you take the good bad comes running in its wakeYou dont study whats neither good nor badThats what people have to be dragged to studyIm going to be like this Im going to be like that  but we never say Im not going to be anything because there isnt any me This we dont studyAll we want to take is goodnessIf we get goodness we dont understand itWe get intoxicated with itIf things get too good theyll start to go bad and so we keep running back and forth like thisWe rest the mind to make it calm in order to become acquainted with what receives sense impressions to see what it isThats why were told to keep track of the mind to keep track of what knows Train the mind to be pureHow pure should you make itIf its really pure the mind should be above both good and evil pure even above purityDoneOnly then are things over and doneWhen we practice sitting in concentration thats just a temporary kind of peaceWhen its peaceful issues ariseIf theres an issue theres what knows the issue tests it questions it keeps after it examines itIf the mind is simply blank then nothing happensSome people really imprison the mind thinking that that sort of peace is the genuine practice but genuine peace is not just peace of mindIts not just peaceful in that wayI want to take just the ease and happiness and not the stress and suffering Once youre peaceful in this way taking just the ease and happiness after a while it gets uncomfortableDiscomfort comes in its wakeGet so that theres no happiness and suffering in the mindThats where theres real peaceThis is a subject that people rarely study rarely understandTo train the mind in the right way to make it bright to develop discernment Dont think you can do it by sitting and making it just stillThats the rock sitting on the grassPeople jump to the conclusion that concentration is sittingThats just a name for concentration but really if the mind has concentration walking is concentration sitting is concentration  concentration with the walking concentration with the sitting the standing the lying downThats the practiceSome people complain I cant meditateIts too irritatingWhenever I sit down I think of this and that I think of my house and my familyI cant do itIve got too much bad kammaI should let my bad kamma run out first and then come back and try meditating Go ahead just try itTry waiting until your bad kamma runs outThis is how we thinkWhy do we think like thisThats what were studyingAs soon as we sit the mind goes way over thereWe track it down and bring it back  and then it goes off againThis is how we studyBut most of us want to skip classWere like a student who skips class who doesnt want to study his lessonsWe dont want to see the mind when its happy when its sufferingWe dont want to see it change but what will we ever knowYou have to stay with the changing like thisGet acquainted with this Oh the mind is like thisOne moment it thinks of that the next moment it thinks of this thats its ordinary nature Know it when it thinksKnow when its thoughts are good when theyre bad when theyre right and wrongKnow what its likeWhen we know the affairs of the mind then even if were simply sitting thinking about this or that the mind is still in concentrationIf we know what its up to we dont get irritated or distractedLet me give you an exampleSuppose you have a pet monkey at homeIt doesnt sit stillIt likes to jump around and grab hold of thingsThats how monkeys areNow you come to the monasteryWe have a monkey here too and this monkey doesnt stay still eitherIt jumps around and grabs things just the same but it doesnt irritate you does itWhyBecause youre acquainted with monkeysYou know what theyre likeIf you know just one monkey no matter how many provinces you go to no matter how many monkeys you see they dont irritate you rightThats someone who understands monkeysIf we understand monkeys then we wont become monkeysIf you dont understand monkeys then as soon as you see a monkey you become a monkey yourself rightWhen you see it grabbing this and that you think Grrr You get angry and irritatedThat damned monkey Thats someone who doesnt understand monkeysSomeone who knows monkeys sees that the monkey at home and the monkey in the monastery are the same monkey and so why should they irritate youWhen you understand what monkeys are like thats enoughYou can be at peaceIf the monkey runs around its only the monkey runningYou dont run around with itYou dont become a monkey tooIf it jumps in front of you and behind you you dont get irritated by the monkey  because you understand monkeys and so you dont become a monkeyIf you dont understand monkeys you become a monkey  understandThis is how things grow calmWe have to know sense impressions observe sense impressionsSome are likable some are not but so whatThats their businessThats what theyre likeJust like monkeysAll monkeys are the same monkeyWe understand sense impressionsSometimes theyre likable sometimes theyre notThats what theyre likeWe have to get acquainted with themWhen were acquainted with them we let them goSense impressions arent for sureTheyre inconstant stressful and notselfWe keep looking at them in that wayWhen the eye ear nose tongue body and mind receive impressions we know them just like knowing monkeysThis monkey is just like the monkey at homeThen we can be at peaceWhen sense impressions arise know themWhy run after themImpressions arent for sureOne minute theyre one way the next minute anotherSometimes they stay as they were beforeThey exist through changeAnd all of us here exist through changeThe breath goes out then it comes back inIt changes like thisTry only breathing in Can you do thatHow many minutes would you lastOr try just breathing out without breathing inIf there were no change could you surviveYou wouldnt survive at allYou need to have both the inbreath and the outbreathOnly then can you walk to the monasteryIf you just held your breath all the way coming here youd be dead by nowYou wouldnt have made itSo understand thisSense impressions are the sameThey have to be thereIf they werent there you couldnt develop any discernmentIf there were no wrong there could be no rightYou have to be right first before you can see whats wrongOr you have to be wrong first before you can recognize whats rightThats the way things normally areIf youre a student of the mind the more sense impressions the betterBut if you dont like sense impressions if you dont want to deal with them youre like the student who skips class who doesnt want to learn or to listen to his teacherThese sense impressions are teaching usWhen we know sense impressions in this way were practicing DhammaWe know what theyre like when they calm down we know what their issues are  just like seeing monkeysThe monkey in your home doesnt irritate youWhen you see the monkey here it doesnt irritate you  because you understand monkeys rightYou can be at easeThe practice of Dhamma is like thisIts not very far awayIts right with usThe Dhamma isnt about divine beings or anything like thatIts simply about us about what were doing right nowContemplate yourselfSometimes theres happiness sometimes suffering sometimes comfort sometimes irritation sometimes you love that person sometimes you hate this personThis is DhammaSeeTo know this Dhamma you have to read your sense impressionsOnly when youre acquainted with them can you let them goThat way you can be at easeThe realization will come flashing up HmmThis isnt for sure When your impression changes This isnt for sure You can be at your ease in the same way that you can be at ease when seeing monkeysYou wont have any doubtsIf youre acquainted with sense impressions youre acquainted with the DhammaYou can let go of sense impressionsYou see that theres nothing for sure about sensations in any way at allHave you ever been happyHave you ever been sadYou dont have to answer I can answer for you Yes Are these things for sureNoThis notforsureness is the BuddhaThe Buddha is the DhammaThe Dhamma is whats not for sureWhoever sees that things arent for sure sees for sure that thats the way they areThe way they are doesnt change into anything elseThats the way things areThats what the Dhamma is likeAnd thats what the Buddha is likeIf you see the Dhamma you see the Buddha if you see the Buddha you see the DhammaIf you know inconstancy notforsureness youll let things go of your own accordYou wont grasp onto themYou may say Dont break my glass But can you prevent something breakable from breakingIf it doesnt break now itll break later onIf you dont break it someone else willIf someone else doesnt break it one of the chickens willThe Buddha says to accept thisHe penetrated all the way to seeing that this glass is already brokenThis glass that isnt broken he saw as already brokenWhenever you pick up the glass put water in it drink from it and put it down he tells you to see that its already brokenUnderstandThe Buddhas understanding was like thisHe saw the broken glass in the unbroken oneWhenever its time is up itll breakDevelop this attitudeUse the glass look after itThen one day it slips out of your hand Smash No problemWhy no problemBecause you saw it as broken before it brokeBut usually people say Ive taken such good care of this glassDont ever let it break Later on the dog breaks it Ill kill that damn dog You hate the dog for breaking your glassIf your child breaks it you hate him tooYou hate whoever breaks itWhyBecause youve dammed yourself up so that the water cant flowYouve made a dam without a spillwayThe only thing the dam can do is burst rightWhen you make a dam you have to make a spillway tooWhen the water rises up to a certain level it can flow off safely to the sideWhen its full to the brim it can flow out the spillwayYou need to have a spillway like thisSeeing inconstancy is the spillway of the Noble OnesWhen you see things this way you can be at peaceThats the practice of the DhammaSo Ive learned to hold that whether standing walking sitting or lying down I keep on practicing using mindfulness to watch over and protect the mindThats concentrationThats discernmentTheyre both the same thingThey differ only in their characteristicsIf we really see inconstancy which means that things arent for sure when we penetrate to see clearly that things arent for sure then what we see is for sureSure in what waySure that thats the way things areThey dont change into any other wayUnderstandWhen you know just this much you know the BuddhaYouve done reverence to himYouve done reverence to his DhammaTake this principle and mull it overAs long as you dont abandon the Buddha you wont sufferAs soon as you abandon him youll suffer immediatelyYoull suffer as soon as you abandon the principles of inconstancy stress and notselfIf you can practice just this much its enoughSuffering wont arise or if it does arise you can snuff it out easilyAnd that will be a cause for suffering not to arise in the futureThats where things finish at the point where suffering doesnt ariseAnd why doesnt suffering ariseBecause were careful around the cause of suffering or samudayaFor instance if this glass were to break normally youd experience suffering rightWe know that this glass will be a cause for suffering so we get rid of the causeAll dhammas arise because of a causeWhen they cease its also because of a causeNow if theres suffering on account of this glass here if you get angry and suffer from the anger If we reflect beforehand that this glass is already broken even when it isnt the cause dies awayWhen theres no longer any suffering that means it ceasesThats nirodhaThats all there isDont stray away from this pointJust keep working away right hereContemplate right hereStart out by contemplating your own mindTo put it in really basic terms you should all have the five precepts as your foundationYou dont have to go study the Pali CanonWatch your five preceptsKeep working at them alwaysDo this with careAt first youll make mistakesWhen you realize it stop come back and start over againMaybe youll go astray and make another mistakeWhen you realize it start over again each and every timeYour mindfulness will gain a higher frequency like water poured from a kettleIf we tilt the kettle just a little the water comes out in drops glug glug glugThere are breaks in the flowIf we tilt the kettle a little bit more the drops become more frequent glugglugglugIf we tilt the kettle even further the glugs disappear and the water turns into a steady streamThere are no more dropsWhere did they goThey didnt go anywhereTheyve changed into a steady stream of waterTheyve become so frequent that theyre beyond frequencyThey meld into one another in a stream of waterThe Dhamma is just like this talking in analogies because the Dhamma doesnt have anythingIt isnt round doesnt have any cornersTheres no way to get acquainted with it except through comparisons like thisIf you understand this you understand the DhammaDont think that the Dhamma lies far away from youIt lies right with you its about youTake a lookOne minute happy the next minute sad satisfied then angry at this person hating that person Its all DhammaLook yourselfWhats trying to give rise to sufferingWhen youve done something that causes suffering turn around and undo itTurn around and undo itYou havent seen it clearlyWhen you see it clearly theres no more sufferingThe cause has been put outOnce youve killed the cause of suffering there are no more conditions for it to ariseIf suffering is still arising if you dont really know it you have to endure it Thats not yet rightTo put it in really simple terms wherever youre stuck wherever theres too much suffering right there youre wrongWhenever youre so happy that the mind starts swelling up  there Wrong againWhichever side it comes from doesnt matterBring everything together to this one point and keep exploringIf you practice like this youll be mindful whether youre standing walking sitting or lying down coming or going whatever youre doingIf youre always mindful and alert youre sure to know right and wrong happiness and sufferingWhen youre acquainted with these things youll know how to undo them so that there wont be any sufferingYou wont let there be sufferingI have people study concentration like thisWhen its time to sit in meditation then sitThats not wrongYou have to know that tooBut concentration isnt just sittingYou have to let the mind encounter different things then register them and bring them up to contemplateContemplate to know whatContemplate to see OhThats inconstantStressfulNotselfIts not for sure Everything is not for sure let me tell youThis is so beautiful I really like it Thats not for sureI dont like this at all Tell it It too is not for sureRightAbsolutelyNo mistakeBut look at what happensThis time Im going to get this thing right for sure Youve gone off the track alreadyDontNo matter how much you like something you should reflect that its not for sureWhen we eat some kinds of food we think WowThats so deliciousI really like that There will be that feeling in the heart but you have to reflect Its not for sure Do you want to test how its not for sureTake your favorite food and eat it every dayEvery single day okayEventually youll complain This doesnt taste so good anymore Youll think Actually I prefer that kind of food Thats not for sure eitherEverything has to go from one thing to the next just like breathing in and outWe have to breathe in and breathe outWe exist because of changeEverything depends on change like thisThese things lie right with us nowhere elseIf we no longer have any doubts then we can sit in comfort stand in comfortConcentration isnt just sittingSome people sit until they fall into a stuporThey might as well be deadThey cant tell north from southDont take it that farIf you feel sleepy then walkChange your postureUse your discernmentIf youre totally sleepy then lie downAs soon as you wake up get right up and continue your effortsDont let yourself get carried away with the comfort of lying downIf youre a meditator you have to practice like thisHave reasons for what you doDiscernmentCircumspectionYou cant not be circumspectYou cant just know one side of thingsYou have to know the full circle like thisStart knowing from your own mind and body seeing them as inconstantTheyre not for sure neither body nor mindThe same goes for everythingIts not for sureKeep this in mind when you think food is so deliciousYou have to tell yourself Its not for sure You have to punch your likes firstWhatever the mind likes you have to tell it Its not for sure Punch it firstBut usually these things just punch you every timeIf you dont like something and suffer because you dont like it its punched youIf she likes me I like her Its punched youYou dont punch it at allYou have to understand in this wayWhenever you like anything just say to yourself This isnt for sure Whenever you dont like something say to yourself This isnt for sure Keep at this and youll see the Dhamma for sureThats how it has to bePractice in all postures sitting standing walking lying downYou can feel anger in any posture rightWalking you can feel anger sitting you can feel anger lying down you can feel angerSometimes you feel desire while lying down while walking while sittingSo you have to practice in all four postures consistently without any front or backKeep at it like thisOnly then can your knowledge be all aroundWhen you sit to get the mind to settle down an issue starts running inBefore its finished another one comes running inIf they run in like this tell yourself Its not for sure Punch it before it gets a chance to punch youPunch it with Its not for sureYou have to know its weak pointIf you know that all things arent for sure all the thinking in your heart will gradually unravel gradually unravelYouve seen that thats whats sure about itWhenever youve seen that something isnt for sure then even when lots of things come passing in theyre all the sameOn a later day you contemplate again and theyre all still just the sameHave you ever seen flowing waterHave you ever seen still waterIf your mind is peaceful its like still flowing waterHave you ever seen still flowing waterThereYouve only seen flowing water and still waterYouve never seen still flowing waterRight there right where your thinking cant take you where the mind is still but can develop discernmentWhen you look at your mind itll be like flowing water and yet stillIt looks like its still it looks like its flowing so its called still flowing waterThats what its likeThats where discernment can ariseAll the things in the world are suppositions that weve supposed into beingOnce weve supposed them we fall for our own supposings so nobody lets them goThey turn into views and pride into attachmentThis attachment is something that never endsIts an affair of samsara that flows without respite with no way of coming to closureBut if we really know our suppositions well know releaseIf we really know release well know our suppositionsThats when you know the Dhamma that can come to closureTake people for instanceWhen we start out were born without namesThe fact that we have names comes from their being supposed into beingIve thought about this and seen that if you dont really know suppositions they can cause a lot of harmActually suppositions are simply things for us to useIf we understand what theyre for thats enoughKnow that if we didnt have suppositions thered be nothing we could say to one another no language to use with one anotherWhen I went abroad I saw Westerners sitting in meditation in row after rowWhen they got up after sitting men and women together sometimes theyd go and touch one another on the head one person after anotherWhen I saw this I thought Hmm if we set up a supposition anywhere and cling to it it gives rise to defilements right there If were willing to let go of our suppositions we can be at peaceLike the generals and colonels men of rank and position who come to see meWhen they come they say Oh please touch my head That shows that theyre willing so theres nothing wrong with itYou can rub their heads and theyre even glad you did itBut if you rubbed their heads in the middle of the street thered be a big fussThis is because of clingingSo Ive seen that letting go is really comfortableWhen they agree to having their heads touched theyve supposed that theres nothing wrong with itAnd there is nothing wrong with it just like rubbing a head of cabbage or a head of lettuceBut if you rubbed their heads in the middle of the road they wouldnt stand for it for sureIts all a matter of willingness  accepting giving up letting goWhen you can do this things are lightWherever youre clinging theres becoming right there birth right there poison and danger right thereThe Buddha taught about suppositions and he taught to undo suppositions in the right way to turn them into releaseDont cling to themThe things that arise in the world are all suppositionsThats how they come into beingWhen theyve arisen and been supposed we shouldnt fall for them for that leads to sufferingThe affairs of supposition and convention are extremely importantWhoever can let them go is free from sufferingBut theyre an activity of this world of oursTake Boonmaa for instanceHes the District CommissionerHis old friend Saengchai isnt a district commissioner but theyve been friends from way backNow that Boonmaa has been appointed district commissioner theres a supposition right there but you have to know how to use it in an appropriate way because we still live in the worldIf Saengchai goes to the district offices and pats Boonmaa on the head its not rightEven if Saengchai thinks about all the old times when they worked together as traveling tailors and about that time they almost died its still not right for him to go playing around with Boonmaas head in front of other peopleYou have to show a little respect and practice in line with our social suppositionsOnly then can we live together in peaceNo matter how long youve been friends hes now the district commissionerYou have to show him some deferenceWhen he leaves the district offices and goes home thats when you can pat him on the headIts the district commissioners head youre patting but when you do it in his home it doesnt matterIf you were to do it in the government offices in front of a lot of people itd be wrongThis is called showing respectIf you know how to use suppositions in this way they serve a purposeNo matter how long youve been close friends if you touch him on the head in front of a lot of people hes sure to get angry  after all hes now the district commissionerThis is all there is to our behavior in the world You need a sense of time and place and of the people youre withSo were taught to be intelligent to have a sense of suppositions and a sense of releaseUnderstand them when you use themIf you use them properly theres no problemIf you dont use them properly its offensiveWhat does it offendIt offends peoples defilements thats all  because people live with defilementThere are suppositions you have to follow with certain groups certain people certain times and placesIf you follow them appropriately you can be said to be smartYou have to know where these things come from and how far they leadWe have to live with suppositions but we suffer when we cling to themIf you understand suppositions simply as suppositions and explore them until you come to release there are no problemsAs Ive often said before we were laymen and now were monksBefore we were supposed to be laymen but now having gone through the ordination chant were supposed to be monksBut were monks on the level of supposition not genuine monks not monks on the level of releaseIf we practice so that our minds are released from all their fermentations step by step as streamwinners oncereturners nonreturners all the way to arahantship then all our defilements will be abandonedEven when we say that someone is an arahant thats just a supposition  but hes a genuine monkIn the beginning we start with suppositions like thisIn the ordination ceremony they agree to call you a monk but does that mean you can suddenly abandon your defilementsNoIts like taking a fistful of sand and saying Suppose this is salt Is it saltSure it is but only on the level of supposingIts not genuine saltIf you were to put it into a curry it wouldnt serve any purposeIf you were to argue that its genuine salt the answer would have to be NoThats whats meant by suppositionThe word release is something supposed into being but what it actually is lies beyond suppositionWhen theres release all our suppositions are releasedThats all there is to itCan we live without suppositionsNoIf we didnt have suppositions we wouldnt know how to talk with each otherWe wouldnt know where things come from and how far they goWe wouldnt have any language to speak with one anotherSo suppositions have their purposes  the purposes were supposed to use them forFor example people have different names even though theyre all people just the sameIf we didnt have names you wouldnt know how to call the person you wantedFor instance if you wanted to call a particular person in a crowd and said PersonPerson that would be uselessNo one would answer because theyre all person But if you called JanCome here then Jan would comeThe others wouldnt have toThis is how suppositions serve a purposeThings get accomplishedSo there are ways for us to train ourselves that arise from suppositionsIf we know both supposition and release in the proper way we can get alongSuppositions have their uses but in reality there really isnt anything thereThere isnt even a person thereTheres just a set of natural conditions born of their causal factorsThey develop in dependence on causal factors stay for a while and before long they fall apartYou cant stop that from happeningYou cant really control itThats all there isIts just a supposition but without suppositions wed have nothing to say no names no practice no work no languageSuppositions and conventions are established to give us a language to make things convenient thats allTake money for exampleIn the past there wasnt any paper moneyPaper was just paper without any valueThen people decided that silver money was hard to store so they turned paper into moneyAnd so it serves as moneyMaybe someday in the future a new king will arise who doesnt like paper moneyHell have us use wax droppings instead  take sealing wax melt it stamp it into lumps and suppose it to be moneyWell be using wax droppings all over the country getting into debt all because of wax droppingsLet alone wax droppings we could take chicken droppings and turn them into moneyIt could happenAll our chicken droppings would be cashWed be fighting and killing one another over chicken droppingsEven when they propose new forms for things if everybody agrees to the new supposition it worksAs for the silver we started out with nobody really knows what it isThe ore we call silver Is it really silverNobody knowsSomebody saw what it was like came up with the supposition of silver and thats what it wasThats all there is to the affairs of the worldWe suppose something into being and thats what it is  because we live with suppositionsBut to turn these things into release to get people to know genuine release Thats hardOur house our money our possessions our family our children our relatives are ours simply on the level of suppositionBut actually on the level of the Dhamma theyre not really oursWe dont like to hear this but thats the way they actually areIf we dont have any suppositions around them they have no valueOr if we suppose them to have no value they have no valueBut if we suppose them to have value they doThis is the way things areThese suppositions are good if we know how to use themEven this body of ours isnt really oursWe just suppose it to be soIts a suppositionIf you try to find a genuine self within it you cantThere are just elements that are born continue for a while and then dieEverything is like thisTheres no real true substance to it but its proper that we have to use itFor example what do we need to stay aliveWe need foodIf our life depends on food as its nourishment as a support we need to use then we should use it to achieve its purposeThats how the Buddha taught new monksRight from the very beginning he taught the four supports clothing food shelter medicineHe taught that we should contemplate these thingsIf we dont contemplate them in the morning we should contemplate them in the evening after weve used themWhy does he have us contemplate them so oftenTo realize that as long as were alive we cant escape these thingsYoull use these things all your life he said but dont fall for themTheir purpose is just to keep life goingIf we didnt have these things we couldnt meditate couldnt chant couldnt contemplateFor the time being we have to depend on these things but dont get attached to themDont fall for the supposition that theyre yoursTheyre supports for keeping you aliveWhen the time comes youll have to give them upIn the meantime though even though the idea that theyre yours is just a supposition you have to take care of themIf you dont take care of them you sufferLike a cup for instanceSomeday in the future the cup is going to breakIf it breaks no big deal  but as long as youre alive you should take good care of it because its your utensilIf it breaks youll be put to troubleIf its going to break let it be broken in a way that cant be helpedThe same goes for the four supports that were taught to contemplateTheyre requisites for those whove gone forthUnderstand them but dont cling to them to the point where the clinging becomes a big lump of craving and defilement in the heart and makes you sufferUse them just for the purpose of keeping alive and thats enoughSuppositions and release are related like this continuallyEven though we use suppositions dont place your trust in their being trueTheyre true only on the level of supposingIf you cling to them suffering will arise because you dont understand them in line with what they really areThe same holds for issues of right and wrongSome people see wrong as right and right as wrong but whose right and wrong they are nobody knowsDifferent people make different suppositions about whats right and wrong so we have to know these things in every caseBut the Buddha was afraid that it would lead to suffering if we got into arguments because issues of this sort never come to closureOne person says right another says wrong One says wrong another says right But actually we dont really know right and wrong at allAll we need is to learn how to use them for our comfort so that we can put them to work in a proper wayDont let them harm you or harm othersKeep things neutral in this wayThat serves our purposesIn short both suppositions and release are simply dhammasOne is higher than the other but theyre synonymsTheres no way we can guarantee for sure that this has to be this or that has to be that so the Buddha said to just put it down as not for sure No matter how much you like something you have to know that its not for sureNo matter how much you dislike something you have to understand that its not for sureAnd these things really arent for sureKeep practicing until theyre dhammasPast present or future Make them all an affair of Dhamma practiceAnd it comes to closure at the point where theres nothing moreYouve let goEverything ends when youve put down the burdenIll give you an analogyOne person asks Why is the flag flutteringIt must be because theres wind Another person says Its fluttering because theres a flag This sort of thing never comes to an endThe same as the old riddle Which came first the chicken or the egg This never comes to an endIt just keeps spinning around in its circlesAll these things are simply suppositionsThey arise from our supposingSo you have to understand suppositions and conventionsIf you understand them youll understand inconstancy stress and notselfThis is a preoccupation that leads straight to nibbanaTraining and teaching people is really hard you knowSome people have their opinionsYou tell them something and they say NoYou tell them the truth and they say its not trueIll take whats right for me you take whats right for you Theres no end to thisIf you dont let go therell be sufferingIve told you before about the four men who go into the forestThey hear a chicken crowing Ekkkiekkekkkk One of them comes up with the question Who says thats a roosterWho says its a hen For the fun of it three of them put their heads together and say its a henThe other one says its a roosterThey argue back and forth like this without stoppingThree of them say its a hen and only one of them says its a roosterHow could a hen crow like that he asksWell its got a mouth doesnt it they replyThe one person argues until he starts cryingActually it was a rooster crowing in line with our standard suppositions but the one person had to argue until he started to cryYet on the ultimate level they were all wrongThe words rooster and hen are just suppositionsIf you asked the chicken Are you a rooster it wouldnt answerIf you asked Are you a hen it wouldnt give any explanationBut we have our conventions These features are the features of a rooster these features the features of a henThe roosters crow is like this a hens squawk is like thatThese are suppositions that are stuck in our worldBut in truth theres no rooster no henTo speak on the level of the worlds suppositions the one person was right but to argue to the point of crying doesnt serve any purpose at allThats all there is to itSo the Buddha taught not to cling to these thingsIf we dont hold onto things how can we practiceWe practice because of notclingingTo bring your discernment in here is hardThis is why its hard not to clingYou need to use sharp discernment to contemplate thisOnly then will you get anywhereWhen you think about it for the sake of relieving suffering it doesnt depend on whether you have a lot of things or a littleWhether youre happy or sad content or discontent it starts from your discernmentTo go beyond suffering depends on discernment seeing things in line with their truthThe Buddha taught us to train ourselves to contemplate to meditateMeditation means undoing these problems in line with the way they areThese are the issues the issues of birth aging illness and deathThese are really common ordinary thingsThis is why he has us contemplate them continuallyHe has us meditate on birth aging illness and deathSome people dont understand why we have to contemplate themWe already know birth they sayWe already know deathTheyre such ordinary issues So trueA person who investigates these things again and again will seeWhen you see you can gradually undo these problemsAlthough you may still have some clinging if you have the discernment to see that these things are normal youll be able to relieve sufferingThis is why we practice for the sake of undoing sufferingThe basic principles of the Buddhas teaching arent much just suffering arising and suffering passing awayThats why these things are called noble truthsIf you dont know these things you sufferIf you argue from pride and opinions theres no end to itTo get the mind to relieve its suffering and be at ease you have to contemplate whats happened in the past whats in the present whats going to be in the futureWhat can you do not to be worried about birth aging illness and deathThere will be some worries but if you can learn to understand them for what they are suffering will gradually lessen because you dont hug it to your chestNewcomers to Buddhism often ask whether a persons lifestyle has any special bearing on their ability to progress along the Buddhas path and in particular whether the Buddha had a compelling reason for establishing a monastic order governed by guidelines quite different from those that hold sway over the lay Buddhist communityDoesnt it seem they ask that a lay person who follows the Buddhist precepts in daily life should be able to advance just as rapidly as a monk or nun and attain the same level of enlightenmentAnd if this is so doesnt that mean that the entire monastic lifestyle becomes something superfluous or at best a mere matter of personal choice no more relevant to ones spiritual development than whether one trains to become a doctor or an engineerIf we suspend concern for questions of status and superiority and simply consider the two modes of life in their ideal expression the conclusion would have to follow that the monastic life lived in the way envisioned by the Buddha is the one that conduces more effectively to the final goalAccording to the Pali canon the ultimate goal of the Dhamma is the attainment of Nibbana the destruction of all defilements here and now and ultimate release from samsara the round of rebirthsThis attainment comes about by eliminating craving and ignorance through the practice of the Noble Eightfold PathThe Eightfold Path is open equally to both monastics and lay followers monastic ordination does not confer any privileged access to the path or an empowerment that enables a monk or nun to make more rapid progress than a lay followerBut while this is so the fact remains that the monastic life was expressly designed by the Buddha to facilitate complete dedication to the practice of the path in its three stages of virtue concentration and wisdom and thus provides the optimal conditions for spiritual progressThe monastic lifestyle does so precisely because the final goal is a state of renunciation the relinquishment of all acquisitions and from the outset the monks life is rooted in renunciationIn going forth the monk leaves behind family possessions and worldly position and even the outer marks of personal identity symbolized by hair beard and wardrobeBy shaving the head and donning the yellow robe the monk has given up  in principle at least  any claim to a unique identity as his ownOutwardly indistinguishable from a hundred thousand other monks he has become simply a Sakyaputtiya samana an ascetic who follows the Sakyan sonThe life of the monk involves radical simplicity contentment with the barest requisites the need to be patient in difficultyThe monastic lifestyle places the monk in dependence on the generosity and kindness of others and imposes on him an intricate code of discipline the Vinaya designed to foster the essential renunciant virtues of simplicity restraint purity and harmlessnessThese virtues provide a sound basis for the higher attainments in concentration and insight which are essentially stages in the progressive purification of the mind and the deepening of insightOf prime importance too is the external freedom ideally provided by the monastic lifeThe monastic schedule leaves the monk free from extraneous demands on his time and energy allowing him to devote himself fully to the practice and study of the DhammaOf course as the monastic life is lived today monks take on many responsibilities not originally mentioned in the canonical texts and in a traditional Buddhist country the village temple has become the hub of religious activity with the monks functioning as virtual priests for the wider Buddhist communityBut here we are concerned with the canonical picture of the monastic lifeIf the monks life so conceived did not promote smoother progress toward the goal it seems there would have been no sound reason for the Buddha to have established a monastic order or to have encouraged men and women so inclined to go forth from the home life into homelessnessWhile the attainment of Nibbana is the ultimate goal of early Buddhism it is not the only goal and one of the shortcomings in the way Theravada Buddhism has been presented to the West is the onesided emphasis placed on the final goal over the provisional aspect of the TeachingIn traditional Buddhist lands few Buddhists see Nibbana as an immediately realistic prospectThe great majority both lay and monastic regard the path as a course of gradual practice gradual progress and gradual achievement extending over many livesTheir practice as Buddhist followers centers around the performance of meritorious deeds and methodical mental purification rooted in the confidence that the kammic law of causality and the spiritual power of the Dhamma will sustain them in their quest for deliveranceTo make clear the choices facing the lay follower we might posit two alternative models of the Buddhist lay lifeOn the first model lay life is seen as a field for gradual progress toward the goal through the development of wholesome qualities such as generosity moral virtue kindness and understandingThe immediate aim is not direct realization of the highest truth but the accumulation of merits leading to a happy rebirth and gradual progress toward NibbanaThe second model recognizes the capacity of lay followers for reaching the stages of awakening in this life itself and advocates strict moral discipline and strenuous effort in meditation to attain deep insight into the truth of the DhammaWhile there are in Buddhist countries lay people who follow the path of direct realization their number is much smaller than those who pursue the alternative modelThe reason should be obvious enough the stakes are higher and include a capacity for inward renunciation rare among those who must raise a family work at a fulltime job and struggle to survive in a ruggedly competitive worldWe should note further a point of prime importance this second model of the Buddhist lay life becomes effective as a means to higher attainment precisely because it emulates the monastic modelThus to the extent that a lay follower embarks on the practice of the direct path to realization he or she does so by conforming to the lifestyle of a monk or nunThese two conceptions of the lay life need not be seen as mutually exclusive for an earnest lay follower can adopt the first model for his or her normal routine and also stake out periods to pursue the second model eg by curtailing social engagements devoting time to deep study and meditation and occasionally going on extended retreatsThough a monastic lifestyle might be more conducive to enlightenment than a busy life within the world when it comes to individuals rather than models all fixed preconceptions collapseSome lay people with heavy family and social commitments manage to make such rapid progress that they can give guidance in meditation to earnest monks and it is not rare at all to find sincere monks deeply committed to the practice who advance slowly and with difficultyWhile the monastic life lived according to the original ideal may provide the optimal outer conditions for spiritual progress the actual rate of progress depends on personal effort and on the store of qualities one brings over from previous lives and often it seems individuals deeply enmeshed in the world are better endowed in both respects than those who enter the SanghaIn any case whether for monk nun or layperson the path to Nibbana is the same the Noble Eightfold PathWhatever ones personal circumstances may be if one is truly earnest about realizing the final goal of the Dhamma one will make every effort to tread this path in the way that best fits the particular circumstances of ones lifeAs the Buddha himself says Whether it be a householder or one gone forth it is the one of right practice that I praise not the one of wrong practiceThe Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creedsFounded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topicsIts publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddhas discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practiceThese works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first arose Dhammapada This book is a short introduction to the basic principles of Buddhism the Buddha the Dhamma and Sangha also known as the Triple Gem or the Triple RefugeThe material is divided into three parts an introductory essay on the meaning of refuge and the act of going for refuge a series of readings drawn from the earliest Buddhist texts illustrating the essential qualities of the Triple Gem and a set of essays explaining aspects of the Triple Gem that often provoke questions in those who are new to the Buddhas teachingsThis last section concludes with an essay that summarizes in a more systematic form many of the points raised in the earlier parts of the bookThe readings on Dhamma form the core of the book organized in a pattern  called a graduated discourse  that the Buddha himself often used when introducing his teachings to new listenersAfter beginning with the joys of generosity he would describe the joys of a virtuous life followed by the rewards of generosity and virtue to be experienced here and after death in heaven the drawbacks of sensual pleasures even heavenly ones and the rewards of renunciationThen when he sensed that his listeners were inclined to look favorably on renunciation as a way to true happiness he would discuss the central message of his teaching the four noble truthsMy hope is that this introduction will help answer many of the questions that newcomers bring to Buddhism and will spark new questions in their minds as they contemplate the possibility of developing within their own lives the qualities of refuge exemplified by the Triple GemThe act of going for refuge marks the point where one commits oneself to taking the Dhamma or the Buddhas teaching as the primary guide to ones lifeTo understand why this commitment is called a refuge its helpful to look at the history of the customIn preBuddhist India going for refuge meant proclaiming ones allegiance to a patron  a powerful person or god  submitting to the patrons directives in hopes of receiving protection from danger in returnIn the early years of the Buddhas teaching career his new followers adopted this custom to express their allegiance to the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha but in the Buddhist context this custom took on a new meaningBuddhism is not a theistic religion  the Buddha is not a god  and so a person taking refuge in the Buddhist sense is not asking for the Buddha personally to intervene to provide protectionStill one of the Buddhas central teachings is that human life is fraught with dangers  from greed anger and delusion  and so the concept of refuge is central to the path of practice in that the practice is aimed at gaining release from those dangersBecause the mind is the source both of the dangers and of release there is a need for two levels of refuge external refuges which provide models and guidelines so that we can identify which qualities in the mind lead to danger and which to release and internal refuges ie the qualities leading to release that we develop in our own mind in imitation of our external modelsThe internal level is where true refuge is foundAlthough the tradition of going to refuge is an ancient practice it is still relevant for our own practice today for we are faced with the same internal dangers that faced people in the Buddhas timeWe still need the same protection as theyWhen a Buddhist takes refuge it is essentially an act of taking refuge in the doctrine of karma Its an act of submission in that one is committed to living in line with the principle that actions based on skillful intentions lead to happiness while actions based on unskillful intentions lead to suffering its an act of claiming protection in that by following the teaching one hopes to avoid the misfortunes that bad karma engendersTo take refuge in this way ultimately means to take refuge in the quality of our own intentions for thats where the essence of karma liesThe refuges in Buddhism  both on the internal and on the external levels  are the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha also known as the Triple GemThey are called gems both because they are valuable and because in ancient times gems were believed to have protective powersThe Triple Gem outdoes other gems in this respect because its protective powers can be put to the test and can lead further than those of any physical gem all the way to absolute freedom from the uncertainties of the realm of aging illness and deathThe Buddha on the external level refers to Siddhattha Gotama the Indian prince who renounced his royal titles and went into the forest meditating until he ultimately gained AwakeningTo take refuge in the Buddha means not taking refuge in him as a person but taking refuge in the fact of his Awakening placing trust in the belief that he did awaken to the truth that he did so by developing qualities that we too can develop and that the truths to which he awoke provide the best perspective for the conduct of our lifeThe Dhamma on the external level refers to the path of practice the Buddha taught to this followersThis in turn is divided into three levels the words of his teachings the act of putting those teachings into practice and the attainment of Awakening as the result of that practiceThis threeway division of the word Dhamma acts as a map showing how to take the external refuges and make them internal learning about the teachings using them to develop the qualities that the Buddha himself used to attain Awakening and then realizing the same release from danger that he found in the quality of Deathlessness that we can touch withinThe word Sangha on the external level has two senses conventional and idealIn its ideal sense the Sangha consists of all people lay or ordained who have practiced the Dhamma to the point of gaining at least a glimpse of the DeathlessIn a conventional sense Sangha denotes the communities of ordained monks and nunsThe two meanings overlap but are not necessarily identicalSome members of the ideal Sangha are not ordained some monks and nuns have yet to touch the DeathlessAll those who take refuge in the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha become members of the Buddhas fourfold assembly of followers monks nuns male lay devotees and female lay devoteesAlthough theres a widespread belief that all Buddhist followers are members of the Sangha this is not the caseOnly those who are ordained are members of the conventional Sangha only those who have glimpsed the Deathless are members of the ideal SanghaNevertheless any followers who dont belong to the Sangha in either sense of the word still count as genuine Buddhists in that they are members of the Buddhas parisaWhen taking refuge in the external Sangha one takes refuge in both senses of the Sangha but the two senses provide different levels of refugeThe conventional Sangha has helped keep the teaching alive for more than yearsWithout them we would never have learned what the Buddha taughtHowever not all members of the conventional Sangha are reliable models of behaviorSo when looking for guidance in the conduct of our lives we must look to the living and recorded examples provided by the ideal SanghaWithout their example we would not know that Awakening is available to all and not just to the Buddha and how Awakening expresses itself in real lifeOn the internal level the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha are the skillful qualities we develop in our own minds in imitation of our external modelsFor instance the Buddha was a person of wisdom purity and compassionWhen we develop wisdom purity and compassion in our own minds they form our refuge on an internal levelThe Buddha tasted Awakening by developing conviction persistence mindfulness concentration and discernmentWhen we develop these same qualities to the point of attaining Awakening too that Awakening is our ultimate refugeThis is the point where the three aspects of the Triple Gem become one beyond the reach of greed anger and delusion and thus totally secureIndeed the Blessed One is worthy and rightly selfawakened consummate in knowledge and conduct wellgone an expert with regard to the cosmos unexcelled as a trainer for those people fit to be tamed the Teacher of divine and human beings awakened blessedThe Dhamma is wellexpounded by the Blessed One to be seen here and now timeless inviting verification pertinent to be realized by the wise for themselvesThe Sangha of the Blessed Ones disciples who have practiced well who have practiced straightforwardly who have practiced methodically who have practiced masterfully  in other words the four types of noble disciples when taken as pairs the eight when taken as individual types  they are the Sangha of the Blessed Ones disciples worthy of gifts worthy of hospitality worthy of offerings worthy of respect the incomparable field of merit for the worldI lived in refinement utmost refinement total refinementMy father even had lotus ponds made in our palace one where redlotuses bloomed one where white lotuses bloomed one where blue lotuses bloomed all for my sakeI used no sandalwood that was not from VaranasiMy turban was from Varanasi as were my tunic my lower garments and my outer cloakA white sunshade was held over me day and night to protect me from cold heat dust dirt and dewI had three palaces one for the cold season one for the hot season one for the rainy seasonDuring the four months of the rainy season I was entertained in the rainyseason palace by minstrels without a single man among them and I did not once come down from the palaceWhereas the servants workers and retainers in other peoples homes are fed meals of lentil soup and broken rice in my fathers home the servants workers and retainers were fed wheat rice and meatEven though I was endowed with such fortune such total refinement the thought occurred to me When an untaught runofthemill person himself subject to aging not beyond aging sees another who is aged he is horrified humiliated and disgusted oblivious to himself that he too is subject to aging not beyond agingIf I  who am subject to aging not beyond aging  were to be horrified humiliated and disgusted on seeing another person who is aged that would not be fitting for me As I noticed this the young persons intoxication with youth entirely dropped awayEven though I was endowed with such fortune such total refinement the thought occurred to me When an untaught runofthemill person himself subject to illness not beyond illness sees another who is ill he is horrified humiliated and disgusted oblivious to himself that he too is subject to illness not beyond illnessAnd if I  who am subject to illness not beyond illness  were to be horrified humiliated and disgusted on seeing another person who is ill that would not be fitting for me As I noticed this the healthy persons intoxication with health entirely dropped awayEven though I was endowed with such fortune such total refinement the thought occurred to me When an untaught runofthemill person himself subject to death not beyond death sees another who is dead he is horrified humiliated and disgusted oblivious to himself that he too is subject to death not beyond deathAnd if I  who am subject to death not beyond death  were to be horrified humiliated and disgusted on seeing another person who is dead that would not be fitting for me As I noticed this the living persons intoxication with life entirely dropped awayBefore my Awakening when I was still an unawakened Bodhisatta being subject myself to birth aging illness death sorrow and defilement I sought what was subject to birth aging illness death sorrow and defilementThe thought occurred to me Why am I being subject myself to birth defilement seeking what is subject to birth defilementWhat if I were to seek the unborn unaging unailing undying sorrowless undefiled unsurpassed security from bondage UnbindingSo at a later time when I was still young blackhaired endowed with the blessings of youth in the first stage of life I shaved off my hair and beard  though my parents wished otherwise and were grieving with tears on their faces  and I put on the ochre robe and went forth from the home life into homelessnessHaving gone forth in search of what might be skillful seeking the unexcelled state of sublime peace I went to where Alara Kalama was staying and on arrival said to him I want to practice in this doctrine and disciplineWhen this was said he replied to me You may stay hereThis doctrine is such that a wise person can soon enter and dwell in his own teachers knowledge having realized it for himself through direct knowledgeI quickly learned the doctrineAs far as mere lipreciting and repetition I could speak the words of knowledge the words of the elders and I could affirm that I knew and saw  I along with othersI thought It isnt through mere conviction alone that Alara Kalama declares I have entered and dwell in this Dhamma having realized it directly for myself Certainly he dwells knowing and seeing this Dhamma So I went to him and said To what extent do you declare that you have entered and dwell in this Dhamma When this was said he declared the dimension of nothingnessI thought Not only does Alara Kalama have conviction persistence mindfulness concentration and discernmentI too have conviction persistence mindfulness concentration and discernmentSuppose I were to endeavor to realize for myself the Dhamma that Alara Kalama declares he has entered and dwells in So it was not long before I entered and dwelled in that Dhamma having realized it for myself through direct knowledgeI went to him and said Friend Kalama is this the extent to which you have entered and dwell in this Dhamma having realized it for yourself through direct knowledgeYes This is the extent to which I too have entered and dwell in this Dhamma having realized it for myself through direct knowledgeIt is a gain for us a great gain for us that we have such a companion in the holy life As I am so are you as you are so am Come friend let us now lead this community togetherIn this way did Alara Kalama my teacher place me his pupil on the same level with himself and pay me great honorBut the thought occurred to me This Dhamma leads not to disenchantment to dispassion to cessation to stilling to direct knowledge to Awakening nor to Unbinding but only to reappearance in the dimension of nothingness So dissatisfied with that Dhamma I leftNow Aggivessana these three similes  spontaneous never before heard  appeared to meSuppose there were a wet sappy piece of timber lying in the water and a man were to come along with an upper firestick thinking Ill light a fireIll produce heat Now what do you thinkWould he be able to light a fire and produce heat by rubbing the upper firestick in the wet sappy timber lying in the waterNo Master Gotama So it is with any brahman or contemplative who does not live withdrawn from sensuality in body and mind and whose desire infatuation urge thirst and fever for sensuality is not relinquished and stilled within him Whether or not he feels painful racking piercing feelings due to his striving he is incapable of knowledge vision and unexcelled selfawakeningThen a second simile  spontaneous never before heard  appeared to meSuppose there were a wet sappy piece of timber lying on land far from water and a man were to come along with an upper firestick thinking Ill light a fireIll produce heat Now what do you thinkWould he be able to light a fire and produce heat by rubbing the upper firestick in the wet sappy timber lying on landNo Master Gotama So it is with any brahman or contemplative who lives withdrawn from sensuality in body only but whose desire infatuation urge thirst and fever for sensuality is not relinquished and stilled within him Whether or not he feels painful racking piercing feelings due to his striving he is incapable of knowledge vision and unexcelled selfawakeningThen a third simile  spontaneous never before heard  appeared to meSuppose there were a dry sapless piece of timber lying on land far from water and a man were to come along with an upper firestick thinking Ill light a fireIll produce heat Now what do you thinkWould he be able to light a fire and produce heat by rubbing the upper firestick in the dry sapless timber lying on landYes Master Gotama So it is with any brahman or contemplative who lives withdrawn from sensuality in body and mind and whose desire infatuation urge thirst and fever for sensuality is relinquished and stilled within him Whether or not he feels painful racking piercing feelings due to his striving he is capable of knowledge vision and unexcelled selfawakeningI thought Suppose that I clenching my teeth and pressing my tongue against the roof of my mouth were to beat down constrain and crush my mind with my awareness So just as if a strong man seizing a weaker man by the head or the throat or the shoulders would beat him down constrain and crush him in the same way I beat down constrained and crushed my mind with my awarenessAs I did so sweat poured from my armpitsBut although tireless persistence was aroused in me and unmuddled mindfulness established my body was aroused and uncalm because of the painful exertionBut the painful feeling that arose in this way did not invade my mind or remainI thought Suppose I were to become absorbed in the trance of nonbreathing So I stopped the inbreaths and outbreaths in my nose and mouthAs I did so there was a loud roaring of winds coming out my earholes just like the loud roar of winds coming out of a smiths bellows So I stopped the inbreaths and outbreaths in my nose and mouth and earsAs I did so extreme forces sliced through my head just as if a strong man were slicing my head open with a sharp sword Extreme pains arose in my head just as if a strong man were tightening a turban made of tough leather straps around my head Extreme forces carved up my stomach cavity just as if a butcher or his apprentice were to carve up the stomach cavity of an ox There was an extreme burning in my body just as if two strong men grabbing a weaker man by the arms were to roast and broil him over a pit of hot embersBut although tireless persistence was aroused in me and unmuddled mindfulness established my body was aroused and uncalm because of the painful exertionBut the painful feeling that arose in this way did not invade my mind or remainDevas on seeing me said Gotama the contemplative is dead Other devas said He isnt dead hes dying Others said Hes neither dead nor dying hes an arahant for this is the way arahants liveI thought Suppose I were to practice going altogether without food Then devas came to me and said Dear sir please dont practice going altogether without foodIf you go altogether without food well infuse divine nourishment in through your pores and you will survive on that I thought If I were to claim to be completely fasting while these devas are infusing divine nourishment in through my pores I would be lying So I dismissed them saying EnoughI thought Suppose I were to take only a little food at a time only a handful at a time of bean soup lentil soup vetch soup or pea soup So I took only a little food at a time only handful at a time of bean soup lentil soup vetch soup or pea soupMy body became extremely emaciatedSimply from my eating so little my limbs became like the jointed segments of vine stems or bamboo stems My backside became like a camels hoof My spine stood out like a string of beads My ribs jutted out like the jutting rafters of an old rundown barn The gleam of my eyes appeared to be sunk deep in my eye sockets like the gleam of water deep in a well My scalp shriveled and withered like a green bitter gourd shriveled and withered in the heat and the wind The skin of my belly became so stuck to my spine that when I thought of touching my belly I grabbed hold of my spine as well and when I thought of touching my spine I grabbed hold of the skin of my belly as well If I urinated or defecated I fell over on my face right there Simply from my eating so little if I tried to ease my body by rubbing my limbs with my hands the hair  rotted at its roots  fell from my body as I rubbedI thought Whatever brahmans or contemplatives in the past have felt painful racking piercing feelings due to their striving this is the utmostNone have been greater than thisWhatever brahmans or contemplatives in the future in the present are feeling painful racking piercing feelings due to their striving this is the utmostNone is greater than thisBut with this racking practice of austerities I have not attained any superior human state any distinction in knowledge or vision worthy of the noble onesCould there be another path to AwakeningI thought I recall once when my father the Sakyan was working and I was sitting in the cool shade of a roseapple tree then  quite withdrawn from sensuality withdrawn from unskillful mental qualities  I entered and remained in the first jhana rapture and pleasure born from withdrawal accompanied by directed thought and evaluationCould that be the path to Awakening Then following on that memory came the realization That is the path to Awakening So why am I afraid of that pleasure that has nothing to do with sensuality nothing to do with unskillful mental qualities I thought I am no longer afraid of that pleasure but it is not easy to achieve that pleasure with a body so extremely emaciated So I took some solid food some rice and porridgeNow five monks had been attending on me thinking If Gotama our contemplative achieves some higher state he will tell us But when they saw me taking some solid food  some rice and porridge  they were disgusted and left me thinking Gotama the contemplative is living luxuriouslyHe has abandoned his exertion and is backsliding into abundanceSo when I had taken solid food and regained strength then  quite withdrawn from sensuality withdrawn from unskillful mental qualities I entered and remained in the first jhana rapture and pleasure born from withdrawal accompanied by directed thought and evaluationBut the pleasant feeling that arose in this way did not invade my mind or remainWith the stilling of directed thoughts  evaluations I entered and remained in the second jhana rapture and pleasure born of composure unification of awareness free from directed thought and evaluation  internal assurance With the fading of rapture I remained in equanimity mindful and alert and physically sensitive of pleasureI entered and remained in the third jhana of which the Noble Ones declare Equanimous and mindful he has a pleasant abiding With the abandoning of pleasure and pain  as with the earlier disappearance of elation and distress  I entered and remained in the fourth jhana purity of equanimity and mindfulness neither pleasure nor painBut the pleasant feeling that arose in this way did not invade my mind or remainWhen the mind was thus concentrated purified bright unblemished rid of defilement pliant malleable steady and attained to imperturbability I directed it to the knowledge of recollecting my past livesI recollected my manifold past lives ie one birth two five ten fifty a hundred a thousand a hundred thousand many eons of cosmic contraction many eons of cosmic expansion many eons of cosmic contraction and expansion There I had such a name belonged to such a clan had such an appearanceSuch was my food such my experience of pleasure and pain such the end of my lifePassing away from that state I rearose thereThere too I had such a name belonged to such a clan had such an appearanceSuch was my food such my experience of pleasure and pain such the end of my lifePassing away from that state I rearose here Thus I remembered my manifold past lives in their modes and detailsThis was the first knowledge I attained in the first watch of the nightIgnorance was destroyed knowledge arose darkness was destroyed light arose  as happens in one who is heedful ardent and resoluteBut the pleasant feeling that arose in this way did not invade my mind or remainWhen the mind was thus concentrated purified bright unblemished rid of defilement pliant malleable steady and attained to imperturbability I directed it to the knowledge of the passing away and reappearance of beingsI saw  by means of the divine eye purified and surpassing the human  beings passing away and reappearing and I discerned how they are inferior and superior beautiful and ugly fortunate and unfortunate in accordance with their kamma These beings  who were endowed with bad conduct of body speech and mind who reviled the noble ones held wrong views and undertook actions under the influence of wrong views  with the breakup of the body after death have reappeared in the plane of deprivation the bad destination the lower realms in hellBut these beings  who were endowed with good conduct of body speech and mind who did not revile the noble ones who held right views and undertook actions under the influence of right views  with the breakup of the body after death have reappeared in the good destinations in the heavenly world Thus  by means of the divine eye purified and surpassing the human  I saw beings passing away and reappearing and I discerned how they are inferior and superior beautiful and ugly fortunate and unfortunate in accordance with their kammaThis was the second knowledge I attained in the second watch of the nightIgnorance was destroyed knowledge arose darkness was destroyed light arose  as happens in one who is heedful ardent and resoluteBut the pleasant feeling that arose in this way did not invade my mind or remainWhen the mind was thus concentrated purified bright unblemished rid of defilement pliant malleable steady and attained to imperturbability I directed it to the knowledge of the ending of the mental effluentsI discerned as it had come to be that This is stress This is the origination of stress This is the cessation of stress This is the way leading to the cessation of stress These are effluents This is the origination of effluents This is the cessation of effluents This is the way leading to the cessation of effluents My heart thus knowing thus seeing was released from the effluent of sensuality released from the effluent of becoming released from the effluent of ignoranceWith release there was the knowledge Released I discerned that Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task doneThere is nothing further for this worldThis was the third knowledge I attained in the third watch of the nightIgnorance was destroyed knowledge arose darkness was destroyed light arose  as happens in one who is heedful ardent and resoluteBut the pleasant feeling that arose in this way did not invade my mind or remainNow at that time Subhadda the Wanderer was staying in KusinaraHe heard that Tonight in the last watch of the night the total Unbinding of Gotama the contemplative will take place Then this thought occurred to him I have heard the elder wanderers teachers of teachers saying that only once in a long long time do Tathagatas  worthy ones rightly selfawakened  appear in the worldTonight in the last watch of the night the total Unbinding of Gotama the contemplative will take placeNow there is a doubt that has arisen in me but I have faith that he could teach me the Dhamma in such a way that I might abandon that doubtSo he went to the Mallan Sal Tree grove and on arrival said to VenAnanda I have heard the elder wanderers teachers of teachers saying that only once in a long long time do Tathagatas  worthy ones rightly selfawakened  appear in the worldTonight in the last watch of the night the total Unbinding of Gotama the contemplative will take placeNow there is a doubt that has arisen in me but I have faith that he could teach me the Dhamma in such a way that I might abandon that doubtIt would be good VenAnanda if you would let me see himWhen this was said VenAnanda said to him Enough friend SubhaddaDo not bother the Blessed OneThe Blessed One is tiredFor a second time For a third time Subhadda the Wanderer said to VenAnanda It would be good VenAnanda if you would let me see himFor a third time VenAnanda said to him Enough friend SubhaddaDo not bother the Blessed OneThe Blessed One is tiredNow the Blessed One heard the exchange between VenAnanda and Subhadda the Wanderer and so he said to VenAnanda Enough AnandaDo not stand in his wayLet him see the TathagataWhatever he asks me will all be for the sake of knowledge and not to be bothersomeAnd whatever I answer when asked he will quickly understandSo VenAnanda said to Subhadda the Wanderer Go ahead friend SubhaddaThe Blessed One gives you his leaveThen Subhadda went to the Blessed One and exchanged courtesies and after the exchange of courtesies sat to one sideAs he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One Lord these brahmans and contemplatives each with his group each with his community each the teacher of his group an honored leader wellregarded by people at large  ie Purana Kassapa Makkhali Gosala Ajita Kesakambalin Pakudha Kaccayana Sañjaya Belatthaputta and the Nigantha Nathaputta Do they all have direct knowledge as they themselves claim or do they all not have direct knowledge or do some of them have direct knowledge and some of them notEnough SubhaddaPut this question asideI will teach you the DhammaListen and pay close attentionI will speakYes lord Subhadda answered and the Blessed One said In any doctrine and discipline where the noble eightfold path is not found no contemplative of the first second third fourth order is foundBut in any doctrine and discipline where the noble eightfold path is found contemplatives of the first second third fourth order are foundThe noble eightfold path is found in this doctrine and discipline and right here there are contemplatives of the first second third fourth orderOther teachings are empty of knowledgeable contemplativesAnd if the monks dwell rightly this world will not be empty of arahantsAnd no contemplative of the second third fourth orderOther teachings are empty of knowledgeable contemplativesAnd if the monks dwell rightly this world will not be empty of arahantsThen Subhadda the Wanderer said Magnificent lord magnificentIn many ways has the Blessed One made the Dhamma clear  just as if one were to place upright what has been overturned to reveal what has been hidden to point out the way to one who is lost or to set out a lamp in the darkness so that those with eyes might see formsI go to the Blessed One for refuge and to the Dhamma and to the community of monksLet me obtain the going forth in the Blessed Ones presence let me obtain admissionAnyone Subhadda who has previously belonged to another sect and who desires the going forth and admission in this doctrine and discipline must first undergo probation for four monthsIf at the end of four months the monks feel so moved they give him the going forth and admit him to the monks stateBut I know distinctions among individuals in this matterLord if that is so I am willing to undergo probation for four yearsIf at the end of four years the monks feel so moved let them give me the going forth and admit me to the monks stateThen the Blessed One said to VenAnanda Very well then Ananda give Subhadda the going forthYes lord Ananda answeredThen Subhadda said to VenAnanda It is a gain for you Ananda a great gain that you have been anointed here in the Teachers presence with the pupils anointingThen Subhadda the Wanderer received the going forth and the admission in the Blessed Ones presenceAnd not long after his admission  dwelling alone secluded heedful ardent and resolute  he in no long time reached and remained in the supreme goal of the holy life for which clansmen rightly go forth from home into homelessness knowing and realizing it for himself in the here and nowHe knew Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task doneThere is nothing further for the sake of this world And thus VenSubhadda became another one of the arahants the last of the Blessed Ones facetoface disciplesThen the Blessed One addressed the monks I exhort you monks All processes are subject to decayBring about completion by being heedful Those were the Tathagatas last wordsThen the Blessed One entered the first jhanaEmerging from that he entered the secondEmerging from that he entered the third the fourth the dimension of the infinitude of space the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness the dimension of nothingness the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception the cessation of perception and feelingThen VenAnanda said to VenAnuruddha The Blessed One sir has entered total UnbindingNo friend the Blessed One has not entered total UnbindingHe has attained the cessation of perception and feelingThen emerging from the cessation of perception and feeling the Blessed One entered the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception the dimension of nothingness the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness the dimension of the infinitude of space the fourth jhana the third the second the first jhanaEmerging from the first jhana he entered the second the third the fourth jhanaEmerging from the fourth jhana he entered total Unbinding in the interimWhen the Blessed One had attained total Unbinding Sakka ruler of the gods uttered this stanzaThere are these five facts that one should reflect on often whether one is a woman or a man lay or ordainedWhich fiveI am subject to aging have not gone beyond agingI am subject to illness have not gone beyond illnessI am subject to death have not gone beyond deathI will grow different separate from all that is dear and appealing to meI am the owner of my actions heir to my actions born of my actions related through my actions and have my actions as my arbitratorWhatever I do for good or for evil to that will I fall heirThese are the five facts that one should reflect on often whether one is a woman or a man lay or ordainedNow based on what line of reasoning should one often reflect that I am subject to aging have not gone beyond agingThere are beings who are intoxicated with a youths intoxication with youthBecause of that intoxication with youth they conduct themselves in a bad way in body in speech and in mindBut when they often reflect on that fact that youths intoxication with youth will either be entirely abandoned or grow weakerNow based on what line of reasoning should one often reflect that I am subject to illness have not gone beyond illnessThere are beings who are intoxicated with a healthy persons intoxication with healthBecause of that intoxication with health they conduct themselves in a bad way in body in speech and in mindBut when they often reflect on that fact that healthy persons intoxication with health will either be entirely abandoned or grow weakerNow based on what line of reasoning should one often reflect that I am subject to death have not gone beyond deathThere are beings who are intoxicated with a living persons intoxication with lifeBecause of that intoxication with life they conduct themselves in a bad way in body in speech and in mindBut when they often reflect on that fact that living persons intoxication with life will either be entirely abandoned or grow weakerNow based on what line of reasoning should one often reflect that I will grow different separate from all that is dear and appealing to meThere are beings who feel desire and passion for the things they find dear and appealingBecause of that passion they conduct themselves in a bad way in body in speech and in mindBut when they often reflect on that fact that desire and passion for the things they find dear and appealing will either be entirely abandoned or grow weakerNow based on what line of reasoning should one often reflect that I am the owner of my actions heir to my actions born of my actions related through my actions and have my actions as my arbitratorWhatever I do for good or for evil to that will I fall heirThere are beings who conduct themselves in a bad way in body in speech and in mindBut when they often reflect on that fact that bad conduct in body speech and mind will either be entirely abandoned or grow weakerNow a noble disciple considers this I am not the only one subject to aging who has not gone beyond agingTo the extent that there are beings  past and future passing away and rearising  all beings are subject to aging have not gone beyond aging When heshe often reflects on this the path take birthHeshe sticks with that path develops it cultivates itAs heshe sticks with that path develops it and cultivates it the fetters are abandoned the latent tendencies destroyedI do not see any one quality by which unarisen skillful qualities arise and arisen unskillful qualities subside like friendship with admirable peopleWhen a person is friends with admirable people unarisen skillful qualities arise and arisen unskillful qualities subsideNow what TigerPaw is friendship with admirable peopleThere is the case

discernmentGrowing in terms of these five types of growth the female noble disciple grows in the noble growth grasps hold of what is essential what is excellent in the body S XXXVIIKamma should be knownThe cause by which kamma comes into play should be knownThe diversity in kamma should be knownThe result of kamma should be knownThe cessation of kamma should be knownThe path of practice for the cessation of kamma should be known Thus it has been saidWhy was it saidIntention I tell you is kammaIntending one does kamma by way of body speech and intellectAnd what is the cause by which kamma comes into playContactAnd what is the diversity in kammaThere is kamma to be experienced in purgatory kamma to be experienced in the realm of common animals kamma to be experienced in the realm of the hungry shades kamma to be experienced in the human world kamma to be experienced in the celestial worldsAnd what is the result of kammaThe result of kamma is of three sorts I tell you that which arises right here and now that which arises later and that which arises following thatAnd what is the cessation of kammaFrom the cessation of contact is the cessation of kammaAnd what is the way leading to the cessation of kammaJust this noble eightfold path right view right resolve right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness right concentrationNow when a noble disciple discerns kamma in this way the cause by which kamma comes into play in this way the diversity of kamma in this way the result of kamma in this way the cessation of kamma in this way and the path of practice leading to the cessation of kamma in this way then he discerns this penetrative holy life as the cessation of kammaThe Buddha What do you think Rahula What is a mirror forRahula For reflection sirThe Buddha In the same way Rahula bodily acts verbal acts and mental acts are to be done with repeated reflectionWhenever you want to perform a bodily act you should reflect on it This bodily act I want to perform  would it lead to selfaffliction to the affliction of others or to bothIs it an unskillful bodily act with painful consequences painful results If on reflection you know that it would lead to selfaffliction to the affliction of others or to both it would be an unskillful bodily act with painful consequences painful results then any bodily act of that sort is absolutely unfit for you to doBut if on reflection you know that it would not cause affliction it would be a skillful bodily act with happy consequences happy results then any bodily act of that sort is fit for you to doWhile you are performing a bodily act you should reflect on it This bodily act I am doing  is it leading to selfaffliction to the affliction of others or to bothIs it an unskillful bodily act with painful consequences painful results If on reflection you know that it is leading to selfaffliction to affliction of others or both you should give it upBut if on reflection you know that it is not you may continue with itHaving performed a bodily act you should reflect on it If on reflection you know that it led to selfaffliction to the affliction of others or to both it was an unskillful bodily act with painful consequences painful results then you should confess it reveal it lay it open to the Teacher or to a knowledgeable companion in the holy lifeHaving confessed it you should exercise restraint in the futureBut if on reflection you know that it did not lead to affliction it was a skillful bodily act with happy consequences happy results then you should stay mentally refreshed and joyful training day and night in skillful mental qualitiesHaving performed a mental act you should reflect on it If on reflection you know that it led to selfaffliction to the affliction of others or to both it was an unskillful mental act with painful consequences painful results then you should feel horrified humiliated and disgusted with itFeeling horrified you should exercise restraint in the futureBut if on reflection you know that it did not lead to affliction it was a skillful mental act with happy consequences happy results then you should stay mentally refreshed and joyful training day and night in skillful mental qualitiesRahula all the brahmans and contemplatives in the course of the past who purified their bodily acts verbal acts and mental acts did it through repeated reflection on their bodily acts verbal acts and mental acts in just this wayAll the brahmans and contemplatives in the course of the future All the brahmans and contemplatives at present who purify their bodily acts verbal acts and mental acts do it through repeated reflection on their bodily acts verbal acts and mental acts in just this wayTherefore Rahula you should train yourself I will purify my bodily acts through repeated reflectionI will purify my verbal acts through repeated reflectionI will purify my mental acts through repeated reflection Thus you should train yourselfThat is what the Blessed One saidPleased VenRahula delighted in the Blessed Ones wordsThese five things are welcome agreeable pleasant and hard to obtain in the worldWhich fiveLong life beauty pleasure status rebirth in heaven Now I tell you these five things are not to be obtained by reason of prayers or wishesIf they were to be obtained by reason of prayers or wishes who here would lack themIt is not fitting for the noble disciple who desires long life to pray for it or to delight in doing soInstead the noble disciple who desires long life should follow the path of practice leading to long lifeIn so doing he will attain long life either human or divineI have heard that at one time the Blessed One was staying in Savatthi at Jetas Grove Anathapindikas monasteryThen a certain deva in the far extreme of the night her extreme radiance lighting up the entirety of Jetas Grove approached the Blessed OneOn approaching having bowed down to the Blessed One she stood to one sideAs she was standing there she addressed him with a verseThese are the five rewards of generosity One is dear and appealing to people at large one is admired by good people ones good name is spread about one does not stray from the rightful duties of the householder and with the breakup of the body at death one reappears in a good destination in the heavenly worldsIf beings knew as I know the results of giving and sharing they would not eat without having given nor would the stain of miserliness overcome their mindsEven if it were their last bite their last mouthful they would not eat without having shared if there were someone to receive their giftBut because beings do not know as I know the results of giving and sharing they eat without having givenThe stain of miserliness overcomes their mindsNow on that occasion Princess Sumana  with an entourage of ladiesinwaiting riding on carriages  went to where the Buddha was stayingOn arrival having bowed down she sat to one sideAs she was sitting there she said to the Blessed One Suppose there were two disciples of the Blessed One equal in conviction virtue and discernment but one was a giver of alms and the other was notAt the breakup of the body after death they would reappear in a good destination in the heavenly worldHaving become devas would there be any distinction any difference between the twoYes there would said the Blessed OneThe one who was a giver of alms on becoming a deva would surpass the other in five areas in divine life span divine beauty divine pleasure divine status and divine power And if they were to fall from there and reappear in this world Having become human beings would there be any distinction any difference between the twoYes there would said the Blessed OneThe one who was a giver of alms on becoming a human being would surpass the other in five areas in human life span human beauty human pleasure human status and human power And if they were to go forth from home into the homeless life of a monk Having gone forth would there be any distinction any difference between the twoYes there would said the Blessed OneThe one who was a giver of alms on going forth would surpass the other in five areas He would often be asked to make use of robes it would be rare that he wouldnt be askedHe would often be asked to take food to make use of shelter to make use of medicine it would be rare that he wouldnt be askedHis companions in the holy life would often treat him with pleasing actions pleasing words pleasing thoughts and present him with pleasing gifts and rarely with unpleasing And if both were to attain arahantship would there be any distinction any difference between their attainments of arahantshipIn that case I tell you that there would be no difference between the two as to their releaseIt is awesome lord and astoundingJust this is reason enough to give alms to make merit in that it benefits one as a deva as a human being and as a monkA VThere are these five gifts five great gifts  original longstanding traditional ancient unadulterated unadulterated from the beginning  are not open to suspicion will never be open to suspicion and are unfaulted by knowledgeable contemplatives and brahmansWhich fiveThere is the case where a noble disciple abandoning the taking of life abstains from taking lifeIn doing so he gives freedom from danger freedom from animosity freedom from oppression to limitless numbers of beingsIn giving freedom from danger freedom from animosity freedom from oppression to limitless numbers of beings he gains a share in limitless freedom from danger freedom from animosity and freedom from oppressionAbandoning taking what is not given he abstains from taking what is not givenAbandoning illicit sex he abstains from illicit sexAbandoning lying he abstains from lyingAbandoning the use of intoxicants he abstains from taking intoxicantsIn doing so he gives freedom from danger freedom from animosity freedom from oppression to limitless numbers of beingsIn giving freedom from danger freedom from animosity freedom from oppression to limitless numbers of beings he gains a share in limitless freedom from danger freedom from animosity and freedom from oppression This is the fifth gift the fifth great gift  original longstanding traditional ancient unadulterated unadulterated from the beginning  that is not open to suspicion will never be open to suspicion and is unfaulted by knowledgeable contemplatives and brahmansCleansing with regard to the body Cunda is threefold cleansing with regard to speech is fourfold and cleansing with regard to the mind threefoldAnd how is cleansing with regard to the body threefoldThere is the case where a certain person abandoning the taking of life abstains from the taking of lifeHe dwells with his rod laid down his knife laid down scrupulous merciful compassionate for the welfare of all living beingsAbandoning the taking of what is not given he abstains from taking what is not givenHe does not take the ungiven property of another whether in a village or in the wilderness with thievish intentAbandoning sensual misconduct he abstains from sensual misconductHe does not get sexually involved with those who are protected by their mothers their fathers their brothers their sisters their relatives or their Dhamma those with husbands those who entail punishments or even those crowned with flowers by another manThis is how cleansing with regard to the body is threefoldAnd how is cleansing with regard to speech fourfoldThere is the case where a certain person abandoning false speech abstains from false speechWhen he has been called to a town meeting a group meeting a gathering of his relatives his guild or of the royalty if he is asked as a witness Come and tell good man what you know If he doesnt know he says I dont know If he does know he says I know If he hasnt seen he says I havent seen If he has seen he says I have seen Thus he doesnt consciously tell a lie for his own sake for the sake of another or for the sake of any rewardAbandoning divisive speech he abstains from divisive speechWhat he has heard here he does not tell there to break those people apart from these people hereWhat he has heard there he does not tell here to break these people apart from those people thereThus reconciling those who have broken apart or cementing those who are united he loves concord delights in concord enjoys concord speaks things that create concordAbandoning abusive speech he abstains from abusive speechHe speaks words that are soothing to the ear that are affectionate that go to the heart that are polite appealing  pleasing to people at largeAbandoning idle chatter he abstains from idle chatterHe speaks in season speaks what is factual what is in accordance with the goal the Dhamma and the VinayaHe speaks words worth treasuring seasonable reasonable circumscribed connected with the goalThis is how cleansing with regard to speech is fourfoldAnd how is cleansing with regard to the mind threefoldThere is the case where a certain person is not covetousHe does not covet the property of another thinking O if only what belongs to another were mine He is not malevolent at heart or destructive in his resolvesHe thinks May these beings  free from animosity free from oppression and free from trouble  look after themselves with ease He has right views and an unperverted outlookHe believes There is what is given what is offered what is sacrificedThere are fruits and results of good and bad actionsThere is this world and the next worldThere is mother and fatherThere are spontaneously reborn beings there are brahmans and contemplatives who living rightly and practicing rightly proclaim this world and the next after having directly known and realized it for themselves This is how cleansing with regard to the mind is threefoldThere are these five benefits in being virtuous in being consummate in virtueWhich fiveThere is the case where a virtuous person consummate in virtue through not being heedless in his affairs amasses a great quantity of wealth His good name is spread about When approaching an assembly of nobles brahmans householders or contemplatives he does so unabashed and with assurance He dies without becoming delirious With the breakup of the body after death he reappears in a good destination in the heavenly worldThese are the five benefits in being virtuous in being consummate in virtueThe Buddha Suppose that a Universal Monarch possessed the seven treasures and the four forms of prowessNow what do you thinkWould he experience pleasure and joyThe monks Yes lordThen taking a small stone the size of his hand the Blessed One said What do you thinkWhich is larger this small stone that I have taken the size of my hand or the Himalayas king of mountainsIt is minuscule the small stone It does not count beside the Himalayas the king of mountainsIt is not even a small fractionThere is no comparisonIn the same way the pleasure and joy that the Universal Monarch experiences on account of his seven treasures and four forms of prowess do not count beside the pleasures of heavenThey are not even a small fractionThere is no comparisonNow what is the allure of sensualityThere are monks these five strings of sensualityWhich fiveForms cognizable via the eye  agreeable pleasing charming endearing fostering desire enticingSounds cognizable via the ear Aromas cognizable via the nose Flavors cognizable via the tongue Tactile sensations cognizable via the body  agreeable pleasing charming endearing fostering desire enticingNow whatever pleasure or joy arises in dependence on these five strings of sensuality that is the allure of sensualityAnd what is the drawback of sensualityThere is the case where on account of the occupation by which a clansman makes a living  whether checking or accounting or calculating or plowing or trading or cattle tending or archery or as a kings man or whatever the occupation may be  he faces cold he faces heat being harassed by mosquitoes flies wind sun and creeping things dying from hunger and thirstNow this drawback in the case of sensuality this mass of stress visible here and now has sensuality for its reason sensuality for its source sensuality for its cause the reason being simply sensualityIf the clansman gains no wealth while thus working and striving and making effort he sorrows grieves and laments beats his breast becomes distraught My work is in vain my efforts are fruitless Now this drawback too in the case of sensuality this mass of stress visible here and now has sensuality for its reasonIf the clansman gains wealth while thus working and striving and making effort he experiences pain and distress in protecting it How shall neither kings nor thieves make off with my property nor fire burn it nor water sweep it away nor hateful heirs make off with it And as he thus guards and watches over his property kings or thieves make off with it or fire burns it or water sweeps it away or hateful heirs make off with itAnd he sorrows grieves and laments beats his breast becomes distraught What was mine is no more Now this drawback too in the case of sensuality this mass of stress visible here and now has sensuality for its reasonFurthermore it is with sensuality for the reason sensuality for the source sensuality for the cause the reason being simply sensuality that kings quarrel with kings nobles with nobles brahmans with brahmans householders with householders mother with child child with mother father with child child with father brother with brother sister with sister brother with sister sister with brother friend with friendAnd then in their quarrels brawls and disputes they attack one another with fists or with clods or with sticks or with knives so that they incur death or deadly painNow this drawback too in the case of sensuality this mass of stress visible here and now has sensuality for its reasonFurthermore it is with sensuality for the reason sensuality for the source that taking swords and shields and buckling on bows and quivers charge into battle massed in double array while arrows and spears are flying and swords are flashing and there they are wounded by arrows and spears and their heads are cut off by swords so that they incur death or deadly painNow this drawback too in the case of sensuality this mass of stress visible here and now has sensuality for its reasonFurthermore it is with sensuality for the reason sensuality for the source that taking swords and shields and buckling on bows and quivers charge slippery bastions while arrows and spears are flying and swords are flashing and there they are splashed with boiling cow dung and crushed under heavy weights and their heads are cut off by swords so that they incur death or deadly painNow this drawback too in the case of sensuality this mass of stress visible here and now has sensuality for its reason sensuality for its source sensuality for its cause the reason being simply sensualityAnd what is the emancipation from sensualityWhatever is the subduing of passion and desire the abandoning of passion and desire for sensuality that is the emancipation from sensualityWhich do you think is greater the tears you have shed while transmigrating and wandering this long time  crying and weeping from being joined with what is displeasing from being separated from what is pleasing  or the water in the four great oceans This is the greater The tears you have shed Why is thatFrom an inconceivable beginning comes transmigrationA beginning point is not evident although beings hindered by ignorance and fettered by craving are transmigrating and wandering onLong have you thus experienced stress experienced pain experienced loss swelling the cemeteries  long enough to become disenchanted with all conditioned things enough to become dispassionate enough to be releasedJanussonin I hold that there is no one who subject to death is not afraid or in terror of deathThe Buddha There are those who subject to death are afraid and in terror of deathAnd there are those who subject to death are not afraid or in terror of deathAnd who is the person who subject to death is afraid and in terror of deathThere is the case of the person who has not abandoned passion desire fondness thirst fever and craving for sensualityWhen he comes down with a serious disease the thought occurs to him O those beloved sensual pleasures will be taken from me and I will be taken from them He grieves and is tormented weeps beats his breast and grows deliriousFurthermore there is the case of the person who has not abandoned passion desire fondness thirst fever and craving for the bodyWhen he is touched by a serious disease the thought occurs to him O my beloved body will be taken from me and I will be taken from my body He grieves and is tormented weeps beats his breast and grows deliriousFurthermore there is the case of the person who has not done what is good has not done what is skillful has not given protection to those in fear and instead has done what is evil savage and cruelWhen he comes down with a serious disease the thought occurs to him After death I am headed for the destination of those who have done what is evil savage and cruel He grieves and is tormented weeps beats his breast and grows deliriousFurthermore there is the case of the person in doubt and perplexity who has not arrived at certainty with regard to the True DhammaWhen he comes down with a serious disease the thought occurs to him How doubtful and perplexed I amI have not arrived at any certainty with regard to the True Dhamma He grieves and is tormented weeps beats his breast and grows deliriousThis is another person who subject to death is afraid and in terror of deathAnd who is the person who is not afraid or in terror of deathThere is the case of the person who has abandoned passion desire fondness thirst fever and craving for sensuality who has abandoned passion desire fondness thirst fever and craving for the body who has done what is good what is skillful has given protection to those in fear and has not done what is evil savage or cruel who has no doubt or perplexity who has arrived at certainty with regard to the True DhammaWhen he comes down with a serious disease he does not grieve is not tormented does not weep or beat his breast or grow deliriousThis is another person who subject to death is not afraid or in terror of deathNow at that time VenBhaddiya Kaligodha on going to a forest to the foot of a tree or to an empty dwelling would repeatedly exclaim What blissWhat bliss Many monks heard him repeatedly exclaim What blissWhat bliss and on hearing him the thought occurred to them Theres no doubt but that VenBhaddiya Kaligodha is not enjoying the holy life for when he was a householder he enjoyed royal pleasures so that now on recollecting them he is exclaiming What blissWhat bliss They went to the Blessed One and told him and he told a certain monk Come monkIn my name call Bhaddiya saying The Teacher calls you my friendYes lord the monk answeredThen VenBhaddiya went to where the Blessed One was staying and on arrival having bowed down sat to one sideAs he was sitting there the Blessed One said to him Is it true Bhaddiya that on going to a forest to the foot of a tree or to an empty dwelling you repeatedly exclaim What blissWhat blissYes lordWhat do you have in mind that you repeatedly exclaim What blissWhat blissBefore when I was a householder maintaining my reign I had guards posted within and without the royal apartments within and without the city within and without the countrysideBut even though I was thus guarded thus protected I dwelled in fear  agitated distrustful and afraidBut now on going alone to a forest to the foot of a tree or to an empty dwelling I dwell without fear unagitated confident and unafraid  unconcerned unruffled my wants satisfied with my mind like a wild deerThis is what I have in mind that I repeatedly exclaim What blissWhat blissNow this monks is the noble truth of stress Birth is stressful aging is stressful death is stressful sorrow lamentation pain distress and despair are stressful association with the unbeloved is stressful separation from the loved is stressful not getting what is wanted is stressfulIn short the five aggregates for sustenance are stressfulAnd this monks is the noble truth of the origination of stress the craving that makes for further becoming  accompanied by passion and delight relishing now here and now there  ie craving for sensual pleasure craving for becoming craving for nonbecomingAnd this monks is the noble truth of the cessation of stress the remainderless fading and cessation renunciation relinquishment release and letting go of that very cravingAnd this monks is the noble truth of the way leading to the cessation of stress precisely this Noble Eightfold Path  right view right intention right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness right concentrationVision arose insight arose discernment arose knowledge arose illumination arose within me with regard to things never heard before This is the noble truth of stressThis noble truth of stress is to be comprehendedThis noble truth of stress has been comprehendedThis is the noble truth of the origination of stressThis noble truth of the origination of stress is to be abandonedThis noble truth of the origination of stress has been abandonedThis is the noble truth of the cessation of stressThis noble truth of the cessation of stress is to be directly experiencedThis noble truth of the cessation of stress has been directly experiencedThis is the noble truth of the way leading to the cessation of stressThis noble truth of the way leading to the cessation of stress is to be developedThis noble truth of the way leading to the cessation of stress has been developedAnd monks as long as this knowledge and vision of mine  with its three rounds and twelve permutations concerning these four noble truths as they actually are  was not pure I did not claim to have directly awakened to the unexcelled right selfawakening But as soon as this knowledge and vision of mine  with its three rounds and twelve permutations concerning these four noble truths as they actually are  was truly pure then did I claim to have directly awakened to the unexcelled right selfawakening The knowledge and vision arose in me Unshakable is my releaseThis is the last birthThere is now no further becomingI have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying at Varanasi in the Game Refuge at IsipatanaThere he addressed the group of five monksPhysical form monks is not the selfIf physical form were the self this physical form would not lend itself to diseaseOne could get physical form to be like this and not be like thatBut precisely because physical form is not the self it lends itself to diseaseAnd one cannot get physical form to be like this and not be like thatFeeling is not the self Perception is not the self Mental fabrications are not the selfConsciousness is not the selfIf consciousness were the self this consciousness would not lend itself to diseaseOne could get consciousness to be like this and not be like thatBut precisely because consciousness is not the self it lends itself to diseaseAnd one cannot get consciousness to be like this and not be like thatWhat do you think monks  Is physical form constant or inconstant  Inconstant Lord  And whatever is inconstant Is it easeful or stressful  Stressful Lord  And is it right to assume with regard to whatever is inconstant stressful subject to change that This is mineThis is my selfThis is what I am  No LordIs feeling constant or inconstant Is perception constant or inconstant Are mental fabrications constant or inconstantIs consciousness constant or inconstant  Inconstant Lord  And whatever is inconstant Is it easeful or stressful  Stressful Lord  And is it right to assume with regard to whatever is inconstant stressful subject to change that This is mineThis is my selfThis is what I am  No LordThus monks any physical form whatsoever  past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or near every physical form  is to be seen as it actually is with right discernment as This is not mineThis is not my selfThis is not what I amAny feeling whatsoever Any perception whatsoever Any mental fabrications whatsoeverAny consciousness whatsoever  past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or near every consciousness  is to be seen as it actually is with right discernment as This is not mineThis is not my selfThis is not what I amSeeing thus the instructed noble disciple grows disenchanted with the body disenchanted with feeling disenchanted with perception disenchanted with mental processes and disenchanted with consciousnessDisenchanted he grows dispassionateThrough dispassion he is releasedWith release there is the knowledge Released He discerns that Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task doneThere is nothing further for this worldThat is what the Blessed One saidGlad at heart the group of five monks delighted at his wordsAnd while this explanation was being given the hearts of the group of five monks through not clinging were released from the mental fermentationsAnd what is the noble method that is rightly seen and rightly ferreted out by discernmentThere is the case where a noble disciple noticesIn other wordsNow from the remainderless fading and cessation of that very ignorance comes the cessation of fabricationsFrom the cessation of fabrications comes the cessation of consciousnessFrom the cessation of consciousness comes the cessation of nameandformFrom the cessation of nameandform comes the cessation of the six sense mediaFrom the cessation of the six sense media comes the cessation of contactFrom the cessation of contact comes the cessation of feelingFrom the cessation of feeling comes the cessation of cravingFrom the cessation of craving comes the cessation of clingingsustenanceFrom the cessation of clingingsustenance comes the cessation of becomingFrom the cessation of becoming comes the cessation of birthFrom the cessation of birth then old age and death sorrow lamentation pain distress and despair all ceaseSuch is the cessation of this entire mass of stress and sufferingThis is the noble method that is rightly seen and rightly ferreted out by discernmentMonks what is the noble eightfold pathRight view right resolve right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness right concentrationAnd what is right viewKnowledge with regard to stress knowledge with regard to the origination of stress knowledge with regard to the cessation of stress knowledge with regard to the way of practice leading to the cessation of stress This is called right viewAnd what is right resolveBeing resolved on renunciation on freedom from ill will on harmlessness This is called right resolveAnd what is right speechAbstaining from lying from divisive speech from abusive speech and from idle chatter This is called right speechAnd what is right actionAbstaining from taking life from stealing and from unchastityThis is called right actionAnd what is right livelihoodThere is the case where a noble disciple having abandoned dishonest livelihood keeps his life going with right livelihood This is called right livelihoodAnd what is right effortThere is the case where a monk generates desire endeavors arouses persistence upholds and exerts his intent for the sake of the nonarising of evil unskillful qualities that have not yet arisen for the sake of the abandoning of evil unskillful qualities that have arisen for the sake of the arising of skillful qualities that have not yet arisen for the maintenance nonconfusion increase plenitude development and culmination of skillful qualities that have arisen This is called right effortAnd what is right mindfulnessThere is the case where a monk remains focused on the body in and of itself  ardent alert and mindful  putting aside greed and distress with reference to the worldHe remains focused on feelings in and of themselves the mind in and of itself mental qualities in and of themselves  ardent alert and mindful  putting aside greed and distress with reference to the worldThis is called right mindfulnessAnd what is right concentrationThere is the case where a monk enters and remains in the first jhana the second jhana the third jhana the fourth jhana purity of equanimity and mindfulness neither pleasure nor painThis is called right concentrationThen Anathapindika the householder went to where the wanderers of other persuasions were stayingOn arrival he greeted them courteouslyAfter an exchange of friendly greetings and courtesies he sat to one sideAs he was sitting there the wanderers said to him Tell us householder what views Gotama the contemplative hasVenerable sirs I dont know entirely what views the Blessed One hasWell wellSo you dont know entirely what views Gotama the contemplative hasThen tell us what views the monks haveI dont even know entirely what views the monks haveSo you dont know entirely what views Gotama the contemplative has or even that the monks haveThen tell us what views you haveIt wouldnt be difficult for me to expound to you what views I haveBut please let the venerable ones expound each in line with his position and then it wont be difficult for me to expound to you what views I haveWhen this had been said one of the wanderers said to Anathapindika the householder The cosmos is eternalOnly this is true anything otherwise is worthlessThis is the sort of view I haveAnother wanderer said to Anathapindika The cosmos is not eternalOnly this is true anything otherwise is worthlessThis is the sort of view I haveAnother wanderer said The cosmos is finiteThe cosmos is infiniteThe soul and the body are the sameThe soul is one thing and the body anotherAfter death a Tathagata existsAfter death a Tathagata does not existAfter death a Tathagata both does and does not existAfter death a Tathagata neither does nor does not existOnly this is true anything otherwise is worthlessThis is the sort of view I haveWhen this had been said Anathapindika the householder said to the wanderers As for the venerable one who says The cosmos is eternalOnly this is true anything otherwise is worthlessThis is the sort of view I have his view arises from his own inappropriate attention or in dependence on the words of anotherNow this view has been brought into being is fabricated willed dependently originatedWhatever has been brought into being is fabricated willed dependently originated that is inconstantWhatever is inconstant is stressThis venerable one thus adheres to that very stress submits himself to that very stress When this had been said the wanderers said to Anathapindika the householder We have each and every one expounded to you in line with our own positionsNow tell us what views you haveWhatever has been brought into being is fabricated willed dependently originated that is inconstantWhatever is inconstant is stressWhatever is stress is not me is not what I am is not my selfThis is the sort of view I haveSo householder whatever has been brought into being is fabricated willed dependently originated that is inconstantWhatever is inconstant is stressYou thus adhere to that very stress submit yourself to that very stressVenerable sirs whatever has been brought into being is fabricated willed dependently originated that is inconstantWhatever is inconstant is stressWhatever is stress is not me is not what I am is not my selfHaving seen this well with right discernment as it actually is present I also discern the higher escape from it as it actually is presentWhen this had been said the wanderers fell silent abashed sitting with their shoulders drooping their heads down brooding at a loss for wordsAnathapindika the householder perceiving that the wanderers were silent abashed at a loss for words got up and leftThere is the case where an uninstructed runofthemill person does not discern what ideas are fit for attention or what ideas are unfit for attentionThis being so he does not attend to ideas fit for attention and attends instead to ideas unfit for attention This is how he attends inappropriately Was I in the pastWas I not in the pastWhat was I in the pastHow was I in the pastHaving been what what was I in the pastShall I be in the futureShall I not be in the futureWhat shall I be in the futureHow shall I be in the futureHaving been what what shall I be in the future Or else he is inwardly perplexed about the immediate present Am IAm I notWhat am IHow am IWhere has this being come fromWhere is it boundAs this person attends inappropriately in this way one of six kinds of view arises in him The view I have a self arises in him as true and established or the view I have no self or the view It is by means of self that I perceive self or the view It is by means of self that I perceive notself or the view It is by means of notself that I perceive self arises in him as true and established or else he has a view like this This very self of mine  the knower that is sensitive here and there to the ripening of good and bad actions  is the self of mine that is constant everlasting eternal not subject to change and will endure as long as eternityThis is called a thicket of views a wilderness of views a contortion of views a writhing of views a fetter of viewsBound by a fetter of views the uninstructed runofthemill person is not freed from birth aging and death from sorrow lamentation pain distress and despairHe is not freed from stress I sayThe welltaught noble disciple discerns what ideas are fit for attention and what ideas are unfit for attentionThis being so he does not attend to ideas unfit for attention and attends instead to ideas fit for attention He attends appropriately This is stress This is the origin of stress This is the cessation of stress This is the way leading to the cessation of stressAs he attends appropriately in this way three fetters are abandoned in him identityview doubt and grasping at precepts and practicesKaccayana Lord Right view right view it is saidTo what extent is there right viewThe Buddha By and large Kaccayana this cosmos is supported by a polarity that of existence and nonexistenceBut when one sees the origination of the cosmos as it actually is with right discernment nonexistence with reference to the cosmos does not occur to oneWhen one sees the cessation of the cosmos as it actually is with right discernment existence with reference to the cosmos does not occur to oneBy and large Kaccayana this cosmos is in bondage to attachments clingings and biasesBut one such as this does not get involved with or cling to these attachments clingings fixations of awareness biases and latent tendencies nor is he resolved on my self He has no uncertainty or doubt that when there is arising only stress is arising and that when there is passing away stress is passing awayIn this ones knowledge is independent of othersIt is to this extent Kaccayana that there is right viewVisakha Now what is concentration what qualities are its themes what qualities are its requisites and what is its developmentSister Dhammadinna Singleness of mind is concentration the four frames of reference are its themes the four right exertions are its requisites and any cultivation development and pursuit of these qualities is its developmentMindfulness of inandout breathing when developed and pursued brings the four frames of reference to their culminationThe four frames of reference when developed and pursued bring the seven factors for Awakening to their culminationThe seven factors for Awakening when developed and pursued bring clear knowing and release to their culminationNow how is mindfulness of inandout breathing developed and pursuedso as to bring the four frames of reference to their culminationThere is the case where a monk having gone to the wilderness to the shade of a tree or to an empty building sits down folding his legs crosswise holding his body erect and setting mindfulness to the foreAlways mindful he breathes in mindful he breathes out Breathing in long he discerns I am breathing in long or breathing out long he discerns I am breathing out long Or breathing in short he discerns I am breathing in short or breathing out short he discerns I am breathing out short He trains himself I will breathe in sensitive to the entire body He trains himself I will breathe out sensitive to the entire body He trains himself I will breathe in calming bodily fabrication He trains himself I will breathe out calming bodily fabricationHe trains himself to breathe in sensitive to rapture and to breathe out sensitive to raptureHe trains himself to breathe in sensitive to pleasure and to breathe out sensitive to pleasureHe trains himself to breathe in sensitive to mental fabrication and to breathe out sensitive to mental fabricationHe trains himself to breathe in calming mental fabrication and to breathe out calming mental fabricationHe trains himself to breathe in sensitive to the mind and to breathe out sensitive to the mindHe trains himself to breathe in satisfying the mind and to breathe out satisfying the mindHe trains himself to breathe in steadying the mind and to breathe out steadying the mindHe trains himself to breathe in releasing the mind and to breathe out releasing the mindHe trains himself to breathe in focusing on inconstancy and to breathe out focusing on inconstancyHe trains himself to breathe in focusing on dispassion and to breathe out focusing on dispassionHe trains himself to breathe in focusing on cessation and to breathe out focusing on cessationHe trains himself to breathe in focusing on relinquishment and to breathe out focusing on relinquishmentNow on whatever occasion a monk breathing in long discerns that he is breathing in long or breathing out long discerns that he is breathing out long or breathing in short discerns that he is breathing in short or breathing out short discerns that he is breathing out short trains himself to breathe in and out sensitive to the entire body trains himself to breathe in and out calming bodily fabrication On that occasion the monk remains focused on the body in and of itself  ardent alert and mindful  putting aside greed and distress with reference to the worldI tell you monks that this  the inandout breath  is classed as a body among bodies which is why the monk on that occasion remains focused on the body in and of itself  ardent alert and mindful  putting aside greed and distress with reference to the worldOn whatever occasion a monk trains himself to breathe in and out sensitive to rapture trains himself to breathe in and out sensitive to pleasure trains himself to breathe in and out sensitive to mental fabrication trains himself to breathe in and out calming mental fabrication On that occasion the monk remains focused on feelings in and of themselves  ardent alert and mindful  putting aside greed and distress with reference to the worldI tell you monks that this  close attention to inandout breaths  is classed as a feeling among feelings which is why the monk on that occasion remains focused on feelings in and of themselves  ardent alert and mindful  putting aside greed and distress with reference to the worldOn whatever occasion a monk trains himself to breathe in and out sensitive to the mind trains himself to breathe in and out satisfying the mind trains himself to breathe in and out steadying the mind trains himself to breathe in and out releasing the mind On that occasion the monk remains focused on the mind in and of itself  ardent alert and mindful  putting aside greed and distress with reference to the worldI dont say that there is mindfulness of inandout breathing in one of confused mindfulness and no alertness which is why the monk on that occasion remains focused on the mind in and of itself  ardent alert and mindful  putting aside greed and distress with reference to the worldOn whatever occasion a monk trains himself to breathe in and out focusing on inconstancy trains himself to breathe in and out focusing on dispassion trains himself to breathe in and out focusing on cessation trains himself to breathe in and out focusing on relinquishment On that occasion the monk remains focused on mental qualities in and of themselves  ardent alert and mindful  putting aside greed and distress with reference to the worldHe who sees clearly with discernment the abandoning of greed and distress is one who oversees with equanimity which is why the monk on that occasion remains focused on mental qualities in and of themselves  ardent alert and mindful  putting aside greed and distress with reference to the worldThis is how mindfulness of inandout breathing is developed and pursued so as to bring the four frames of reference to their culminationAnd how are the four frames of reference developed and pursued so as to bring the seven factors for Awakening to their culminationOn whatever occasion the monk remains focused on the body in and of itself  ardent alert and mindful  putting aside greed and distress with reference to the world on that occasion his mindfulness is steady and without lapseWhen his mindfulness is steady and without lapse then mindfulness as a factor for Awakening becomes arousedHe develops it and for him it goes to the culmination of its developmentRemaining mindful in this way he examines analyzes and comes to a comprehension of that quality with discernmentWhen he

for him it goes to the culmination of its developmentIn one who examines analyzes and comes to a comprehension of that quality with discernment unflagging persistence is arousedWhen unflagging persistence is aroused in one who examines analyzes and comes to a comprehension of that quality with discernment then persistence as a factor for Awakening becomes arousedHe develops it and for him

of an enraptured monk grow calm then serenity as a factor for Awakening becomes arousedHe develops it and for him it goes to the culmination of its developmentFor one who is at ease  his body calmed  the mind becomes concentratedWhen the mind of one who is at ease  his body calmed  becomes concentrated then concentration as a factor for Awakening becomes arousedHe develops it and for him it goes to the culmination of its developmentHe oversees the mind thus concentrated with equanimityWhen he oversees the mind thus concentrated with equanimity equanimity as a factor for Awakening becomes arousedHe develops it and for him it goes to the culmination of its developmentThis is how the four frames of reference are developed and pursued so as to bring the seven factors for Awakening to their culminationAnd how are the seven factors for Awakening developed and pursued so as to bring clear knowing and release to their culminationThere is the case where a monk develops mindfulness as a factor for Awakening dependent on seclusion dispassion cessation resulting in relinquishmentHe develops analysis of qualities as a factor for Awakeningpersistence as a factor for Awakeningrapture as a factor for Awakeningserenity as a factor for Awakening concentration as a factor for Awakening equanimity as a factor for Awakening dependent on seclusion dispassion cessation resulting in relinquishmentThis is how the seven factors for Awakening are developed and pursued so as to bring clear knowing and release to their culminationthere remains only equanimity pure and bright pliant malleable and luminousJust as if a skilled goldsmith or goldsmiths apprentice were to prepare a furnace heat up a crucible and taking gold with a pair of tongs place it in the crucibleHe would blow on it periodically sprinkle water on it periodically examine it periodically so that the gold would become refined wellrefined thoroughly refined flawless free from dross pliant malleable and luminousThen whatever sort of ornament he had in mind  whether a belt an earring a necklace or a gold chain  it would serve his purposeIn the same way there remains only equanimity pure and bright pliant malleable and luminousHe discerns that If I were to direct equanimity as pure and bright as this toward the dimension of the infinitude of space I would develop the mind along those lines and thus this equanimity of mine  thus supported thus sustained  would last for a long timeHe discerns that If I were to direct equanimity as pure and bright as this toward the dimension of the infinitude of space and to develop the mind along those lines that would be fabricated He neither fabricates nor wills for the sake of becoming or unbecomingThis being the case he is not sustained by anything in the worldUnsustained he is not agitatedUnagitated he is totally unbound right withinHe discerns that Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task doneThere is nothing further for this worldThere is that dimension where there is neither earth nor water nor fire nor wind neither dimension of the infinitude of space nor dimension of the infinitude of consciousness nor dimension of nothingness nor dimension of neither perception nor nonperception neither this world nor the next world nor sun nor moonAnd there I say there is neither coming nor going nor stasis neither passing away nor arising without stance without foundation without supportThis just this is the end of stressAggivessana Vacchagotta But Venerable Gotama the monk whose mind is thus released Where does he reappearBuddha

the case where a Tathagata appears in the world worthy and rightly selfawakenedHe teaches the Dhamma admirable in its beginning admirable in its middle admirable in its endHe proclaims the holy life

confining a dusty pathThe life gone forth is like the open airIt is not easy living at home to practice the holy life totally perfect totally pure like a polished shellSuppose I were to go forthSo after some time he abandons his mass of wealth large or small leaves his circle of relatives large or small shaves off his hair and beard puts on the saffron robes and goes forth from the household life into homelessnessWhen he has thus gone forth he lives restrained by the rules of the monastic code seeing danger in the slightest faultsConsummate in his virtue he guards the doors of his senses is possessed of mindfulness and presence of mind and is contentNow how does a monk guard the doors of his sensesOn seeing a form with the eye he does not grasp at any theme or variations by which  if he were to dwell without restraint over the faculty of the eye  evil unskillful qualities such as greed or distress might assail himAnd how is a monk possessed of mindfulness and alertnessWhen going forward and returning he acts with alertnessWhen looking toward and looking away when bending and extending his limbs when carrying his outer cloak his upper robe and his bowl when eating drinking chewing and tasting when urinating and defecating when walking standing sitting falling asleep waking up talking and remaining silent he acts with alertnessAnd how is a monk contentJust as a bird wherever it goes flies with its wings as its only burden so too is he content with a set of robes to provide for his body and alms food to provide for his hungerWherever he goes he takes only his barest necessities alongHe seeks out a secluded dwelling a forest the shade of a tree a mountain a glen a hillside cave a charnel ground a jungle grove the open air a heap of strawAfter his meal returning from his alms round he sits down crosses his legs holds his body erect and brings mindfulness to the foreHe purifies his mind from greed ill will sloth and torpor restlessness and anxiety and uncertaintyAs long as these five hindrances are not abandoned within him he regards it as a debt a sickness a prison slavery a road through desolate countryBut when these five hindrances are abandoned within him he regards it as unindebtedness good health release from prison freedom a place of securitySeeing that they have been abandoned within him he becomes glad enraptured tranquil sensitive to pleasureFeeling pleasure his mind becomes concentratedQuite withdrawn from sensuality withdrawn from unskillful mental qualities he enters and remains in the first jhana rapture and pleasure born from withdrawal accompanied by directed thought and evaluationHe permeates and pervades suffuses and fills this very body with the rapture and pleasure born from withdrawalJust as if a skilled bathman or bathmans apprentice would pour bath powder into a brass basin and knead it together sprinkling it again and again with water so that his ball of bath powder  saturated moistureladen permeated within and without  would nevertheless not drip even so the monk permeates this very body with the rapture and pleasure born of withdrawalThere is nothing of his entire body unpervaded by rapture and pleasure born from withdrawalThis is a reward of the contemplative life visible here and now more excellent than the previous ones and more sublimeFurthermore with the stilling of directed thoughts  evaluations he enters and remains in the second jhana rapture and pleasure born of composure unification of awareness free from directed thought and evaluation  internal assuranceHe permeates and pervades suffuses and fills this very body with the rapture and pleasure born of composureJust like a lake with springwater welling up from within having no inflow from the east west north or south and with the skies supplying abundant showers time and again so that the cool fount of water welling up from within the lake would permeate and pervade suffuse and fill it with cool waters there being no part of the lake unpervaded by the cool waters even so the monk permeates this very body with the rapture and pleasure born of composureThere is nothing of his entire body unpervaded by rapture and pleasure born of composureThis too is a reward of the contemplative life visible here and now more excellent than the previous ones and more sublimeAnd furthermore with the fading of rapture he remains equanimous mindful  alert and senses pleasure with the bodyHe enters  remains in the third jhana of which the Noble Ones declare Equanimous  mindful he has a pleasant abiding He permeates and pervades suffuses and fills this very body with the pleasure divested of raptureJust as in a lotus pond some of the lotuses born and growing in the water stay immersed in the water and flourish without standing up out of the water so that they are permeated and pervaded suffused and filled with cool water from their roots to their tips and nothing of those lotuses would be unpervaded with cool water even so the monk permeates this very body with the pleasure divested of raptureThere is nothing of his entire body unpervaded with pleasure divested of raptureThis too is a reward of the contemplative life visible here and now more excellent than the previous ones and more sublimeAnd furthermore with the abandoning of pleasure and stress  as with the earlier disappearance of elation and distress  he enters and remains in the fourth jhana purity of equanimity and mindfulness neitherpleasure nor stressHe sits permeating the body with a pure bright awarenessJust as if a man were sitting covered from head to foot with a white cloth so that there would be no part of his body to which the white cloth did not extend even so the monk sits permeating the body with a pure bright awarenessThere is nothing of his entire body unpervaded by pure bright awarenessThis too is a reward of the contemplative life visible here and now more excellent than the previous ones and more sublimeWith his mind thus concentrated purified and bright he directs it to the knowledge of the ending of the mental fermentationsJust as if there were a pool of water in a mountain glen  clear limpid and unsullied  where a man with good eyesight standing on the bank could see shells gravel and pebbles and also shoals of fish swimming about and resting and it would occur to him This pool of water is clear limpid and unsulliedHere are these shells gravel and pebbles and also these shoals of fish swimming about and resting In the same way the monk discerns as it has come to be that This is stress This is the origination of stress This is the cessation of stress This is the way leading to the cessation of stress These are mental fermentations This is the origination of fermentations This is the cessation of fermentations This is the way leading to the cessation of fermentations His heart thus knowing thus seeing is released from the fermentations of sensuality becoming and ignoranceWith release there is the knowledge Released He discerns that Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task doneThere is nothing further for this world This too is a reward of the contemplative life visible here and now more excellent than the previous ones and more sublimeAnd as for another visible fruit of the contemplative life higher and more sublime than this there is noneThen VenAssaji arising early in the morning taking his robe and bowl entered Rajagaha for alms gracious in the way he approached and departed looked forward and behind drew in and stretched out his arm his eyes downcast his every movement consummateSariputta the wanderer saw VenAssaji going for alms in Rajagaha gracious his eyes downcast his every movement consummateOn seeing him the thought occurred to him Surely of those in this world who are arahants or have entered the path to arahantship this is oneWhat if I were to approach him and question him On whose account have you gone forthWho is your teacherOf whose Dhamma do you approve But then the thought occurred to Sariputta the wanderer This is the wrong time to question himHe is going for alms in the townWhat if I were to follow behind this monk who has found the path for those who seek itThen VenAssaji having gone for alms in Rajagaha left taking the alms he had receivedSariputta the wanderer approached him and on arrival having exchanged friendly greetings and courtesies stood to one sideAs he stood there he said Your faculties are bright my friend your complexion pure and clearOn whose account have you gone forthWho is your teacherOf whose Dhamma do you approveThere is my friend the Great Contemplative a son of the Sakyans gone forth from a Sakyan familyI have gone forth on account of that Blessed OneThat Blessed One is my teacherIt is of that Blessed Ones Dhamma that I approveBut what is your teachers teachingWhat does he proclaimI am new my friend not long gone forth only recently come to this doctrine and disciplineI cannot explain the doctrine in detail but I can give you the gist in briefThen Sariputta the wanderer spoke thus to the VenAssajiThen VenAssaji gave this Dhamma exposition to Sariputta the WandererThen to Sariputta the Wanderer as he heard this Dhamma exposition there arose the dustless stainless Dhamma eye Whatever is subject to origination is all subject to cessationThen Mahapajapati Gotami approached the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down stood to one sideAs she was standing there she said It would be good if the Blessed One would teach me the Dhamma in brief so that I having heard the Dhamma might dwell alone secluded heedful ardent and resoluteGotami the qualities of which you may know These qualities lead to dispassion not to passion to being unfettered and not to being fettered to selfeffacement and not to selfaggrandizement to modesty and not to ambition to contentment and not to discontent to seclusion and not to entanglement to the arousing of persistence and not to laziness to being unburdensome and not to being burdensome You may definitely hold This is the Dhamma this is the Vinaya this is the Teachers instructionPunna Lord I am going to live in the Sunaparanta countryThe Buddha Punna the Sunaparanta people are fierceThey are roughIf they insult and ridicule you what will you thinkI will think These Sunaparanta people are civilized very civilized in that they dont hit me with their hands That is what I will think But if they hit you with their handsI will think These Sunaparanta people are civilized very civilized in that they dont hit me with a clod But if they hit you with a clodI will think These Sunaparanta people are civilized very civilized in that they dont hit me with a stick But if they hit you with a stickI will think These Sunaparanta people are civilized very civilized in that they dont hit me with a knife But if they hit you with a knifeI will think These Sunaparanta people are civilized very civilized in that they dont take my life with a sharp knife But if they take your life with a sharp knifeI will think There are disciples of the Blessed One who  horrified humiliated and disgusted by the body and by life  have sought for an assassin but here I have met my assassin without searching for him That is what I will think Good Punna very goodPossessing such calm and selfcontrol you are fit to dwell among the SunaparantansNow it is time to do as you see fitThen VenPunna delighting and rejoicing in the Blessed Ones words rising from his seat bowed down to the Blessed One and left keeping him on his right sideSetting his dwelling in order and taking his robe and bowl he set out for the Sunaparanta country and after wandering stage by stage he arrived thereThere he livedDuring that Rains retreat he established male and female lay followers in the practice while he realized the three knowledgesEventually he attained total UnbindingThe two crucial aspects of the Buddhas Awakening are the what and the how what he awakened to and how he did itHis Awakening is special in that the two aspects come togetherHe awakened to the fact that there is an undying happiness and that it can be attained through human effortThe human effort involved in this process ultimately focuses on the question of understanding the nature of human effort itself  in terms of skillful kamma and dependent coarising  what its powers and limitations are and what kind of right effort can take one beyond its limitations and bring one to the threshold of the DeathlessAs the Buddha described the Awakening experience in one of his discourses first there is the knowledge of the regularity of the Dhamma  which in this context means dependent coarising  then there is the knowledge of nibbanaIn other passages he describes the three stages that led to insight into dependent coarising knowledge of his own previous lifetimes knowledge of the passing away and rebirth of all living beings and finally insight into the four Noble TruthsThe first two forms of knowledge were not new with the BuddhaThey have been reported by other seers throughout history although the Buddhas insight into the second knowledge had a special twist He saw that beings are reborn according to the ethical quality of their thoughts words and deeds and that this quality is essentially a factor of the mindThe quality of ones views and intentions determines the experienced result of ones actionsThis insight had a double impact on his mindOn the one hand it made him realize the futility of the round of rebirth  that even the best efforts aimed at winning pleasure and fulfillment within the round could have only temporary effectsOn the other hand his realization of the importance of the mind in determining the round is what led him to focus directly on his own mind in the present to see how the processes in the mind that kept the round going could be disbandedThis was how he gained insight into the four noble truths and dependent coarising  seeing how the aggregates that made up his person were also the impelling factors in the experience of the world at large and how the whole show could be brought to cessationWith its cessation there remained the experience of the unconditioned which he also termed nibbana consciousness without surface or feature the DeathlessWhen we address the question of how other enlightenment experiences recorded in world history relate to the Buddhas we have to keep in mind the Buddhas own dictum First there is the knowledge of dependent coarising then there is the knowledge of nibbanaWithout the first  which includes not only an understanding of kamma but also of how kamma leads to the understanding itself  no realization no matter how calm or boundless that doesnt result from these sorts of understanding can count as an Awakening in the Buddhist senseTrue Awakening necessarily involves both ethics and insight into causalityAs for what the Buddhas Awakening means for us now four points stand out The role that kamma plays in the Awakening is empoweringIt means that what each of us does says and thinks does matter  this in opposition to the sense of futility that can come from reading say world history geology or astronomy and realizing the fleeting nature of the entire human enterpriseThe Awakening lets us see that the choices we make in each moment of our lives have consequencesThe fact that we are empowered also means that we are responsible for our experiencesWe are not strangers in a strange landWe have formed and are continuing to form the world we experienceThis helps us to face the events we encounter in life with greater equanimity for we know that we had a hand in creating them and yet at the same time we can avoid any debilitating sense of guilt because with each new choice we can always make a fresh start The Awakening also tells us that good and bad are not mere social conventions but are built into the mechanics of how the world is constructedWe may be free to design our lives but we are not free to change the underlying rules that determine what good and bad actions are and how the process of kamma works itself outThus cultural relativism  even though it may have paved the way for many of us to leave our earlier religious orientations and enter the Buddhist fold  has no place once we are within that foldThere are certain ways of acting that are inherently unskillful and we are fools if we insist on our right to behave in those ways As the Buddha says at one point in describing his Awakening Ignorance was destroyed knowledge arose darkness was destroyed light arose  as happens in one who is heedful ardent and resolute In other words he gained liberating knowledge through qualities that we can all develop heedfulness ardency resolutionIf we are willing to face the implications of this fact we realize that the Buddhas Awakening is a challenge to our entire set of valuesThe fact that the Unconditioned can be attained forces us to reevaluate any other goals we may set for ourselves any worlds we may want to create in our livesOn an obvious level it points out the spiritual poverty of a life devoted to wealth status or sensual pursuits but it also forces us to take a hard look at other more worthwhile goals that our culture and its subcultures tend to exalt such as social acceptance meaningful relationships stewardship of the planet etcThese too will inevitably lead to sufferingThe interdependence of all things cannot be for any truly sensitive mind a source of security or comfortIf the Unconditioned is available and its the only trustworthy happiness around the most sensible course is to invest our efforts and whatever mental and spiritual resources we have in its direction Even for those who are not ready to make that kind of investment the Awakening assures us that happiness comes from developing qualities within ourselves that we can be proud of such as kindness sensitivity equanimity mindfulness conviction determination and discernmentAgain this is a very different message from the one we pick up from the world telling us that in order to gain happiness we have to develop qualities we cant take any genuine pride in aggressiveness selfaggrandizement dishonesty etcJust this much can give an entirely new orientation to our lives and our ideas of what is worthwhile investment of our time and effortsThe news of the Buddhas Awakening sets the standards for judging the culture we were brought up in and not the other way aroundThis is not a question of choosing Asian culture over AmericanThe Buddhas Awakening challenged many of the presuppositions of Indian culture in his day and even in socalled Buddhist countries the true practice of the Buddhas teachings is always counterculturalIts a question of evaluating our normal concerns  conditioned by time space and the limitations of aging illness and death  against the possibility of a timeless spaceless limitless happinessAll cultures are tied up in the limited conditioned side of things while the Buddhas Awakening points beyond all culturesIt offers the challenge of the Deathless that his contemporaries found liberating and that we if we are willing to accept the challenge may find liberating ourselvesYouve probably heard the rumor that Buddhism is pessimistic that Life is suffering is the Buddhas first noble truthIts a rumor with good credentials spread by wellrespected academics and meditation teachers alike but a rumor nonethelessThe real truth about the noble truths is far more interestingThe Buddha taught four truths  not one  about life There is suffering there is a cause for suffering there is an end of suffering and there is a path of practice that puts an end to sufferingThese truths taken as a whole are far from pessimisticTheyre a practical problemsolving approach  the way a doctor approaches an illness or a mechanic a faulty engineYou identify a problem and look for its causeYou then put an end to the problem by eliminating the causeWhats special about the Buddhas approach is that the problem he attacks is the whole of human suffering and the solution he offers is something human beings can do for themselvesJust as a doctor with a surefire cure for measles isnt afraid of measles the Buddha isnt afraid of any aspect of human sufferingAnd having experienced a happiness thats totally unconditional hes not afraid to point out the suffering and stress inherent in places where most of us would rather not see it  in the conditioned pleasures we cling toHe teaches us not to deny that suffering and stress or to run away from it but to stand still and face up to itTo examine it carefullyThat way  by understanding it  we can ferret out its cause and put an end to itTotallyHow confident can you getA fair number of writers have pointed out the basic confidence inherent in the four noble truths and yet the rumor of Buddhisms pessimism persistsI wonder whyOne possible explanation is that in coming to Buddhism we subconsciously expect it to address issues that have a long history in our own cultureBy starting out with suffering as his first truth the Buddha seems to be offering his position on a question with a long history in the West is the world basically good or badAccording to Genesis this was the first question that occurred to God after he had finished his creation had he done a good jobSo he looked at the world and saw that it was goodEver since then people in the West have sided with or against God on his answer but in doing so they have affirmed that the question was worth asking to begin withWhen Theravada  the only form of Buddhism to take on Christianity when Europe colonized Asia  was looking for ways to head off what it saw as the missionary menace Buddhists who had received their education from the missionaries assumed that the question was valid and pressed the first noble truth into service as a refutation of the Christian God look at how miserable life is they said and its hard to accept Gods verdict on his handiworkThis debating strategy may have scored a few points at the time and its easy to find Buddhist apologists who  still living in the colonial past  keep trying to score the same pointsThe real issue though is whether the Buddha intended for his first noble truth to be an answer to Gods question in the first place and  more importantly  whether were getting the most out of the first noble truth if we see it in that lightIts hard to imagine what you could accomplish by saying that life is sufferingYoud have to spend your time arguing with people who see more than just suffering in lifeThe Buddha himself says as much in one of his discoursesA brahman named Longnails comes to him and announces that he doesnt approve of anythingThis would have been a perfect time for the Buddha if he had wanted to chime in with the truth that life is sufferingInstead he attacks the whole notion of taking a stand on whether life is worthy of approvalThere are three possible answers to this question nothing is worthy of approval everything is and some things are and some things arentIf you take any of these three positions you end up arguing with the people who take either of the other two positionsAnd where does that get youThe Buddha then teaches Longnails to look at his body and feelings as instances of the first noble truth theyre stressful inconstant and dont deserve to be clung to as selfLongnails follows the Buddhas instructions and in letting go of his attachment to body and feelings gains his first glimpse of the Deathless of what its like to be totally free from sufferingThe point of this story is that trying to answer Gods question passing judgment on the world is a waste of timeAnd it offers a better use for the first noble truth looking at things not in terms of world or life but simply identifying suffering so that you can comprehend it let it go and attain releaseRather than asking us to make a blanket judgment  which in effect would be asking us to be blind partisans  the first noble truth asks us to look and see precisely where the problem of suffering liesOther discourses make the point that the problem isnt with body and feelings in and of themselvesThey themselves arent sufferingThe suffering lies in clinging to themIn his definition of the first noble truth the Buddha summarizes all types of suffering under the phrase the five aggregates of clinging clinging to physical form feelings perceptions thought constructs and consciousnessHowever when the five aggregates are free from clinging he tells us they lead to longterm benefit and happinessOf course by happiness he isnt here referring to the arts food travel sports family life or any of the other sections of the Sunday newspaperHes talking about the solid wellbeing that comes when we treat the aggregates as factors in the path to the DeathlessThe aggregates in themselves are neutralThe role they play in leading to true happiness or suffering lies in whether or not we clingSo the first noble truth simply put is that clinging is sufferingIts because of clinging that physical pain becomes mental painIts because of clinging that aging illness and death cause mental distressHow do we clingThe texts list four ways the clinging of sensual passion the clinging of views the clinging of precepts and practices and the clinging of doctrines of the selfIts rare that a moment passes in the ordinary mind without some form of clingingEven when we abandon a particular form of clinging its usually because it gets in the way of another formWe may abandon a puritanical view because it interferes with sensual pleasure or a sensual pleasure because it conflicts with a view about what we should do to stay healthyOur views of who we are may expand and contract depending on which of our many senses of I is feeling the most pain expanding into a sense of cosmic oneness when we feel confined by the limitations of our small mindbody complex shrinking into a small shell when we feel wounded from identifying with a cosmos so filled with cruelty thoughtlessness and wasteWhen the insignificance of our finite self becomes oppressive again we may jump at the idea that we have no self but then that becomes oppressiveSo our minds jump from clinging to clinging like a bird trapped in a cageAnd when we realize were captive we naturally search for a way outThis is where its so important that the first noble truth not say that Life is suffering for if life were suffering where would we look for an end to sufferingWed be left with nothing but death and annihilationBut when the actual truth is that clinging is suffering we simply have to look to see precisely where clinging is and learn not to clingThis is where we encounter the Buddhas great skill as a strategist He tells us to take the clingings well have to abandon and transform them into the path to their abandoningWell need a certain amount of sensory pleasure  in terms of adequate food clothing and shelter  to find the strength to go beyond sensual passionWell need right view  seeing all things including views in terms of the four noble truths  to undermine our clinging to viewsAnd well need a regimen of the five ethical precepts and the practice of meditation to put the mind in a solid position where it can drop its clinging to precepts and practicesUnderlying all this well need a strong sense of selfresponsibility and selfdiscipline to master the practices leading to the insight that cuts through our clinging to doctrines of the selfSo we start the path to the end of suffering not by trying to drop our clingings immediately but by learning to cling more strategicallyIn other words we start where we are and make the best use of the habits weve already gotWe progress along the path by finding better and better things to cling to and more skillful ways to cling in the same way you climb a ladder to the top of a roof grab hold of a higher rung so that you can let go of a lower rung and then grab onto a rung still higherAs the rungs get further off the ground you find that the mind grows clearer and can see precisely where its clingings areIt gets a sharper sense of which parts of experience belong to which noble truth and what should be done with them the parts that are suffering should be comprehended the parts that cause of suffering  craving and ignorance  should be abandoned the parts that form the path to the end of suffering should be developed and the parts that belong to the end of suffering should be verifiedThis helps you get higher and higher on the ladder until you find yourself securely on the roofThats when you can finally let go of the ladder and be totally freeSo the real question we face isnt Gods question passing judgment on how skillfully he created life or the worldIts our question how skillfully are we handling the raw stuff of lifeAre we clinging in ways that serve only to continue the round of suffering or are we learning to cling in ways that will reduce suffering so that ultimately we can grow up and wont have to clingIf we negotiate life armed with all four noble truths realizing that life contains both suffering and an end to suffering theres hope hope that well be able to sort out which parts of life belong to which truth hope that someday in this life well come to the point where we agree with the Buddha OhYesThis is the end of suffering and stressOne of the first stumbling blocks that Westerners often encounter when they learn about Buddhism is the teaching on anatta often translated as noselfThis teaching is a stumbling block for two reasonsFirst the idea of there being no self doesnt fit well with other Buddhist teachings such as the doctrine of kamma and rebirth If theres no self what experiences the results of kamma and takes rebirthSecond it doesnt fit well with our own JudeoChristian background which assumes the existence of an eternal soul or self as a basic presupposition If theres no self whats the purpose of a spiritual lifeMany books try to answer these questions but if you look at the Pali canon  the earliest extant record of the Buddhas teachings  you wont find them addressed at allIn fact the one place where the Buddha was asked pointblank whether or not there was a self he refused to answerWhen later asked why he said that to hold either that there is a self or that there is no self is to fall into extreme forms of wrong view that make the path of Buddhist practice impossibleThus the question should be put asideTo understand what his silence on this question says about the meaning of anatta we first have to look at his teachings on how questions should be asked and answered and how to interpret his answersThe Buddha divided all questions into four classes those that deserve a categorical answer those that deserve an analytical answer defining and qualifying the terms of the question those that deserve a counterquestion putting the ball back in the questioners court and those that deserve to be put asideThe last class of question consists of those that dont lead to the end of suffering and stressThe first duty of a teacher when asked a question is to figure out which class the question belongs to and then to respond in the appropriate wayYou dont for example say yes or no to a question that should be put asideIf you are the person asking the question and you get an answer you should then determine how far the answer should be interpretedThe Buddha said that there are two types of people who misrepresent him those who draw inferences from statements that shouldnt have inferences drawn from them and those who dont draw inferences from those that shouldThese are the basic ground rules for interpreting the Buddhas teachings but if we look at the way most writers treat the anatta doctrine we find these ground rules ignoredSome writers try to qualify the noself interpretation by saying that the Buddha denied the existence of an eternal self or a separate self but this is to give an analytical answer to a question that the Buddha showed should be put asideOthers try to draw inferences from the few statements in the discourse that seem to imply that there is no self but it seems safe to assume that if one forces those statements to give an answer to a question that should be put aside one is drawing inferences where they shouldnt be drawnSo instead of answering no to the question of whether or not there is a self  interconnected or separate eternal or not  the Buddha felt that the question was misguided to begin withWhyNo matter how you define the line between self and other the notion of self involves an element of selfidentification and clinging and thus suffering and stressThis holds as much for an interconnected self which recognizes no other as it does for a separate selfIf one identifies with all of nature one is pained by every felled treeIt also holds for an entirely other universe in which the sense of alienation and futility would become so debilitating as to make the quest for happiness  ones own or that of others  impossibleFor these reasons the Buddha advised paying no attention to such questions as Do I exist or Dont I exist for however you answer them they lead to suffering and stressTo avoid the suffering implicit in questions of self and other he offered an alternative way of dividing up experience the four Noble Truths of stress its cause its cessation and the path to its cessationRather than viewing these truths as pertaining to self or other he said one should recognize them simply for what they are in and of themselves as they are directly experienced and then perform the duty appropriate to eachStress should be comprehended its cause abandoned its cessation realized and the path to its cessation developedThese duties form the context in which the anatta doctrine is best understoodIf you develop the path of virtue concentration and discernment to a state of calm wellbeing and use that calm state to look at experience in terms of the Noble Truths the questions that occur to the mind are not Is there a selfWhat is my self but rather Am I suffering stress because Im holding onto this particular phenomenonIs it really me myself or mineIf its stressful but not really me or mine why hold on These last questions merit straightforward answers as they then help you to comprehend stress and to chip away at the attachment and clinging  the residual sense of selfidentification  that cause it until ultimately all traces of selfidentification are gone and all thats left is limitless freedomIn this sense the anatta teaching is not a doctrine of noself but a notself strategy for shedding suffering by letting go of its cause leading to the highest undying happinessAt that point questions of self noself and notself fall asideOnce theres the experience of such total freedom where would there be any concern about whats experiencing it or whether or not its a selfWe all know what happens when a fire goes outThe flames die down and the fire is gone for goodSo when we first learn that the name for the goal of Buddhist practice nibbana literally means the extinguishing of a fire its hard to imagine a deadlier image for a spiritual goal utter annihilationIt turns out though that this reading of the concept is a mistake in translation not so much of a word as of an imageWhat did an extinguished fire represent to the Indians of the Buddhas dayAnything but annihilationAccording to the ancient Brahmins when a fire was extinguished it went into a state of latencyRather than ceasing to exist it became dormant and in that state  unbound from any particular fuel  it became diffused throughout the cosmosWhen the Buddha used the image to explain nibbana to the Indian Brahmins of his day he bypassed the question of whether an extinguished fire continues to exist or not and focused instead on the impossibility of defining a fire that doesnt burn thus his statement that the person who has gone totally out cant be describedHowever when teaching his own disciples the Buddha used nibbana more as an image of freedomApparently all Indians at the time saw burning fire as agitated dependent and trapped both clinging and being stuck to its fuel as it burnedTo ignite a fire one had to seize itWhen fire let go of its fuel it was freed released from its agitation dependence and entrapment  calm and unconfinedThis is why Pali poetry repeatedly uses the image of extinguished fire as a metaphor for freedomIn fact this metaphor is part of a pattern of fire imagery that involves two other related terms as wellUpadana or clinging also refers to the sustenance a fire takes from its fuelKhandha means not only one of the five heaps that define all conditioned experience but also the trunk of a treeJust as fire goes out when it stops clinging and taking sustenance from wood so the mind is freed when it stops clinging to the khandhasThus the image underlying nibbana is one of freedomThe Pali commentaries support this point by tracing the word nibbana to its verbal root which means unbinding What kind of unbindingThe texts describe two levelsOne is the unbinding in this lifetime symbolized by a fire that has gone out but whose embers are still warmThis stands for the enlightened arahant who is conscious of sights and sounds sensitive to pleasure and pain but freed from passion aversion and delusionThe second level of unbinding symbolized by a fire so totally out that its embers have grown cold is what the arahant experiences after this lifeAll input from the senses cools away and heshe is totally freed from even the subtlest stresses and limitations of existence in space and timeThe Buddha insists that this level is indescribable even in terms of existence or nonexistence because words work only for things that have limitsAll he really says about it  apart from images and metaphors  is that one can have foretastes of the experience in this lifetime and that its the ultimate happiness something truly worth knowingSo the next time you watch a fire going out see it not as a case of annihilation but as a lesson in how freedom is to be found in letting goAccording to the Buddhist monastic code monks and nuns are not allowed to accept money or even to engage in barter or trade with lay peopleThey live entirely in an economy of giftsLay supporters provide gifts of material requisites for the monastics while the monastics provide their supporters with the gift of the teachingIdeally  and to a great extent in actual practice  this is an exchange that comes from the heart something totally voluntaryThere are many stories in the texts that emphasize the point that returns in this economy  it might also be called an economy of merit  depend not on the material value of the object given but on the purity of heart of the donor and recipientYou give what is appropriate to the occasion and to your means when and wherever your heart feels inspiredFor the monastics this means that you teach out of compassion what should be taught regardless of whether it will sellFor the laity this means that you give what you have to spare and feel inclined to shareThere is no price for the teachings nor even a suggested donation Anyone who regards the act of teaching or the act of giving requisites as a repayment for a particular favor is ridiculed as mercenaryInstead you give because giving is good for the heart and because the survival of the Dhamma as a living principle depends on daily acts of generosityThe primary symbol of this economy is the alms bowlIf you are a monastic it represents your dependence on others your need to accept generosity no matter what form it takesYou may not get what you want in the bowl but you realize that you always get what you need even if its a hardearned lesson in doing withoutOne of my students in Thailand once went to the mountains in the northern part of the country to practice in solitudeHis hillside shack was an ideal place to meditate but he had to depend on a nearby hilltribe village for alms and the diet was mostly plain rice with some occasional boiled vegetablesAfter two months on this diet his meditation theme became the conflict in his mind over whether he should go or stayOne rainy morning as he was on his alms round he came to a shack just as the morning rice was readyThe wife of the house called out asking him to wait while she got some rice from the potAs he was waiting there in the pouring rain he couldnt help grumbling inwardly about the fact that there would be nothing to go with the riceIt so happened that the woman had an infant son who was sitting near the kitchen fire crying from hungerSo as she scooped some rice out of the pot she stuck a small lump of rice in his mouthImmediately the boy stopped crying and began to grinMy student saw this and it was like a light bulb turning on in his headHere you are complaining about what people are giving you for free he told himselfYoure no match for a little kidIf he can be happy with just a lump of rice why cant you As a result the lesson that came with his scoop of rice that day gave my student the strength he needed to stay on in the mountains for another three yearsFor a monastic the bowl also represents the opportunity you give others to practice the Dhamma in accordance with their meansIn Thailand this is reflected in one of the idioms used to describe going for alms proad sat doing a favor for living beingsThere were times on my alms round in rural Thailand when as I walked past a tiny grass shack someone would come running out to put rice in my bowlYears earlier as lay person my reaction on seeing such a bare tiny shack would have been to want to give monetary help to themBut now I was on the receiving end of their generosityIn my new position I may have been doing less for them in material terms than I could have done as a lay person but at least I was giving them the opportunity to have the dignity that comes with being a donorFor the donors the monks alms bowl becomes a symbol of the good they have doneOn several occasions in Thailand people would tell me that they had dreamed of a monk standing before them opening the lid to his bowlThe details would differ as to what the dreamer saw in the bowl but in each case the interpretation of the dream was the same the dreamers merit was about to bear fruit in an especially positive wayThe alms round itself is also a gift that goes both waysOn the one hand daily contact with lay donors reminds the monastics that their practice is not just an individual matter but a concern of the entire communityThey are indebted to others for the right and opportunity to practice and should do their best to practice diligently as a way of repaying that debtAt the same time the opportunity to walk through a village early in the morning passing by the houses of the rich and poor the happy and unhappy gives plenty of opportunities to reflect on the human condition and the need to find a way out of the grinding cycle of death and rebirthFor the donors the alms round is a reminder that the monetary economy is not the only way to happinessIt helps to keep a society sane when there are monastics infiltrating the towns every morning embodying an ethos very different from the dominant monetary economyThe gently subversive quality of this custom helps people to keep their values straightAbove all the economy of gifts symbolized by the alms bowl and the alms round allows for specialization a division of labor from which both sides benefitThose who are willing can give up many of the privileges of home life and in return receive the free time the basic support and the communal training needed to devote themselves fully to Dhamma practiceThose who stay at home can benefit from having fulltime Dhamma practitioners around on a daily basisI have always found it ironic that the modern world honors specialization in almost every area  even in things like running jumping and throwing a ball  but not in the Dhamma where it is denounced as dualism elitism or worseThe Buddha began the monastic order on the first day of his teaching career because he saw the benefits that come with specializationWithout it the practice tends to become limited and diluted negotiated into the demands of the monetary economyThe Dhamma becomes limited to what will sell and what will fit into a schedule dictated by the demands of family and jobIn this sort of situation everyone ends up poorer in things of the heartThe fact that tangible goods run only one way in the economy of gifts means that the exchange is open to all sorts of abusesThis is why there are so many rules in the monastic code to keep the monastics from taking unfair advantage of the generosity of lay donorsThere are rules against asking for donations in inappropriate circumstances from making claims as to ones spiritual attainments and even from covering up the good foods in ones bowl with rice in hopes that donors will then feel inclined to provide something more substantialMost of the rules in fact were instituted at the request of lay supporters or in response to their complaintsThey had made their investment in the merit economy and were interested in protecting their investmentThis observation applies not only to ancient India but also to the modernday WestOn their first contact with the Sangha most people tend to see little reason for the disciplinary rules and regard them as quaint holdovers from ancient Indian prejudicesWhen however they come to see the rules in the context of the economy of gifts and begin to participate in that economy themselves they also tend to become avid advocates of the rules and active protectors of their monasticsThe arrangement may limit the freedom of the monastics in certain ways but it means that the lay supporters take an active interest not only in what the monastic teaches but also in how the monastic lives  a useful safeguard to make sure that teachers walk their talkThis again insures that the practice remains a communal concernAs the Buddha saidMonks householders are very helpful to you as they provide you with the requisites of robes alms food lodgings and medicineAnd you monks are very helpful to householders as you teach them the Dhamma admirable in the beginning admirable in the middle and admirable in the end as you expound the holy life both in its particulars and in its essence entirely complete surpassingly pureIn this way the holy life is lived in mutual dependence for the purpose of crossing over the flood for making a right end to suffering and stressPeriodically throughout the history of Buddhism the economy of gifts has broken down usually when one side or the other gets fixated on the tangible side of the exchange and forgets the qualities of the heart that are its reason for beingAnd periodically it has been revived when people are sensitive to its rewards in terms of the living DhammaBy its very nature the economy of gifts is something of a hothouse creation that requires careful nurture and a sensitive discernment of its benefitsI find it amazing that such an economy has lasted for more than yearsIt will never be more than an alternative to the dominant monetary economy largely because its rewards are so intangible and require so much patience trust and discipline in order to be appreciatedThose who demand immediate return for specific services and goods will always require a monetary systemSincere Buddhist lay people however have the chance to play an amphibious role engaging in the monetary economy in order to maintain their livelihood and contributing to the economy of gifts whenever they feel so inclinedIn this way they can maintain direct contact with teachers insuring the best possible instruction for their own practice in an atmosphere where mutual compassion and concern are the medium of exchange and purity of heart the bottom lineIs human action real or illusoryIf real is it effectiveIf it is effective does one have a choice in what one doesIf one has a choice can one choose to act in a way that will lead to genuine happinessIf so what is that wayThese are questions that lie at the heart of the way we conduct our livesThe way we answer them will determine whether we look for happiness through our own abilities seek happiness through outside help or abandon the quest for a higherthanordinary happiness altogetherThese questions were precisely the ones that led Siddhattha Gotama  the Bodhisatta or Buddhatobe  to undertake his quest for AwakeningHe felt that there was no honor no value in life if true happiness could not be found through ones own effortsThus he put his life on the line to see how far human effort could goEventually he found that effort skillfully applied could lead to an Awakening to the DeathlessThe lessons he learned about action and effort in the course of developing that skill and which were confirmed by the experience of his Awakening formed the basis of his doctrine of kammaThis doctrine lies at the heart of his teaching and forms the essence of the Triple RefugePut briefly it states that action is real effective and the result of ones own choiceIf one chooses to act skillfully and works to develop that skill ones actions can lead to happiness not only on the ordinary sensory level but also on a level that transcends all the dimensions of time and the presentTo understand this doctrine and get a sense of its full implications we must first have some background on how the Buddha arrived at itThis will help us to see how kamma can act as a refuge and what kind of refuge it providesPeople often believe that the Buddha simply picked up the doctrine of kamma from his environment but nothing could be further from the truthNorthern India at his time was a place of great intellectual activity and  as science made new advances and called many of the old established beliefs into question  all of the great philosophical and religious issues of human life were up for grabsThe foremost science at that time was astronomyNew precise observations of planetary movements combined with new advances in mathematics had led astronomers to conclude that time was measured in eons incomprehensibly long cycles that repeat themselves endlesslyPhilosophers of the time tried to work out the implications of this vast temporal frame for the drama of human life and the quest for ultimate happinessThese philosophers fell into two broad camps those who conducted their speculations within the traditions of the Vedas orthodox religious and ritual texts and other unorthodox groups called the Samanas who questioned the authority of the VedasBy the time of Siddhattha Gotama philosophers of the Vedic and Samana schools had developed widely differing views of the laws of nature and how they affected the pursuit of true happinessTheir main points of disagreement were two Personal identityMost Vedic and Samana philosophers assumed that a persons identity extended beyond this lifetime eons before birth back into the past and after death on into the futureThere was some disagreement however as to whether ones identity from life to life would change or remain the sameThe Vedas had viewed rebirth in a positive light but by the time of Prince Siddhattha the influence of the newly discovered astronomical cycles had led those who believed in rebirth to regard the cycles as pointless and confining and release as the only possibility for true happinessThere was however a Samana school of hedonist materialists called Lokayatans who denied the existence of any identity beyond death and insisted that happiness could be found only by indulging in sensual pleasures here and now Action and causalityThe ancient Vedas had formulated a doctrine of kamma or action which stated that correctly performed actions played a causal role in providing for ones happiness in the life after deathThe primary actions recognized by these texts though were ritualistic ritually performed sacrifices often involving the slaughter of animals and gifts to brahmansTo be effective the ritual actions had to be correctly performedThis concern for correct performance led the Vedists to compose ritual manuals prescribing in minute detail the proper things to do and say in the course of their ritualsThey even included special chants and spells to compensate for any inadvertent mistakes in the course of a particular ritual so great was their conviction that the quality of an act depends on its physical expressionThe Samana schools rejected the Vedic teachings on kamma but for a variety of different reasonsOne set of Samana schools called the Ajivakas asserted that an individuals actions were not in the least bit responsible for the course of hisher lifeOne branch of the Ajivakas taught that all action in the cosmos is illusory as the only truly existing things are the unchanging substances of which the cosmos is madeThus there is no such thing as right or wrong good or evil for in the ultimate sense there is no such thing as actionAnother branch of the Ajivakas taught that action was real but totally subject to fate deterministic causal laws that left no room for free willThus they insisted that release from the round of rebirth came only when the round worked itself outPeace of mind could be found by accepting ones fate and patiently waiting for the cycle like a ball of string unwinding to come to its endAlthough these two positions derived from two very different pictures of the cosmos they both led to the same conclusion good and evil were illusory social conventions human beings were not responsible for their acts and human action had no role in shaping ones experience of the cosmosThe Lokayatans came to a similar conclusion but for different reasonsThey agreed with the Vedists that physical action was real but they maintained that it bore no resultsThere was no way to observe any invariable causeeffect relationship between events they said as a result all events were spontaneous and selfcausedThis meant that human actions had no consequences and thus there were no such things as good and evil because no action could have a good or evil effect on anything elseThey concluded that one could safely ignore moral rules in ones pursuit of sensual pleasure and would be a fool to deny oneself immediate gratification of ones desires whenever the opportunity appearedAnother school the Jains accepted the Vedic premise that ones actions shaped ones experience of the cosmos but they differed from the Vedas in the way they conceived of actionAll action according to them was a form of violenceThe more violent the act the more it produced effluents conceived as sticky substances that bound the soul to the round of rebirthThus they rejected the Vedic assertion that ritual sacrifice produced good kamma for the violence involved in killing the sacrificial animals was actually a form of very sticky bad kammaIn their eyes the only way to true happiness was to try to escape the round of kamma entirelyThis was to be done by violence against themselves various forms of selftorture that were supposed to burn away the effluents the heat of pain being a sign that the effluents were burningAt the same time they tried to create as little new kamma as possibleThis practice would culminate in total abstinence from physical action resulting in suicide by starvation the theory being that if old kamma were completely burned away and no new kamma created there would be no more effluents to bind the soul to the cosmosThus the soul would be releasedDespite the differences between the Vedic and Jain views of action they shared some important similarities Both believed that the physical performance of an action rather than the mental attitude behind it determined its kammic resultAnd both saw kamma as acting under deterministic linear lawsKamma performed in the present would not bear fruit until the future and the relationship between a particular action and its result was predictable and fixedThese divergent viewpoints on the nature of action formed the backdrop for the Bodhisattas quest for ultimate happinessOn the one side stood the Ajivakas and Lokayatans who insisted for various reasons that human action was ineffective either nonexistent chaotic or totally predeterminedOn the other side stood the Vedic and Jain thinkers who taught that physical action was effective but that it was subject to deterministic and linear laws and could not lead to true happiness beyond the round of rebirthThe Buddhas position on kamma broke from both sides of the issue largely because he approached the question from a radically new directionInstead of arguing from abstract science the Bodhisatta focused directly on the level of immediate experience and explored the implications of truths that both sides overlookedInstead of fixing on the content of the views expressed he considered the actions of those who were expressing the viewsIf views of determinism and total chaos were followed to their logical end there would be no point in purposeful action and yet the proponents of both theories continued to act in purposeful waysIf only physical acts bore consequences there would be no point in teaching a proper understanding of the nature of action  for the mental act of understanding right or wrong would have no consequences  and yet all sides agreed that it was important to understand reality in the right wayThe fact that each side insisted that the other used unskillful forms of observation and argumentation to advance its views implied that mental skills were crucial in determining the truthThus the Bodhisatta looked directly at skillful mental action in and of itself followed its implications in developing knowledge itself as a skill  rather than as a body of facts  and found that those implications carried him all the way to releaseThe most basic lesson he learned was that mental skills can be developedAs one of the Pali discourses notes he found that thoughts imbued with passion aversion and delusion were harmful thoughts devoid of these qualities were not harmful and he could shepherd his thoughts in such a way to avoid harmThe fact that he could develop this skill meant that mental action is not illusory that it actually gives resultsOtherwise there would be no such thing as skill for no actions would be more effective than othersThe fact of skillfulness also implies that some results are preferable to others for otherwise there would be no point in trying to develop skillsIn addition the fact that it is possible to learn from mistakes in the course of developing a skill  so that ones future actions may be more skillful  implies that the cycle of action result and reaction is not entirely deterministicActs of perception attention and intention can actually provide new input as the cycle goes through successive turnsThe important element in this input is attentionAnyone who has mastered a skill will realize that the process of attaining mastery requires attention to three things to preexisting conditions to what one is doing in relation to those conditions and to the results that come from ones actionsThis threefold focus enables one to monitor ones actions and adjust them accordinglyIn this way attention to conditions actions and effects allows the results of an action to feed back into future action thus allowing for refinement in ones skillIn the first stage of his practice the Bodhisatta refined the skillfulness of his mind until it reached a state of jhana or concentrated mental absorption marked by perfect equanimity and mindfulnessThe question that occurred at that point was how much further the principle of skillful action could be appliedDid intentional action directly or indirectly explain all experience in the world or only some of itIf all of it could the same principle be used to gain escape from the suffering inherent in the world or were the Jains right in saying that action could only keep one bound to the cycle of sufferingAs the texts tell us the Bodhisattas first attempt to answer these questions was to direct his mind  now stable bright clear and malleable  to knowledge of previous lifetimesIf it were true that he had been born before his actions from past lives might explain experiences in this life  such as the circumstances into which he was born  for which no actions in this life could accountHe found that he could indeed remember previous lives many thousands of them what he had been born as where what his experience of pleasure and pain how he had died and then experienced rebirth as something elseThis first insight however did not fully answer his questionHe needed to know if kamma was indeed the principle that shaped life not only in terms of the narrative of his own lives but also as a cosmic principle effecting the lives of all beingsSo he directed his mind to knowledge of the passing away and arising of beings throughout the cosmos and found that he could indeed see beings dying and gaining rebirth that the pleasure and pain of their new lives was shaped by the quality of their kamma and the kamma in turn was dependent on the views that gave rise to itRight views  believing that good kamma based on skillful intentions gave rise to happiness  lay behind good kamma while wrong views  not believing these principles  lay behind badEven this second insight however didnt fully answer his questionTo begin with there was no guarantee that the visions providing this knowledge were true or completeAnd even if they were they did not tell whether there was a form of right view that would underlie a level of skillful kamma that would lead not simply to a pleasant rebirth within the cycle of rebirth but to release from the cycle altogetherHere was where the Bodhisatta turned to look again at the events in the mind in and of themselves in the present and in particular at the process of developing of skillfulness to see if it offered any clues as to what a right view leading out of the cycle of rebirth might beAs we noted above the process of skillfulness implies two things a nonlinear principle of cause and effect involving feedback loops to allow for greater skillfulness and the fact that some results are preferable to othersThe Bodhisatta used these principles in their most basic form to divide experience into four categories based on two sets of variables cause and effect on one hand and stress and its cessation on the otherHe then dropped the categories in which the first two knowledges had been expressedIn other words he dropped the sense of self and others in which the narrative of the first knowledge had been expressed and the sense of beings inhabiting a world in which the cosmology of the second knowledge had been expressedIn his place he analyzed experience in categories empty of those concepts simply in terms of the direct experience of stress its cause its cessation and the path of mental factors leading to its cessationIn the first round of this new insight he was able to identify each of these categories stress in ultimate terms was attachment to anything that might be identified as a self The cause of stress was craving which in turn was based on ignorance about the true nature of stressThe cessation of stress was the total abandoning of craving while the path to the cessation of stress was a cluster of eight factors right view right resolve right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness and right concentrationIn the second round of this insight he realized the duties that had to be performed with regard to each of these categoriesStress was to be comprehended its cause abandoned its cessation realized and the path developedHe then pursued those duties until the mental powers of the path were so fully developed that stress was totally comprehendedThis meant that there were no more objects on which craving could land and so it was naturally abandonedThus in the third round of this insight he realized that the duties with regard to all four truths had been fulfilledAt that point there was nothing further for the mind to do  there was nothing more it could do in these termsRight view and concentration  the mental qualities lying at the heart of the path  had done such a thorough job of ferreting out stress and craving that as their final act they detected the subtle stress and craving inherent in the act of right view and right concentration themselvesThus as its final act the mind let go even of these path factors just as a carpenter would let go of his tools when they had finished their jobAs a result all present mental input into the processes of experience naturally came to a halt in a state of nonfashioningThis state opened onto an experience of total liberation called UnbindingRealizing that this Unbinding was the total cessation of suffering and of the processes of death and rebirth as generated in the mind the Bodhisatta now the Buddha knew that his questions had been answeredSkillful action based on right view in the form of the four categories based around stress  which he termed the four noble truths  could indeed bring about a total happiness free from the limitations of birth aging illness and deathThe texts tell us that the Buddha spent the first seven weeks after his Awakening experiencing that happiness and freedomThen he decided to teach the way to that happiness to othersHis teachings were based on the three insights that had led to his own experience of AwakeningBecause right view lay at the heart of his analysis of kamma and the way out of kamma his teachings focused in particular on the two forms of right view that he learned in the course of those insights the form he learned in the second insight which led to a favorable rebirth and the form he learned in the third insight which led out from the cycle of death and rebirth once and for allThe first level of right view the Buddha termed mundane right viewHe expressed it in these termsThere is what is given what is offered what is sacrificedThere are fruits and results of good and bad actionsThere is this world and the next worldThere is mother and fatherThere are spontaneously reborn beings there are brahmans and contemplatives who faring rightly and practicing rightly proclaim this world and the next after having directly known and realized it for themselvesThe second level of right view which the Buddha termed transcendent right view he expressed simply asKnowledge in terms of stress knowledge in terms of the origination of stress knowledge in terms of the cessation of stress knowledge in terms of the way of practice leading to the cessation of stressJust as the third insight grew out of the first two insights the second level of right view grows out of the firstIts purpose is impossible to fathom if taken outside of the context of mundane good and bad kamma and their good and bad resultsTogether the two levels of right view provide a complete and complementary picture of the nature of kamma as viewed from two different perspectivesThe first level views kamma as a cosmic principle at work in the narrative of each individuals many livesThe second form views kamma as a principle at work in the present moment approached from a frame of mind empty of the categories of self and other being and nonbeing which lie at the essence of narratives and cosmologiesTo see how these two levels of right view complement one another in shaping the form and content of the Buddhas teachings we can look at his most common mode of presenting his teachings the graduated discourse beginning with the principle of good and bad kamma and gradually building up through the topics of generosity virtue heaven drawbacks and renunciation ending with the topic of the four noble truthsThere were several reasons for this gradual approach but primarily they came down to the fact that the four truths were too abstract to appear immediately relevant and the goal of escape from rebirth made no sense unless viewed in the proper contextThe role of the graduated discourse was to provide that sense of relevance and contextStarting with the first level of right view the Buddha would describe good actions under two main categories generosity and virtueTogether the two categories could be stretched to cover almost any type of good physical verbal or mental deedsFor example generosity covers not only the giving of material gifts but also generosity with ones time knowledge gratitude and forgivenessVirtue begins with the five precepts  against killing stealing illicit sex lying and taking intoxicants  includes prohibitions against five forms of wrong livelihood  selling slaves intoxicants poisons weapons and animals to be killed for food  and goes on to cover abstention from all forms of harmful behaviorThus good behavior taken under the categories of generosity and virtue means both refraining from harmful behavior and performing actions that are beneficialHaving described good actions the Buddha would describe their rewards as results of the cosmic principle of kammaThe rewards here include both those visible in this world and those to be anticipated in the nextThe Buddhist texts contain glowing descriptions both of the sense of wellbeing in the immediate present that results from good actions and of the exquisite pleasures that rebirth in heaven entailsImplicit in these descriptions is the dark side of the principle of kamma the inherent punishments that come from bad behavior again both in this world and in the next in the various levels of hell and other lower births  such as a common animal  and again in this world on ones return to the human stateHowever  because finite actions cant produce infinite results  the rewards of kamma good or bad are not eternalThis point led naturally to the next topic in the discourse the drawbacks of the cycle of rebirth as a wholeNo happiness within the cycle is permanent even the most refined heavenly pleasures must end when the force of ones good kamma ends and one is forced to return to the rough and tumble of lower realms of beingThe changeability of the mind lying behind the creation of kamma means that the course of an individuals life through the realms of rebirth is not necessarily ever upwardIn fact as the Buddha saw from his remembrance of his own lives the course leading from one rebirth to another is filled with aimless ups and downs like a stick thrown into the air sometimes landing on this end sometimes on the other end sometimes in the middleThe amount of suffering and stress suffered in the course of these many throws is more than can be measuredThese considerations led naturally to the next topic of the discourse renunciationHaving realized the fleeting nature of even the most refined pleasures in the round of rebirth the sensitive listener would be prepared to look favorably on the idea of renouncing any aspiration for happiness within the round and cultivating the path to releaseThe texts compare this mental preparation to the act of washing a cloth so that it would be ready to take dyeThis was when the Buddha would take the listener beyond the level of mundane right view and broach the transcendent levelThe texts describing the steps of the graduated discourse describe this step simply as the teaching special to the Buddhas stress its origination its cessation and the path ie the four noble truthsHowever the four noble truths are simply one out of three interrelated versions of transcendent right view taught in the texts thisthat conditionality dependent coarising and the four noble truthsIn order to gain a full picture of the Buddhas teachings on the nature of kamma we should look at all threeThe most basic version of right view is simply the causal principle of feedback loops that the Buddha found in the process of developing skillful actionHe called this principle thisthat conditionality because it explains experience in terms that are immediately present to awareness  events that can be pointed to in the mind as this or that  rather than principles hidden from awarenessHe expressed this principle in a simplelooking formulaOf the many possible ways of interpreting this formula only one does justice both to the way the formula is worded and to the complex fluid manner in which specific examples of causal relationships are described in the textsThat way is to view the formula as the interplay of two causal principles one diachronic acting over time and the other synchronic acting in a single instant of timeThe two principles combine to form a nonlinear patternThe diachronic principle  taking and as a pair  connects events over time the synchronic principle  and  connects objects and events in the present momentThe two principles intersect so that any given event is influenced by two sets of conditions input from the past and input from the presentAlthough each principle seems simple their interaction makes their consequences very complexTo begin with every act has repercussions in the present moment together with reverberations extending into the futureDepending on the intensity of the act these reverberations can last for a very short or a very long timeThus every event takes place in a context determined by the combined effects of past events coming from a wide range in time together with the effects of present actsThese effects can intensify one another can coexist with little interaction or can cancel one another outThus even though it is possible to predict that a certain type of act will tend to give a certain type of result  for example acting on anger will lead to pain  there is no way to predict when or where that result will make itself feltThe complexity of the system is further enhanced by the fact that both causal principles meet at the mindThrough its views and intentions the mind keeps both principles activeThrough its sensory powers it is affected by the results of the causes it has set in motionThis allows for the causal principles to feed back into themselves as the mind reacts to the results of its own actionsThese reactions can form positive feedback loops intensifying the original input and its results much like the howl in a speaker placed next to the microphone feeding into itThey can also create negative feedback loops counteracting the original input in the same way that a thermostat turns off a heater when the temperature in a room is too high and turns it on again when it gets too lowBecause the results of actions can be immediate and the mind can react to them immediately these feedback loops can sometimes quickly spin out of control at other times they may provide skillful checks on ones behaviorFor example a man may act out of anger which gives him an immediate sense of disease to which he may react with further anger thus creating a snowballing effectOn the other hand he may come to understand that the anger is causing his disease and so immediately attempt to stop itHowever there can also be times when the results of his past actions may obscure his present disease so that he doesnt immediately react to it at allThis means that although there are general patterns relating habitual acts to their results there is no set oneforone titfortat relationship between a particular action and its resultsInstead the results are determined by the entire context of the act shaped by the actions that preceded or followed it and by ones state of mind at the time of acting or experiencing the resultIn this way the combination of two causal principles  influences from the past interacting with those in the immediate present  accounts for the complexity of causal relationships on the level of immediate experienceHowever the combination of the two principles also opens the possibility for finding a systematic way to break the causal webIf causes and effects were entirely linear the cosmos would be totally deterministic and nothing could be done to escape from the machinations of the causal processIf they were entirely synchronic there would be no relationship from one moment to the next and all events would be arbitraryThe web could break down totally or reform spontaneously for no reason at allHowever with the two modes working together one can learn from causal patterns observed from the past and apply ones insights to disentangling the same causal patterns acting in the presentIf ones insights are true one can then gain freedom from those patternsThis allows for escape from the cycle of kamma altogether by developing kamma at a heightened level of skill by pursuing the noble eightfold pathIn addition the nonlinearity of thisthat conditionality explains why heightened skillfulness when focused on the present moment can succeed in leading to the end of the kamma that has formed the experience of the entire cosmosAll nonlinear processes exhibit what is called scale invariance meaning that the behavior of the process on any one scale is similar to its behavior on smaller or larger scalesTo understand say the largescale pattern of a particular nonlinear process one need only focus on its behavior on a smaller scale that is easier to observe and one will see the same pattern at workIn the case of kamma one need only focus on the process of kamma in the immediate present in the course of developing heightened skillfulness and the largescale issues over the expanses of space and time will become clear as one gains release from themThe teaching on dependent coarising helps to provide more detailed instructions on this point showing precisely where the cycle of kamma provides openings for more skillful present inputIn doing so it both explains the importance of the act of attention in developing heightened skillfulness and acts as a guide for focusing attention on present experience in appropriate waysDependent coarising shows how the cosmos when viewed in the context of how it is directly experienced by a person developing skillfulness is subsumed entirely under factors immediately present to awareness the five aggregates of form feeling perception mental fabrication and consciousness and the six sense media  ie the five senses plus the mindThe standard list of causal factors runs as follows the suffering and stress of aging illness and death depend on birth birth in turn depends on becoming and so on down through clinging craving feeling sensory contact the six senses name and form sensory consciousness mental fabrications and ignoranceAlthough the list reads like a linear pattern the precise definitions of the terms show that it is filled with many feedback loopsBecause it is nonlinear it thus functions on several scales birth for instance refers both to the birth of a physical organism and to the birth of a sense of being in the mindIncluded in this list is the Buddhas ultimate analysis of kamma and rebirthFor instance the nexus of kamma clinging becoming and birth accounts for the realm in which birth takes placeKamma gives rise to the five aggregates which form the objects for craving and clingingOnce there is clinging there is a comingintobeing in any of three realms the sensual realm the realm of form and the formless realmThese realms refer not only to levels of being on the cosmic scale but also to levels of mental statesSome mental states are concerned with sensual images others with forms and still others with formless abstractionsThe relationship between birth and becoming can be compared to the process of falling asleep and dreamingAs drowsiness leads the mind to lose contact with waking reality a dream image of another place and time will appear in itThe appearance of this image is called becomingThe act of entering into this image and taking on a role or identity within it  and thus entering the world of the dream and falling asleep  is birthThe commentaries to the Pali texts maintain that precisely the same process is what enables rebirth to follow the death of the bodyAt the same time the analogy between falling asleep and taking birth explains why release from the cycle of becoming is called AwakeningOnce there is birth in a particular realm the nexus of nameandform with consciousness accounts for the arising and survival of the active organism within that realmWithout consciousness the mental and physical organism would dieWithout the mental and physical organism consciousness would have no place to land and developThis nexus also explains the feedback loops that can lead to skillful actionName includes the subfactors of attention intention feeling perception and contact which are precisely the factors at work in the process of kamma and its resultThe first lesson of skillfulness is that the essence of an action lies in the intention motivating it an act motivated by the intention for greater skillfulness will give results different from those of an act motivated by greed aversion or delusionIntention in turn is influenced by the appropriateness or inappropriateness of the act of attention to ones circumstancesThe less an act of attention is clouded by delusion the more clearly it will see things in appropriate termsThe combination of attention and intention in turn determines the quality of the feeling and the physical events that result from the actThe more skilled the action the more refined these results will bePerceptions arise with regard to those results some more appropriate than othersThe act of attention selects which ones to focus on thus feeding back into another round in the cycle of actionUnderlying the entire cycle is the fact that all its factors are in contact with consciousnessThis interplay of name form and consciousness provides an answer to the quandary of how the stress and suffering inherent in the cycle of action can be endedIf one tried simply to stop the cycle through a direct intention the intention itself would count as kamma and thus as a factor to keep the cycle goingThis double bind can be dissolved however if one can watch as the contact between consciousness and the cycle naturally falls awayThis requires not inaction but more and more appropriate attention to the process of kamma itselfWhen ones attention to and mastery of the process becomes fully complete there occurs a point of equipoise called nonfashioning in which the contact between the processes of kamma and consciousness  still fully conscious  naturally becomes disengagedOne modern teacher has compared this disengagement to that of a fruit naturally falling when fully ripened from the treeThis is how the cycle of action comes to an end in the moment of AwakeningAs this analysis shows the most important obstacle to release is the ignorance that keeps attention from being fully perceptiveAs the Buddha traced the element of ignorance that underlay the processes of mental fabrication he found that it came down to ignorance of the four noble truths the identity of the truths the duties appropriate to each and the mastery of those dutiesWhen this ignorance is fully overcome the craving that keeps the cycle going will have nothing to fasten on for all its possible objects are seen for what they are suffering and stressWith no place to land craving disappears and the cycle can come to an endBecause knowledge in terms of the four noble truths is what ends ignorance and craving the Buddha most often expressed transcendent right view in their termsThese truths focus the analysis of kamma directly on the question of stress and suffering issues at the heart of the narratives that people make of their own life experiencesAs the Buddha noted in his second insight his memory of previous lives included his experience of pleasure and pain in each life and most people  when recounting their own lives  tend to focus on these issues as wellThe four truths however do not stop simply with tales about stress they approach it from the problemsolving perspective of a person engaged in developing a skillWhat this means for the meditator trying to master heightened skillfulness is that these truths cannot be fully comprehended by passive observationOnly by participating sensitively in the process of developing skillful powers of mindfulness concentration and discernment  and gaining a practical feel for the relationship of cause and effect among the mental factors that shape that process  can one eradicate the ignorance that obstructs the ending of kammaThus only through developing skillfulness to the ultimate degree can the cycle be brought to equilibrium and as a result disbandThe truth of the Buddhas understanding of the processes of kamma  as informed by thisthat conditionality dependent coarising and the four noble truths  was confirmed by the knowledge of Unbinding that followed immediately on his mastery of heightened skillfulnessHe found that when skillfulness is intentionally brought to a point of full consummation as expressed in the direct awareness of thisthat conditionality it leads to a state of nonfashioning that opens to a level of consciousness in which all experience of the cosmos has fallen awayWhen ones experience of the cosmos resumes after the experience of Awakening one sees clearly that it is composed entirely of the results of old kamma with no new kamma added to the process all experience of the cosmos will eventually run out  or in the words of the texts will grow cold right here This discovery confirmed the basic premise that kamma not only plays a role in shaping experience of the cosmos it plays the primary roleIf this were not so then even when kamma was ended there would still remain the types of experience that came from other sourcesBut because none of the limitations of the cosmos  time space etc remain when all present kamma disbands and none resume after all old kamma runs out kamma must be the factor accounting for all experience of those limitationsThis fact implies that even the limiting factors that one encounters in terms of sights sounds etc are actually the fruit of past kamma in thought word and deed  committed not only in this but also in many preceding lifetimesThus even though the Buddhas development of heightened skillfulness focused on the present moment the resulting Awakening gave insights that encompassed all of timeFrom this discussion it should become clear why kamma as an article of faith is a necessary factor in the path of Buddhist practiceThe teaching on kamma in its narrative and cosmological forms provides the context for the practice giving it direction and urgencyBecause the cosmos is governed by the laws of kamma those laws provide the only mechanism by which happiness can be foundBut because good and bad kamma consisting of good and bad intentions simply perpetuate the ups and downs of experience in the cosmos a way must be found out of the mechanism of kamma by mastering it in a way that allows it to disband in an attentive state of nonintentionAnd because there is no telling what sudden surprises the results of ones past kamma may still hold in store one should try to develop that mastery as quickly as possibleIn its empty mode  ie focusing on the process of action without referring to questions of whether or not there is a self or a being behind the processes  the teaching on kamma accounts for the focus and the terms of analysis used in the practiceIt also accounts for the mental qualities needed to attain and maintain that level of focus and analysisIn terms of focus the principle of scale invariance means that the complexities of kamma can be mastered by giving total attention to phenomena in and of themselves in the immediate presentThese phenomena are then analyzed in terms of the four noble truths the terms used in observing and directing the experience of developing the qualities of skillful actionThe most immediate skillful kamma that can be observed on this level is the mastery of the very same mental qualities that are supporting this refined level of focus and analysis mindfulness concentration and discernment together with the more basic qualities on which they are basedThus these mental qualities act not only as supports to the focus and analysis but also as their objectUltimately discernment becomes so refined that the focus and analysis take as their object the act of focusing and analyzing in and of themselvesThe cycle of action then shortcircuits as it reaches culmination and Unbinding occursIt is entirely possible that a person with no firm conviction in the principle of kamma can follow parts of the Buddhist path including mindfulness and concentration practices and gain positive results from themFor instance one can pursue mindfulness practice for the sense of balance equanimity and peace it gives to ones daily life or for the sake of bringing the mind to the present for the purpose of spontaneity and going with the flow The full practice of the path however is a skillful diverting of the flow of the mind from its habitual kammic streams to the stream of UnbindingAs the Buddha said this practice requires a willingness to develop and abandon to an extreme degreeThe developing requires a supreme effort aimed at full and conscious mastery of mindfulness concentration and discernment to the point of nonfashioning and on to releaseA lack of conviction in the principle of kamma would undercut the patience and commitment the desire persistence intent and refined powers of discrimination needed to pursue concentration and discernment to the most heightened levels beyond what is needed for a general sense of peace or spontaneityThe abandoning involves uprooting the most deeply buried forms of clinging and attachment that maintain bondage to the cycle of rebirthSome of these forms of clinging  such as views and theories about selfidentity  are so entrenched in the narrative and cosmological modes in which most people function that only firm conviction in the benefits to be had by abandoning them will be able to pry them looseThis is why the Buddha insisted repeatedly that conviction in the fact of his Awakening necessarily involves conviction in the principle of kamma and that both forms of conviction are needed for the full mastery of the kamma of heightened skillfulness leading to releaseThere are many wellknown passages in the Canon where the Buddha asks his listeners not to accept his teachings simply on faith but these remarks were directed to people just beginning the practiceBeginners need only accept the general principles of skillful action on a trial basis focusing on the input that their intentions are putting into the causal system at the present moment and exploring the connection between skillful intentions and favorable resultsThe more complex issues of kamma come into play at this level only in forcing one to be patient with the practiceMany times skillful intentions do not produce their favorable results immediately aside from the sense of wellbeing  sometimes clearly perceptible sometimes barely  that comes with acting skillfullyWere it not for this delay the principle of kamma would be selfevident no one would dare act on unskillful intentions and there would be no need to take the principle on faithThe complexity of thisthat conditionality is the major cause of the confusion and lack of skill with which most people live their livesThe ability to master this process takes timeAs one progresses on the path however  and as the process of developing skillfulness in and of itself gradually comes to take center stage in ones awareness  the actual results of developing skillfulness should give greater and greater reason for conviction in the principle of kammaExcept in cases where people fall into the trap of heedlessness or complacency these results can spur and inspire one to hold to the principle of kamma with the increasing levels of firmness focus and refinement needed for AwakeningThis then is the sense in which kamma or intentional action forms the basic refuge for the person on the pathOn the one hand as a doctrine it provides guidance to the proper path of action and encouragement to muster the energy needed to follow the pathOn the other hand as the actual principle by which skillful action is brought to a pitch of nonfashioning on the threshold of the Deathless it provides the mechanism by which human effort and action can bring about the ultimate in genuine happinessReferences to D M and Iti are to discourseReferences to Dhp are to verseReferences to Mv and Cv are to chapter section and subsectionReferences to the remaining texts are to chapter and discourseAlthough our calculation of times passage in years and centuries carries no more weight against the vastness of the cosmic process than a feather before a storm still being human it is natural for us to nurture hope on reaching the threshold of a new millenniumAdherents of different religions also turn their thoughts toward the new millennium and as Buddhists we might briefly ponder the question what the Dhamma can offer the world in the years aheadFrom one angle it could be said that what Buddhism can offer humankind today is exactly what it has been holding out for the past twentyfive centuries an acute diagnosis of the human condition and a clear path to final liberation from sufferingBut while this statement is correct as far as it goes it is not yet sufficient for it does not take account of the fact that in any age the aspects of the Dhamma to be emphasized and the way they are to be expressed must address the particular problems faced by the people living in that ageThe Buddhas teaching acquires its incisive relevance not merely by the cogency of its broad generalities but by attuning its formulations to the precise problems that loom so large in the consciousness of the particular period in which it has taken rootThus for the Dhamma to preserve its vitality and strength it is not enough merely to repeat hallowed formulas inherited from the past however true they might be in their own rightRather we must focus the lens of the Buddhas teaching on the deep problems faced by human beings today and determine how the teachings can help to resolve those problems as effectively as possibleIf what the Buddha taught is only suffering and the cessation of suffering then the starting point for any convincing presentation of the way to sufferings end must be the specific forms of suffering characteristic of our timeIn the decades of the twentieth century two manifestations of suffering have become so prevalent that they seem almost the defining characteristics of the modern eraOne is an invidious sense of meaninglessness a feeling of alienation from life now becoming almost as common in the more modernized quarters of Asia as in the WestThe other most marked in the Third World is collective violenceThe first problem has its locus in the individual consciousness the second in the relationships among communities at different levels of social orderIf the Dhamma is to benefit humanity in the coming years and decades it must show us a way out of the abyss of meaninglessness and offer guidelines for reducing the frequency and severity of collective violenceThe sense of meaninglessness as a widespread social phenomenon set in with the rise of modern industrial civilizationAs each new breakthrough in natural science dealt a fresh blow to the organic Christian world view that had prevailed during the medieval period human beings could no longer regard themselves as the pinnacle of creation the beloved children of an allloving Father who had created the universe expressly as the stage for our unfolding march toward salvationInstead under the influence of the mechanistic sciences we came to see ourselves as chance products of purely natural causes born and dying in a universe cold and indifferent to our hopesOur existence was inexplicable in terms of any objective source of meaningIt did not embody any higher purpose than the brute struggle to survive and propagate our genes before death draws the curtain closed on all our restless strivingsThe loss of meaning was further aggravated by the breakup of traditional forms of social order under the impact of industrial capitalismThe rise of the city and the compulsive work routine of office and factory cut the bonds of social solidarity so that each individual came to see himself or herself as an isolated entity pitted against others in stark competition for dominanceThe individual ego thus became the ultimate center of experience and the sole determinant of valueBut it was an isolated ego on whom the otherregarding virtues inculcated by religious ethics such as generosity and selfsacrifice no longer had any claimsAltruism and restraint were eclipsed by the new creed of selfindulgence which gave precedence to wealth power and conspicuous consumption as the supreme goals of lifeAs Western technology and its offshoot the consumerist culture spread to the far corners of the world the breakdown of meaning and the sense of selfalienation became endemic to many lands and today this sense of meaninglessness has reached a truly global scaleThe culture of narcissism which exalts the reckless quest for selfaggrandizement has spread its tentacles everywhere leaving behind the same debris agitated minds and hollow livesBent on quick and easy gratification we pass our lives perpetually shadowed by a fear that all our achievements are worthless unable to deliver any deep and stable satisfactionAnd when this fear reveals itself the abyss opens up the realization that we have wasted our lives in the pursuit of empty dreamsThus the high incidence of mental illness drug dependence alcoholism and suicide particularly in the more affluent parts of the worldIt is a telling sign that despite the impressive achievements of science and technology a culture built on mere mastery over external nature is far from successful in meeting the deep demands of the human spiritFor those adrift in the sea of meaninglessness the Buddhas teaching offers a sense of meaning stemming from a profound spiritual tradition that combines metaphysical depth with psychological astuteness and the highest ethical standardsWithout calling for blind faith in dogmatic creeds or speculative postulates the Buddha points directly to the invariable universal laws that underlie happiness and sufferingHe insists that we can discover these laws for ourselves simply by clear reflection on our own immediate experience and he offers us methods of practice by which we can gradually dig up the buried roots of suffering and cultivate the causes culminating in the highest happinessHis appeal is to immediate experienceWe can see for ourselves that suffering prevails in a mind driven by greed hatred and delusion and that happiness grows when the mind is suffused by the virtues of generosity kindness and understandingOn the basis of this experimental test which lies within the scope of any thinking person we can extrapolate and see that for a mind fully liberated from all selfcentered defilements and adorned with perfect detachment love and wisdom happiness and peace will become boundless and irreversibleThus by showing us the way to inner peace and happiness the Dhamma offers us an outlet from the abyss of meaninglessness a way to confer on our lives an exalted meaning and purposeThe second type of suffering that has become so pervasive in our time is social violence which still wreaks so much misery across the globeTo be sure communal violence is by no means peculiar to our era nor a product of modern civilization but has infected human relations from time immemorialBut what has become so disturbing in the presentday world is the eruption of violence between different ethnic communities that in the past had managed to coexist in a relatively stable degree of mutual acceptanceWe have witnessed these outbreaks of enmity recently in the Balkans Russia Indonesia Central Africa northern India and sadly in our own Sri LankaViolence manifests itself moreover not only in the conflicts that rage between groups of different ethnic stocks and communal loyalties but also in economic oppression in the widening gap between rich and the poor in the gargantuan arms industries that thrive on violent conflict in the sexual exploitation of women and children in the drug trade and also in the reckless devastation of the environment by which we risk ripping away the life support systems that sustain our life on earthWhile Buddhism cannot pretend to offer a detailed solution to all the countless forms that violence takes in the presentday world the values emphasized by the Dhamma show what is required to arrive at any lasting solutionWhat is necessary for true peace and harmony to prevail among human beings is not the hammering out of a comprehensive treaty by which the various parties to a conflict compromise their hard and volatile demandsWhat is truly required is a new mode of perception the ascent to a universal consciousness that transcends the narrow standpoint of egocentric or ethnocentric selfinterestThis is a consciousness that regards others as not essentially different from oneself which detaches itself from the insistent voice of selfinterest and rises up to a universal perspective from which the welfare of all appears as important as ones own goodWe can see the germ of this universal perspective in a principle that stands at the base of Buddhist ethics even more fundamental to its ethical ideals than the Five Precepts or any other formal code of conductThis is the principle of taking oneself as the criterion for determining how to treat othersWhen we apply this principle we can understand that just as we each wish to live happily and to be free from suffering so all other beings wish to live happily and to be free from suffering just as we are each averse to pain and hardship and want to live in peace so all others are averse to pain and hardship and want to live in peaceWhen we have understood this common core of feeling that we share with all other beings not as a mere idea but as a visceral experience born of deep reflection we will treat others with the same kindness and care that we would wish them to treat usAnd this must apply at a communal level just as much as in our personal relationsWe must learn to see other communities as essentially similar to our own and entitled to the same benefits as we wish for the group to which we belongEven if we cannot reach any expansive feelings of love and compassion for others we will at least realize that the moral imperative requires that we treat them with justice and kindnessThus the message of the Dhamma to human beings in the next millennium might be briefly summed up in these twin giftsIn the personal domain it gives us a precisely defined path that confers on life a deep sense of purpose a purpose grounded in the cosmic order but which can be actualized in ones own immediate experienceIn the communal dimension of human existence it holds out an ethical guideline to right action which if diligently applied can arouse a conscientious commitment to a life of nonviolenceThough it is far too much to expect that these two blessings will become the common heritage of all humanity we can at least hope that enough people will accept them to make the twentyfirst century a brighter and happier century than the one we are about to leave behindThe Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creedsFounded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topicsIts publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddhas discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practiceThese works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first aroseNibbana is the culmination of the Buddhist quest for perfection and happinessIn order to understand the meaning of this term it is useful to refer to the verse attributed to Kisa Gotami when she saw Prince Siddhattha returning to the palace from the park on the eve of his great renunciationShe declaredHappycontentedpeaceful indeed is the mother happy indeed is the father happy indeed is the woman who has such a one as her husbandNibbuta is often treated as the past participle of the verb nibbaayati and nibbaana is the nominal form of that verbIt means happiness contentment and peaceNibbaayati also means to extinguish to blow out as in the blowing out of a lampNibbana is so called because it is the blowing out of the fires of greed hatred and delusionWhen these fires are blown out peace is attained and one becomes completely cooled  siitibhuutaIt is sometimes conjectured that Nibbana is called cool because the Buddha preached in a warm country where the cool was appreciated as comfortableHad he taught in a cold climate he might have described Nibbana in terms of warmthBut it is certain that the term cool was chosen to convey a literal psychological realityAnger makes us hot and restlessWe use expressions such as boiling with anger and they clearly express the intensity of the aggressive emotionWhen such negative emotions are completely eradicated never to arise again the temperament has to be described as coolNibbana is a state to be attained here and now in this very life and not a state to be attained only after deathIn terms of living experience Nibbana can be characterized by four special attributes happiness moral perfection realization and freedomWe shall take these up for discussion one by oneNibbana is described as the highest happiness the supreme state of blissThose who have attained Nibbana live in utter bliss free from hatred and mental illness amongst those who are hateful and mentally illSukha in Paali denotes both happiness and pleasureIn English happiness denotes more a sense of mental ease while pleasure denotes physical well beingThe Paali word sukha extends to both these aspects and it is certain that mental and physical bliss is experienced by one who has attained NibbanaThe experience of nonsensuous physical bliss for limited periods is possible even before the attainment of Nibbana through the practice of jhaana or meditative absorptionThe Saamaññaphala Sutta describes these physical experiences with the help of eloquent similesWhen bath powder is kneaded with water into a neat wet ball the moisture touches every part of the ball but does not ooze out similarly the body of the adept in the first jhaana is drenched and suffused with joy and pleasure born of detachment from sense pleasuresThe experience in the second jhaana is elucidated with a different simileA deep pool filled to the brim with clear cool water is fed by underground springs yet the waters do not overflow and no part of the pool remains untouched by the cool watersSimilarly joy and pleasure born of concentration pervade the body of the meditator in the second jhaanaThe simile for the third jhaana is a lotus born in water grown in water fully submerged in water and drawing nourishment from water with no part of the lotus remaining untouched by the cool waterThus happinesspleasure suffuses drenches and permeates the entire body of the adept in the third jhaanaThese are the experiences of nonsensuous pleasure before the attainment of NibbanaOn the attainment of Nibbana more refined nonsensuous pleasure is permanently establishedThe Cankii Sutta specifically states that when a monk realizes the ultimate truth he experiences that truth with the bodyRegarding the experience of the arahant the Suttanipaata states that by the destruction of all feelingssensations a monk lives desireless and at peaceOnce Saariputta was asked what happiness there can be when there is no feelingsensationHe explained that the absence of feelingsensation itself is happinessIt is relevant to note here that the Buddha says that he does not speak of happiness only with reference to pleasant feelingssensationsWherever there is happiness or pleasure that he recognizes as happiness or pleasureHere we are reminded of the statement that all mental states converge on feelingsWhat is meant by this statement seems to be that all mental states are translated into sensations in the bodyIt is possible to understand the import of this statement if we pay attention to a gross emotion such as angerWhen we are angry we experience a variety of bodily sensations feeling hot being restless breaking out in a sweat trepidation etcWhen we are sad tears come into our eyesThese are brought about by changes in body chemistry through the discharge of various glandular secretionsIf intense emotions bring about such gross sensations we might conjecture that all thoughts cause subtle sensations in the body resulting from changes in body chemistryWe are hardly aware of these sensations which however become noticeable with the development of vedanaanupassanaa contemplation of sensationsThoughts are endless and continuous therefore if this interpretation that thoughts are translated into sensations is correct sensations too should be endless and continuousThe Vedanaasamyutta states that just as diverse winds constantly blow in different directions numerous sensations pass through the bodyAn arahant has full control over his thoughts therefore he must have full control over his feelingssensations tooWhat is meant by the statement that a monk lives desireless and at peace by the destruction of all feelingssensations seems to be that he has destroyed all psychogenic feelingssensationsThis leads us to another statement that all feelingssensations partake of the nature of sufferingIn order to understand the significance of this statement we must pay attention to our posturesIf we have to remain seated for some time say for an hour we are not even aware of how many times we shift and adjust our limbs to more comfortable positionsThis happens almost mechanically as all the time we unconsciously seek to avoid discomfortThis is because monotony of sensations even pleasant sensations brings about discomfort and a change brings about a temporary sensation of comfortIf there were no sensations produced from within perhaps we would not need to change positions so often and we would have a running sense of ease even if we continue to remain in the same position for a long timeHere it might be asked whether an arahant has lost the ability to feel pain which is also an essential part of the touch sensationIt has to be pointed out that this is not so for in that case an arahant would not even know if a part of his body is seriously injured or burntThere is plenty of evidence to show that an arahant does feel sensations caused by physical changesFor instance the Buddha felt acute pain when he was wounded by a stone splinter and when he suffered from indigestionBut he was able to withstand the painful sensations with mindfulness and clear comprehension without being fatigued by themAgain an experience of Saariputta throws light on the subjectHis experience refers to events which modern psychology designates as nonordinary reality of altered states of consciousness A yakkha a malevolent spirit once gave Saariputta a blow on the headThe blow it is said was so powerful that it was capable of splitting a mountain peak or making a seven and a half cubit high elephant go down on its kneesMoggallaana who saw the incident with his divine eye inquired from Saariputta how he was feelingHe replied that he was all right but there was slight pain in the headThis shows us that a blow which could have deprived an ordinary person of life had only minimal impact on an arahantPerhaps because the psychological factors which predispose a person to the experience of sensations are perfectly well under control in an arahant he experiences only those sensations that are felt purely physically by an animate organismIt seems as if the body is under some sort of mentally regulated anesthesia which allows a narrow margin of sensation to protect the body from external dangerThere are two kinds of pain physical and mental and arahants are said to experience only physical pain without the anxious mental agony when experiencing physical painIt is also possible to look at this issue from another angleThough the texts state that vedanaa is destroyed in the arahant they never say that the sense faculties are destroyedWhen describing the superconscious state of sannaavedayitanirodha the sense faculties are said to be refined  vippasannaani indriyaaniSo in the case of the arahant too the sense faculties must certainly be refined and not rendered deficient in any wayIn that case it is possible to surmise that though vedanaa is extinct bodysensitivity continues to be active and is thoroughly refinedThe Vedanaasamyutta differentiates between three types of joy and pleasureAn arahant experiences both physical and mental bliss as all tensions torments and fevers have been completely eliminated for goodBhaddiya was a monk who often exclaimed What happiness what happinessThis expression of joy was misunderstood by his less developed fellow monks and they reported the matter to the Buddha suspecting that Bhaddiya was often reminiscing about his lay comfortsOn being questioned by the Buddha Bhaddiya explained that he was a prince in his lay life and that he had armed guards stationed in all strategic points within and without his palace yet still he suffered from insomnia and insecurity fearing that rivals might usurp his position and even deprive him of his lifeBut now though living all alone in the open air he is completely free from fear and anxietyTherefore to express his happiness he frequently exclaimed What happiness what happinessSo great was the experience of joy on the attainment of release from all mental intoxicants that sometimes arahants have stayed in that same position continuously without moving for seven days enjoying the bliss of emancipationIt is said that the whole body was permeated with this joy and blissThus there are various passages in the Paali Canon which record the experience of bliss in the attainment of NibbanaBut it appears that this bliss is not confined to or dependent on the five aggregates which constitute the individualFor the Dvayataanupassanaa Sutta maintains that suffering ceases to arise with the cessation of the five aggregatesFurther it is said in the Alagadduupama Sutta that the perfected being cannot be identified with any of the five personality factors even while he is still aliveNibbana is a state of moral perfectionFor one who has attained Nibbana all unwholesome motivational roots such as greed hatred and delusion have been fully eradicated with no possibility of their ever becoming active againTherefore Nibbana is called the destruction of greed hatred and delusionAll inflowing moral depravities are destroyed hence the epithet aasavakkhaya for NibbanaCraving has been uprooted for good therefore tanhakkhaya is another synonymAll types of conceit the superiority and the inferiority complex plus the complex of equality are eliminatedThis necessarily has to be so as an arahant has no egoistic delusions such as I and mineJust as much as an arahant has transcended egoism he has transcended sexuality tooWhen Somaa a female arahant was rebuked by Maara the Evil One saying that womankind with very little intelligence cannot attain that state which is to be attained with great effort by seers and sages Somaa replied that womanhood is no impediment for the realization of truth to one who is endowed with intelligence and concentrationFurther she adds that Maara must address these words to one who thinks I am a man or I am a woman and not to one like herselfThis reply seems to imply that one loses even sexual identity on the attainment of arahantshipThere is evidence that an arahant has undergone such transformation in body chemistry that he has gone beyond the dichotomy of masculinity and femininityAll normal physiological sexual functions seem to be atrophied in an arahant as it is said that seminal emission is impossible for an arahant even in sleepWe may also note the tradition maintaining that arahants never dream maybe because they have attained such perfect mental health that there is no necessity to release tension through dreamsThe sublime modes of conduct such as lovingkindness compassion sympathetic joy and equanimity are fully developed without any limitationsAn arahant is such a perfect being that it is simply impossible for him to commit an immoral actHe is incapable of wilfully destroying the life of a living creatureIt is impossible for him to stoop so low as to steal something to indulge in sex to utter a deliberate lie or to enjoy accumulated goods as in the household lifeOne may wonder why household life is an impossibility for an arahantThe reason may be that the household is recognized as a fortress of greed where we deposit all our belongings it is in other words the external repository of our egoAn arahant who has fully transcended the ego is incapable of partaking of such an institutionSeveral expressions are used in the Paali Canon to denote the cognitive aspect of the experience of NibbanaThe mass of darkness has been torn asunder is a frequent expressionIn his First Sermon the Buddha describes the realization of the Four Noble Truths as the arising of the eye wisdom insight knowledge and lightThe three knowledges have been attained is another expressionThe triple knowledge consists of retrocognition clairvoyance and the knowledge of the destruction of defilementsWith the first two knowledges one obtains personal verification of the doctrines of rebirth and kamma respectivelyWith the destruction of intoxicants one realizes the causal origination of all phenomena and egolessnessSometimes three other cognitive faculties are mentioned as extra qualifications of arahants namely miraculous powers the divine ear and telepathyWith the attainment of Nibbana one also realizes that birth is destroyed the higher life has been successfully lived ones duty has been done and there is no more of this existenceThe Uddesavibhanga Sutta explains the nature of consciousness and the general cognitive attitude of an arahantThe Mahaasalaayatanika Sutta explains more fully the cognitive experience of an arahant from the angle of sense experienceThe arahant realistically understands the nature of sense faculties sense objects sense consciousness sense contact established by the convergence of these three factors and the resulting sensations of pleasure pain and hedonic neutralityHe does not get attached to any of these factorsWhen he lives without deriving pleasure and without getting attached to perceived sense objects and without being deluded by the process of sense perception recognizing the evil consequences of sense perception the five aggregates of grasping or the personality factors do not get built upThey fall apart as craving which leads to rebirth is totally eliminatedAll physical and mental tensions torments and fevers are destroyedThe arahant experiences perfect physical and mental blissWe are not quite sure exactly what is meant by the realistic understanding of the nature of sense faculties but we might suppose that an arahant intuitively understands through the framework of his own personality how the sense stimuli pass through sense receptors and nerve fibers and are interpreted at brain centersModern science explains to a certain extent the physiological processes involved in the activity of sense perception but this understanding is confined at best to the intellectual level and is dependent on technological devices in medical laboratoriesSuch knowledge cannot bring about the attitudinal and emotional changes which are necessary for liberationAn arahants understanding springs from a deeper experiential level with direct vision into the whole perceptual process as explained for instance in the Madhupindika SuttaWhat is meant by the realistic understanding of sense objectsMost likely it is the realization of the impermanent unsatisfactory and nonsubstantial nature of all that is around usThis too is a direct profound experience of acute sensitivity a direct personal vision into the dynamism of atomic and subatomic particles that go to form the material world around us as well as our bodiesThe Dhammapada records that when a monk sees in his contemplations the dynamic working of the physical and mental phenomena composing his own personality great joy arises in him and that can only be described as superhuman joyOne has direct insight into the inner workings of ones body the arising and passing away of body cells sensations perceptions activities and consciousnessGreat is the joy and delight of this realization and it is the realization of deathlessnessThis is what is called the bliss of enlightenmentAll bonds which tie us down to suffering are torn asunder thus Nibbana is called samyojanakkhayaAs the arahant has complete mastery over his thoughts no recurring unhealthy thoughts obsess himNegative emotions restrict an individuals psychological freedom therefore greed hatred and ignorance are described as pamaanakarana iethey circumscribe an individuals freedomGreed hatred and ignorance are roots of unwholesome mental states which fetter the individual within samsaaraThere is an interesting simile which illustrates the nature of a fetterIf there is a white bull and a black bull tied together by a rope the question is asked whether the white bull is a fetter to the black bull or the black bull is a fetter to the white bullIn fact neither is a fetter to the other the fetter is the rope by which they are tied togetherSimilarly the desire we have for external objects is the fetter that binds usThe arahant has cut this off and attained freedomUnhealthy negative emotions are always selforiented and selfcenteredThe Dhammapada says that the fool laments He abused me he beat me he defeated me he robbed me and generates angerAs he is firmly tied to the idea of the self or the ego and he cannot wean himself away from the experience which inflicted a wound on his ego he is like a dog tied to a postThis situation is quite in contrast to an experience the Buddha had onceA brahman came and abused him in very harsh languageThe Buddha remained silentWhen at last the brahman stopped the Buddha asked If you were to visit a friend and you took a gift to him but the friend declined to accept the gift what would you do The brahman replied that he would take it backThe Buddha said You brought me a gift of much abuse I do not accept you can take it back The Buddha also states that even if one is cut into pieces with a doublehandled saw one should train oneself not to generate anger towards the tormentorMoggallaana was an arahant who was mercilessly beaten by robbers but he was able to maintain his composure without a trace of angerSuch is the freedom one gains from negative emotions on the attainment of NibbanaAn arahant has fully developed the brahmavihaaras the sublime modes of conduct  universal love compassion sympathetic joy and equanimityThese positive qualities are generated by transcending the self and are described as allembracing and immeasurableThus they do not limit the scope of psychological freedom as do the mental states rooted in greed hatred and ignoranceThe freedom won by an arahant is called cetovimutti and pannaavimutti release of mind and release through wisdomKnowledge also arises in the meditator that freedom has been gainedThis is called the bliss of emancipation the highest bliss that any human being could enjoyCreativity is another aspect under which the achievement of an arahant can be fruitfully discussedThe virtues of the arahant can be succinctly summarized as karunaa and pannaa compassion and wisdomThese are the two qualities through which the creativity of the arahant finds expressionWhen arahants look at humanity they are moved by great compassion as they fully realize the gravity of the precarious condition of the worldlingsTherefore they willingly plunge into a life of selfless activity preaching to the people trying to show them the path leading out of misery to eternal peaceIt is especially noteworthy that the Buddhas role as teacher was so demanding that he barely slept two hours a dayThe body of discourses he gave during the course of his long ministry of fortyfive years is as profound as it is extensiveIt stands preeminent in world literary history for originality of ideas profundity of thought and clarity of expressionThese observations hold good for the discourses delivered by the arahants as wellThe entire Paali Canon can be considered as testimony to the creative genius of the liberated beingsIt is but natural that creativity finds spontaneous expression when a person attains liberation as all negative emotions which hinder creativity and distort spontaneity are totally eliminated in the arahantSome arahants are endowed with the special accomplishment of the fourfold analytical knowledge which qualifies them even more thoroughly for creative workThese are spelt out as analytical knowledge of the meaning or goal profound truth language or the medium of communication and originality of expressionThese four special qualifications make arahants experts in communicating to their audience the exact meanings and goals of the profound truths they have discovered through the medium of refined language using their own original modes of expression such as eloquent similes metaphors etcSeveral arahants both male and female are recorded as eloquent speakers and erudite exponents of the DhammaSpecial mention must be made of the Theragaathaa and Theriigaathaa which comprise poems of exquisite beautyThey are utterances of monks and nuns embodying their varied experiencesLiterary critics rank them among the best lyrics in Indian literatureThey remain unrivalled in the literary history of the world as creative writing issuing forth from the undefiled purity of the human heart and the nobility of human wisdomThey are everfresh fountains of inspiration to the truthseeker and lasting monuments to the creative genius of the liberated beingsHaving considered this traditional material from the Paali Canon let us now turn to modern studies on psychophysiology and meditation to see whether we can draw some inferences from them on the experience of NibbanaStudies done by investigators such as Walter BCanon show beyond doubt that there is a definite correlation between physiology and strong emotionsWhen a sensory trunk is strongly excited the adrenal glands are reflexly stimulated and they pour into the blood stream an increased amount of adrenalin This gives rise to the overt manifestation of bodily changes such as dilation of the pupils sweating rapid respiration etcThere are other physiological changes such as those in heart beat blood pressure blood volume electrodermal responses etcBut they are not quite useful for us as they cannot be related to material found in the Paali CanonThe logical inference is that if strong negative emotions can give rise to certain physiological changes in the body changes which may be described as unhealthy the cultivation of positive emotions too should give rise to physiological changes which are quite different from those stimulated by negative emotionsAs opposed to the dilation of the pupils and a consequent look of ferocity in the instance of a strong emotion such as anger we find in the Paali texts mention made of the monks eyes as being very pleasantThe monks it is said look at one another with amiable eyes and they mix with one another as milk and water blendThis feature was conspicuous enough to draw the attention of the intelligent public for example King Pasenadi Kosala cited the pleasing expression in the eyes of the monks as one of the special characteristics which convinced him that they possess purity of heart and spiritual maturityThe complexion or facial expression of the monks is also mentioned as an impressive feature indicating the height of spirituality attainedThe bright clear complexion or serene facial expression attracted the attention of many observers and inspired their confidence in the DhammaFor instance Saariputta was impressed by the bright countenance and the serene appearance of the monk Assaji and that was the starting point of his conversionKing Asokas conversion to Buddhism was prompted by the outward appearance of the novice NigrodhaThe spotlessly pure bright complexion of the Buddha was counted as one of the thirtytwo marks of a great man and these marks are considered the outward manifestations of profound spiritual maturityAs sweating is one of the physiological manifestations of emotional excitement there is an interesting incident from the life of the Buddha relevant for our present studyOnce Saccaka a redoubtable debater came for a debate with the BuddhaHe boasted that he would harass the Buddha in debate as a strong man would shake a goat to and fro while holding it by its long beardArrogantly he bragged that he could see no man who would not break out in a sweat when challenged by him in debateBut when the debate with the Buddha was actually held before a large audience it was Saccaka who sweated profusely in defeatThe Buddha bared his chest and showed that he did not sweat at allThis episode may be taken as evidence that an arahant does not perspire due to emotional excitementRapid respiration is another physiological accompaniment of negative emotionsChanges in breathing rhythm or amplitude are considered excellent indicators of deceptionIt is a commonplace experience that respiration remains calm and placid when we are quiet and restingIt becomes even calmer in meditationThe Paali Canon maintains that respiration ceases altogether during the fourth jhaana which is a subtle highly refined state of superconsciousnessIt is possible that metabolism comes to a standstill or a minimum level during this stateThough arahants do not always abide in this jhaana they must constantly maintain a calm regular rhythm in their respiration for they never become emotionally disturbed or excitedTheir calm is so profound that it is said that they also maintain an inner silence even when they speak as the subvocal chatter which is characteristic of others has been quelled altogether in their caseModern scientific studies on the physiology of meditation shed light on some other aspects relevant to the present studyIt has been found that the concentration of bloodlactate level declines precipitously in meditationIts concentration normally falls in a subject at rest but the rate of decline during meditation has proved to be more than three times faster than the normal rateThis offers a good contrast to the rise of bloodlactate levels when patients with anxiety neurosis are placed under stressIt is also reported from experiments that the infusion of lactate brings about attacks of anxiety in such patientsFurthermore it is significant that patients with hypertension show higher bloodlactate levels in a resting state than patients without hypertension whereas in contrast the low lactate level in meditators is associated with low blood pressureThus it is clear that the fall in the bloodlactate level has a beneficial psychophysiological effectAll this medical evidence goes to show that a calm healthy mind finds expression in a positively transformed body chemistryTherefore it is reasonable to maintain that one who has reached the culmination of meditative practice and realized Nibbana is healthy in both mind and bodyThe body has certain electrical properties that are clearly associated with psychological processes such as attention and emotionOne of these is shown in the rapid rise in the electrical resistance of the skin accompanying meditationWallace and Benson report that fifteen subjects tested showed a rise of about ohms in minutesIn sleep skin resistance normally rises but not so much or at such a rateThe same test is used in lie detection and most laboratory studies have found that the skin resistance response is the best indicator of deceptionThis evidence shows beyond doubt that involuntary physiological changes accompany emotional states both positive and negativeAgain it is said that the brain is constantly emitting small electrical potentials measured in cycles per second called HertzThese waves of varying frequencies and shapes are labelled with Greek letters such as delta waves theta waves alpha waves and beta wavesElectroencephalographic recordings of subjects in meditation have disclosed a marked intensification of alpha wavesWallace and Benson report that they recorded the waves from seven main areas of the brain on magnetic tape and analyzed the patterns with a computerThey say that typically there was an increase in intensity of slow alpha waves at eight or nine cycles per second in the frontal and central regions of the brain during meditationIn several subjects this change was also accompanied by prominent theta waves in the frontal areasOn the other hand emotional disturbance such as anger is always accompanied by alpha blocking whereas sleep the antithesis of emotion is characterized by slow highamplitude activityLight and sound stimuli also block the alpha rhythmIt is reduced or suppressed during periods of apprehensionAlpha waves are absent in records of patients in an anxiety stateOn the strength of these findings it is possible to conjecture that the harmony of the mind determines to a very large extent the health of the bodyWhen related to the experience of Nibbana it seems reasonable to conjecture that an arahant has put an end to all psychosomatic diseasesHis body would be susceptible only to physical ailments and injury caused by external agentsThere are reports in the Paali Canon of arahants falling ill and experiencing acute painIt is also noteworthy that they are said to have recovered by meditating on the DhammaOn the strength of the evidence furnished so far one is inclined to regard their illnesses as being caused by physiological factorsThere is also an incident of a monk who is not an arahant dying of snakebiteThe Buddha says that if the monk had practiced mettaa fully he would not have met with such an unfortunate deathIt may be that the snake would not have bitten him in the first place had mettaa been fully cultivatedOn the other hand there is another commentarial episode where a nonarahant monk was bitten by a poisonous snake while he was listening to the DhammaThe poison started spreading in the body and the pain became acuteThe monk then reflected on the immaculate purity of his virtues from the time he received higher ordinationIt is said that as a result of this reflection great joy arose in his mind suffusing his entire bodyThe joy acted as an antivenom and he was curedMeditation is described in psychophysiological terminology as a wakeful hypometabolic state characterized by reductions in oxygen consumption carbon dioxide elimination and the rate and volume of respiration a slight increase in the acidity of arterial blood a marked decrease in the bloodlactate level a slowing of the heart beat a considerable increase in skin resistance and an electroencephalogram pattern of intensification of slow alpha waves with occasional thetawave activity It may be surmised that the metabolism during normal waking hours is probably maintained at the lowest possible healthy level in the case of the arahant as his body is not subject to undue wear and tear brought about by emotional excitementThe positive refined sublime emotions or the divine modes of conduct such as mettaa karunaa muditaa and upekkhaa not to speak of the higher cognitive states must necessarily find expression in body chemistry to produce a healthy constitution and a calm unruffled serene personality filled with peace contentment and the joy of enlightenmentWe are reminded here of a statement the Buddha once madeHe said that even if there is a portion as small as a pinch of dust that defies change in the psychophysical personality of the human being leading the higher life would be uselessWhat is meant is that there is no such permanent part and the higher life can successfully bring about a total transformation of the individual in both mind and bodyModern scientific studies on the physiology of meditation prove that basic biochemical and bioelectrical changes do take place in the body as a result of mental cultureIt is therefore possible to surmise that mental culture culminates in a total psychophysical transformationStudies done on the biofeedback technique suggest that a radical transformation of the nervous system must take place with the development of higher mental potentialitiesIt is common knowledge that the autonomous nervous system is divided into two parts the sympathetic nervous system and the parasympathetic nervous systemJohann Stoyva in an article on biofeedback techniques states that probably in deep relaxation there is a shift in the autonomous nervous system towards parasympathetic dominanceParasympathetic functioning is associated with subtler emotions  wonder religious and aesthetic experiences contemplation  emotions characterized by a broader range of awarenessOn the other hand sympathetic predominance is linked to emotions in which the range of awareness is restricted  anger and fear for exampleOn the strength of this evidence it may be conjectured that parasympathetic functioning develops to greater efficiency with spiritual advancementVery little is known about the functions of the pineal gland which Ren Descartes regarded as the chosen residence of the human soulIt is described as the builtin biological clock of the human being on which depends the regularity of sleeping and wakingThis gland synthesizes a hormone called melatonin which affects behavior sleep brain activity and sexual activity such as puberty ovulation and sexual maturationWhile melatonin stimulates brain activity it inhibits sexual activityAgain it has been recognized that lightdark olfaction cold stress and other neural inputs affect the pineal functionExposure to light reduces the synthesis of melatonin and depresses pineal weightOn the other hand light accelerates sexual maturation and activityIn the context of Buddhist thought the function of the pineal gland seems to be the biological basis of sense controlBuddhism maintains that unrestrained sense stimulation disturbs mental activityIf the sense doors are well guarded ieif visual auditory olfactory gustatory and tactile inputs are controlled a corresponding degree of happiness and concentrated mental activity become possibleCittassekaggataa the ability to fix the mind on one point is greatly determined by the control of the sense facultiesIn terms of physiology it seems that such sense control helps the synthesis of melatonin in the pineal gland which stimulates brain activity and retards sexual activityThus in terms of pineal function brain activity and sexual activity seem to be antitheticalBuddhism too emphasizes that sexual desire prevents clear thinking distorts vision clouds issues inhibits wisdom and destroys peace of mindThe entire scheme of spiritual development comprising the Noble Eightfold Path is an efficient methodical plan of action designed to bring a gradual psychophysical transformation culminating in the attainment of NibbanaCultivation of moral habits is the frame for wholesome behavior by means of which healthy body chemistry gets gradually establishedNeural circuits related to harmonious physical and vocal activity are strengthened and those related to violence become proportionately weakThe second phase in the development of the Noble Eightfold Path comprises meditationA steady rapid psychophysical development takes place during this phaseIt is our conjecture that the adrenalin secretion which accompanied negative emotions of rage and fear is reduced to a healthy workable levelPerhaps adrenalin is secreted in small quantities into the blood stream to maintain an unflagging enthusiasm to continue in the difficult practice of meditation with undaunted courage and perseveranceOr it may be as the endocrine glands stimulate or inhibit one another a balanced combination of these glandular secretions affects the cognitive and emotional behavior of the meditatorWhen sublime modes of conduct such as mettaa karunaa muditaa and upekkhaa are practiced over and over again they must become ingrained in the nervous system perhaps increasing parasympathetic dominanceWith the practice of vipassanaa or insightmeditation the pineal gland seems to develop its full bodily potential for unlocking all possible spiritual knowledges in the meditators mind and when the process is complete Nibbana is attainedThis interpretation finds further support in the Buddhist conception of the reciprocal relationship between vinnaana and naamaruupaThis relationship is illustrated in the Canon with the simile of two bundles of reeds placed together supporting each otherA change of position in one is bound to make a corresponding change in the otherThus psychological development affects physiological function apparently through the activity of the nervous system and the endocrine glandsHealthy physiological changes reinforce healthy psychological activityThus the process of mutual psychophysical interaction works for the happiness or misery of the individual depending on the moral quality of the actions performed through body speech and mindAs the mind is involved in all activity it is the mind that is responsible for the quality of body chemistry and neural functionWhen the mind ultimately attains to a state of absolute purity beyond corruptibility body chemistry and neural function undergo a radical transformation which will not be reversed againIt can be conjectured that when the pineal gland and its auxiliaries develop to the fullest possible capacity the hitherto inactive brain regions unlock their secrets and reveal them when attention is directed accordinglyThus memory becomes so efficient as to revive prenatal knowledge running into numerous previous existencesSimilarly the divine eye or clairvoyance is clarified disclosing the kammic antecedents of human experienceWhen one gains direct vision and knowledge of the bodily and mental processes involved in the human personality one attains supreme enlightenmentThe state of Nibbana after the death of the arahant is nowhere discussed in the Paali CanonThe four alternatives put forward regarding this state namely Does the Perfect One exist after death does he not does he and does he not does he neither exist nor not exist after death are all left aside unansweredThese questions are put aside because they are not useful to human happiness and understanding not concerned with the Dhamma not helpful for the higher life not conducive to disenchantment and detachment not conducive to cessation of misery to tranquillity of the mind to higher knowledge to insight and to peaceThe Aggivacchagotta Sutta cites a simile in this connection which illustrates that the questions themselves are meaninglessIf there is a fire burning and if the fire goes out without fuel can one ask the question In which direction did the fire go east south west or north The question itself is inappropriate as it assumes that fire can have existence independent of fuelThe nun Khemaa points out that the state of the Tathaagata after death is immeasurableJust as it is impossible to calculate the drops of water in the ocean and the grains of sand in the earth so is it impossible to conceptualize the state of Nibbana after the demise of the arahantThe Anuraadha Sutta states that the five aggregates of grasping or the personality factors are impermanent unsatisfactory and nonselfTherefore the noble disciple is detached from themHe wins freedom and after death becomes completely untraceableThe Alagadduupama Sutta maintains that the Tathaagata cannot be identified with the personality factors even during his lifetime so how can he be identified after deathA plausible explanation is necessary for the traditional silence regarding the state of the arahant after deathExistence in the world implies time and spaceOne exists within a particular period in a particular space or localityIf one passes beyond time and beyond space it is not possible to speak of existence with reference to such a oneTo speak of both time and space one needs a point of reference egA is years oldThis means years have passed since the event of As birthIf A is not born it is impossible to speak of time or existence with reference to himSimilarly with spaceWithout points of reference it is not possible to grasp spaceThere is a definite distance between any two specific pointsNor can one speak of direction without a point of referenceWhen the notion of I which is the point of personal reference is eradicated one goes beyond time beyond space and beyond causalityTherefore it is not possible to speak of the liberated being as existing or not existingHere we are reminded of a statement made by Fritjof Capra in his Tao of Physics relevant to our present contextHe states Physicists can experience the four dimensional spacetime world through the abstract mathematical formalism of their theories but their visual imagination like everybody elses is limited to the threedimensional world of the sensesOur language and thought patterns have evolved in this threedimensional world and therefore we find it extremely hard to deal with the fourdimensional reality of relativistic physics Thus when the fourdimensional reality too eludes the perceptual experience of the average man how can Nibbana which transcends all these four dimensions come within mere verbal experienceTherefore it is impossible to speak of the arahants state in terms of existence or nonexistenceAt this point an observation can be made from another point of viewBuddhism describes the characteristics of all things in three statements Sabbe sankhaaraa aniccaa sabbe sankhaaraa dukkhaa sabbe dhammaa anattaa meaning all conditioned things are impermanent all conditioned things are unsatisfactory all phenomena are nonselfHere the change of terminology in the last statement seems importantThe Samyutta Commentary explains the last statement as Sabbe dhammaa anattaa ti sabbe catubhuumakaa dhammaaThe Visuddhimagga explains the four bhuumis or planes as kaamaavacara ruupaavacara aruupaavacara and lokuttara meaning the sensual sphere the finematerial sphere the immaterial sphere and the supramundaneTherefore dhammaa in our statement can be interpreted as including the supramundane state of Nibbana as wellCommenting on this statement VenNarada Thera observes Dhammaa can be applied to both conditioned and unconditioned things and statesIt embraces both conditioned and unconditioned things including NibbanaIn order to show that even Nibbana is free from a permanent soul the Buddha used the term dhammaa in the third verseNibbana is a positive supramundane state and is without a soul It is significant that dhammaa was not used in the first two statementsThe purpose seems to be to exclude Nibbana which is permanent and blissfulTherefore we can surmise a condition that is permanent and blissful but it is not a selfThat state is NibbanaIt has to be a dimension completely different from all that is worldlyThe permanence that is conjectured here has no reference to time and space and the bliss that is spoken of has no reference to feelings vedanaaFurther there is a great difference between the death of an ordinary worldling and that of an arahantTo indicate this a different terminology is used maranamiyyati is used for the death of a worldling while parinibbaanaparinibbaayati is used in the case of an arahantIn fact the Dhammapada specifically states that the vigilant ones meaning arahants never dieLet us first see what happens when a worldling diesIt is an accepted fact that everybody fears deathWe also fear the unknown therefore death is doubly fearful because we know least about itIt seems reasonable to assume that at the root of all fear there lurks the fear of deathIn other words we fear everything which directly or indirectly threatens our lifeSo long as our bodies are strong enough we can either fight or run away from the source of fear with the intention of preserving lifeBut when ultimately we are on the deathbed face to face with death and our body is no longer strong enough to flee from death it is highly unlikely that we will mentally accept death with resignationWe will struggle hard long for and crave for life and reach out and grasp a viable base somewhere as the dying body can no longer sustain lifeOnce such a viable base for instance a fertilized ovum in a mothers womb has been grasped the process of becoming or growth starts there which in due course gives rise to birthThis is what is referred to in the twelvelinked paticcasamuppaada as craving conditions grasping grasping conditions becoming becoming conditions birth Thus a worldling dies and is rebornNow let us consider the last moments of an arahantAs an arahant has no fear whatsoever from any source he would not be agitated as he has no craving for lifeHe will watch the process of death with perfect equanimity and crystalclear mindfulnessFurther the Mahaaparinibbaana Sutta which explains the final moments of the Buddha states that the Buddha passed away immediately after rising from the fourth jhaanaThe fourth jhaana is characterized by purity of equanimity and mindfulnessIt is not known whether all arahants attain parinibbaana after the fourth jhaana but certainly they cannot have a deluded deathAs they do not grasp another birth the state they attain after final passing away has to be described as unbornSimilarly it is uncausedAs it is no ordinary death it is called the deathless stateIt is beyond elemental existence beyond brahmalokas neither in this world nor the next beyond the radiance of the sun and moonIt is beyond what we know of in the three worlds of kaama ruupa and aruupaTherefore as it is beyond the ken of ordinary human understanding any attempt to define the state is bound to end in failureThe course of liberated ones cannot be traced like that of birds in the airIn the Gopakamoggallaana Sutta a brahman asks the Venerable AAnanda whether there is a single monk who is completely endowed with all the qualities with which the Buddha is endowedAAnanda replies that there is not a single monk who is so endowedIn this paper an attempt is made to compare the attainments of the Buddha with those of the arahant with a view to ascertain wherein the two differBoth the Buddha and the arahants are recognized as equal as far as the attainment of the final goal of Nibbana is concernedThe principal difference is that the Buddha is the pioneer the discoverer of the undiscovered path while the arahants are followers who tread the path mapped out by the pioneering BuddhaThe Cuulagopaalaka Sutta uses a slightly different allegory it compares the Buddha to a clever cowherd who gets his herd to cross a deep river from a safe fordLater Buddhist texts elucidate the pioneership of the Buddha with lucid descriptions of how he spent incalculable periods of time practising and perfecting the virtues called paaramitaa which gave him the intellectual and emotional maturity to discover the long forgotten path to NibbanaBut it is specifically stated that the Buddha did not preach all that he understood during the process of preparationWhat he preached is compared to a handful of leaves whereas what he understood but refrained from teaching is like the leaves in the forestThe Buddha also maintains that he preached the Dhamma in its entirety without any reservationsWhat is meant by these superficially contradictory statements seems to be that the Buddha taught everything useful and relevant for emancipation but kept strictly aside everything that was useless and irrelevant for that purposeThis position is reiterated in the Canon in a number of suttasThe Buddha clearly defined the scope of his teaching and strictly confined himself to the problem of suffering and its eliminationThe Buddhas standpoint can be illustrated with the help of a simileHe was like a lonely man who was lost in the fearful wilderness of samsaara and earnestly sought a way outAs he had to spend a long time in this vast terrible forest he had to learn a great deal about the forest itselfTo survive he had to learn about edible and poisonous plants and fruits he had to learn the habits and habitats of wild animals he had to climb trees in order to discover in which direction there were signs of a human settlement etcBut at long last when he did discover a straight path leading out of the wilderness he thought quite rightly that it was a waste of time to teach about the ways of the forest to others who are also lost in the wildernessIt is most useful and urgent if he devoted his time and energy to point out the path to other suffering beingsThis is exactly the function of a BuddhaTherefore he refrained from teaching what was irrelevant to emancipationThis clearly shows that the Buddha is far superior to other arahants regarding knowledge about matters not directly related to NibbanaAmong arahants too there are differences in attainmentIn one place the Buddha states that in a group of monks sixty are arahants with the six higher knowledges sixty are arahants with the three clear knowledges another sixty are arahants liberated from both parts while the rest are arahants liberated by wisdomThe highest qualifications among arahants are the six higher knowledges and the four analytical knowledgesThe former comprise psychic powers the divine ear thought reading retrocognition clairvoyance and the knowledge of the destruction of defilementsThe four analytical knowledges comprise insight into the meaning of words truth use of language and originality of ideasThey seem to pivot round the ability to teach the Dhamma through the medium of verbal communication with appealing and meaningful ways of presentationArahants of lesser attainments have only three higher knowledges retrocognition clairvoyance and the knowledge of the destruction of defilementsStill other arahants attain emancipation from both partsThey have gained emancipation from the body by the physical experience and complete mastery of eight deliverances or supernormal states of consciousness and emancipation from the mind through the destruction of defilementsArahants who are released through wisdom have only the knowledge of the destruction of defilementsAs a common denominator all arahants have pannaavimutti also called akuppaa cetovimutti imperturbable mental freedomWhile the highest qualities attainable by an arahant are certainly found in the Buddha the Suttas assign additional qualifications to the Buddha which are not shared by other arahantsThe Mahaasiihanaada Sutta describes ten special powers of the Buddha called tathaagatabalaThey are tabulated below and will be taken up for discussion in comparison with the attainments of arahantsEndowed with these ten powers the Buddha claims a position of supreme eminenceHe is fearless in facing any audience or critic the text metaphorically states that he roars like a lion in assembliesHe exercises supreme authority among human beingsThe ten powers are as followsHe knows realistically a possibility as a possibility and an impossibility as an impossibilityHe knows realistically the causally connected results of all actions whether they belong to the past present or futureHe knows realistically the course of action leading to all states of existenceHe knows realistically all worlds composed of various and diverse elementsHe knows realistically the various spiritual propensities or dispositions of human beingsHe knows realistically the maturity levels of the spiritual faculties of various human beingsHe knows realistically the attainment of superconscious meditational levels such as jhaana vimokkha samaadhi and samaapatti together with the defilements and purities associated with them and the means of rising from these statesHe has retrocognitive powers extending up to several aeons with ability to recall details regarding past existencesHe has clairvoyant powers with the ability to see beings dying and being reborn in high or low states according to their own kammaHe has attained knowledge of the complete destruction of all defilements in this very lifeThese will be taken up for discussion in comparison with the attainments of arahants in reverse order as it seems to be clearer and more convenient to do so The Buddha shares the last of the tathaagatabalas with all other arahants and there seems to be no difference between the Buddha and the arahants in regard to emancipationand Arahants with the triple and sixfold higher knowledge share with the Buddha the retrocognitive and clairvoyant abilitiesBut there seems to be a difference in proficiency and extent of vision the Buddha seems to have unlimited retrocognitive and clairvoyant abilities as he says that he can see as far as he wishes to see The Buddha shares his mastery over superconscious meditational levels with the ubhatobhaagavimutta arahant who can attain the eight deliverances in progressive order regressive order and in both progressive and regressive orders he can attain whatever he wishes whenever he wishes for any length of time he wishes and can also rise from them at willand These are special aspects of thoughtreadingThough arahants with chalabhinnaa are said to have the ability of thoughtreading nowhere is it stated in the Paali Canon that arahants can discern the spiritual propensities and maturity levels of the spiritual faculties of other individualsThis seems to be a special province of the Buddha aloneMuch evidence could be gathered from the Paali Canon in support of this special ability of the BuddhaSeeing the spiritual maturity of Angulimaala Suniita and AAlavaka the Buddha approached them on his own initiativeHe preached to them and they gained lasting spiritual distinctionThere is not a single instance of an arahant approaching a prospective saint with prior knowledge of his spiritual potentialitiesAccording to the Udaana the Buddha saw the spiritual potential of a poor leper named Suppabuddha and preached a sermon which was particularly appealing to himAt the end of the discourse he became a sotaapanna a streamentererAccording to the Cuularaahulovaada Sutta the Buddha saw that Raahula was mature and ready for further instructionHe preached to Raahula about the nature of sense faculties sense data and their interactionAt the end of this discourse it is reported that Raahula attained arahantshipCountless other examples could be cited and These seem to be specialities connected with clairvoyanceThey show that the Buddha possesses a world view far superior to that of the arahantsWith clairvoyance arahants realize only one aspect the truth of kamma which is so helpful for the understanding of mans samsaaric conditionThe Buddhas clairvoyance encompasses knowledge regarding the external world as wellTherefore he knows realistically the worlds with various and diverse elementsPerhaps this means that he has understood the universe comprising gross physical realms such as the human world finematerial realms such as the Brahmaworlds and nonmaterial realms such as the aruupa worldHe also knows the type of action which leads to rebirth in these various worlds and he has understood the perennial laws pertaining to these worldsHis clairvoyant vision reaches so far back that he has recorded in the Mahaapadaana Sutta details regarding the lives of six previous Buddhas much to the admiration of his followersIn fact as mentioned earlier in this essay the Buddhas clairvoyant powers seem limitless This special power of knowing a possibility as a possibility and an impossibility as an impossibility is never mentioned as a knowledge of the arahantThe Buddha may have left the undetermined problems unanswered because he was utterly convinced by this special form of insight that it is not only useless but impossible for unenlightened beings to know the solutions to those problemsBesides the ten tathaagatabalas the Mahaasiihanaada Sutta enumerates four confidences enjoyed by the Buddha aloneHe has the absolute confidence that no human or superhuman being can reasonably accuse him of not being fully enlightened of not being free of all mental defilements of wrongly declaring as dangers things that are not really dangerous of preaching a doctrine which does not lead to the goal it professes to lead toEndowed with this absolute confidence the Buddha claims supreme eminence and authority among gods and men that no arahant could ever claimThe Anguttara Nikaaya enumerates ten powers of the arahant and they all seem to pivot round the practice and realization of the DhammaAn arahant sees all component things as impermanentHe sees all sense pleasures as a pit of burning embersHis mind is inclined towards seclusion and renunciationHe has developed the four stations of mindfulnessHe has developed the fourfold right exertionHe has developed the four bases of psychic powersHe has developed the five spiritual facultiesHe has developed the five spiritual powersHe has developed the seven factors of enlightenmentHe has developed the Noble Eightfold PathEndowed with these powers a monk can claim to have destroyed all mental defilementsWhen compared with the powers and confidences of the Buddha these center round the theme of ones own individual emancipationThe Buddha on the other hand wields far greater powers which can even be called universal with insight into the spiritual potential of other individuals and a world view far superior to that of arahantsIt is appropriate to compare the epithets which normally describe an arahant with those applied to the BuddhaSuttas describe an arahant as khiinaasavo one whose mental defilements are destroyed vusitavaa one who has successfully lived the higher life katakaraniiyo one whose duty is done ohitabhaaro one who has laid the burden aside anuppattasadattho one who has attained the noble goal parikkhiinabhavasamyojano one who has destroyed all bonds leading to further existences and sammadannaavimutto one who has attained emancipation with right knowledge All these epithets describe aspects of the personal emancipation of the arahantThough all these epithets can rightly be applied to the Buddha they are hardly used with reference to him as it is not just his personal emancipation that makes him uniqueThe Buddhas fame spread in terms of nine other epithetsHe is called araham as he is the worthy one who does no evil even in secret sammaasambuddho because he is fully enlightened and selfenlightened vijjaacaranasampanno because he is endowed with knowledge and conduct sugato because he successfully reached the goal as a pioneer lokaviduu because he has understood the universe with its world systems purisadammasaarathii because he is the champion tamer of human beings satthaa devamanussaanam because he is the teacher of gods and men buddho because he has awakened to reality bhagavaa because he is the fortunate one the Blessed One the lordThough a few of these epithets could be attributed to the arahant as well this group of nine epithets collectively expresses the praiseworthy qualities of the Buddha aloneIn their totality they can never be applied to an arahantTo emphasize his superiority the Buddha himself declares that even those monks who are liberated in mind and who have achieved unsurpassed vision unsurpassed practice and unsurpassed liberation still honor respect esteem and worship the BuddhaThe reason is The Blessed One is enlightened and teaches the Dhamma for enlightenment he is tamed and teaches the Dhamma for taming he is at peace and teaches the Dhamma for peace he has attained Nibbana and teaches the Dhamma for attaining NibbanaThe Buddha has sometimes referred to himself as sabbaabhibhuu because he has conquered everything all passionsThough the Buddha acknowledges himself to be sabbaviduu allknowing he has rejected the epithet sabbannuu which also has the same meaningAt the time of the Buddha sabbannuu had a special connotation as Nigantha Naataputta the founder of Jainism also claimed to be sabbannuuNaataputta claimed to have everpresent continuous knowledge of everything all the time whether he was awake or asleepThe Buddha disclaims such everpresent continuous knowledge of everythingIn fact he maintains that no one can ever have knowledge of everything at one and the same timeIt is an impossibilityIt is possible to interpret the allknowing aspect of the Buddhas knowledge in terms of the definition of sabba all everything as given in the Sabba SuttaAccording to this definition everything means the five sense faculties and their corresponding objects plus the mind and the corresponding mental phenomenaIn this sutta the Buddha challenges anybody to give a more comprehensive definition of everything The Buddhas ability to know something was such that he had to direct his attention to the desired object in order to know it as it really isThe Buddha clearly says that he can recollect as far back as he wishes through his retrocognitive knowledge and his clairvoyant abilities are similarly wishboundHe does not have a mirrorlike knowledge or vision where everything is automatically reflectedHere we are reminded of the incident when the Buddha decided to preach the DhammaHe thought of AAlaara Kaalaama first to preach the Dhamma to but he did not know that AAlaara had died a week agoThen he thought of Uddaka Raamaputta only to realize that he too had passed away the previous nightThese episodes clearly show that the Buddha had to direct his attention if he wished to know somethingThese episodes bring us to the interesting question whether it is possible for others to read the mind of the BuddhaWhen the Buddha was disinclined to preach the doctrine Sahampati the great Brahmaa immediately knew this and he came and requested the Buddha to preachAccording to the Brahmasamyutta when the Buddha decided to honor the Dhamma as his teacher because he saw none capable of being his teacher in the whole world of gods and men Brahmaa Sahampati appeared once again and informed him that this was the custom of previous Buddhas too and Buddhas in the future also will do the sameWhen the Buddha thought of choosing AAlaara Kaalaama and Uddaka Raamaputta to be his first disciples gods informed him of their deathThe Khandhasamyutta records another incident when Mahaabrahmaa read the thoughts of the Buddha and appeared before him to plead on behalf of some errant monksAccording to the Mahaaparinibbaana Sutta when the Buddha was going through the jhaanic process in ascending and descending orders just before attaining parinibbaana Anuruddha knew the jhaanic process he was going throughAll these episodes point to the fact that at least certain aspects of the Buddhas mind were accessible to other arahants with thoughtreading ability and certain superhuman beingsAnother episode recorded in the Mahaaparinibbaana Sutta shows that all aspects of the Buddhas mind are not known even to the most eminent arahantsSaariputta once told the Buddha that he was convinced that there has never been there will never be and there is not at present any other recluse or brahman who is more distinguished in enlightenment than the BuddhaThe Buddha then asked Saariputta whether he had read the minds of all past present and future Buddhas and known their virtue to be such and such their concentration to be such and such their wisdom to be such and such their mode of living to be such and such and their emancipation to be such and suchSaariputta replied that he has no such knowledge and that he was only making a reasonable inferenceAll this evidence clearly points to the fact that there is no human or superhuman being not even an arahant who can fully read the mind of the Buddha but of course the Buddha has the ability to read the minds of all others including arahantsThe Paali Canon mentions five types of vision that the Buddha hasThe first is mamsacakkhu the normal human vision consisting of the physical faculty of sightAccording to the Lakkhana Sutta the Buddha possesses a perfect pair of deep blue eyes with long eye lashes because as a human being fulfilling the perfections requisite for Buddhahood he looked at others with pleasant kind eyes honest and uncritical eyesThe second type of vision is dibbacakkhu the divine vision or clairvoyance the most important function of which is the ability to see the passing away and rebirth of beings according to their respective kammaThe third is pannaacakkhu the vision of insight which enabled the Buddha to see things as they really are the impermanent unsatisfactory and nonsubstantial nature of everythingThe fourth is buddhacakkhu the Buddha vision when the Buddha surveyed the world with this vision he saw people with a lesser and a greater degree of defilements people with refined and dull spiritual facultiesThe fifth is samantacakkhu which we venture to translate as panvisionIt is possible to infer that this vision refers to the ability to see a problem or an issue in its entirety as samanta means entire or allroundMoreover Mahaabrahmaa addresses the Buddha as samantacakkhu when he entreats him in allegorical terms to ascend to the top of the Dhamma mansion and behold the suffering mass of humanityThe last two visions are never attributed to arahants and remain the sole province of the BuddhaThe Paali Canon contains interesting material to draw a distinction between the enlightenment experience of the Buddha and that of the arahantThe Chabbisodhana Sutta enumerates several criteria of arahantship which give a clear idea of what the Buddha expected of his disciples who have reached the ultimate goal of realizationThese criteria comprise the unshakeable freedom of the mind from the influence of the senses from hankering after the constituents of personality from craving for elements constituting the world from the yearning for the internal and external sense spheres and from the bias of the notion of I and mine One of the most comprehensive accounts of the enlightenment experience of an arahant is given in the Mahaa Assapura SuttaAccording to this the adept who has attained to the fourth jhaana gains first retrocognition and then clairvoyanceThen he directs his mind to the knowledge of the destruction of defilementsIn this process he gains firsthand knowledge of suffering its cause its elimination and the path leading to its eliminationHe understands what mental defilements are their origin cessation and the path leading to their cessationWhen knowing thus the mind is freed from the defilements of sense pleasures desire for continued existence and ignoranceIn him who is released thus there arises the knowledge of freedom birth is destroyed the higher life has been successfully lived ones duty has been done there is no more of this continued existenceJust as a man standing beside a pool of clear unsullied water would see the shells pebbles and fish in the water the adept would see clearly and directly suffering its cause its cessation and the path leading to its cessationThis could very well be a description of the Buddhas enlightenment experience tooBut scattered in the Paali Canon there are various biographical descriptions of his enlightenment which suggest that the above was only one of its aspectsIt appears that the Buddhas enlightenment was a full multifaceted rich experience that could be explained from various anglesIn the Mahaasaccaka Sutta the Buddha relates that he realized retrocognition during the first watch of the night clairvoyance during the second watch and the knowledge of the destruction of defilements during the third watchTherefore it is clear that enlightenment is not a sudden flash but a gradual unfolding of human potentialities when conditions for it are ripeIt can be compared to the gradual unfolding of petals in the blossoming of a flowerIn the Khandhasamyutta the Buddha says So long as I did not understand the satisfaction the evil consequences and the escape from the five aggregates of grasping so long I did not claim supreme enlightenment The Mahaapadaana Sutta states that the mind attained emancipation from defilements when contemplating the rise and fall of the five aggregates of graspingThus knowledge and vision into the five aggregates is another aspect of the enlightenment experienceAccording to the Vedanaasamyutta the Buddha did not claim enlightenment until he gained full vision into all aspects of feelings what is feeling what is its origin its cessation the path leading to its cessation its satisfaction its evil consequences and escape therefromAs all beings are bound to samsaara because of their attachment to pleasures and pleasures are but pleasurable sensations it is only too logical that one has to have a thorough knowledge of all sensations if one wants to make an end of samsaaraTherefore the Buddhas enlightenment experience comprised a thoroughgoing realization of all aspects of feeling tooThe Salaayatanasamyutta records another aspectAccording to this the Buddha did not claim enlightenment in the world of gods and men so long as he did not realistically understand the six sense faculties and their respective objects according to the satisfaction they yield the evil consequences they entail and the escape therefromAs we are attached to pleasures through the instrumentality of our sense organs in order to gain release we have to understand the nature of the sense faculties sense objects and their interrelationshipIn the Nidaanasamyutta the Buddha says that vision and knowledge arose in him regarding matters not heard of before as he contemplated the paticcasamuppaada paying attention to the causal process giving rise to suffering and the causal process bringing about the cessation of sufferingThe Anguttara Nikaaya explains the gradual deepening of dibbacakkhu clairvoyance as an aspect of the enlightenment experienceThere are eight stages in this process of gradual development extending from preenlightenment days up to the enlightenmentThe Buddha says that so long as he did not understand these eight stages he did not claim enlightenment in the world of gods and menThe most important and the most famous account of the enlightenment experience of the Buddha is recorded in the Vinaya Mahaavagga and this comprises the full comprehension of the Four Noble TruthsAs this statement is of great significance it is recorded below in detailThe Buddha says thatWisdom and knowledge arose in him regarding truths never heard of before and he was able to isolate the problem of the noble truth of suffering he understood that the truth of suffering must be fully comprehended and that the truth of suffering has been fully comprehendedWisdom and knowledge arose in him regarding the cause of suffering he understood that this cause of suffering must be eliminated and that this cause of suffering has been eliminatedWisdom and knowledge arose in him that the cessation of suffering is a possibility he understood that the cessation of suffering must be realized and that the cessation of suffering has been realizedWisdom and knowledge arose in him regarding the path leading to the cessation of suffering he understood that this path must be developed and that this path has been developedThe Buddha says that he did not claim to have attained supreme enlightenment until he realized the Four Noble Truths each according to the threefold ramifications thus the four truths run into twelve detailsThis was such a novel realization that he uses the phrase truths never heard of before with each of the above twelve statementsThe wisdom that arose was so profound that he uses five terms to describe different aspects of this deep spiritual awakening vision arose wisdom arose insight arose knowledge arose and illumination aroseWe are now in a position to compare the enlightenment experience of the arahant with that of the BuddhaThe Mahaa Assapura account cited earlier in this essay which can be regarded as one of the best descriptions of an arahants enlightenment experience seems to fade into insignificance when compared with the rich multifaceted enlightenment experience of the BuddhaNowhere has the Paali Canon attributed insight into the sense faculties sense objects sensations etc as an enlightenment experience of an arahantAs stated in the Chabbisodhana Sutta it is very probable that they realistically understand the nature of sense faculties sense objects elements etc that these phenomena are impermanent unsatisfactory and nonsubstantial but they may not gain insight into the inner workings of these phenomenaThe arahants enlightenment experience is introduced by the phrase yathaabhuutam pajaanaati realistically understands whereas the Buddhas enlightenment experience is expressed as vision arose wisdom arose insight arose knowledge arose illumination arose The Paali Canon never uses this phraseology to refer to the realization of an arahantThe realization of the Four Noble Truths by an arahant is also expressed in terms of realistic understandingBut the Buddhas vision into the Four Truths is described in twelve details consisting of the threefold ramifications with respect to each of the Four TruthsThe simile used in the Mahaa Assapura Sutta to describe the enlightenment experience of the arahant is that of a pond of crystalclear water where a man standing on its bank sees the pebbles shells etc in its bed and shoals of fish swimming in the waterBut the Buddhas enlightenment experience is like the panoramic view one gets from the summit of a mountain and this is exactly the imagery Mahaabrahmaa uses to describe the Buddhas enlightenment experienceWe are not in a position to conjecture whether the various facets of the enlightenment experience of the Buddha had a chronological and a hierarchical order and if so what that order wasIt could also have been an experience like circular vision as when one is at the top of a mountain where the scenery on the east is different from the scenery in the west and the scenery in the north different from that of the southHowever different the sceneries may be from the different directions all the scenes constitute one integrated experience of a person standing on a vantage pointThe scanty evidence gleaned from the Paali Canon seems to favor a combination of both these patterns for the Buddhas enlightenment experienceThe experience has started with a chronological hierarchy as according to the Mahaasaccaka Sutta the higher knowledges of retrocognition clairvoyance and the destruction of defilements were realized during the first second and third watches of the night respectivelyThe other facets of the enlightenment experience may be parts of the spiritual panorama seen in different directions from the vantage point of realityWhatever the pattern may be an arahants enlightenment is a much less significant much less dramatic experience than that of the Buddha which is so profound multifaceted rich and uniqueIn conclusion it can be stated that the Buddha would have realized a far more profound world view than he chose to preach to humanityAs that knowledge was far too complicated for ordinary comprehension and as it was irrelevant for the solution of the human problem of suffering keeping that profound knowledge as the framework within which to work the Buddha would have preached to humanity how best we could order our life in order to achieve harmony and peace in such a worldThis harmony at the highest level is NibbanaThose who followed him lacked the profound world view but learned the practice for the attainment of lasting peace and emancipationThe Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creedsFounded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topicsIts publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddhas discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practiceThese works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first aroseBuddha told this story while journeying through KosalaWhen he came to the village of Nalakapana he stayed near the Nalakapana LakeOne day after bathing in the pool the monks asked the novices to fetch them some canes for needlecasesAfter getting the canes however the monks discovered that rather than having joints like common canes the canes were completely hollowSurprised they went to Buddha and said Venerable Sir we wanted to make needlecases out of these canes but from top to bottom they are quite hollowHow can that beMonks said Buddha this was my doing in days gone by Then he told this story of the pastLong long ago on this spot there was a lake surrounded by a thick forestIn those days the Bodhisatta was born as the king of the monkeysAs large as the fawn of a red deer he was the wise leader of eighty thousand monkeys that lived in that forestHe carefully counseled his followers My friends in this forest there are trees that are poisonous and lakes that are haunted by ogresRemember always to ask me first before eating any fruit you have not eaten before or drinking any water from a source you have not drunk from beforeCertainly the monkeys agreedOne day while roaming the jungle the monkey troop came to an area they had never before visitedThirsty after their days wanderings they searched for water and found this beautiful lakeRemembering their masters warning the monkeys refrained from drinkingThey sat and waited for their leaderWhen he joined them he asked  Well my friends why dont you drinkWe waited for you to comeWell done said the monkey kingThen he walked a full circuit around the lakeHe noticed that all the footprints led down into the water but none came backMy friends he announced you were right not to drink from this lakeIt is undoubtedly haunted by a demonSuddenly the ogre in a hideous guise rose up out of the lake and appeared before themHe had a blue belly a white face and brightred hands and feetWhy are you sitting here he asked the monkeysGo down to the lake and drinkThe monkey king asked him Arent you the ogre of this lakeYes I amHow did you know I was hereI saw the footprints leading down to the water but none returningDo you prey on all those who go down to the waterYes I doFrom small birds to the largest animals I catch everything which has come into my waterI will eat all of you tooOh no ogre said the monkey king we are not going to let you eat usYou must be parchedJust drink the water taunted the monsterAll right ogre we will drink some water but we are not going to fall into your powerHow can you drink water without entering the lakeOgre the monkey king criedWe need not enter your lake at allAll eighty thousand of us can drink through these canes as easily as through a hollow lotus stalkWe will drink and you will not be able to harm usThe monkey king requested that a cane be brought to himThen recollecting the Ten Paramitas he was perfecting he recited them in a solemn asseveration of truth and blew into the caneInstantly the joints disappeared and the whole length of the cane became hollowAfter hollowing several more in the same way the monkey king toured the lakeLet all canes growing here become perfectly hollow throughout he commandedBecause of the great virtues of Bodhisattas their commands are always fulfilledTherefore every single cane that grew around that lake instantly became hollow and has always remained soAt last the monkey king seated himself with a cane in his handsThe other eighty thousand monkeys likewise arranged themselves around the lake each with a caneThey all dipped their canes into the water and drankThey satisfied their thirst but the ogre could not touch a single one of themFrustrated and furious he returned to his home in defeatWhen all had finished the monkey king led his followers back into the forestWhen Buddha had ended his lesson he showed the connection and identified the Birth by saying Devadatta was the waterogre of those days my disciples were the eighty thousand monkeys and I was the monkeyking so fertile in resourcefulnessWhile he was on tour through Magadha Buddha told this story about the extinguishing of a forest fireOne day Buddha went on his morning round for alms through a hamlet in MagadhaAfter finishing his meal he went out again accompanied by a large group of bhikkhusSome monks walked ahead of Buddha and some walked behind himWhile they were on their way a great forest fire broke out raging fiercely and spreading rapidly until the jungle was a roaring wall of flames and smokeThose monks who had not yet made attainments were terrified with the fear of deathLet us set a counter fire so the jungle fire cannot reach us over the ground we have burned they cried and immediately started to kindle a fireWhat are you doing asked the other monksYou are blind to the sun rising in front of your eyesHere you are journeying along with Buddha who is without equal but still you cry Let us make a counter fire You do not know the might of a BuddhaCome with us to the TeacherAll the monks gathered around Buddha who had halted as soon as he had seen the flamesThe blaze whirled and roared as if to devour themSuddenly however when the fire was exactly sixteen lengths from the spot where Buddha stood the flames went out like a torch plunged into water extinguished and completely harmlessThe monks burst into praises of Buddha Oh how great are the virtues of the TeacherEven fire can not singe the spot where Buddha standsIt is no present power of mine Buddha told them that makes the fire go out as soon as it reaches this spotIt is the power of a former Act of Truth of mineNo fire will ever burn this spot during the whole of this world ageThis is one of the miracles which will last until the end of this eraThe Elder Ananda then folded a robe in fourths and laid it down for Buddha to sit onAfter he had taken his seat the monks bowed to him and seated themselves respectfully around himOnly the present is known to us SirThe past is hidden they saidPlease make it clear to us At their request the Buddha told this story of the pastLong long ago in this very spot the Bodhisatta was reborn as a quailEvery day his parents fed him with food which they brought in their beaks since he was still was confined to the nest and unable to forage on his ownThe baby quail did not even have the strength yet to stand on his feet to walk about much less to spread his wings and flyOne day a great jungle fire broke outAs the flames swept through the grass and the forest birds and animals fled for their livesThe air was filled with the shrieking of adult birds flying away from their nestsThe parents of this young bird were as frightened as the others and abandoned their helpless offspring to his fateLying there in the nest the little quail stretched his neck to see what was happeningWhen he saw the flames coming toward him he thought to himself My parents fearing death have fled to save themselves leaving me here completely aloneI am without protector or helperHad I the power to take to my wings I too would fly to safetyIf I could use my legs I would run awayWhat can I doIn this world he thought further there exists the Power of Goodness and the Power of TruthThere are beings who having realized all the Perfections in previous lives have attained enlightenment beneath the Bodhi treeThey have become Buddhas filled with truth compassion mercy and patienceThere is power in the attributes they have wonAlthough I am very young and very weak I can grasp one truth that is the single principle in NatureAs I call to mind the Buddhas of the past and the power of their attributes let me perform an Act of TruthThe little quail concentrated his mind by recalling the power of the Buddhas long since passed away and declared With wings that cannot fly and legs that cannot yet walk forsaken by my parents here I lieBy this truth and by the faith that is in me I call on you O dreadful Fire to turn back harming neither me nor any of the other birdsAt that instant the fire retreated sixteen lengths and went out like a torch plunged in water leaving a circle thirtytwo lengths in diameter around the baby quail perfectly unscathedFrom that time on that very spot has escaped being touched by fire and so it will continue to be throughout this entire eraWhen his life ended the quail who had performed this Act of Truth passed away to fare according to his desertsThus monks said the Master it is not my present power but the efficacy of that Act of Truth performed by me as a young quail that has made the flames spare this spot in the jungleAt the end of his lesson Buddha preached the TruthsSome of the monks who heard attained the First path some the Second some the Third and some became ArahatsThen Buddha showed the connection and identified the Birth by saying My present parents were the parents of those days and I myself the little quail who became king of the quailsBuddha told this story while at Jetavana monastery about a monk who had stopped making effortAsked if it was true that he was a backslider the monk immediately admitted it was soIn bygone days bhikkhu Buddha told him the wise and good won a throne by sheer perseverance in the hour of needThen he told this story of the pastLong long ago when Brahmadatta was reigning in Baranasi the Bodhisatta was reborn to his queenOn the day he was to be named his royal parents gave a feast for eight hundred brahmansAfter the meal they asked the brahmans what their sons destiny would beNoting that the child showed promise of a glorious destiny the soothsayers predicted that the child would become a mighty king endowed with every virtueWinning fame through exploits with his five weapons he would be without equal in all JambudipaBecause of the brahmans prophecy the king and queen named their son Prince FiveWeaponsWhen the prince was sixteen years old the king gave him a thousand pieces of silver and sent him to study with a famous teacher in Takkasila a city in GandharaThe prince studied there for several yearsWhen he had mastered all his subjects the teacher presented him with a set of five weaponsThe prince paid his respects to his master and left Takkasila to return to BaranasiOn his way the prince came to a dense jungleSome men who were camped at the edge of the jungle tried to stop him from going onYoung man they warned do not try to go through that forestIt is the haunt of a formidable ogre named Shaggygrip who kills everyone who enters his territoryConfident of his own strength the prince was undaunted but sure enough in the middle of the jungle the hairy ogre confronted himThe monster made himself as tall as a palmtree with a head as big as a gazebo eyes like mixing bowls two sharp tusks and a hawklike beakHis distended belly was purple and the palms of his hands were blueblackWhere do you think youre going cried the monsterStopYou are mineOgre answered the prince calmly You do not scare meDo not come near me or I will kill you with a poisoned arrowBravely the prince fitted an arrow dipped in deadly poison to his bowHe shot it at the monster but it only stuck to the creatures scruffy coatThe youth shot all fifty of his arrows one after another but they all stuck to the ogres unkempt furShaking himself so that the arrows fell harmlessly at his feet the ogre gave a roar and charged the princeThe young prince shouted defiance drew his sword and struck at the ogre but like the arrows the sword merely got caught in the demons shaggy hairNext the prince hurled his spear but that too lodged in the demons thick peltHe struck the ogre with his club but the club joined the other weapons in sticking to the creatures furThe prince maintained his stance Ogre you have never before heard of meI am Prince FiveWeaponsWhen I entered this forest however I put my trust not in these weapons  bow arrows sword spear and club  but in myselfNow will I give you a blow which will crush you to smithereens The prince hit the demon with his right fist but his hand stuck fast to the hairNext he aimed a blow with his left handHe kicked the ogre with his right foot and with his leftAll he accomplished however was to get himself stuck to the monster with both hands and both feetI will crush you to atoms he shouted as he butted the ogre with his head but that too stuck fastThough completely ensnared by all four limbs and his head hanging helplessly like a doll from the ogres coat the prince remained fearless and undauntedThe monster reflected This is a hero without equal a lion among menHe cannot be an ordinary human beingAlthough he has been captured by an ogre like me he shows no sign of fearIn all the time Ive been killing travelers in this jungle I have never seen anyone like himWhy isnt he afraid of meReluctant to devour the prince the ogre asked How can it be young prince that you have no fear of deathWhy should I be afraidEach life must surely end in deathI know that inside my body there is a diamond sword which not even you can digestIf you eat me this sword will chop your innards into mincemeatMy death will bring about yours Of course the prince was referring to the adamantine Sword of KnowledgeThe ogre pondered on thisThis young prince speaks only the truthSurely I would not be able digest a morsel of such a heroI had better release him Fearful for his own life the demon let the prince go free saying Brave youth I will not eat youGo free to gladden the hearts of your kinsfolk your friends and your countryI am free to go and I will go ogre answered the prince but the sins you committed in a past life have caused you to be reborn as a murderous fiendIf you continue your evil ways you will go from darkness to darknessHaving met me however you have the chance to stop killingTo destroy life is to ensure rebirth in hell as a brute or as a hungry spiritEven if a killers rebirth is as a human it will be miserable and shortThe prince taught the ogre the evil consequences of violating the moral precepts and explained the blessings that follow from observing themHaving converted the monster the prince imbued him with selfdiscipline and established him in the Five PreceptsBefore continuing on his way the prince made the ogre the guardian of that forest with a right to levy dues and charged him to remain steadfastAs he passed through the villages at the forests edge he announced to everyone that the ogre was completely reformedFinally armed with his five weapons the prince returned to the city of Baranasi and was reunited with his parentsWhen he at last became king he was a righteous rulerAfter a life spent in charity and other good works he passed away to fare according to his desertsHis lesson ended Buddha said Without attachments to hamper ones heart victory will be achieved by walking righteouslyBuddha taught the Dhamma progressively until that monk won ArahatshipThen he showed the connection and identified the Birth by saying Angulimala was the ogre of those days and I myself was Prince FiveWeaponsOne day while Buddha was staying at Jetavana a bhikkhu came to him and confessed that he was weakheartedBuddha encouraged him saying Monk in bygone days you won the entire kingdom of Baranasi and presented it to a tiny baby boyYou did it by sheer determinationNow that you have embraced this great discipline leading to liberation how could you possibly lose heart Then he told this story of the pastLong long ago when Brahmadatta was king of Baranasi there was a village of carpenters who earned their livelihood by building housesEvery day they took a boat upriver and went into the forestThere they cut trees and shaped beams and timbers for housesThen they numbered all the pieces to be put together into a frameTaking all the lumber back to the river they loaded it on the boat and returned to townThey were very skillful at their work and earned substantial wagesOne day near their jungle workplace an elephant stepped on a splinter of acacia woodThe splinter pierced the elephants foot which began to swell and fester causing him terrible agonyWhen the elephant heard the carpenters cutting wood he thought Perhaps those carpenters can cure my foot Limping with pain he approached them and lay downAt first the carpenters were very surprised at this but noticing his swollen foot they looked closely and discovered the splinterWith a sharp tool they made an incision around the splinter fastened a string to it and pulled it outThen they lanced the wound cleaned it thoroughly with warm water and wrapped it in clean bandagesIn a short time the elephants foot had healed completelyGrateful to the carpenters for having saved his life the elephant decided to repay them by helping them with their workFrom that time on he pulled up trees and rolled logs for themWhenever the carpenters needed tools he picked them up with his trunk and took them to where they were workingAt lunchtime the carpenters brought food to the elephant so that he didnt have to forageAfter some time the elephant realized that he was getting old and would not be able to continue serving the carpenters much longerOne day he brought his son a magnificent wellbred white elephantHe said to the carpenters This young elephant is my sonSince you saved my life I give him to youFrom now on he will work for you After he had explained all his duties to his son the old elephant returned alone to the forestThe young elephant worked faithfully and obediently the same as his father had doneThe carpenters fed him as they had fed his father and he thrivedAt the end of each work day the elephant bathed in the river before returning to the forestThe carpenters children enjoyed pulling him by the trunk and playing all sorts of games with him both in the water and on the riverbankOf course noble creatures be they elephants horses or men never urinate or defecate in waterThis elephant being noble and pure white was always careful never to do anything of the kind while he was in the riverHe always waited until he came outOne day when it rained very heavily flood waters caught a halfdry cake of the white elephants dung and carried it down riverThis piece of dung floated to Baranasi where it lodged in a bush right at the spot where the kings elephant keepers brought the kings five hundred elephants to batheWhen these beasts caught the scent of the dung of the noble young elephant they refused to enter the waterInstead they extended their tails fanned their ears and ran from the riverWhen the keepers explained what had happened to the elephant trainers the trainers realized that there was something in the waterOrders were given to search the river and the lump of dung was found in the bushThe trainers powdered the dung and mixed it with a little waterThen they sprinkled it over the backs of the other elephantsThis caused the animals to smell very sweet and they immediately went into the water to batheThe trainers were sure the dung had come from a very noble elephantThey reported all this to the king and advised him to capture the elephant for himselfThe king ordered a raft prepared and set off upstreamWhen he reached the place where the carpenters had settled he found the young elephant playing in the waterAs soon as the elephant heard the sound of the kings drums he came out of the water and drew near to the carpentersThey all went together to pay their respects to the kingSire the carpenters said if you wish us to do any work for you you didnt need to come yourselfYou could have sent for it and we would have brought it to youNo my friends the king answeredIve come not for wood but for this elephantHe is yours Sire they replied immediately but the elephant refused to budgeAddressing the elephant directly the king asked What do you want me to doOrder the carpenters paid for what they have spent on me Sire the elephant answeredWillingly friend The king ordered a hundred thousand coins to be piled by the elephants trunk by his tail and beside each foot but this was not enough for the elephant he still refused to goEach of the carpenters was given clothes for himself and his wifeThen the king provided money for all the childrenSatisfied that his friends would be able to manage without his help the elephant bade farewell to the carpenters their wives and the children and departed with the kingThe king took the elephant to his capital which was beautifully decorated to mark the occasionHe led the elephant around the city in a solemn procession and gave him a beautifully furnished stableThe elephant served as the kings comrade and no one else was ever permitted to ride himWith the help of this elephant the king won supremacy over all IndiaAfter some time the Queen Consort became pregnantWhen it was almost time for her to give birth the king diedEveryone realized that if the elephant were to learn of the death of the king his heart would break so he was cared for as usual but not a word was saidAs soon the king of Kosala heard rumors of the kings death however he thought Surely Baranasi is at my mercy and he decided to attack the kingdomMarching at the head of a great army he laid siege to the capitalThe people of Baranasi closed the city gates and sent a message to the king of Kosala The Queen of Baranasi is near the time of her delivery and the astrologers have predicted that she will bear a son in seven daysIf indeed she bears a son we will fight to protect the kingdomPlease grant us seven days The king of Kosala agreed to their termsJust as predicted on the seventh day the baby boy was bornSince he was born to win the hearts of his people the Queen named him Alinacitta which means InspirerOn that day the army emerged to begin fighting the king of KosalaWithout a leader however the soldiers were driven back and began to waverShortly after the battle began messengers went to see the queenOur army is losing ground they reported and we are afraid of defeatThe state elephant our late kings loyal friend has not been told that the king is dead that a prince has just been born and that we are besieged by the king of KosalaShall we tell himYes the time has come answered the QueenShe quickly dressed her baby boy and wrapped him in a fine clothThen she went with all the court to the elephants stableThere she laid the infant at the elephants feet saying Master your comrade the king is dead but we were afraid to tell it to you for fear your heart would breakThis is your kings sonNow the king of Kosala is besieging our city and is making war upon usOur army is losing groundEither kill your son yourself or win back his kingdom for himThe elephant stroked the child with his trunk and gently lifted him up to his own headThen with lamentation for his dead master he took the baby and laid him in his mothers armsThe elephant told the officers to dress him in his armor and to prepare for battleThey unlocked the city gate and escorted him outThe great beast emerged trumpetingHis aweinspiring demeanor so surprised and frightened the invaders that they panicked and fled in retreatDuring the rout the elephant managed to seize the king of Kosala by his topknotHe carried his prisoner to the young prince and dropped him at the babys feetSoldiers sprang to kill the invader but the elephant stopped themBe careful in the future the noble elephant advised the captive kingNever presume to take advantage of us because our Prince is young Then he allowed the king to goAlinacitta was consecrated King at the age of sevenLike his father he ruled all of India and no foe dared rise up against him againHis reign was just and when he came to the end of his life he went to swell the hosts of heavenTo conclude his discourse Buddha observed that any monk strong in will and seeking a refuge in the Triple Gem would prevail as did the determined elephant of yoreAfter Buddha had declared the Truths the weakhearted monk was established in ArahatshipIdentifying the birth Buddha said Queen Mahamaya was then the mother this monk was the elephant who won the kingdom and handed it over to the child Sariputta was the father elephant and I myself was the young princeThe Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creedsFounded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topicsIts publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddhas discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practiceThese works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first aroseOne morning when the ministers and brahmans went to the palace to pay their respects to King Pasenadi the King of Kosala and to inquire whether His Majesty had slept well they found him lying in terror unable to move from his bedHow could I sleep well exclaimed the kingJust before daybreak I dreamed sixteen incredible dreams and I have been lying here terrified ever sinceSince you are my advisors tell me what these dreams meanWhat were your dreams sire the brahmans askedSurely we will be able to judge their importanceAs the king was telling them his dreams the brahmans looked very worried and began wringing their handsWhy are you wringing your hands brahmans asked the kingIs it because of my dreamsYes sireThese are evil dreamsThey are full of perilWhat will come of them asked the kingThey portend one of three calamities sire  great harm to your kingdom to your wealth or to your lifeIs there any remedyThese dreams are powerful and extremely threateningStill we will find a remedy otherwise what is the use of our vast study and learningHow do you propose to avert the evil asked the kingWherever four roads meet we will offer appropriate sacrifices sireMy advisors cried the kingMy life is in your handsHurry and do your best to save meEach of the exultant brahmans had the same thought We are going to make a fortune from these dreamsSoon we will feast on the choicest foodsAs soon as they had left the kings presence they began scurrying about happily giving orders in every directionThey ordered laborers to dig huge sacrificial pitsThey demanded herds of various fourfooted creatures all without blemishThey called for baskets of pure white birds of many kindsAgain and again they discovered something or other lackingMessengers raced back and forth to inform the king of each new requestNoticing all the commotion Queen Mallika went to the king and asked why the brahmans and their servants kept coming to himI envy you said the king sarcasticallyA snake in your ear and you dont even know itWhat does your majesty mean asked the queenI have dreamed such unlucky dreamsThe brahmans tell me they point to disasterThey keep coming here because they are anxious to protect me from the evil by offering sacrificesHas your majesty consulted the Chief Brahman of all the worlds about this asked the queenWho do you mean my dear asked the kingOf course I mean Lord BuddhaHe will surely understand your dreamsGo to Jetavana and ask himA good idea my queen answered the kingI will go at onceWhen the king reached the monastery he paid his respects to the Buddha and sat downWhat brings your majesty here so early in the morning asked the BuddhaJust before daybreak venerable sir I dreamed sixteen terrifying dreamsMy brahmans have warned me that my dreams foretell calamityTo avert the evil they are preparing to sacrifice many animals wherever four roads meetQueen Mallika suggested that I ask you to tell me what these dreams really mean and what will come of themIt is true sire that I alone can explain the significance of your dreams and tell you what will come of themTell me your dreams as they appeared to youI will Blessed One answered the king and he began relating his dreamsIn the first dream I saw four jetblack bulls the king beganThey came together from the four cardinal directions to the royal courtyard with every intention to fightA great crowd of people gathered to see the bullfightThe bulls however only made a show of fighting pawing and bellowingFinally they went off without fighting at allThis was my first dreamWhat will come of itSire that dream will have no result in your lifetime or mineBut in the distant future when kings are stingy when citizens are unrighteous when the world is perverted and when good is waning and evil waxing in those days of the worlds decline no rain will fall from the heavens the monsoons will forget their season the crops will wither and famine will stalk the landAt that time immense clouds will gather from the four quarters of the heavens as if for rainFarmers will rush to bring in the rice they had spread to dry in the sunMen will take their spades and hurry to repair the dikesThe thunder will roar and the lightning will flash from the cloudsHowever just as the bulls in your dream didnt fight these clouds will retreat without giving any rainThis is what shall come of this dreamBut no harm shall come to you from this dream because it applies only to the remote futureThe brahmans only said what they said to get some profit for themselvesNow tell me your second dream sireMy second dream was about tiny trees and shrubs which burst through the soilWhen they were scarcely more than a few inches high they flowered and bore fruitThis was my second dreamWhat will come of itSire said the Buddha this dream will be realized in future days when the world has fallen into decay and when human lives are shortPassions then will be so strong that even very young girls will cohabitate with menDespite their immaturity they will get pregnant and have childrenThe flowers and fruit symbolize their babiesHowever you have nothing to fear from thisTell me your third dreamI saw cows sucking milk from their very own newborn calvesThis was my third dreamWhat can it possibly meanThis dream will come about only when age is no longer respectedIn that future time young people will have no regard for their parents or parentsinlawChildren will handle the family estate themselvesIf it pleases them they will give food and clothing to the old folks but if it doesnt suit them they will withhold their giftsThus the old people destitute and dependent will survive only by the favor and whim of their own children like big cows suckled by dayold calvesHowever you have nothing to fear from thisTell me your fourth dreamMen unyoked a team of strong sturdy oxen and replaced them with young steers too weak to draw the loadThose young steers refused to pullThey stood stockstill so that the wagons didnt move at allThis was my fourth dreamWhat will come of itHere again the dream will not come to pass until the future in the days of wicked kingsIn days to come unjust and parsimonious kings will show no honor to wise leaders skilled in diplomacyThey will not appoint experienced learned judges to the courtsOn the contrary they will honor the very young and foolish and will appoint the most inexperienced and unprincipled to the courtsNaturally these appointees because of their ignorance of statecraft and the law will not be able to bear the burden of their responsibilitiesBecause of their incompetence they will have to throw off the yoke of public officeWhen that happens the aged and wise lords will remember being passed over and even though they are able to cope with all difficulties they will refuse to help saying It is no business of ours since we have become outsiders They will remain aloof and the government will fall to ruinsIt is just like when the young steers not strong enough for the burden were yoked instead of the team of sturdy oxenHowever you have nothing to fear from thisTell me your fifth dreamI saw an incredible horse with a mouth on each side of its head being fed fodder on both sidesThat dreadful horse ate voraciously with both its mouthsThis was my fifth dreamWhat will come of itThis dream will also come true only in the future in the days of unrighteous and irresponsible kings who will appoint covetous men to be judgesThese despicable magistrates blind to virtue and honesty will take bribes from both sides as they sit in the seat of judgmentThey will be doubly corrupt just like the horse that ate fodder with two mouths at onceHowever you have nothing to fear from thisTell me your sixth dreamI saw people holding out a brightly burnished golden bowl which must have been worth a fortuneThey were actually begging an old jackal to urinate in itThen I saw the repulsive beast do just thatThis was my sixth dreamWhat can it meanThis dream too will come to be only in the remote future when immoral kings although from a royal line themselves will mistrust the sons of their old nobility preferring instead the lowestborn of the countryBecause of the kings blindness nobles will decline and the lowborn will rise in rankNaturally the great families will give their daughters to them in marriageThe union of the noble maidens with the ignoble nouveauriche will be like the pissing of the old jackal into the golden bowlHowever you have nothing to fear from thisTell me your seventh dreamI saw a man braiding ropeAs he worked he dropped the finished rope at his feetUnder his bench unknown to him lay a hungry jackal bitch which kept eating the rope as fast as he braided itThis was my seventh dreamWhat shall come of itThis dream also will happen only in far off daysAt that time women will crave men strong drink extravagant clothes jewelry and entertainmentIn their profligacy these women will get drunk with their lovers and carry on shamelesslyThey will neglect their homes and familiesThey will pawn household valuables selling everything for drink and amusements even the seed needed for the next cropJust as the hungry jackal under the bench ate the rope of the ropemaker so these women will squander the savings earned by their husbands laborHowever you have nothing to fear from thisTell me your eighth dreamAt a palace gate there stood a big pitcher full to the brimAround it stood many empty pitchersFrom all directions there came a steady stream of people carrying pots of water which they poured into the already full pitcherThe water from that full pitcher kept overflowing and wastefully soaking into the sandStill the people came and poured more and more water into the overflowing vesselNot a single person even glanced at the empty pitchersThis was my eighth dreamWhat shall come of itThis dream too will not come to pass until the future when the world is in declineThe kingdom will grow weak and its kings will be poorer and more demandingThese kings in their poverty and selfishness will make the whole country work exclusively for themThey will force citizens to neglect their own work and to labor only for the throneFor the kings sake they will plant sugar cane make sugarmills and boil down molassesFor the kings sake they will plant flower gardens and orchards and gather fruitsThey will harvest all the crops and fill the royal storerooms and warehouses to overflowing but they will be unable even to glance at their own empty barns at homeIt will be like filling and overfilling the full pitcher heedless of the needy empty onesHowever you have nothing to fear from thisTell me your ninth dreamI saw a deep pool with sloping banks overgrown with lotusesFrom all directions a wide variety of animals came to drink water from that poolStrangely the deep water in the middle was terribly muddy but the water at the edges where all those thirsty creatures had descended into the pool was unaccountably clear and sparklingThis was my ninth dreamWhat does it meanThis dream too will not come to pass until the future when kings grow increasingly corruptRuling according to their own whim and pleasure they will never make judgments according to what is rightBeing greedy they will grow fat on lucrative bribesNever showing mercy or compassion to their subjects they will be fierce and cruelThese kings will amass wealth by crushing their subjects like stalks of sugar cane in a mill and by taxing them to the last pennyUnable to pay the oppressive taxes the citizens will abandon their villages towns and cities and will flee like refugees to the bordersThe heart of the country will be a wilderness while the remote areas along the borders will teem with peopleThe country will be just like the pool muddy in the middle and clear at the edgesHowever you have nothing to fear from thisTell me your tenth dreamI saw rice boiling in a pot without getting doneBy not getting done I mean that it looked as though the cooking was going on in three distinct stages which were sharply delineated and separate from each otherOne part of the rice was sodden another part was hard and raw and the third part looked like it was perfectly cookedThis was my tenth dreamWhat will come of itThis dream too will not be fulfilled until the futureIn days to come kings will become unrighteous the nobles will follow the kings example and so will the brahmansThe townsmen the merchants and at last even the farmers will be corruptedEventually everyone in the country the sages and even the gods of the land will become immoralEven the winds that blow over the realm of such an unrighteous king will grow cruel and lawlessBecause even the skies and the spirits of the skies over that land will be disturbed they will cause a droughtRain will never fall on the whole kingdom at onceIt may rain in the upper districts but in the lower it will notIn one place a heavy downpour will damage the crops while in another area the crops will wither from droughtThe crops sown within a single kingdom  like the rice in the one pot  shall have no uniform characterHowever you have nothing to fear from thisTell me your eleventh dreamI saw rancid buttermilk being bartered for precious sandalwood worth a fortune in goldThis was my eleventh dreamWhat shall come of itThis will happen only in the distant future when my teaching is waningIn those days there will be many greedy shameless bhikkhus who for the sake of their bellies dare to preach the very words in which I have warned against greedBecause they desert the Truth to gratify their stomachs and because they sided with sectarians their preaching will not lead to NibbanaTheir only thought as they preach will be to use fine words and sweet voices to induce lay believers to give them costly robes delicate food and every comfortOthers will seat themselves beside the highways at busy street corners or at the doors of kings palaces where they will stoop to preach for money even for a pittanceThus these monks will barter away for food for robes or for coins my teaching which leads to liberation from sufferingThey will be like those who exchanged precious sandalwood worth a fortune in pure gold for rancid buttermilkHowever you have nothing to fear from thisTell me your twelfth dreamI saw dried gourds sinking in the waterWhat shall come of itThis dream also will not have its fulfillment until the future in the days of unjust kings when the world is pervertedIn those days kings will favor the lowborn not the sons of nobilityThe lowborn will become great lords while the nobles will sink into povertyIn the kings court and in the courts of justice the words of the lowborn alone will be recognized so that they like the dried gourds will be firmly establishedIn the assemblies of monks it will be the sameWhenever there are enquiries about proper behavior rules of conduct or discipline only the counsel of wicked corrupt monks will be consideredThe advice of modest monks will be ignoredIt will be as when the empty pumpkins sankHowever you have nothing to fear from thisTell me your thirteenth dreamThen the king said I saw huge blocks of solid rock as big as houses floating like dried gourds upon the watersWhat shall come of itThis dream also will not come to pass until those times of which I have spokenAt that time unrighteous kings will show honor to the lowborn who will become great lords while the true nobles will fade into obscurityThe nobles will receive no respect while the ignorant upstarts will be granted all honorsIn the kings court and in the law courts the words of the nobles learned in the law will drift idly by like those solid rocksThey will not penetrate deep into the hearts of menWhen the wise speak the ignorant will merely laugh them to scorn saying What is it these fellows are saying In the assemblies of monks as well people will not respect the excellent monksTheir words will not sink deep but will drift idly by the same as the rocks floating on the waterHowever you have nothing to fear from thisTell me your fourteenth dreamI saw tiny frogs no bigger than miniature flowerets swiftly pursuing huge black snakes and devouring themWhat can this meanThis dream too will not have its fulfillment until those future days of which I have already spoken when the world is decliningAt that time mens passions will be so strong that husbands will be thoroughly infatuated with their childish wivesMen will lose all judgment and selfrespectBeing completely smitten they will place their infantile wives in charge of everything  servants livestock granaries gold and silver everything in the houseShould the overfond husband presume to ask for some money or for a favorite robe he will be told to mind his own business and not to be so inquisitive about property in her houseThese abusive young wives will exercise their power over their husbands as if the men were slavesIt will be like the tiny frogs which gobbled up the big black snakesHowever you have nothing to fear from thisTell me your fifteenth dreamI saw a village crow a vile creature with all the ten vices attended by an entourage of Mandarin ducks beautiful birds with feathers of golden sheenWhat shall come of itThis dream too will not come to pass until the far distant future in the reign of weakling kingsThen there will be kings who know nothing about rulingThey will be cowards and foolsFearing revolt and revolution they will elevate their footmen bathattendants and barbers to nobilityThese kings will ignore the real nobilityCut off from royal favor and unable to support themselves bona fide nobles will be reduced to dancing attendance on the upstarts as when the crow had regal Mandarin ducks for his retinueHowever you have nothing to fear from thisTell me your sixteenth dreamI saw goats chasing wolves and eating themAt the sight of goats in the distance the wolves fled terrorstricken quaking with fear to hide in thicketsSuch was my dreamWhat will come of itThis dream too will not have its fulfillment until the reign of immoral kingsThe lowborn will be raised to important posts and will become royal favoritesTrue nobles will sink into obscurity and distressGaining power in the law courts because of the kings favors the parvenu will claim the ancestral estates of the impoverished old nobility demanding their titles and all their propertyWhen the real nobles plead their rights in court the kings minions will have them beaten and tortured then taken by the throat and thrown out with words of scornThat will teach you to know your place fools they will shoutHow dare you dispute with usThe king shall hear of your insolence and we will have your hands and feet chopped off At this the terrified nobles will agree that black is white and that their own estates belong to the lowly upstartsThey will then hurry home and cower in an agony of fearLikewise at that time evil monks will harass good worthy monks until the worthy ones flee from the monasteries to the jungleThis oppression of true nobles by the lowborn and of good monks by the evil monks will be like the intimidation of wolves by goatsHowever you have nothing to fear from thisThis dream refers to the future onlyWhen he had thus reassured the king the Buddha added It was neither truth nor love for you that prompted the brahmans to prophesy as they didIt was pure greed and selfishness that led them to prescribe sacrificesThus the Buddha explained the meaning of the sixteen dreamsThen he said Nor are you the first to have had these dreamsThey were dreamed by kings of bygone days as wellThen as now brahmans found in them a pretext for sacrificesAt the kings request the Buddha told this story of the pastLong long ago when Brahmadatta was reigning in Baranasi the Bodhisatta was born into a brahman family in the North countryWhen he grew up he renounced the world and became a hermitHaving attained a high level of meditation he acquired supernatural powersOne day King Brahmadatta dreamed sixteen mysterious dreams and asked his advisors about themThe brahmans explained that the dreams foretold evil and began preparing great sacrificesSeeing this one of the pupils of the chief brahman a young man of considerable learning and wisdom approached his teacher and said Master you have taught me the Three VedasDont the texts say that it is never a good thing to take lifeMy dear boy answered the teacher this means money to us  a great deal of moneyWhy are you anxious to spare the kings treasuryDo as you will Master replied the young manI will no longer stay here with you With those words he left the palace and went to the royal gardensThat same morning the Bodhisatta had thought to himself If I visit the kings garden today I will save a great number of creatures from deathThe young brahman found the ascetic radiant as a golden image sitting on the kings ceremonial stone seat in the gardenHe sat down in an appropriate place paid respect to the hermit and entered into pleasant conversation with himThe hermit asked the young man if he thought the king ruled righteouslySir he answered the king himself is righteous but the brahmans are leading him astrayThe king consulted with them about sixteen dreams he had and the brahmans jumped at the opportunity for sacrificesVenerable sir how good it would be for you to explain to the king the real meaning of his dreamsYour explanation will save many animals from cruel deathI do not know the king nor does he know meIf he comes here and asks me however I will tell himPlease wait here sirI will bring the king said the young brahmanHe hurried to the king and told him there was a wondrous ascetic who would interpret the dreamsHe asked the king to visit the ascetic and talk with himThe king immediately agreed and went to the garden with his retinuePaying his respects to the ascetic he sat down and asked if the ascetic could tell him what would come of his dreamsCertainly sire he answeredLet me hear the dreams as you dreamed themThe king proceeded to tell the dreams exactly as King Pasenadi told them to the BuddhaEnough said the BodhisattaYou have nothing to fear from any of these dreamsHaving reassured the king and having freed a great number of creatures from death the hermit poised in midair taught the king how to observe the Five Precepts and concluded by saying From this time on sire do not join the brahmans in slaughtering animals for sacrificeRemaining firm in the teaching he had heard and spending the rest of his days in almsgiving and other good works the king passed away to fare according to his desertsHis lesson ended the Buddha said Sire you too have nothing to fear from these dreamsStop the sacrifice Then the Buddha identified the Birth by saying Ananda was the king of those days Sariputta was the young brahman and I was the asceticDuring a stay in Veluvana the Buddha heard that Devadatta intended to kill himMonks this is not the first time that Devadatta has tried to kill me he tried before and failed Then he told them this story of the pastLong long ago when Brahmadatta was reigning in Baranasi in a village not far from the capital the Bodhisatta was born as the son of a householderWhen he became a young man he married a wellbred young lady from BaranasiShe was a fair and graceful maiden named SujataShe became a virtuous wife faithfully serving her husband and his parentsThe young man loved his wife very much and the two of them lived together in joy harmony and oneness of mindOne day Sujata said to her husband I would like to see my mother and father again after such a long timeVery well my dear he replied Please prepare food for us for the journeyThey loaded a cart with provisions and giftsHe sat in front to drive and she sat behindAs soon as they reached the outskirts of Baranasi they stopped to rest and he unyoked the oxenAfter they had washed and eaten their meal Sujata changed her clothes and adorned herselfQuite refreshed her husband yoked the oxen again and climbed up into the drivers seatSujata sat down again in the back and they resumed their journeyAs they entered the city Sujata stepped down from the cart and walked behind itThe king of Baranasi happened to be passing in procession on the back of his splendid royal elephant and saw herHe was so attracted by her beauty that he ordered one of his men to go and find out whether or not she had a husbandI am told she has a husband sire the servant reportedDo you see that man driving the cartThat is her husbandThe king could not control his passionI will get rid of that fellow he thought and take the wife for myself A vicious plan began forming in his mind and he called his servant againTake this ornament he said to the servant handing him a beautiful jeweled crest and walk past that mans wagonAs you pass by casually drop the jewel into the wagon without letting anyone see what you are doingAs soon as you have done it report back to me The servant did exactly as he was toldI have lost a jeweled crest cried the kingShut all the gatesCatch the thief The news spread rapidly and the city was soon in an uproarThe servant immediately set out with soldiers and accosted Sujatas husbandHey you he shoutedStop that cartThe king has lost a jewel and we must search your wagon Of course he quickly found the jeweled crest which he himself had put there a few minutes beforeThief he cried grabbing hold of the young manThe soldiers immediately seized him and beat himThey tied his arms behind his back and dragged him before the kingHeres the thief who stole your jewel they criedOff with his head the king commanded excitedlyThe soldiers led the young man away striking him with whips at every corner until they reached the south gateSujata ran after him stretching out her arms and wailing Dearest husband it is I who got you into this wretched predicamentJust outside the city the kings servants threw him down and prepared to cut off his headWhen she saw her beloved husband about to be executed Sujata reflected on her own virtue and cried No gods are hereThey must be far awayThere can be no gods here or they would stop these cruel men from slaying my innocent husbandWhile the virtuous Sujata reproached the heavens in this way Sakka king of the gods noticed that his throne was growing hotWho is trying to make me fall from my position he wonderedHe immediately became aware of what was happeningAh he thought The king of Baranasi is doing a very evil deedHe is making the worthy Sujata sufferI must go there at onceSwiftly descending from his heaven Sakka plucked the wicked king from the royal elephant and laid him down on the execution groundIn the same instant he snatched Sujatas husband from the execution place dressed him in the kings robes and set him on the back of the kings elephantThe executioner lifted his axe and cut off a head  but it was the kings head and as soon as the blow was struck everyone realized it was the kingsThen Sakka appeared to the crowd stood in front of the young man and consecrated him as king with Sujata his queenAll the courtiers brahmans householders and other citizens rejoicedThe unjust king is dead they criedSakka himself has given us a righteous kingSakka stood poised in the air and declared This upright king shall rule you virtuouslyBecause he was unrighteous the evil king was slainIf a king is immoral the gods send rain out of season and in season there is no rainIf the king is evil three great fears torment men  fear of famine fear of pestilence and fear of the swordThis righteous king has been sent to you from heaven Having thus admonished the people Sakka returned to his divine abodeThe just king reigned wisely and in due time went to swell the hosts of heavenAt the end of this discourse the Buddha identified the Birth At that time Devadatta was the wicked king Anuruddha was Sakka Rahulas mother was Sujata and I myself was the king proclaimed by SakkaWhile staying in Jetavana the Buddha told this story about the bhikkhu Upananda the SakyanUpananda had forsaken the virtues of contentment and had become extremely greedyAt the beginning of the rains retreat he tried two or three monasteries leaving an umbrella or a shoe at one and a water pot or a walking stick at another but actually staying at yet anotherAs he began the retreat in a rural monastery he exhorted his fellow bhikkhus as if he were making the moon rise in the sky saying Bhikkhus must live contentedly He praised contentment with bare necessities and expounded on the nobility of having few wantsSwayed by his eloquence the other bhikkhus threw away their fine robes and vessels and began wearing robes of rags and using rough clay potsUpananda collected all the choice items and kept them in his own lodgingWhen the rains retreat was over he filled a cart and set out for JetavanaOn the way he came to a forest monasteryHe stopped behind the monastery and wrapped his feet with creepersSaying to himself Surely theres something to be gotten here he entered the monasteryHe found two old bhikkhus who had spent the retreat there and had received two coarse cloaks and one fine blanketThe two were pleased to see UpanandaSir they said we cannot divide these thingsWe are having an argument about them and would be very grateful if you would divide them between usUpananda quickly agreedHe gave a coarse robe to each of them and took the blanket for himselfThis falls to me for knowing the rules of discipline he said and went awayThose elders who loved the blanket went with him to Jetavana and explained the matter to the senior monks who knew the rulesIs it right they asked for those who know the rules to take so much away from us in this wayWhen the bhikkhus saw the pile of robes and bowls which Upananda had brought they said Sir you must have great merit to have gained so much food and so many robesSirs he protested where is my merit Then he proceeded to tell them exactly how he had gained everythingIn the Hall of Truth the bhikkhus said to each other Upananda the Sakyan is very covetous and greedyWhen the Buddha heard about it he said Bhikkhus Upanandas deeds are not suited for progressA bhikkhu should act suitably himself before he preaches to others about progressAs for Upananda he added this is not the first time that he has been covetousIn the past too he plundered others property in the same way Then he told this storyLong long ago when Brahmadatta was reigning in Baranasi there was a jackal named Mayavi who had taken a mate and lived near a riverbankOne day his wife said to him Husband I suddenly feel a very strong craving for fresh redfishAll right my dear he saidJust wait and Ill bring you some Then he went to the river wrapped his feet in creepers and crept along the bankNot far from that place two otters named Gambhiracari and Anutiracari were standing on the bank looking for fishAt that moment Gambhiracari saw a great redfishHe jumped into the water and grabbed it by the tailThe fish was strong and swam away dragging the otter with himGambhiracari called to his friend QuickCome and help me AnutiracariThis enormous fish will be enough for both of usRushing to help him Anutiracari shouted How lucky you are GambhiracariAnd strong tooHold the fish as tight as you can and like a garuda lifting a snake Ill snatch him from the waterThen the two together hauled and pushed the redfish onto the riverbank laid him down and killed himYou have caught a great fish Anutiracari saidPlease divide itNo protested GambhiracariI could not have caught it without your helpYou must divide itIn this way the two of them quarreled both refusing to divide the fishAt last they sat down with the fish lying in front of themAs soon as they had sat down the jackal emerged from his hiding place and approached themThe otters saluted him and said Welcome friendPlease help usTogether we have caught this redfish but we cannot decide how to divide it between usPlease cut it fairly and give us each an equal partCertainly the jackal answeredI have settled many cases such as this and I have always acted fairly maintaining peace and friendship between the partiesThen as cleanly as if he had a butchers knife he bit the fish into three piecesAnutiracari take the tail he saidAnd you Gambhiracari keep the headEat your shares without quarrelingThe middle part will be my payment for settling your dispute In a flash he grabbed the plump middle portion of the fish and ran offThe two otters sat stunned as though they had lost a purse of a thousand pieces of silverWhat fools we are they criedIf we had not argued over this fish it would have been enough for a delicious feast for us bothBut now the jackal has taken the fish and left us with no more than the bony head and tailThe jackal was very proud of himself as he carried the redfish to his wifeWhen she saw him coming she saluted him and cried My lord how happy I am to see you with such a prizeYou are like a king who has just conquered a neighboring kingdomHow did you manage to catch this fishYou cant swimMayavi placed the fish before his wife and explained Strife causes weakness and decayBecause of strife the otters lost their prize and I Mayavi brought it home to youA treespirit dwelling nearby who had observed all this added So it is among men as wellWhen strife arises and men seek an arbiter the arbiter gains the upper handThey lose their wealth but the king grows richer stillAfter the lesson the Buddha explained At that time the jackal was Upananda the otters were the two old monks and I myself was the treespirit who witnessed the sceneThe Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creedsFounded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topicsIts publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddhas discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practiceThese works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first aroseThe Bhaddekaratta Sutta of the Majjhima Nikaaya consists of a summary in four verses and an exposition dealing with some doctrinal points of considerable psychological and ethical importThe theme set out by the Buddha in this discourse recurs in three others  AAnandabhaddekaratta Sutta Mahaakaccaanabhaddekaratta Sutta and Lomasakangiyabhaddekaratta Sutta  in which the disciples of these names figure prominentlyThese four consecutive suttas are thus made conspicuous among the discourses of the Majjhima Nikaaya and one can well infer that this bespeaks of the importance attached to their themeThat the theme was highly esteemed is clearly revealed by the framework of the two suttas Mahaakaccaanabhaddekaratta and LomasakangiyabhaddekarattaIn both one finds a deity appearing before a monk and recommending to him the learning of the summary and exposition of the Bhaddekaratta as followsMonk you learn the summary and exposition of the BhaddekarattaMonk you master the summary and exposition of the BhaddekarattaMonk you bear in mind the summary and exposition of the BhaddekarattaMonk the summary and exposition of the Bhaddekaratta is beneficial it pertains to the elements of the Holy LifeAlthough the theme of these four discourses was thus held in high esteem there is unfortunately a formidable obstacle to a proper appreciation of its significanceThe title Bhaddekaratta which is also the main keyword remains more or less a puzzleIn none of the four suttas is the word commented upon despite the fact that the venerables AAnanda and Mahaakaccaana also contribute to the exposition of the themeThis is probably because the early disciples were already familiar with the expression as suchEven the two monks Samiddhi and Lomasakangiya who confessed their ignorance of the summary and exposition of the Bhaddekaratta when questioned by the deities have not thought it fit to get this puzzling word clarified for us when they later went to the Buddha for instruction on the subjectIn the commentaries there is an attempt to explain the meaning of bhaddekaratta but some scholars have questioned the validity of the interpretation given in themWhat these interpretations are and on what grounds they are found to be inadequate can be gleaned from the following comments by IBHorner and the venerable aanamoliSuttas  all have the term bhaddekaratta as part of their title and this presents something of a puzzleMA vattempts an explanation of this word by saying vipassanaanuyogasamannaagatattaa bhaddakassa ekarattasa of one who is happy for one night because he is possessed of intentness of insight Neumann renders the term by Glcksaligeinsam lonely blissfulnessBut ekatta is loneliness ekaratta usually means for one night But the Bhaddekaratta suttas do not appear to envisage withdrawal from thoughts of the past future and present for so little as one nightOn the contrary the verses that form the maatikaa say that the person to be called bhaddekaratta is he who abides ardently and unweariedly day and night that is surely for some consecutive time lasting longer than one night I thought it best to translate only the first part of the baffling compound and have rendered bhadda by auspicious not in its sense of betokening success but in that of prosperous prosperingFor the sage who comes to be at peace has prospered by not following after the past by not desiring the future to be such or so and by cultivating a right attitude to present thingsHis position is not due to luck a happy chance or fortunes favors it is due to his own successful efforts determined resolution and shunning of indolence IBHorner Middle Length Sayings III Introduction ppxxvixxviiThere are four consecutive suttas in the Majjhima Nikaaya with the name Bhaddekaratta each based on the same verseThis term has elsewhere been translated by true saint and like phrases which however quite miss the pointThe commentary says only this Bhaddekarattassa means of one who is fortunate in having one attachment  this is because of his possessing application to insight The subcommentary resolves the compound ekaratta into ekaa ratti and says only that bhaddekaratta means one who has a fortunate single attachment it is a term for a person who is cultivating insight The Mahaa Niddesa alludes to these suttas without throwing any light on themThere appears to be no other mention of the term elsewhere in the Canon and its commentariesThe Paali word ratta or ratti in this instance is from the root rajSo the bhaddekaratta appears as one who is applying himself invincibly unshakably to know and to study the present state as it occursThis application or attachment is auspicious or fortunate because it leads to liberationThe much more common meaning of the Paali word ratti is nightBut if we attempt to interpret the term bhaddekaratta as one who has a single auspicious night and the commentarial passages accordingly it is hard to make satisfactory sense of the contextIt might be supposed that the expression bhaddekaratta was a popular phrase taken over by the Buddha and given a special sense by him as was not infrequently done but there seems no reason to do so and there is no evidence for it in this caseIt is more likely to be a term coined by the Buddha himself to describe a certain aspect of developmentSuch terms are ukkhittapaligha ditthippatta and many more Venerable aanamoli Translation of the Majjhima Nikaaya It is not clear precisely what bhaddekaratta meansNettiA says Evam patipannaattaa bhaddo ekaratto assaati bhaddekarattaMAA adds Ekaaratti ekaratto bhaddo ekaratto etassaati bhaddekarattam vipassanam paribruuhento puggalo etenaaha vipassanaanuyogasamannaagatattaa tam uddissa pavattiyaa pana bhaddekarattasahacaranato bhaddekaratto tenaaha bhagavaa Bhaddekarattassa vo bhikkhave uddesanca vibhanganca desissaami tiNettiTiikaa offers nothingThe only other mention referring to these four suttas is at Nd namely bhaddekarattavihaaram in an explanation of jaagariyaanuyogapariyanto The NdA has nothing enlighteningAll these comments seem to take the ratt element as representing ratti and so the literal translation would then be one who has an auspicious one night and the Burmese transcript of the Majjhima Nikaaya gives the same sense to bhaddekaratta as to ahorattam two lines higherBut these explanations are all grammatical and avoid the meaningThe term might  it has been suggested but this is entirely speculative  have been a popular one for say the Hindu Sivoraatri which was purposely given a new sense here by the Buddha as he did with many other current termsAn alternative derivation might be that ratt stands for ratto or ratti from Vranj to desire to lust cfdhammaraaga or tathaagatoranjita of the profitable craving and profitable conceit though there is apparently no example of raatti from this root in PaaliThis interpretation has been adopted in the translation here as more trenchant though neither seems quite safe and the meaning remains unsettled Venerable aanamoli The Guide pp fnThe Theranaamo Sutta of the Samyutta Nikaaya gives the case of a monk who was a lonedweller and who also recommended the same mode of living to othersAs the title of the sutta suggests he was known to his fellow monks simply as the Elder Whether this was in deference to his love of anonymity or whether it had any pejorative associations for the more sociable of his fellow monks we do not knowNevertheless we seem to get a caricature of his character in the following sentences of the suttaTena kho pana samayena annataro bhikkhu Theranaamako ekavihaarii ceva hoti ekavihaarassa ca vannavaadiiSo eko gaamapindaaya pavisati eko patikkamati eko raho nisiidati eko cankamam adhitthaatiAt that time a certain monk called The Elder was a lonedweller and he also spoke in praise of lonedwellingAlone he enters the village for alms alone he returns alone he sits in seclusion alone he paces up and downSome of his fellow monks who might have thought his behavior to be rather peculiar report about him to the BuddhaThe Buddha summons the Thera who thereupon confirms that report about his partiality for lonedwellingWhen questioned as to how exactly he upholds the precept and practice of lonedwelling he explains to the Buddha his daily routine after the manner given aboveHere Lord alone I enter the village for alms alone I return alone I sit in seclusion and alone I pace up and downIt is thus Lord that I am a lonedweller and an exponent of lonedwellingThe Buddhas remarks in this instance were neither those of condemnation nor of unqualified praiseHe says There is Thera this type of lonedwelling I do not deny itBut Thera I shall tell you the manner in which lonedwelling is fulfilled in all its detailsListen attentively to it And then he goes on to explain it in the following wordsIdha Thera yam atitam tam pahiinam yam anaagatam patinissattinamPaccuppannesu ca attabhaavapatilaabhesu chandaraago suppativiniitoEvam kho Thera ekavihaaro vitthaarena paripunno hotiHerein Elder whatever is past that is abandonedWhatever is yettocome that is relinquishedAnd the desireandlust for the present modes of personality is well under controlIt is thus Elder that lonedwelling becomes fulfilled in all its detailsIn order to make it clear that the ideal lonedweller who fully conforms to the above requirements is the arahant himself the Buddha sums up his discourse with this verseNow this ideal of lonedwelling as set out in the Theranaama Sutta seems to find an echo in the verses which make up the summary of the Bhaddekaratta SuttaOne can compare the Buddhas definition of the perfect lonedweller in the former sutta with the following lines occurring in the latterWe saw above how the Theranaamo Sutta expounds the true ideal of solitude as against the popular and commonplace concept of solitudeThe true ideal is depicted as a solitude of mind gained by giving up everything belonging to the past and the future and by disciplining well the desireandlust for ones present modes of personalityThe concluding verse makes it clear that the ideal lonedweller is unsoiled as to all phenomena and is well released renouncing all This reminds us of the term upadhiviveka denoting Nibbaana which is the highest mental solitude to which all attempts at physical solitude should be properly harnessedAs for this latter the popular conception is always one of dwelling alone all by oneselfIt conjures up in the ascetic mind the prospect of peace in being away from the maddingcrowd No doubt this physical solitude is often upheld by the Buddha as an essential prerequisite for detachmentThus at the end of one of the most forceful perorations in favor of this type of solitude he confesses to his attendant the venerable Naagita with remarkable candor that he is quite at ease even in answering calls of nature when he sees none in front of or behind him while journeying all aloneYasmaaham Naagita samaye addhaanamagga patipanno na kanci passaami purato vaa pacchato vaa phaasu me Naagita tasmim samaye hoti antamaso uccaarapassaavakammaayaati and we find in the Theragaathaa a similar expression of the ease of solitude in the words of Ekavihaariya TheraWhen there is none to be seen in front or behind one is greatly at ease as one dwells in the forest all aloneJust as much as the physical solitude is associated with the satisfaction of not seeing anyone before or behind oneself the mental solitude too is characterized by the absence of anxious glances forward or backwardHaving abandoned everything past one does not trace back or relive the pastHaving given up what pertains to the future one is no longer anxious about the futureThis concept of the past and future brings spatial and temporal modes of thinking much closer to each other  the before and the behind of physical solitude and the past and the future of mental solitudeHowever the freedom from these two distracting elements in itself does not constitute the perfect ease that is the ideal of solitudeThere is also a third element of distraction to be eliminatedOne has to be carefree whether the solitude aimed at is physical or mentalHence any deep attachment to ones belongings  be they material or mental  is the third element of distractionHaving brought under complete control the desireandlust regarding ones present modes of personality one discerns what is present with penetrative insight as impermanent sorrowfraught and not ones ownThe two suttas Theranaamo and Bhaddekaratta thus concur with each other in pointing to a concept of solitude far transcending its popular connotationsNor are they without parallel in other portions of the Paali canon the following being a few of themA comparative study of the two suttas in question would make it abundantly clear that both deal with the same themeBut how are we to bring into proper alignment the baffling compound  bhaddekarattaIn the context of our discussion of the subject of solitude the most outstanding element of this compound appears to be the middle word ekaOwing to the rather generic character of the word its significance has often been underestimated  hence the tendency to treat bhaddekaratta as an elliptical expressionThe word eka was more or less regarded as a blank check by some scholars and resort was had to companion words like night or attachmenttosolitude in order to give it its full valueBut it may be pointed out that the word eka enjoyed a privileged position in the terminology of the Paali canon as a symbol of great significance for those of an ascetic temperamentIt bore little ambiguity for them as it had all the connotations that go with the ascetic idealization of solitudeFor them apparently there was no monotony in the word eka and hence we find it ringing through the Khaggavisaana Sutta in the refrain eko care khaggavisaanakappoThe Muni Sutta too uses the word in connection with this faringalone ekam carantam munim appamattamIt also occurs as many as six times in the verses of the venerable EkavihaariyaTo be alone without a second in the depth of the forest was the longing of his heart and for this he had won the approbation of the Buddha in the following verseThe semantic difficulties in connection with the word eka having been surmounted we may now pass on to a discussion of its relation to the following word rattaThe expression ekaratta was traditionally interpreted to mean one night due to a rather superficial connection with the compound ahorattam as has been pointed out by the Venerable aanamoliEnough has been said by him and by IBHorner to show that there is little justification for such an interpretationVenerable aanamoli rightly suggests as an alternative that ratta might be a derivation from Vranj  to desire to lust to get attachedHis hesitation to follow up the full implications of his hypothesis might have been due to the difficulties he encountered in regard to the word ekaNow that this word has revealed its significance we can proceed to appreciate the clues he had given at their full valueThe loveofsolitude was reckoned a type of profitable craving  if one may use that expression prudentlyFor instance we get an express sanction for such an attachment or delight in the Naalaka SuttaEkaasanassa sikkhetha  samanupaasanassa ca ekattam monamakkhaatam  eko ce abhiramissati atha bhaasiti dasa disaaLet one train oneself in sitting alone and in the resort proper to a recluseOneness is called sageship and if you will delight in being alone then you will illuminate the ten quartersOr again we find in the Saariputta Sutta the word rati used in the qualified sense referred to above in connection with the Buddhas love of solitude and renunciationAll this evidence would go to show that ekaratto in bhaddekaratto meant the one attached to solitude in other words the lover of solitude We are now left with the adjective bhaddaAs already mentioned in the discussion of the Theranaamo Sutta mere being alone physically is not the beall of the concept of solitude advocated by the BuddhaIt may be recalled that he was reserved in his remarks on the Theras description of his daily routine and that he proceeded to teach him the manner in which lonedwelling is perfected in all its detailOne can also compare in this respect the Migajaala Sutta where he defines the two terms ekavihaari and sadutiyavihaariiThere are Migajaala forms cognizable by the eye desirable pleasant agreeable delightful connected with sensepleasures and alluringSupposing a monk delights in them asserts them clings to them then even as he delights in asserts and clings to them there arises delightWhen there is delight he is lustful and when he is lustful there is bondageA monk who is fettered by the fetter of delight Migajaala is called OnewhodwellswithasecondHaving made a similar pronouncement in respect of the objects of the other senses he sums up in the following wordsA monk thus dwelling Migajaala even though he may resort to remote lodgings in the forest where there is little sound little noise which are deserted of people and where one can remain undisturbed by men  lodgings fit for meditative seclusion  still he is called onewhodwellswithasecond And why soBecause craving is his second and that is not abandoned by himHence he is called onewhodwellswithasecondThe lonedweller is then defined as the monk who does not delight in assert or cling to the objects of the six senses and is thus free from bondage to the fetter of delightThe Buddhas summingup in this case is no less forceful than his concluding remark in the Naagita Sutta  the contradiction between them being only apparent when examined within contextA monk thus dwelling Migajaala even though he may be dwelling in the village in the midst of monks nuns male and female lay followers kings royal ministers teachers and disciples of other sects  still he is called a lonedweller And why soBecause craving is his second and that is abandoned by himHence is he called lonedwellerThe ideal type of solitude advocated by the two suttas is also the theme of the Bhaddekaratta suttasThere the summary and the exposition concern the Bhaddekaratto whom we may now identify as the ideal lover of solitude The distinction made by the Buddha between mere physical solitude and the ideal type of spiritual solitude would amply justify the use of the epithet bhadda in fact the concluding verse of the summary attributes the compliment to the Buddha himselfThe significance of the title however is not the sole point of interest in the Bhaddekaratta SuttaBoth the summary and the exposition despite their brevity can well afford to represent the essence of the Dhamma in all its depth and significanceThere is for instance in the summary the pair of difficult terms asamhiramasamkuppam with a significance of its ownBut these points will be dealt with in the Notes since they could best be appreciated in the light of the sutta itselfThus have I heard At one time the Exalted one was living at Saavatthi in the Jeta Grove Anaathapindikas monasteryThere he addressed the monks thus Monks Revered one the monks answered the Exalted One in assentThe Exalted one

meaning of which he had not expounded in detail when he rose from his seat and went in to his dwellingOf this summary that was recited by the Exalted One in brief but the meaning of which he did not expound in detail I friends understand the detailed meaning thusThis phrase helps us to understand the significance of the Buddhas constant advice to letgo the pastThe exposition clearly reveals that it is not so much the mere recollection of the past that is the bondage as the element of delight or desireandlust one finds thereinIt is the tendency to retrace revive relive and relish the past that has to be eliminated and hence there comes in the necessity of detachment even with regard to thought processesThere is however a notion in some philosophers  notably in Krishnamurthy  that it is the faculty of memory as such that is to be blamed for mans psychological bondageIn an attempt to die to the past he seems to regard memory as the villainofthepiece and advocate its obliteration while stressing the necessity of awarenessThis contrasts with the Buddhist approach inasmuch as sati which is a term for awareness or mindfulness is also the usual term for memory Thus one comes across the following standard definition of satindriya in the Paali canonAnd what monks is the faculty of mindfulnessHerein monks a noble disciple is mindful and is endowed with the highest prudence in mindfulness he is one who remembers and recollects even what is done or said long agoThis monks is called the faculty of mindfulnessThis recognition of the essential relationship between mindfulness and memory is understandable since the keenness of the one naturally leads to the clarity of the otherThe denial of its rightful place to the faculty of memory in the complex scheme of mental functions might even give rise to a schizophrenic conditionThe noble disciple therefore would not unscrupulously contradict himself or claim to have forgotten what he has said and done earlier on the flimsy ground of his devotion to the practice of momenttomoment awareness On the contrary he might without inhibition even develop his faculty of memory to such a degree that he could recollect his past lives and experiences in all their major and minor detailsWhat he aims at by his diligent practice of mindfulness is mastery over the pathways of thought currents as the concluding lines of Vitakkasanthaana Sutta of the Majjhima Nikaaya make it clearThis monk is called monks a master of the pathways of thought modes and whatever thought he wishes to think that he thinks whatever thought he does not wish to think that he does not thinkHe has cut off craving turned back the fetter and by fully understanding conceit put an end to IllThe most distinctive feature of the Buddhas solution to the intricate problem of mindfulness and memory is the emphasis on detachmentThe elimination of the element of delight was the essential condition to be fulfilled and to this end he oriented his exhortations to the monks so that often the finale turns out to be Impermanent O monks are formationsUnstable O Monks are formationsUnsatisfying O monks are formations so much so monks that this is enough for one to turn away from all formations enough to get detached from them enough to seek release from them The theme of impermanence runs even through his contemplation of mountains and rivers which for the average man offer beautiful landscapes and lasting landmarksIndeed this emphasis on utter detachment based on the contemplation of universal impermanence is not so marked in other systems of thought purporting to solve the above problem even in Krishnamurthy too much stress is laid for instance on the beauty of marvelous mountains trees rivers and sunsetsIt is also significant that the Buddhist scheme of mindtraining while recognizing the role of mindfulness or awareness in the field of senserestraint assigns the function of transcendence to the faculty of wisdomAs such it does not find itself in the awkward position of being antimemory and proawareness Though sati is helpful in temporarily stemming the swift currents of craving flowing in through the six sensedoors the ultimate deliverance of the mind is a matter for the penetrative faculty of pannaa  whetted as it were on the three signataPannaa is the dam wherefrom all currents turn backAs in case of the past so with regard to future too it is the delight or desireandlust that gives rise to yearning or anxietyThe aspiration for acquisition is the condition for delight in this case and in being delighted one is yearning for the futureA simple expression of choice and wish in regard to future courses of action in the everyday life of the arahant is not altogether deniedBut it is the attitude which makes all the difference between such expressions and the hankerings and forebodings of a worldling relating to an uncertain futureThe arahant as his epithet taadi suggests is endowed with the highest adaptability and resilience due to his penetration into suchnessFor him anxiety and yearning with their corollaries vexation and disappointment simply do not existIf he does get anything he thinks It is well and if he does not get anything then also he thinks It is good In both circumstances he is such and he turns back like one who went up to a treeThe stable and steady nature of the emancipated mind is indicated by these two termsTogether they form an epithet of Nibbaana that might be of interest to the student of psychology and ethics in particularThough it does not occur in the canonical list of epithets of Nibbaana it is represented there by the term dhuvamIts significance however lies mainly in the nuances it conveys through the twin termsAsamhiira is a word often used in the Paali canon to enhance the sense of stability conveyed by a positive term such as thito or chekoThe immovability the irremovability the ability to stand ones ground are some of the shades of meaning associated with the wordHence samhiirati when used in the positive sense as in the prose section of the sutta would suggest the tendency to get attracted enticed or drawn intoIn this specific context the twenty types of personalityview are interpreted as so many ways of being drawn into involvement in regard to present phenomenaBy contrast therefore asamhiram in its reference to Nibbaana seems to emphasize the total absence of lust or attachment in that state of supreme mental reposeAsamkuppam too basically carries with it overtones of stability since the gerundive kuppa has such meanings as movable shakable excitable irritable Not infrequently the verb kuppati is used with little or no emotional coloring mostly with reference to the behavior of inanimate things and then it is simply disturbance or shaking But in the context of mental states it is often associated with the impulses of irritation or anger particularly when prefixed with samAnd here too the same nuances are evidentThe stability of Nibbaana as a psychological state is as much due to the absence of repulsion as to that of attractionOut of the three roots of evil  greed hate and delusion  the first two indicate the polarization of those psychological forces known as formationsFormations themselves spring from delusion or ignorance which manifests itself primarily as personalityviewsHerein monks the uninstructed ordinary man looks upon form as selfThat very looking upon monks is a formation In normal perception it obtains as attention which as a rule is impelled by desire or interestThe world of discrete objects over which the range of perception extends is the result of this beam of attention switched on as it were by interestAll phenomena friends are rooted in desire all phenomena are born of attention all phenomena arise from contactThe keener the interest the keener the attention and both these factors introduce a certain degree of tension into the perceptual situation whereby all other relative distractions are forcibly ignored This tension force stress or strain involved in the process renders all perception more or less artificial and syntheticEven in the most elementary form of perception ignorance and craving are already implicitBut what is the cause the arising the origin and the source of that formationTo the uninstructed ordinary man touched by a feeling born of ignorancecontact monks there arises craving born thereof is that formationThus monks even that formation is impermanent compounded dependently arisenThat feeling tooThat contact too That ignorance too is impermanent compounded dependently arisenIn the very act of attending perception becomes blighted with an artificiality which estranges one from realitySince it is the formations themselves that are revealed in senseperception as attitudes of greed and hatred delusion as the seedbed of formations may rightly be regarded as the apex which sustains both types of attitudesThis shows that in order to transcend the above polarization delusion too must be eliminated together with the formations springing therefromThe two terms in our epithet apparently do not say anything about this tertiumquid but it is already implicit in them as we have shown aboveAs such the epithet may be said to refer to that paradoxical samaadhi peculiar to Buddhas and Arahants which is known as aanantarika or arahattaphala samaadhiSome salient features of this concentration find mention in the following canonical passagesMonks in such a manner should a monk examine that his consciousness will  while thus examining  neither be distracted or dissipated outwardly nor be established inwardly and not grasping he would not be vexedWhen monks ones consciousness is neither distracted nor dissipated outwardly nor established inwardly and when he grasping naught is not vexed there will be no arising or origination again of birth decay death and sufferingSister that particular concentration which is neither turnedtoward nor turnedoutward which is not a form of restraint forcibly held in place by formations  a concentration which is stable owing to the fact of emancipation and is one of contentment owing to its stability wherein owing to contentment one is not vexed  that concentration sister has been made known by the Lord as that which has knowledge as its fruitOne can form an idea of the range of meaning covered by the terms asamhiram and asamkuppam in the context of these two passagesThe reference to a nonestablishment of consciousness inwardly would readily call to mind the definition of samhiirati in the Bhaddekaratta Sutta in terms of the twenty types of personalityviews while the expression neither turned toward suggests the absence of an introvert attitude which is not totally unrelated to the nuances of the term in questionSimilarly the phrase  his consciousness will neither be distracted or dissipated outwardly and the expression nor turned outward have much in common with asamkuppam though they stress in particular the absence of an extreme extrovert attitudeThe negation of the aforementioned tertiumquid finds expression in these two passages in the words not grasping he would not be vexed and perhaps more clearly in the rather unwieldy compound which we sought to render by  which is not a form of restraint forcibly held in place by formationsThis latter expression seems to suggest by contrast that any makeshift compromise between the two extremes of attraction and repulsion of sympathy and antipathy of settling and distraction  such as obtain in any worldly type of concentration  is necessarily accompanied by mental synergies or formationsThese formations exercise such a rigorous control over the concentration so much so that it might be called a state of pentup tension or stress however subtle it may appearHence like all other phenomena which partake of a concocted and compound character worldly concentration even at its best can yield only a peacedependentonirritabilityThat extraordinary concentration of the arahant however has eliminated even this tertiumquid by the utter appeasement of all formations and is therefore known as the unexcitable deliverance of the mindThe appeasement of mental formations is accompanied by the relinquishment of all assets or substrata which arrest and sustain attentionYet this paradoxical concentration does not lapse into a dull lethargy since it has as its quasiobject of attention the very Nibbaanic peace of the cessation of formationsFor instance at A V one finds the Buddha giving the following explanation in response to Venerable AAnandas query concerning the possibility and nature of such a concentrationHerein AAnanda a monk attends thus This is peace this is excellent that is to say the appeasement of all formations the relinquishment of all assets the destruction of craving dispassion cessation Nibbaana Thus is it AAnanda that there could be such an attainment of concentration for a monk in which he would not attend to the eye nor to a form nor to the ear nor to a sound nor to the nose nor to a smell nor to the tongue nor to a flavor nor to the body nor to a tangible nor to earth nor to water nor to fire nor to air nor to the sphere of infinity of space nor to the sphere of infinity of consciousness nor to the sphere of nothingness nor to the sphere of neitherperceptionnornonperception nor to this world nor to a world beyondAnd whatever is seen heard sensed cognized attained sought after and traversed by the mind even to that he does not attendBut nevertheless he does attendTranscending all polarities characteristic of the phenomenal consciousness the emancipated one thus attains to the highest possible state of mental equilibrium which is immovable and nonirritable and in which he meditates as it were thoughtlessThat pure concentration which the Supremely Awakened One extolled and which they call Immediacy  a concentration comparable to that there does not existThe significance of the term anantarika as applied to this unique samaadhi could best be illustrated by the following utterance of Venerable AAnandaWhile seeing in whatever manner friend there comes to be the immediate destruction of influxes  that is the highest seeingWhile hearing in whatever manner there comes to be the immediate destruction of influxes  that is the highest hearingWhile being happy in whatever way there comes to be the immediate destruction of influxes  that is the highest happinessWhile perceiving in whatever manner there comes to be the immediate destruction of influxes  that is the highest perceptionBeing in whatever state there comes to be the immediate destruction of influxes  that is the highest existenceCfSchopenhauer The world can appear in its true color and form in its complete and correct significance only when the intellect freed from willing moves freely over objects and yet is energetically active without being spurred on by the willThis is certainly contrary to the nature and destiny of the intellect thus it is to a certain extent unnatural and for this reason exceedingly

as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practiceThese works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first aroseOne day into the temple premises where Kapuri the sheelephant the wise tortoise and the peacock lived there arrived a workworn bullKapuri saw him seated in the middle of the temple grounds behind the monks quarters looking as though he were weighed down by a world of sorrowWhen Kapuris mahout tied her to the accustomed jak tree after her days work and went away leaving a heap of kitul palms for her to munch on Kapuri cast several thoughtful glances in the direction of the bullHe was seated close by looking like a dejected sack of bones that had been carelessly deposited on the groundFriend from what part of the country have you comeAre you staying here long Kapuri asked himThe bull lifted his head and shook it to get rid of the flies and fleas swarming about himI came from a place not far from hereMy owner brought me and wanted the chief monk to keep me here for a whileI suppose my owner wants me to get fattened up on the temple grass so he can get more work out of meYour owner sounds rather unkindThe bull let out a long low moan that vibrated with deep emotionFriend if you knew how I have suffered he said bitterlyTell me Kapuri urged him kindlyTo begin with my owner a carter was very kind to meBut after he got married and the children came one after the other he started to neglect meLike howWell for instance he used to give me less and less foodI didnt mind that because he made up for it by being extra kindWhen I had to drag a load of metal or sand or brick to a distant place from early dawn until the late afternoon he used to sing sad carters songs more to alleviate my suffering than to entertain himselfHowever he expected me to do the same amount of work as I did beforeAs you know dragging a cartload of metal or brick up hilly roads under a scorching sun is no jokeOnce I remember how I began to foam at the mouth and pant furiouslyThen my head began to turn round and round and everything became dark and very silentFor a moment I had no idea what had happened until I felt a stinging cut on my hideWhen I came to my owner was beating me with a stick and I found that I had fallen on my kneesI hastily got to my feet but even then my owner went on giving me beatings and earbashing tirades as though he had lost all control of himself until we reached our destinationI was extremely shaken by his treatment of meThat was how your owners concern for you his anxiety for his livelihood and his guilt at exploiting you were expressing themselvesThe bull paused and considered this statementMaybe so he said and began to ward off flies and fleas again by shaking his head twitching his hide and flicking his tailThe bells round his neck jangledHe got up and slowly walked up to a coconut tree close by and began to rub himself against the coarse barkSo what happened after that incidentWhatever my owners anger was due to he became more and more unfeeling and unsympathetic toward meBut on my part I continued to look upon him with the same dumb affection and loyalty that I had beforeThat is not a virtue Kapuri said quietlyYou were merely clinging to your idea of securityTo you the carter represented your securityThe bull shruggedMaybe soAnyway gradually my owner began to brazenly disregard my basic needsOne day he brought a bucket not even a third filled with poonac and setting it down before me said aggressively as if giving a bone from his body Here take thisThat is all there isBe thankful you are getting even that muchYou are far better off than most others It was his haughty callous manner which hurt me more than anything elseYou cannot imagine what a burning started up inside meAs a result I was in such a turmoil within that I hardly knew what I was doingAs this ill treatment went on I began to react The bull ambled away from the coconut tree and settled down again to chew the cudHow did you react if I am not too inquisitiveOne day I nearly attacked his wife the bull saidBut why his wifeBecause I am quite sure she is the cause of his callousnessShe was the one who was stiffening his spine to mistreat meOtherwise my young master would never have become so hardhearted toward meHow can you be so sureTime and time again I have overheard her bending his ear with complaints against meShe was forever grumbling and complaining about meComplaining about whatI drop dung all over the compound it seems and as a result the place swarms with fliesOr else she says I am a great expense and a nuisanceShe used to urge him to get rid of me and do another job that does not require a bullWhy did she have a knife into youI dont knowI thought perhaps she was jealous of meYou see in the past I was the carters trusted friend and constant companionI suppose she resented thatIt could be Kapuri agreedSome wives are notoriously jealous and possessive of their husbandsI also had heard thatThat is why I was very patient with her at the startI thought if I was very goodtempered and understanding and kind toward her she would get over her dislike and distrust of me but far from that she went on carrying on against me through the years until she had built a solid wall of aversion between herself and meIt used to manifest itself even when I played with the childrenLike howWell you know sometimes I used to chase the children for funThey knew it was a gameThey would run away gleefully from me and return to give me a playful whack on my backI would then turn around and lowering my head as if to butt them with my horns chase them round and round the gardenSometimes they would climb on to my backOnce when I was trotting around with a little one on my back led by a bigger one the little one slipped and fell to the ground and began to bawl and cryHis mother came running out picked up the child and scolded me You wretched old bull you did that on purposeI saw what you did you wicked devil And she ranted on for hours about that accidentOn another occasion I remember one child gave me a plantain through the kitchen window and I ate it with great relish and to show my appreciation I held the middle of her small arm in my mouthThen too the mother saw this and shouted at me and drove me away from the windowI had held the childs arm in my mouth very gently with affection but the carters wife behaved as if I was trying to eat her childs arm like a plantainOn another occasion one of the children brought me a piece of milkrice on New Years dayI enjoyed it so much that having eaten it in one gulp I bent my head and placed my horns against the childs belly for funI did not use any pressure at all but you should have heard how his mother shouted and carried onAnyone would have thought I was trying to kill the childAll these incidents were exaggerated and misrepresented to the carter so much so that he also started becoming suspicious and wary of meIt then slowly dawned on me that she would never be happy until she had got rid of meShe simply did not want to break down that wall she had put up between usSo what did you doI suppose that the best thing would have been to leave them but how could I leave and where could I goI just had to wait and put up with it and my head was so full of her hurtful barbs and remarks that one day when she brought me a pail of water to drink I kicked it with my hind legThe rim struck her chin when she was bending down and blood sprang from the cutYou can imagine how she swore at me and how she complained about me to the carterYou shouldnt have done that Kapuri reprimanded the bull gentlyThat was a mistakeI know but I am only a bull not a saintWhen people go to all kinds of lengths to hurt me and mistreat me how can I not reactAll the same you shouldntIs that possibleYesNot reacting is the only way to protect yourself and othersProtect othersProtect them from doing more harm to you and worsening the situationI suppose you went on reactingWell yes because you see it came to a point when even the children became suspicious and wary of me as if I was some kind of an ogre or spiteful poisonous snake in their midstTheir behavior used to hurt me very deeplyThen she set them up to taunt me  to pull my tail or pelt stones at meOnce I chased a little fellow in real anger because he aimed a stone at my back with a catapultI became livid with uncontrolled anger because by that time I had become very jumpy and irritableScarcely had I felt the impact of the stone on my rear than I chased the little rascal round and round the garden with all the pentup hurt and anger that had been welling up inside me until he escaped inside the houseThat was another mistake you made Kapuri said shaking her head dolefullyYou were only giving the carters wife more ammunitionShe would have made capital of itNext time you do such a thing the carter will surely heed his wife and send you awayI know the bull murmuredYou see that was the turning point between the carter and myselfThereafter he became just as hard as she  abusing me and even beating meHow foolish you have beenAnd I suppose you reacted to him alsoYes I became stubborn and resentful and he couldnt make me budge for all the beatings in the worldI would bend down my head dig in my heels grit my teeth and wait and wait until he beat me and beat me and beat me till the tears poured down his face and he began to sobKapuri shook her head sorrowfullyI am so sad to hear all this she saidI can see the whole cause of it very clearly and you have only added fuel to the fireMe the bull roared rolling his eyes skywardAll this is done to me and I am the culpritWhy do you say soDont you see bull she was your karma from a past birthInstead of not reacting to her malice you have gone and made more bad karma for yourself and her and your ownerIf you had ignored her and overlooked all her venom and wickedness things would not have come to this stageYou should have steeled yourself against her hatred and drawn strength from your virtueIt is in such a situation that virtue comes to our aid like a shieldWhat do you mean by virtueDo you mean the Five PreceptsYes but in the deepest senseI mean selfrestraint in all things beginning with thoughtsBy being grateful for whatever little food you received and the shelter and kindness you got you would have stored up good karma and thereby slowly worked out the effects of your past bad karmaYou are expecting an impossible standard of behavior from a mere bovine creature like meI can only think of food sleep and respite from fleas and flies and of course kindness from those around meYou have to raise yourself from that bovine level with much effort if you are to free yourself from the bonds of sufferingThe bull looked down at the ground somewhat shamefacedlyIf only my owner continued to be kind to me I would not have reacted he said softlyI was so patient forever so longWhat wounded me was my kind master becoming hard and callous and turning against meYour carter is no different from many young family men Kapuri went on wiselyWhen a young man takes a wife and brings into the world other mouths to feed he sometimes feels an overriding sense of responsibility for them which blinds him to the needs and sensibilities of others  even those near to him like his employees and his parentsTell me how to prevent myself from reacting again the bull pleaded abjectlyFirst tell me how you came to be here Kapuri queriedWell one day without a word my master gave me a lot of fodder to eat and when I became docile and amenable he brought me hereHe probably thought the temple atmosphere would have a salutary effect on me not to mention the ample grazing groundKapuri considered the statement objectivelyWould you go back with him happily if he returns to take you backIf the bull slowly turned and looked at Kapuri with a lifted eyebrowWhat do you mean ifMy dear bull has it not occurred to you that he might not return for youThe bull stood still as if he had been thunderstruckWell if he doesnt return to take me back he mumbled shakily to tell you the truth I really dont know what I should doYou yourself told me that the carters wife cannot be changed and that she would never be satisfied until she had got rid of youAlso you have told me how unpleasant conditions are for youIf that is so you should examine very carefully the nature of your attachment to your master  the clinging you have for the socalled security you feel by being with himYou see attachment is capable of giving one an unnecessary amount of anguishI know the bull agreedI am realizing itWhen the carter used to talk affectionately to me I used to become so happy all my troubles seemed to vanish into thin airBut when he became callous and reduced my meals and spoke to me harshly I would be dashed to the ground into the depths of despairIf he gave me only a little to eat but was kind it would have been enoughI would have been only too ready to accept his poverty and not chafe against it if he only showed a little kindness and concern for my welfareBut he became just as aggressive and overbearing as his wifeI hate them allI hate everyone and everything the bull suddenly bellowedNow now my friend restrain yourselfYoure letting your frustration overwhelm youDo you know what is happening to youYou have become a hapless victim of your sense of grievanceIt is chasing you round and round in an endless merrygoroundTell me how to get rid of it  this feeling of violence and hatred in meIt is burning inside like a live coal burning my heart and there is nothing but a milling confusion in my brainI too felt like that at one time Kapuri saidFriend it will take a long long time for your hurt to healBut I dont want time to heal me the bull roared rebelliouslyI want to heal myselfGoodThen listen carefully to this stanza from the DhammapadaFrom affection springs griefFrom affection springs fearFor one who is wholly free from affectionThere is no grief much less fearThe bull flicked his ears and tail looking perplexedI would advise you to go and ask the tortoise for more advice Kapuri said gentlyHe is a sageHe will give you the most efficacious medicine of all with which to heal yourself  also prescribed by the Buddha himselfIt is not for nothing that our Buddha was called the Supreme HealerWhere can I find the tortoiseHe forages around the hedge once a day for his foodThen you can speak to himSo the following day the bull rummaged through the hedge that bordered the temple ground and finally located the tortoiseSir I have something to ask youAm I disturbing you the bull ventured somewhat timidlyNo not at allDo go on and ask me any question you wantSir my head is on fireThere is a live coal blazing within meThere is so much anguish inside of me poisoning my whole systemI even feel it shooting into the marrow of my bonesI feel miserableGive me a cureThere is no instant cure the tortoise said slowly looking deep into the bulls red eyes as if to penetrate into the very core of his miseryThere is much striving you must do to rid yourself of aversion and attachment and clinging to false securityBegin the practice by purging the mind of all angry thoughtsCultivate feelings of kindness to allHowThink of the little acts of kindness done to you during your lifetime for which you are grateful for instance and let that feeling of gratitude grow and expand inside youThen radiate those thoughts of kindness to all around youEach time the thoughts of anger and resentment arise be aware of themStamp out those living glowing coals till they are ashCultivate thoughts of kindnessBe always mindfulWatch your thoughtsAs it is said Do no evil cultivate good and purify ones mind this is the Teaching of the Buddhas Is that allIs that the medicineThat is allBut friend it is not such a simple matter to take the medicine in the prescribed mannerIt might require a whole lifetime to learn how to take the medicine but it is worthwhileOnce you free yourself of anger and resentment and hurt  you will feel so free and contentYou will experience supreme bliss in this very life itselfIs that truly soYou are not leading me up a garden pathOf course I am not leading you up a garden pathThe freedom of mind that is experienced when one has got rid of lust ill will sloth and torpor flurry and worry and doubt is described in the suttasIt is likened to what a man experiences when he has borrowed a loan done business with that capital made a profit and repaid the loanThen again it is likened to what a man experiences when having been ill he gets wellAlso to what a man experiences when having been in prison he is set free or to the feeling of a slave released from slaveryFinally it is likened to what a man experiences when having got lost on a desert road and having been exposed to hunger and much danger he comes to the border of a village and so to safetyIs there no short cut to this safety  to this peaceWhen you give up clinging to objects of attachment you will experience great freedomHow the bull askedHow do you experience freedom when you give up clingingYou see sense objects are transient and whatever is transient is inherently subject to sufferingSo where is the lasting security the lasting pleasureWhen you cant obtain those things which you find pleasant there is anguishWhen you encounter those things which you find unpleasant there is anguish but when you let go of wanting and not wanting then you experience a sense of great freedom and peaceWhen ones happiness is not dependent on transient sense objects feelings and emotions but on the peace that comes by letting go that is a happiness worth experiencingIt is beyond all the pleasures known to the mundane worldSo I am to give up my attachment to my master  to food and all thatDont cling to them as if they are the beall and endall of your lifeBe satisfied with littleBe at peace with yourself and everyone and everything around youBe at peace with my masters wife and her contemptuous remarksHow do I do that the bull asked with a skeptical laughHow do I achieve thatBull for heavens sake give up your clinging to aversion the tortoise said with mild severityYou are hugging your hurts to yourself and nursing grudges as if they were your most precious treasuresThe carters wife hurts you with her remarks  so whatForget themGive them upSee how free and liberated you will feel when you give up hurt and grudge without hanging on to them for dear lifeBut how do I do thatTell me the secret  the techniqueAll I know is that when a hurtful barb is let off at me with not a little venom it hurtsIt really hurts like an arrow shot through my heart and I feel my whole frame shaking visibly from the impactNow how do I pretend it didnt happenHow do I pretend nothing hit meDont pretendStrive to master your emotionsBull listen to me wellYou cannot achieve that state of peace and calm automatically  you have to strive hard with a technique of meditationThere has to be deep searching within you to know the nature of these hurts to find out why they hurtYou must have pure awareness of the remark without any fancying in your imagination  rushing to probe your memory for similar remarks associating and linking them with past events jumping to conclusions  all that clumsy murky play of thought must be swept asideNor should you rush into the future with fears of what the remark implies with regard to your socalled securityYou must clearly comprehend not only the nature of the remark but why you react to it the way you doWith this kind of selfexamination you begin to realize little by little that remarks hurt because of your socalled ego notion  the image you have of yourself the image you would like people to have of yourselfIn actual fact there is no ego or you only a conglomeration of mental and physical phenomena arising and passing away from moment to moment without a subject to which they are attachedThat kind of clear comprehension is possible only when our minds are purified by cultivating mindfulness and concentrationWhen the mind is purified of defilements then you can focus on these problems and those areas you want to probeYou will then discover with great clarity that there is no self  only transient thoughts feelings emotions  physical and mental phenomenaSeeing and experiencing this truth is the greatest discovery the key to letting goWhen your meditation is really advanced you will be able to see this for yourselfYou will see that all these phenomena originate not from a single cause but from several related causes and conditionsThis is why the suttas say Contemplate that the body is not I feelings are not I perceptions are not I mental volitions are not I consciousness is not They are all impermanentWhat is impermanent is sufferingWhat is suffering is not I There is no I in all thisOnce you begin to see this for yourself you learn to let goYou learn not to reactThen you begin to reduce the anguish within you and thereby attain peaceSo if my master takes me back and mistreats me again what you are telling me to do is to bear it up without anger or resentment because in actual fact there is no IMy dear friend the tortoise said smiling gentlyYou asked me for the medicine and I am giving it to youTake it or leave itI am only telling you to purify yourself so that you can see things clearly and thereby attain inner calmInwardly if you are calm and firm as a post unshakeable by the wind made calm and firm by really seeing and experiencing the insubstantiality of the socalled ego  then giving up clinging is no great problemAnd this medicine is guaranteed to give one complete freedom from sufferingIt is indeed a lasting cureIt is no patchup job no temporary cureI give you no mystical medicine that involves the performance of all kinds of elaborate rites and rituals the hocuspocus of magicThe magic of inner transformation is what the Buddhas medicine aims atAnd that goal is the complete giving up of clinging  clinging to existence to nonexistence to sense pleasures to aversion to views that giving up of clinging alone brings lasting emancipation from miseryRemember it is better to die happy without anger and ill will than to die unhappy and full of resentment which will take you to rebirth in a place far worse than your present conditionThe bull considered this reply frowning flicking his tail and ears and twitching his hidePresently his forehead uncreased and clear steady light began to shine in his eyesHe nodded his head slowly while chewing the cudSir I think I am beginning to understand what you are driving atGood but to achieve the pure awareness and clear comprehension that are imperative for liberation you must meditateLive in the present moment all the timeBe aware of your thoughts feelings and emotionsBe truly friendly and gentle toward yourself and by doing that you will be able to project that gentleness and kindness and understanding to othersBy this you will be freed from the I notion and experience a common empathy with all that existsKnow your thoughts and emotions for what they areYou will then gradually begin to understand the nature of this complex process which we label I and me and mine Then you will see for yourself that freedom comes when you give up not only the objects of the senses but this grasping of the notion of an ego  the entire grasping of the aggregates which are really empty unsubstantial transitoryYes I think I am beginning to understand a little nowCertainly I shall do my best to take the medicine  first to purify my mind and cultivate good thoughts and thereby rid myself of attachment and aversionThus I will give up clinging to a false sense of securityVery good bullVery good indeedIt is not easy but if you take the medicine in the prescribed manner you will soon reap the desired results of contentment and total

Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creedsFounded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topicsIts publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddhas discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practiceThese works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first aroseThis is a how to bookIt teaches the liberation of the mind not as a mindboggling theory but as a very basic skill that starts with keeping the breath in mindThe teachings here are drawn from the works of Ajaan Lee Dhammadharo one of Thailands most renowned teachers of Buddhist meditationAjaan Lee was a forest monk  one who prefers to live in the seclusion of the forest and makes meditation the central theme of his practice  so his teachings grow out of personal practical experience although he also makes a point of relating them to standard Buddhist doctrineThe book is in two parts The first is a basic guide to the techniques of breath meditation  Ajaan Lees specialty  and gives two methods that he developed at separate points in his careerThe second part consists of excerpts from five of his talks dealing with issues that tend to arise in the course of meditationIf you want to begin your practice of meditation immediately and fill in the details later turn to MethodRead over the seven basic steps until you have them firmly in mind and then start meditatingTake care especially at the beginning not to clutter your mind with extraneous ideas or informationOtherwise you might spend too much time looking for things in your meditation and not see what is actually thereThe rest of the book can wait until later when you want help with a particular problem or  what is often the same thing  when you want an overall perspective on what you are doingThe purpose of this book is to suggest possibilities to direct your attention to areas you may have overlooked to suggest approaches that otherwise might not have occurred to youWhat you actually see is purely an individual matterDont try to force thingsDont be worried if you have experiences that arent covered in the bookDont be disappointed if you dont have experiences that areSigns and visions for example Some people experience them others dontThey are an individual matter and not really essential to the meditationIf you experience them learn how to use them wiselyIf you dont learn how to use what you do experienceThe important point is to keep the basics in mind and to stay observantMeditation like carpentry sailing or any other skill has its own vocabulary that to the beginner is bound to seem like a codeOne of the challenges in using this book will be in breaking its codePart of the difficulty is that some of the terms are literally foreign Theyre in Pali the language of the oldest extant Buddhist texts colored by shades of meaning theyve picked up from ThaiThis problem though is relatively minorMost of these terms are explained in the text the glossary at the back of the book gives definitions for any that arent plus additional information on many that areA greater challenge lies in getting a feel for the authors point of viewIn meditation we are dealing with the body and mind as experienced from the insideAjaan Lee practiced meditation most of his adult lifeHe had long experience in viewing the body and mind from that perspective and so it is only natural that his choice of terms should reflect itFor example when he refers to the breath or breath sensations he is speaking not only of the air going in and out of the lungs but also of the way breathing feels from the inside throughout the entire bodySimilarly the elements of the body are not the chemical elementsInstead they are elementary feelings  energy warmth liquidity solidity emptiness and consciousness  the way the body presents itself directly to inner awarenessThe only way to get past the strangeness of this sort of terminology is to start exploring your own body and mind from the inside and to gain a sense of which terms apply to which of your own personal experiencesOnly then will these terms fulfill their intended purpose  as tools for refining your inner sensitivities  for the truth of meditation lies not in understanding the words but in mastering the skill that leads to a direct understanding of awareness itselfYou might compare this book to a recipeIf you simply read the recipe you cant  even if you understand all the terms  get any flavor or nourishment from itIf you follow the first few steps and then give up when it starts getting difficult youve wasted your timeBut if you follow it all the way you can then set it aside and simply enjoy the results of your own cookingMy hope is that this book will be helpful in your personal exploration into the benefits that come from keeping the breath in mindThis book is a guide to the practice of centering the mindThere are two sections The first deals almost exclusively with the mindBut because the wellbeing of the mind depends to some extent on the body I have included a second section that shows how to use the body to benefit the mindFrom what Ive observed in my own practice there is only one path that is short easy effective and pleasant and at the same time has hardly anything to lead you astray the path of keeping the breath in mind the same path the Lord Buddha himself used with such good resultsI hope that you wont make things difficult for yourself by being hesitant or uncertain by taking this or that teaching from here or there and that instead youll earnestly set your mind on getting in touch with your own breath and following it as far as it can take youFrom there you will enter the stage of liberating insight leading to the mind itselfUltimately pure knowing  buddha  will stand out on its ownThats when youll reach an attainment trustworthy and sureIn other words if you let the breath follow its own nature and the mind its own nature the results of your practice will without a doubt be all that you hope forOrdinarily the nature of the heart if it isnt trained and put into order is to fall in with preoccupations that are stressful and badThis is why we have to search for a principle  a Dhamma  with which to train ourselves if we hope for happiness thats stable and secureIf our hearts have no inner principle no center in which to dwell were like a person without a homeHomeless people have nothing but hardshipThe sun wind rain and dirt are bound to leave them constantly soiled because they have nothing to act as shelterTo practice centering the mind is to build a home for yourself Momentary concentration is like a house roofed with thatch threshold concentration a house roofed with tile and fixed penetration a house built out of brickOnce you have a home youll have a safe place to keep your valuablesYou wont have to put up with the hardships of watching over them the way a person who has no place to keep his valuables has to go sleeping in the open exposed to the sun and rain to guard those valuables  and even then his valuables arent really safeSo it is with the uncentered mind It goes searching for good from other areas letting its thoughts wander around in all kinds of concepts and preoccupationsEven if those thoughts are good we still cant say that were safeWere like a woman with plenty of jewelry If she dresses up in her jewels and goes wandering around shes not safe at allHer wealth might even lead to her own deathIn the same way if our hearts arent trained through meditation to gain inner stillness even the virtues weve been able to develop will deteriorate easily because they arent yet securely stashed away in the heartTo train the mind to attain stillness and peace though is like keeping your valuables in a strongboxThis is why most of us dont get any good from the good we doWe let the mind fall under the sway of its various preoccupationsThese preoccupations are our enemies because there are times when they can cause the virtues weve already developed to wither awayThe mind is like a blooming flower If wind and insects disturb the flower it may never have a chance to give fruitThe flower here stands for the stillness of the mind on the path the fruit for the happiness of the paths fruitionIf our stillness of mind and happiness are constant we have a chance to attain the ultimate good we all hope forThe ultimate good is like the heartwood of a treeOther goods are like the buds branches and leavesIf we havent trained our hearts and minds well meet with things that are good only on the external levelBut if our hearts are pure and good within everything external will follow in becoming good as a resultJust as our hand if its clean wont soil what it touches but if its dirty will spoil even the cleanest cloth in the same way if the heart is defiled everything is defiledEven the good we do will be defiled for the highest power in the world  the sole power giving rise to all good and evil pleasure and pain  is the heartThe heart is like a godGood evil pleasure and pain come entirely from the heartWe could even call the heart a creator of the world because the peace and continued wellbeing of the world depend on the heartIf the world is to be destroyed it will be because of the heartSo we should train this most important part of the world to be centered as a foundation for its wealth and wellbeingCentering the mind is a way of gathering together all its skillful potentialsWhen these potentials are gathered in the right proportions theyll give you the strength you need to destroy your enemies all your defilements and unwise mental statesYou have discernment that youve trained and made wise in the ways of good and evil of the world and the DhammaYour discernment is like gunpowderBut if you keep your gunpowder for long without putting it into bullets  a centered mind  itll go damp and moldyOr if youre careless and let the fires of greed anger or delusion overcome you your gunpowder may flame up in your handsSo dont delayPut your gunpowder into bullets so that whenever your enemies  your defilements  make an attack youll be able to shoot them right downWhoever trains the mind to be centered gains a refugeA centered mind is like a fortressDiscernment is like a weaponTo practice centering the mind is to secure yourself in a fortress and so is something very worthwhile and importantVirtue the first part of the Path and discernment the last arent especially difficultBut keeping the mind centered which is the middle part takes some effort because its a matter of forcing the mind into shapeAdmittedly centering the mind like placing bridge pilings in the middle of a river is something difficult to doBut once the mind is firmly in place it can be very useful in developing virtue and discernmentVirtue is like placing pilings on the near shore of the river discernment like placing them on the far shoreBut if the middle pilings  a centered mind  arent firmly in place how will you ever be able to bridge the flood of sufferingThere is only one way we can properly reach the qualities of the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha and thats through the practice of mental developmentWhen we develop the mind to be centered and still discernment can ariseDiscernment here refers not to ordinary discernment but to the insight that comes solely from dealing directly with the mindFor example the ability to remember past lives to know where living beings are reborn after death and to cleanse the heart of the fermentations of defilement These three forms of intuition  termed ñanacakkhu the eye of the mind  can arise for people who train themselves in the area of the heart and mindBut if we go around searching for knowledge from sights sounds smells tastes and tactile sensations mixed together with concepts its as if we were studying with the Six Masters and so we cant clearly see the truth  just as the Buddha while he was studying with the Six Masters wasnt able to gain AwakeningHe then turned his attention to his own heart and mind and went off to practice on his own keeping track of his breath as his first step and going all the way to the ultimate goalAs long as youre still searching for knowledge from your six senses youre studying with the Six MastersBut when you focus your attention on the breath  which exists in each of us  to the point where the mind settles down and is centered youll have the chance to meet with the real thing buddha pure knowingSome people believe that they dont have to practice centering the mind that they can attain release through discernment by working at discernment aloneThis simply isnt trueBoth release through discernment and release through stillness of mind are based on centering the mindThey differ only in degreeLike walking Ordinarily a person doesnt walk on one leg aloneWhichever leg is heavier is simply a matter of personal habits and traitsRelease through discernment begins by pondering various events and aspects of the world until the mind slowly comes to rest and once its still gives rise intuitively to liberating insight clear and true understanding in terms of the four Noble TruthsIn release through stillness of mind though theres not much pondering involvedThe mind is simply forced to be quiet until it attains the stage of fixed penetrationThats where intuitive insight will arise enabling it to see things for what they areThis is release through stillness of mind Concentration comes first discernment laterA person with a wideranging knowledge of the texts  wellversed in their letter and meaning capable of clearly and correctly explaining various points of doctrine  but with no inner center for the mind is like a pilot flying about in an airplane with a clear view of the clouds and stars but no sense of where the landing strip isHes headed for troubleIf he flies higher hell run out of airAll he can do is keep flying around until he runs out of fuel and comes crashing down in the savage wildsSome people even though they are highly educated are no better than savages in their behaviorThis is because theyve gotten carried away up in the cloudsSome people  taken with what they feel to be the high level of their own learning ideas and opinions  wont practice centering the mind because they feel it beneath themThey think they deserve to go straight to release through discernment insteadActually theyre heading straight to disaster like the airplane pilot who has lost sight of the landing stripTo practice centering the mind is to build a landing strip for yourselfThen when discernment comes youll be able to attain release safelyThis is why we have to develop all three parts of the path  virtue concentration and discernment  if we want to be complete in our practice of the religionOtherwise how can we say that we know the four Noble Truths because the path to qualify as the Noble Path has to be composed of virtue concentration and discernmentIf we dont develop it within ourselves we cant know itAnd if we dont know how can we let goMost of us by and large like getting results but dont like laying the groundworkWe may want nothing but goodness and purity but if we havent completed the groundwork well have to keep on being poorLike people who are fond of money but not of work How can they be good solid citizensWhen they feel the pinch of poverty theyll turn to corruption and crimeIn the same way if we aim at results in the field of the religion but dont like doing the work well have to continue being poorAnd as long as our hearts are poor were bound to go searching for goodness in other areas  greed gain status pleasure and praise the baits of the world  even though we know betterThis is because we dont truly know which means simply that we arent true in what we doThe truth of the path is always true Virtue is something true concentration is true discernment is true release is trueBut if we arent true we wont meet with anything trueIf we arent true in practicing virtue concentration and discernment well end up only with things that are fake and imitationAnd when we make use of things fake and imitation were headed for troubleSo we have to be true in our heartsWhen our hearts are true well come to savor the taste of the Dhamma a taste surpassing all the tastes of the worldThis is why I have put together the following two guides for keeping the breath in mindNow I will explain how to go about the practice of centering the mindBefore starting out kneel down with your hands palmtopalm in front of your heart and sincerely pay respect to the Triple Gem saying as followsThen showing respect with your thoughts words and deeds pay homage to the BuddhaAnd take refuge in the Triple GemThen make the following resolution I take refuge in the Buddha  the Pure One completely free from defilement and in his Dhamma  doctrine practice and attainment and in the Sangha  the four levels of his Noble Disciples  from now to the end of my lifeThen formulate the intention to observe the five eight ten or precepts according to how many you are normally able to observe expressing them in a single vowNow that you have professed the purity of your thoughts words and deeds toward the qualities of the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha bow down three timesSit down place your hands palmtopalm in front of your heart steady your thoughts and develop the four Sublime Attitudes good will compassion appreciation and equanimityTo spread these thoughts to all living beings without exception is called the immeasurable Sublime AttitudeA short Pali formula for those who have trouble memorizing isSit in a halflotus position right leg on top of the left leg your hands placed palmup on your lap right hand on top of the leftKeep your body straight and your mind on the task before youRaise your hands in respect palmtopalm in front of the heart and think of the qualities of the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha Buddho me natho  The Buddha is my mainstayDhammo me natho  The Dhamma is my mainstaySangho me natho  The Sangha is my mainstayThen repeat in your mind buddho buddho dhammo dhammo sangho sanghoReturn your hands to your lap and repeat one word buddho three times in your mindThen think of the inandout breath counting the breaths in pairsFirst think bud with the inbreath dho with the out ten timesThen begin again thinking buddho with the inbreath buddho with the out seven timesThen begin again As the breath goes in and out once think buddho once five timesThen begin again As the breath goes in and out once think buddho three timesDo this for three inandout breathsNow you can stop counting the breaths and simply think bud with the inbreath and dho with the outLet the breath be relaxed and naturalKeep your mind perfectly still focused on the breath as it comes in and out of the nostrilsWhen the breath goes out dont send the mind out after itWhen the breath comes in dont let the mind follow it inLet your awareness be broad cheerful and openDont force the mind too muchRelaxPretend that youre breathing out in the wide open airKeep the mind still like a post at the edge of the seaWhen the water rises the post doesnt rise with it when the water ebbs the post doesnt sinkWhen youve reached this level of stillness you can stop thinking buddhoSimply be aware of the feeling of the breathThen slowly bring your attention inward focusing it on the various aspects of the breath  the important aspects that can give rise to intuitive powers of various kinds clairvoyance clairaudience the ability to know the minds of others the ability to remember previous lives the ability to know where different people and animals are reborn after death and knowledge of the various elements or potentials that are connected with and can be of use to the bodyThese elements come from the bases of the breathThe First Base Center the mind on the tip of the nose and then slowly move it to the middle of the forehead The Second BaseKeep your awareness broadLet the mind rest for a moment at the forehead and then bring it back to the noseKeep moving it back and forth between the nose and the forehead  like a person climbing up and down a mountain  seven timesThen let it settle at the foreheadDont let it go back to the noseFrom here let it move to The Third Base the middle of the top of the head and let it settle there for a momentKeep your awareness broadInhale the breath at that spot let it spread throughout the head for a moment and then return the mind to the middle of the foreheadMove the mind back and forth between the forehead and the top of the head seven times finally letting it rest on the top of the headThen bring it into The Fourth Base the middle of the brainLet it be still for a moment and then bring it back out to the top of the headKeep moving it back and forth between these two spots finally letting it settle in the middle of the brainKeep your awareness broadLet the refined breath in the brain spread to the lower parts of the bodyWhen you reach this point you may find that the breath starts giving rise to various signs such as seeing or feeling hot cold or tingling sensations in the headYou may see a pale murky vapor or your own skullEven so dont let yourself be affected by whatever appearsIf you dont want the nimitta to appear breathe deep and long down into the heart and it will immediately go awayWhen you see that a nimitta has appeared mindfully focus your awareness on it  but be sure to focus on only one at a time choosing whichever one is most comfortableOnce youve got hold of it expand it so that its as large as your headThe bright white nimitta is useful to the body and mind Its a pure breath that can cleanse the blood in the body reducing or eliminating feelings of physical painWhen you have this white light as large as the head bring it down to The Fifth Base the center of the chestOnce its firmly settled let it spread out to fill the chestMake this breath as white and as bright as possible and then let both the breath and the light spread throughout the body out to every pore until different parts of the body appear on their own as picturesIf you dont want the pictures take two or three long breaths and theyll disappearKeep your awareness still and expansiveDont let it latch onto or be affected by any nimitta that may happen to pass into the brightness of the breathKeep careful watch over the mindKeep it oneKeep it intent on a single preoccupation the refined breath letting this refined breath suffuse the entire bodyWhen youve reached this point knowledge will gradually begin to unfoldThe body will be light like fluffThe mind will be rested and refreshed  supple solitary and selfcontainedThere will be an extreme sense of physical pleasure and mental easeIf you want to acquire knowledge and skill practice these steps until youre adept at entering leaving and staying in placeWhen youve mastered them youll be able to give rise to the nimitta of the breath  the brilliantly white ball or lump of light  whenever you wantWhen you want knowledge simply make the mind still and let go of all preoccupations leaving just the brightness and emptinessThink one or two times of whatever you want to know  of things inside or outside concerning yourself or others  and the knowledge will arise or a mental picture will appearTo become thoroughly expert you should if possible study directly with someone who has practiced and is skilled in these matters because knowledge of this sort can come only from the practice of centering the mindThe knowledge that comes from centering the mind falls into two classes mundane and transcendentWith mundane knowledge youre attached to your knowledge and views on the one hand and to the things that appear and give rise to your knowledge on the otherYour knowledge and the things that give you knowledge through the power of your skill are composed of true and false mixed together  but the true here is true simply on the level of mental fabrication and anything fabricated is by nature changeable unstable and inconstantSo when you want to go on to the transcendent level gather all the things you know and see into a single preoccupation  ekaggatarammana the singleness of mental absorption  and see that they are all of the same natureTake all your knowledge and awareness and gather it into the same point until you can clearly see the truth that all of these things by their nature simply arise and pass awayDont try to latch onto the things you know  your preoccupations  as yoursDont try to latch onto the knowledge that has come from within you as your ownLet these things be in line with their own inherent natureIf you latch onto your preoccupations youre latching onto stress and painIf you hold onto your knowledge it will turn into the cause of stressSo A mind centered and still gives rise to knowledgeThis knowledge is the pathAll of the things that come passing by for you to know are stressDont let the mind fasten onto its knowledgeDont let it fasten onto the preoccupations that appear for you to knowLet them be in line with their naturePut your mind at easeDont fasten onto the mind or suppose it to be this or thatAs long as you suppose yourself youre suffering from obscured awarenessWhen you can truly know this the transcendent will arise within you  the noblest good the most exalted happiness a human being can knowTo summarize the basic steps to practice are as followsMake the mind dwell on good preoccupationsGather all good preoccupations into one  the singleness of meditative absorptionConsider this one preoccupation until you see how it is aniccam inconstant dukkham stressful and anatta not yourself or anyone else  empty and voidLet all good and bad preoccupations follow their own nature  because good and bad dwell together and are equal by natureLet the mind follow its own natureLet knowing follow its own natureKnowing doesnt arise and it doesnt fall awayThis is santidhamma  the reality of peaceIt knows goodness but the knowing isnt goodness and goodness isnt the knowingIt knows evil but the knowing isnt evil and evil isnt the knowingIn other words knowing isnt attached to knowledge or to the things knownIts nature is truly elemental  flawless and pure like a drop of water on a lotus leafThis is why its called asankhatadhatu the unfabricated property a true elementWhen you can follow these five steps youll find marvels appearing in your heart the skills and perfections that come from having practiced tranquillity and insight meditationYoull obtain the two types of results already mentionedtranscendent providing for the wellbeing of your heart bringing happiness that is calm cool and blooming leading all the way to Liberation  free from birth aging illness and deathThis has been a brief explanation of the main principles of breath meditationIf you have any questions or encounter any difficulties in putting these principles into practice and you wish to study directly with someone who teaches along these lines I will be happy to help you to the best of my ability so that we can all attain the peace and wellbeing taught by the religionMost people will find that Method which follows is easier and more relaxing than Method outlined aboveThere are seven basic stepsBe clearly aware of each inandout breathObserve the breath as it goes in and out noticing whether its comfortable or uncomfortable broad or narrow obstructed or freeflowing fast or slow short or long warm or coolIf the breath doesnt feel comfortable adjust it until it doesFor instance if breathing in long and out long is uncomfortable try breathing in short and out shortAs soon as you find that your breathing feels comfortable let this comfortable breath sensation spread to the different parts of the bodyTo begin with inhale the breath sensation at the base of the skull and let it flow all the way down the spineThen if you are male let it spread down your right leg to the sole of your foot to the ends of your toes and out into the airInhale the breath sensation at the base of the skull again and let it spread down your spine down your left leg to the ends of your toes and out into the airThen let the breath from the base of the skull spread down over both shoulders past your elbows and wrists to the tips of your fingers and out into the airLet the breath at the base of the throat spread down the central nerve at the front of the body past the lungs and liver all the way down to the bladder and colonInhale the breath right at the middle of the chest and let it go all the way down to your intestinesLet all these breath sensations spread so that they connect and flow together and youll feel a greatly improved sense of wellbeingLearn four ways of adjusting the breathBreathe whichever way is most comfortable for youOr better yet learn to breathe comfortably all four ways because your physical condition and your breath are always changingBecome acquainted with the bases or focal points for the mind  the resting spots of the breath  and center your awareness on whichever one seems most comfortableA few of these bases areIf you suffer from frequent headaches or nervous problems dont focus on any spot above the base of the throatAnd dont try to force the breath or put yourself into a tranceBreathe freely and naturallyLet the mind be at ease with the breath  but not to the point where it slips awaySpread your awareness  your sense of conscious feeling  throughout the entire bodyUnite the breath sensations throughout the body letting them flow together comfortably keeping your awareness as broad as possibleOnce youre fully aware of the aspects of the breath you already know in your body youll come to know all sorts of other aspects as wellThe breath by its nature has many facets breath sensations flowing in the nerves those flowing around and about the nerves those spreading from the nerves to every poreBeneficial breath sensations and harmful ones are mixed together by their very natureTo summarize for the sake of improving the energy already existing in every part of your body so that you can contend with such things as disease and pain and for the sake of clarifying the knowledge already within you so that it can become a basis for the skills leading to release and purity of heart  you should always bear these seven steps in mind because they are absolutely basic to every aspect of breath meditationWhen youve mastered them you will have cut a main roadAs for the side roads  the incidentals of breath meditation  there are plenty of them but they arent really importantYoull be perfectly safe if you stick to these seven steps and practice them as much as possibleOnce youve learned to put your breath in order its as if you have everyone in your home in orderThe incidentals of breath meditation are like people outside your home  in other words guestsOnce the people in your home are wellbehaved your guests will have to fall in lineThe guests here are the signs and vagrant breaths that will tend to pass within the range of the breath you are dealing with the various signs that arise from the breath and may appear as images  bright lights people animals yourself others or as sounds  the voices of people some you recognize and others you dontIn some cases the signs appear as smells  either fragrant or else foul like a corpseSometimes the inbreath can make you feel so full throughout the body that you have no sense of hunger or thirstSometimes the breath can send warm hot cold or tingling sensations through the bodySometimes it can cause things that never occurred to you before to spring suddenly to mindAll of these things are classed as guestsBefore you go receiving guests you should put your breath and mind into good order making them stable and secureIn receiving these guests you first have to bring them under your controlIf you cant control them dont have anything to do with themThey might lead you astrayBut if you can put them through their paces they can be of use to you later onTo put them through their paces means to change them at will through the power of thought  making them small large sending them far away bringing them up close making them appear and disappear sending them outside bringing them inOnly then will you be able to use them in training the mindOnce youve mastered these signs theyll give rise to heightened sensory powers the ability to see without opening your eyes the ability to hear fardistant sounds or smell fardistant aromas the ability to taste the various elements that exist in the air and can be of use to the body in overcoming feelings of hunger and desire the ability to give rise to certain feelings at will  to feel cool when you want to feel cool hot when you want to feel hot warm when you want to feel warm strong when you need strength  because the various elements in the world that can be physically useful to you will come and appear in your bodyThe mind too will be heightened and will have the power to develop the eye of intuition the ability to remember previous lives the ability to know where living beings are reborn after they die and the ability to cleanse the heart of the fermentations of defilementIf you have your wits about you you can receive these guests and put them to work in your homeThese are a few of the incidentals of breath meditationIf you come across them in your practice examine them thoroughlyDont be pleased by what appearsDont get upset or try to deny what appearsKeep your mind on an even keelStay neutralBe circumspectConsider carefully whatever appears to see whether its trustworthy or notOtherwise it might lead you to mistaken assumptionsGood and evil right and wrong high and low All depend on whether your heart is shrewd or dull and on how resourceful you areIf youre dullwitted even high things can become low and good things evilOnce you know the various aspects of the breath and its incidentals you can gain knowledge of the four Noble TruthsIn addition you can relieve physical pains as they arise in your bodyMindfulness is the active ingredient in the medicine the inandout breath is the solventMindfulness can cleanse and purify the breathA pure breath can cleanse the blood throughout the body and when the blood is cleansed it can relieve many of the bodys diseases and painsIf you suffer from nervous disorders for instance theyll completely disappearWhats more youll be able to strengthen the body so that you feel a greater sense of health and wellbeingWhen the body feels well the mind can settle down and restAnd once the mind is rested you gain strength the ability to relieve all feelings of pain while sitting in meditation so that you can go on sitting for hoursWhen the body is free from pain the mind is free from HindrancesBody and mind are both strongThis is called samadhibalam  the strength of concentrationWhen your concentration is strong like this it can give rise to discernment the ability to see stress its cause its disbanding and the path to its disbanding all clearly within the breathThis can be explained as followsThe inandout breath is stress  the inbreath the stress of arising the outbreath the stress of passing awayNot being aware of the breath as it goes in and out not knowing the characteristics of the breath is the cause of stressKnowing when the breath is coming in knowing when its going out knowing its characteristics clearly  ie keeping your views in line with the truth of the breath  is Right View part of the Noble PathKnowing which ways of breathing are uncomfortable knowing how to vary the breath knowing That way of breathing is uncomfortable Ill have to breathe like this in order to feel at ease This is Right ResolveThe mental factors that think about and correctly evaluate all aspects of the breath are Right SpeechKnowing various ways of improving the breath breathing for example in long and out long in short and out short in short and out long in long and out short until you come across the breath most comfortable for you This is Right ActionKnowing how to use the breath to purify the blood how to let this purified blood nourish the heart muscles how to adjust the breath so that it eases the body and soothes the mind how to breathe so that you feel full and refreshed in body and mind This is Right LivelihoodTrying to adjust the breath until it soothes the body and mind and to keep trying as long as you arent fully at ease is Right EffortBeing mindful and alert to the inandout breath at all times knowing the various aspects of the breath  the upflowing breath the downflowing breath the breath in the stomach the breath in the intestines the breath flowing along the muscles and out to every pore  keeping track of these things with every inandout breath This is Right MindfulnessA mind intent only on issues related to the breath not pulling any other objects in to interfere until the breath is refined giving rise to fixed absorption and then liberating insight right there This is Right ConcentrationTo think of the breath is termed vitakka directed thoughtTo adjust the breath and let it spread is called vicara evaluationWhen all aspects of the breath flow freely throughout the body you feel full and refreshed in body and mind This is piti raptureWhen body and mind are both at rest you feel serene and at ease This is sukha pleasureAnd once you feel pleasure the mind is bound to stay snug with a single preoccupation and not go straying after any others This is ekaggatarammana singleness of preoccupationThese five factors form the beginning stage of Right ConcentrationWhen all these parts of the Noble Path  virtue concentration and discernment  are brought together fully mature in the heart you gain insight into all aspects of the breath knowing that Breathing this way gives rise to skillful mental statesBreathing that way gives rise to unskillful mental states You arent caught up with the factors  the breath in all its aspects  that fabricate the body the factors that fabricate speech the factors that fabricate the mind whether for good or for illYou let them be in line with their inherent nature This is the disbanding of stressAnother even briefer way to express the four Noble Truths is this The inandout breath is the truth of stressNot being aware of the inbreath not being aware of the outbreath This is the cause of stress  obscured deluded awarenessSeeing into all aspects of the breath so clearly that you can let them go with no sense of attachment is the disbanding of stressBeing constantly mindful and alert to all aspects of the breath is the path to the disbanding of stressWhen you can do this you can say that youre correctly following the path of breath meditationYou have cognitive skill able to know all four Truths clearlyYou can attain releaseRelease is a mind that doesnt cling to low causes and low effects  ie stress and its cause or to high causes and high effects  the disbanding of stress and the path to its disbandingIts a mind unattached to the things that cause it to know unattached to knowledge unattached to knowingWhen you can separate these things youve mastered the skill of release  in other words when you know what forms the beginning what forms the end and what lies in between letting them be as they are on their own in line with the phraseTo be attached to the things that cause us to know  the elements khandhas the senses and their objects  is termed clinging to sensualityTo be attached to knowledge is termed clinging to viewsTo be unacquainted with pure knowing in and of itself is termed clinging to precepts and proceduresAnd when we cling in this way we are bound to be deluded by the factors that fabricate the body speech and the mind all of which arise from obscured awarenessThe Buddha was a complete master of both cause and effect without being attached either to low causes and low effects or to high causes and high effectsHe was above cause and beyond effectStress and ease were both at his disposal but he was attached to neither of themHe fully knew both good and evil was fully equipped with both self and notself but wasnt attached to any of these thingsHe had at his disposal the objects that can act as the basis for the cause of stress but wasnt attached to themThe Path  discernment  was also at his disposal He knew how to appear either ignorant or shrewd and how to use both ignorance and shrewdness in his work of spreading the religionAnd as for the disbanding of stress he had it at his disposal but didnt cling to it wasnt attached to it which is why we can truly say that his mastery was completeBefore the Buddha was able to let go of these things in this way he first had to work at giving rise to them in full measureOnly then could he put them asideHe let go from abundance unlike ordinary people who let go out of povertyEven though he let these things go they were still at his disposalHe never dismissed the virtue concentration and discernment he had worked at perfecting up to the day of his AwakeningHe continued using every aspect of virtue concentration and discernment to the day he entered total LiberationEven the moment he was about to nibbana he was practicing his full command of concentration  in other words his total Liberation occurred when he was between the jhanas of form and formlessnessSo we shouldnt dismiss virtue concentration and discernmentSome people wont observe the precepts because theyre afraid of getting tied to themSome people wont practice concentration because theyre afraid of becoming ignorant or going insaneThe truth of the matter is that normally were already ignorant already insane and that to practice centering the mind is what will end our ignorance and cure our insanityOnce weve trained ourselves properly well give rise to pure discernment like a cut jewel that gives off light by its very natureThis is what qualifies as true discernmentIt arises for us individually and is termed paccattam We can give rise to it and know it only for ourselvesMost of us though tend to misunderstand the nature of discernmentWe take imitation discernment adulterated with concepts and use it to smother the real thing like a man who coats a piece of glass with mercury so that he can see his reflection and that of others thinking hes found an ingenious way of looking at the truthActually hes nothing more than a monkey looking in a mirror One monkey becomes two and will keep playing with its reflection until the mercury wears off at which point it becomes crestfallen not knowing what the reflection came from in the first placeSo it is when we gain imitation discernment unwittingly by thinking and conjecturing in line with concepts and preoccupations Were headed for sorrow when death meets us facetofaceThe crucial factor in natural discernment comes solely from training the mind to be like a diamond that gives off its own light  surrounded by radiance whether in dark places or brightA mirror is useful only in places already welllitIf you take it into the dark you cant use it to see your reflection at allBut a cut jewel that gives off its own light is brilliant everywhereThis is what the Buddha meant when he taught that there are no closed or secret places in the world where discernment cant penetrateThis jewel of discernment is what will enable us to destroy craving clinging and obscured awareness and to attain the highest excellence Liberation  free from pain death annihilation and extinction  existing naturally through the reality of deathlessnessBy and large we tend to be interested only in discernment and releaseAt the drop of a hat we want to start right in with the teachings on stress inconstancy and notself  and when this is the case well never get anywhereBefore the Buddha taught that things are inconstant he had worked at knowing them until they revealed their constancyBefore teaching that things are stressful he had turned that stress into pleasure and easeAnd before teaching that things are notself he had turned what is notself into a self and so was able to see what is constant and true lying hidden in what is inconstant stressful and notselfHe then gathered all of these qualities into oneHe gathered all that is inconstant stressful and notself into one and the same thing fabrications viewed in terms of the world  a single class equal everywhere throughout the worldAs for whats constant pleasant and self this was another class fabrications viewed in terms of the DhammaAnd then he let go of both classes without getting caught up on constant or inconstant stress or ease self or notself This is why we can say he attained release purity and Liberation for he had no need to latch onto fabrications  whether of the world or of the Dhamma  in any way at allThis was the nature of the Lord Buddhas practiceBut as for our own practice most of us act as if we have everything figured out beforehand and have succeeded even before we startIn other words we want simply to let go and attain peace and releaseBut if we havent laid the full groundwork our lettinggo is bound to be lacking Our peace is bound to be piecemeal our release is bound to be wrongThose of us who sincerely mean well and want only the highest good should ask ourselves Have we laid the proper foundationIf we dont lay the proper foundation for release and letting go how will we ever be freeThe Buddha taught that virtue can overcome common defilements the gross faults in our words and deeds that concentration can overcome such intermediate defilements as sensual desires ill will torpor restlessness and uncertainty and that discernment can overcome such subtle defilements as craving clinging and obscured awarenessYet some people whose discernment is sharp who can clearly explain subtle points of doctrine cant seem to shake off the more common defilements that even virtue can overcomeThis shows that something must be lacking in their virtue concentration and discernmentTheir virtues are probably all on the surface their concentration splotchy and stained their discernment a smearedon gloss  like the glass coated with mercury  which is why they cant attain the goalTheir actions fall under the old saying Keeping a sword outside the scabbard  having a way with words and theories but no center for the mind laying an egg outside the nest  looking for goodness only outside without training the mind to be centered resting a foundation on the sand  trying to find security in things of no substanceAll of this is bound to bring disappointmentSuch people have yet to find a worthwhile refugeSo we should lay the groundwork and put the causes into good working order because all the attainments we hope for come springing from causesNow we will summarize the methods of breath meditation under the headings of jhanaJhana means to be absorbed or focused in a single object or preoccupation as when we deal with the breathThe first jhana has five factorsDirected thought Think of the breath until you can keep it in mind without getting distractedSingleness of preoccupation Keep the mind with the breathDont let it stray after other concepts or preoccupationsWatch over your thoughts so that they deal only with the breath to the point where the breath becomes comfortableEvaluation Gain a sense of how to let this comfortable breath sensation spread and connect with the other breath sensations in the bodyLet these breath sensations spread until theyre interconnected all over the bodyOnce the body has been soothed by the breath feelings of pain will grow calmThe body will be filled with good breath energyThese three qualities must be brought together to bear on the same stream of breathing for the first jhana to ariseThis stream of breathing can then take you all the way to the fourth jhanaDirected thought singleness of preoccupation and evaluation act as the causesWhen the causes are fully ripe results will appear  rapture a compelling sense of fullness and refreshment for body and mind going straight to the heart independent of all else pleasure physical ease arising from the bodys being still and unperturbed mental contentment arising from the minds being at ease on its own undistracted unperturbed serene and exultantRapture and pleasure are the resultsThe factors of the first jhana thus come down simply to two sorts causes and resultsAs rapture and pleasure grow stronger the breath becomes more subtleThe longer you stay focused and absorbed the more powerful the results becomeThis enables you to set directed thought and evaluation aside and  relying completely on a single factor singleness of preoccupation  you enter the second jhanaThe second jhana has three factors rapture pleasure and singleness of preoccupationThis refers to the state of mind that has tasted the results coming from the first jhanaOnce you have entered the second level rapture and pleasure become stronger because they rely on a single cause singleness of preoccupation which looks after the work from here on in focusing on the breath so that it becomes more and more refined keeping steady and still with a sense of refreshment and ease for both body and mindThe mind is even more stable and intent than beforeAs you continue focusing rapture and pleasure grow stronger and begin to expand and contractContinue focusing on the breath moving the mind deeper to a more subtle level to escape the motions of rapture and pleasure and you enter the third jhanaThe third jhana has two factors pleasure and singleness of preoccupationThe body is quiet motionless and solitaryNo feelings of pain arise to disturb itThe mind is solitary and stillThe breath is refined freeflowing and broadA radiance  white like cotton wool  pervades the entire body stilling all feelings of physical and mental discomfortKeep focused on looking after nothing but the broad refined breathThe mind is free No thoughts of past or future disturb itThe mind stands out on its ownThe four properties  earth water fire and wind  are in harmony throughout the bodyYou could almost say that theyre pure throughout the entire body because the breath has the strength to control and take good care of the other properties keeping them harmonious and coordinatedMindfulness is coupled with singleness of preoccupation which acts as the causeThe breath fills the bodyMindfulness fills the bodyFocus on in The mind is bright and powerful the body is lightFeelings of pleasure are stillYour sense of the body feels steady and even with no slips or gaps in your awareness so you can let go of your sense of pleasureThe manifestations of pleasure grow still because the four properties are balanced and free from motionSingleness of preoccupation the cause has the strength to focus more heavily down taking you to the fourth jhanaThe fourth jhana has two factors equanimity and singleness of preoccupation or mindfulnessEquanimity and singleness of preoccupation on the fourth jhana are powerfully focused  solid stable and sureThe breath property is absolutely quiet free from ripples crosscurrents and gapsThe mind neutral and still is free of all preoccupations with past and futureThe breath which forms the present is still like the ocean or air when they are free from currents or wavesYou can know distant sights and sounds because the breath is even and unwavering acting like a movie screen that gives a clear reflection of whatever is projected onto itKnowledge arises in the mind You know but stay neutral and stillThe mind is neutral and still the breath neutral and still past present and future are all neutral and stillThis is true singleness of preoccupation focused on the unperturbed stillness of the breathAll parts of the breath in the body connect so that you can breathe through every poreYou dont have to breathe through the nostrils because the inandout breath and the other aspects of the breath in the body form a single unified wholeAll aspects of the breath energy are even and fullThe four properties all have the same characteristicsThe mind is completely stillThe mind sheds light in all directionsThe breath is radiant the mind fully radiant due to the focusing of mindfulnessThe focus is strong the light aglow The mind has power and authorityAll four of the frames of reference are gathered into oneThere is no sense that Thats the body Thats a feeling Thats the mind Thats a mental quality Theres no sense that theyre fourThis is thus called the great frame of reference because none of the four are in any way separateMindfulness and alertness converge into one This is what is meant by the one path  the concord among the properties and frames of reference four in one giving rise to great energy and wakefulness the purifying inner fire that can thoroughly dispel all obscuring darknessAs you focus more strongly on the radiance of the mind power comes from letting go of all preoccupationsThe mind stands alone like a person who has climbed to the top of a mountain and so has the right to see in all directionsThe minds dwelling  the breath which supports the minds prominence and freedom  is in a heightened state so the mind is able to see clearly the locations of all Dhamma fabrications  ie elements khandhas and sense mediaJust as a person who has taken a camera up in an airplane can take pictures of practically everything below so a person who has reached this stage can see the world and the Dhamma as they truly areIn addition awareness of another sort in the area of the mind  called liberating insight or the skill of release  also appearsThe elements or properties of the body acquire potency the mind resilient powerWhen you want knowledge of the world or the Dhamma focus the mind heavily and forcefully on the breathAs the concentrated power of the mind strikes the pure element intuitive knowledge will spring up in that element just as the needle of a record player as it strikes a record will give rise to soundsOnce your mindfulness is focused on a pure object then if you want images images will appear if sounds sounds will arise whether near or far matters of the world or the Dhamma concerning yourself or others past present or future  whatever you want to knowAs you focus down think of what you want to know and it will appearThis is ñana  intuitive sensitivity capable of knowing past present and future  an important level of awareness that you can know only for yourselfThe elements are like radio waves going through the airIf your mind and mindfulness are strong and your skills highly developed you can use those elements to put yourself in touch with the entire world so that knowledge can arise within youWhen you have mastered the fourth jhana it can act as the basis for eight skillsManomayiddhi psychic powers  the ability to use thoughts to influence eventsIddhividhi the ability to display supranormal powers eg creating images in certain instances that certain groups of people will be able to seeDibbasota the ability to hear distant soundsCetopariyañana the ability to know the level  good or evil high or low  of other peoples mindsPubbenivasanussatiñana the ability to remember previous lifetimesDibbacakkhu the ability to see gross and subtle images both near and farAsavakkhayañana the ability to reduce and eliminate the effluents of defilement in the heartThese eight skills come exclusively from the centering the mind which is why I have written this condensed guide to concentration and jhana based on the technique of keeping the breath in mindIf you aspire to the good that can come from these things you should turn your attention to training your own heart and mindIf when youre sitting you arent yet able to observe the breath tell yourself Now Im going to breathe inNow Im going to breathe out In other words at this stage youre the one doing the breathingYoure not letting the breath come in and out as it naturally wouldIf you can keep this in mind each time you breathe youll soon be able to catch hold of the breathIn keeping your awareness inside your body dont try to imprison it thereIn other words dont try to force the mind into a trance dont try to force the breath or hold it to the point where you feel uncomfortable or confinedYou have to let the mind have its freedomSimply keep watch over it to make sure that it stays separate from its thoughtsIf you try to force the breath and pin the mind down your body is going to feel restricted and you wont feel at ease in your workYoull start hurting here and aching there and your legs may fall asleepSo just let the mind be its natural self keeping watch to make sure that it doesnt slip out after external thoughtsWhen we keep the mind from slipping out after its concepts and concepts from slipping into the mind its like closing our windows and doors to keep dogs cats and thieves from slipping into our houseWhat this means is that we close off our sense doors and dont pay any attention to the sights that come in by way of the eyes the sounds that come in by way of the ears the smells that come in by way of the nose the tastes that come in by way of the tongue the tactile sensations that come in by way of the body and the preoccupations that come in by way of the mindWe have to cut off all the perceptions and concepts  good or bad old or new  that come in by way of these doorsCutting off concepts like this doesnt mean that we stop thinkingIt simply means that we bring our thinking inside to put it to good use by observing and evaluating the theme of our meditationIf we put our mind to work in this way we wont be doing any harm to ourself or to our mindActually our mind tends to be working all the time but the work it gets involved in is usually a lot of nonsense a lot of fuss and bother without any real substanceSo we have to find work of real value for it to do  something that wont harm it something really worth doingThis is why were doing breath meditation focusing on our breathing focusing on our mindPut aside all your other work and be intent on doing just this and nothing elseThis is the sort of attitude you need when you meditateThe Hindrances that come from our concepts of past and future are like weeds growing in our fieldThey steal all the nutrients from the soil so that our crops wont have anything to feed on and they make the place look like a messTheyre of no use at all except as food for the cows and other animals that come wandering throughIf you let your field get filled with weeds this way your crops wont be able to growIn the same way if you dont clear your mind of its preoccupation with concepts you wont be able to make your heart pureConcepts are food only for the ignorant people who think theyre delicious but sages dont eat them at allThe five Hindrances  sensual desire ill will torpor  lethargy restlessness  anxiety and uncertainty  are like different kinds of weedsRestlessness  anxiety is probably the most poisonous of the lot because it makes us distracted unsettled and anxious all at the same timeIts the kind of weed with thorns and sharpedged leavesIf you run into it youre going to end up with a stinging rash all over your bodySo if you come across it destroy itDont let it grow in your field at allBreath meditation  keeping the breath steadily in mind  is the best method the Buddha taught for wiping out these HindrancesWe use directed thought to focus on the breath and evaluation to adjust itDirected thought is like a plow evaluation like a harrowIf we keep plowing and harrowing our field weeds wont have a chance to grow and our crops are sure to prosper and bear abundant fruitThe field here is our bodyIf we put a lot of thought and evaluation into our breathing the four properties of the body will be balanced and at peaceThe body will be healthy and strong the mind relaxed and wide open free from HindrancesWhen youve got your field cleared and leveled like this the crops of your mind  the qualities of the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha  are sure to prosperAs soon as you bring the mind to the breath youll feel a sense of rapture and refreshmentThe four bases of attainment  the desire to practice persistence in the practice intentness and circumspection in your practice  will develop step by stepThese four qualities are like the four legs of a table that keep it stable and uprightTheyre a form of power that supports our strength and our progress to higher levelsTo make another comparison these four qualities are like the ingredients in a health tonicWhoever takes this tonic will have a long lifeIf you want to die you dont have to take it but if you dont want to die you have to take a lotThe more you take it the faster the diseases in your mind will disappearIn other words your defilements will dieSo if you know that your mind has a lot of diseases this is the tonic for youWhen you sit and meditate even if you dont gain any intuitive insights make sure at least that you know this much When the breath comes in you knowWhen it goes out you knowWhen its long you knowWhen its short you knowWhether its comfortable or uncomfortable you knowIf you can know this much youre doing fineAs for the various thoughts and concepts that come into the mind brush them away  whether theyre good or bad whether they deal with the past or the futureDont let them interfere with what youre doing  and dont go chasing after them to straighten them outWhen a thought of this sort comes passing in simply let it go passing onKeep your awareness unperturbed in the presentWhen we say that the mind goes here or there its not really the mind that goesOnly concepts goConcepts are like shadows of the mindIf the body is still how will its shadow moveThe movement of the body is what causes the shadow to move and when the shadow moves how will you catch hold of itShadows are hard to catch hard to shake off hard to set stillThe awareness that forms the present Thats the true mindThe awareness that goes chasing after concepts is just a shadowReal awareness  knowing  stays in placeIt doesnt stand walk come or goAs for the mind  the awareness that doesnt act in any way coming or going forward or back  its quiet and unperturbedAnd when the mind is thus its normal even undistracted self  ie when it doesnt have any shadows  we can rest peacefullyBut if the mind is unstable uncertain and wavering concepts arise and go flashing out  and we go chasing after them hoping to drag them back inThe chasing after them is where we go wrongThis is what we have to correctTell yourself Nothing is wrong with your mindJust watch out for the shadowsYou cant improve your shadowSay your shadow is blackYou can scrub it with soap till your dying day and itll still be black  because theres no substance to itSo it is with your conceptsYou cant straighten them out because theyre just images deceiving youThe Buddha thus taught that whoever isnt acquainted with the self the body the mind and its shadows is suffering from avijja  darkness deluded knowledgeWhoever thinks the mind is the self the self is the mind the mind is its concepts  whoever has things all mixed up like this  is deluded and lost like a person lost in the jungleTo be lost in the jungle brings countless hardshipsThere are wild beasts to worry about problems in finding food to eat and a place to sleepNo matter which way you look theres no way outBut if were lost in the world its many times worse than being lost in the jungle because we cant tell night from dayWe have no chance to find any brightness because our minds are dark with avijjaThe purpose of training the mind to be still is to simplify thingsWhen things are simplified the mind can settle down and restAnd when the mind has rested itll gradually become bright in and of itself and give rise to knowledgeBut if we let things get complicated  if we let the mind get mixed up with sights sounds smells tastes tactile sensations and ideas  thats darknessKnowledge wont have a chance to ariseWhen intuitive knowledge does arise it can  if you know how to use it  lead to liberating insightBut if you let yourself get carried away by knowledge of the past or future you wont get beyond the mundane levelIn other words if you dabble too much in knowledge of physical things without gaining wisdom with regard to the workings of the mind it can leave you spiritually immatureSay for example that a vision arises and you get hooked You gain knowledge of your past lives and get all excitedThings you never knew before now you can knowThings you never saw before now you see  and they can make you overly pleased or upsetWhyBecause you take them all too seriouslyYou may see a vision of yourself prospering as a lord or master a great emperor or king wealthy and influentialIf you let yourself feel pleased thats indulgence in pleasureYouve strayed from the Middle PathOr you may see yourself as something you wouldnt care to be a pig or a dog a bird or a rat crippled or deformedIf you let yourself get upset thats indulgence in selfaffliction  and again youve strayed from the pathSome people really let themselves get carried away As soon as they start seeing things they begin to think that theyre special somehow better than other peopleThey let themselves become proud and conceited  and the right path has disappeared without their even knowing itIf youre not careful this is where mundane knowledge can lead youBut if you keep one principle firmly in mind you can stay right on the path Whatever appears good or bad true or false dont let yourself feel pleased dont let yourself get upsetKeep the mind balanced and neutral and discernment will ariseYoull see that the vision or sign displays the truth of stress it arises fades and disappearsIf you get hooked on your intuitions youre asking for troubleKnowledge that proves false can hurt youKnowledge that proves true can really hurt youIf what you know is true and you go telling other people youre braggingIf it turns out to be false it can backfire on youThis is why those who truly know say that knowledge is the essence of stress It can hurt youKnowledge is part of the flood of views and opinions over which we have to crossIf you hang onto knowledge youve gone wrongIf you know simply know and let it go at thatYou dont have to be excited or pleasedYou dont have to go telling other peoplePeople whove studied abroad when they come back to the rice fields dont tell what theyve learned to the folks at homeThey talk about ordinary things in an ordinary wayThe reason they dont talk about the things theyve studied is because no one would understand them it wouldnt serve any purposeEven with people who would understand them they dont display their learningSo it should be when you practice meditationNo matter how much you know you have to act as if you know nothing because this is the way people with good manners normally actIf you go bragging to other people its bad enoughIf they dont believe you it can get even worseSo whatever you know simply be aware of it and let it goDont let there be the assumption that I know When you can do this your mind can attain the transcendent free from attachmentEverything in the world has its truthEven things that arent true are true  ie their truth is that theyre falseThis is why we have to let go of both whats true and whats falseOnce we know the truth and can let it go we can be at our easeWe wont be poor because the truth  the Dhamma  will still be there with usWe wont be left emptyhandedIts like having a lot of money Instead of lugging it around with us we keep it piled up at homeWe may not have anything in our pockets but were still not poorThe same is true with people who really knowEven when they let go of their knowledge its still thereThis is why the minds of the Noble Ones arent left adriftThey let things go but not in a wasteful or irresponsible wayThey let go like rich people Even though they let go theyve still got piles of wealthAs for people who let things go like paupers they dont know whats worthwhile and whats notWhen they throw away the things that are worthwhile theyre simply heading for disasterFor instance they may see that theres no truth to anything  no truth to the khandhas no truth to the body no truth to stress its cause its disbanding or the path to its disbanding no truth to LiberationThey dont use their brains at allTheyre too lazy to do anything so they let go of everything throw it all awayThis is called letting go like a pauperLike a lot of modernday sages When they come back after they die theyre going to be poor all over againAs for the Buddha he let go only of the true and false things that appeared in his body and mind  but he didnt abandon his body and mind which is why he ended up rich with plenty of wealth to hand down to his descendantsThis is why his descendants never have to worry about being poorSo we should look to the Buddha as our modelIf we see that the khandhas are worthless  inconstant stressful notself and all that  and simply let go of them by neglecting them were sure to end up poorLike a stupid person who feels so repulsed by a festering sore on his body that he wont touch it and so lets it go without taking care of it Theres no way the sore is going to healAs for intelligent people they know how to wash their sores put medicine and bandages on them so that eventually theyre sure to recoverIn the same way when people see only the drawbacks to the khandhas without seeing their good side and so let them go without putting them to any worthwhile or skillful use nothing good will come of itBut if were intelligent enough to see that the khandhas have their good side as well as their bad and then put them to good use by meditating to gain discernment into physical and mental phenomena were going to be richOnce we have the truth  the Dhamma  as our wealth we wont suffer if we have money and wont suffer if we dont for our minds will be transcendentThe various forms of rust  greed anger and delusion  that have been obscuring our senses will all fall awayOur eyes ears nose tongue and body will be entirely clean clear and bright for as the Buddha said the Dhamma  discernment  is like a lampOur mind far distant from all forms of trouble and suffering will stay in the current flowing on to LiberationWhen feelings of pain or discomfort arise while youre sitting in meditation examine them to see what they come fromDont let yourself be pained or upset by themIf there are parts of the body that wont go as youd like them to dont worry about themLet them be  because your body is the same as every other body human or animal throughout the world Its inconstant stressful and cant be forcedSo stay with whatever part does go as youd like it to and keep it comfortableThis is called dhammavicaya being selective in whats goodThe body is like a tree No tree is entirely perfectAt any one time itll have new leaves and old leaves green leaves and yellow fresh leaves and dryThe dry leaves will fall away first while those that are fresh will slowly dry out and fall away laterSome of the branches are long some thick and some smallThe fruits arent evenly distributedThe human body isnt really much different from thisPleasure and pain arent evenly distributedThe parts that ache and those that are comfortable are randomly mixedYou cant rely on itSo do your best to keep the comfortable parts comfortableDont worry about the parts that you cant make comfortableIts like going into a house where the floorboards are beginning to rot If you want to sit down dont choose a rotten spotChoose a spot where the boards are still soundIn other words the heart neednt concern itself with things that cant be controlledOr you can compare the body to a mango If a mango has a rotten or a wormy spot take a knife and cut it outEat just the good part remainingIf youre foolish enough to eat the wormy part youre in for troubleYour body is the same and not just the body  the mind too doesnt always go as youd like it toSometimes its in a good mood sometimes its notThis is where you have to use as much thought and evaluation as possibleDirected thought and evaluation are like doing a jobThe job here is concentration centering the mind in stillnessFocus the mind on a single object and then use your mindfulness and alertness to examine and reflect on itIf you use a meager amount of thought and evaluation your concentration will give meager resultsIf you do a crude job youll get crude resultsIf you do a fine job youll get fine resultsCrude results arent worth muchFine results are of high quality and are useful in all sorts of ways  like atomic radiation which is so fine that it can penetrate even mountainsCrude things are of low quality and hard to useSometimes you can soak them in water all day long and they still dont soften upBut as for fine things all they need is a little dampness in the air and they dissolveSo it is with the quality of your concentrationIf your thinking and evaluation are subtle thorough and circumspect your concentration work will result in more and more stillness of mindIf your thinking and evaluation are slipshod and crude you wont get much stillnessYour body will ache and youll feel restless and irritableOnce the mind can become very still though the body will be comfortable and at easeYour heart will feel open and clearPains will disappearThe elements of the body will feel normal The warmth in your body will be just right neither too hot nor too coldAs soon as your work is finished itll result in the highest form of happiness and ease nibbana  LiberationBut as long as you still have work to do your heart wont get its full measure of peaceWherever you go there will always be something nagging at the back of your mindOnce your work is done though you can be carefree wherever you goIf you havent finished your job its because you havent set your mind on it and you havent actually done the workYouve shirked your duties and played truantBut if you really set your mind on doing the job theres no doubt but that youll finish itOnce youve realized that the body is inconstant stressful and cant be forced you should keep your mind on an even keel with regard to itInconstant means that it changesStressful doesnt refer solely to aches and painsIt refers to pleasure as well  because pleasure is inconstant and undependable tooA little pleasure can turn into a lot of pleasure or into painPain can turn back into pleasure and so onSo we shouldnt be all that concerned about pleasure and painThink of the body as having two parts like the mangoIf you focus your attention on the comfortable part your mind can be at peaceLet the pains be in the other partOnce you have an object of meditation you have a comfortable place for your mind to stayYou dont have to dwell on your painsYou have a comfortable house to live in Why go sleep in the dirtWe all want nothing but goodness but if you cant tell whats good from whats defiled you can sit and meditate till your dying day and never find nibbana at allBut if youre knowledgeable and intent on what youre doing its not all that hardNibbana is really a simple matter because its always thereIt never changesThe affairs of the world are whats hard because theyre always changing and uncertainToday theyre one way tomorrow anotherOnce youve done something you have to keep looking after itBut you dont have to look after nibbana at allOnce youve realized it you can let it goKeep on realizing keep on letting go  like a person eating rice who after hes put the rice in his mouth keeps spitting it out rather than letting it become feces in his intestinesWhat this means is that you keep on doing good but dont claim it as your ownDo good and then spit it outThis is viragadhamma disengagementMost people in the world once theyve done something latch onto it as theirs  and so they have to keep looking after itIf theyre not careful itll either get stolen or else wear out on its ownTheyre headed for disappointmentLike a person who swallows his rice After hes eaten hell have to defecateAfter hes defecated hell be hungry again so hell have to eat again and defecate againThe day will never come when hes had enoughBut with nibbana you dont have to swallowYou can eat your rice and then spit it outYou can do good and let it goIts like plowing a field The dirt falls off the plow on its ownYou dont need to scoop it up and put it in a bag tied to your water buffalos legWhoever is stupid enough to scoop up the dirt as it falls off the plow and stick it in a bag will never get anywhereEither his buffalo will get bogged down or else hell trip over the bag and fall flat on his face right there in the middle of the fieldThe field will never get plowed the rice will never get sown the crop will never get gatheredHell have to go hungryBuddho our meditation word is the name of the Buddha after his AwakeningIt means someone who has blossomed who is awake who has suddenly come to his sensesFor six long years before his Awakening the Buddha traveled about searching for the truth from various teachers all without successSo he went off on his own and on a fullmoon evening in May sat down under the Bodhi tree vowing not to get up until he had attained the truthFinally toward dawn as he was meditating on his breath he gained AwakeningHe found what he was looking for  right at the tip of his noseNibbana doesnt lie far awayIts right at our lips right at the tip of our noseBut we keep groping around and never find itIf youre really serious about finding purity set your mind on meditation and nothing elseAs for whatever else may come your way you can say No thanks PleasureNo thanks PainNo thanks GoodnessNo thanks EvilNo thanks Paths and fruitionsNo thanks NibbanaNo thanks If its no thanks to everything what will you have leftYou wont need to have anything leftThats nibbanaLike a person without any money How will thieves be able to rob himIf you get money and try to hold onto it youre going to get killedThis you want to takeThat you want to takeCarry whats yours around till youre completely weighed downYoull never get awayIn this world we have to live with both good and evilPeople who have developed disengagement are filled with goodness and know evil fully but dont hold onto either dont claim either as their ownThey put them aside let them go and so can travel light and easyNibbana isnt all that difficult a matterIn the Buddhas time some people became arahants while going on their almsround some while urinating some while watching farmers plowing a fieldWhats difficult about the highest good lies in the beginning in laying the groundwork  being constantly mindful and alert examining and evaluating your breath at all timesBut if you can keep at it youre bound to succeed in the endThe breath is a mirror for the mindIf the mirror is abnormal it gives abnormal reflectionsSay you look into a convex mirror Your reflection will be taller than you areIf you look in a concave mirror your reflection will be abnormally shortBut if you look into a mirror thats flat smooth and normal itll give you a true reflection of yourselfIf you polish the mirror so that its clean and bright  in other words if you use evaluation to adjust and expand the breath so that its comfortable  your reflection will be sharp and clearKnowing how to adjust the breath putting it in good order is tantamount to putting the mind in good order as well and can give all kinds of benefits  like a good cook who knows how to vary the foods she serves sometimes changing the color sometimes the flavor sometimes the shape so that her employer will never grow tired of her cookingIf she fixes the same thing all year around  porridge today porridge tomorrow porridge the next day  her employer is bound to go looking for a new cookBut if she knows how to vary her offerings so that her employer is always satisfied shes sure to get a raise in her salary or maybe a special bonusSo it is with the breathIf you know how to adjust and vary the breath  if youre always thinking about and evaluating the breath  youll become thoroughly mindful and expert in all matters dealing with the breath and the other elements of the bodyYoull always know how things are going with the bodyRapture ease and singleness of preoccupation will come on their ownThe body will be refreshed the mind contentBoth body and mind will be at peaceAll the elements will be at peace free from unrest and disturbancesIts like knowing how to look after a small childIf the child starts crying you know when to give it milk or candy when to give it a bath when to take it out for some air when to put it in a playpen and give it a doll to play withIn no time at all the child will stop crying stop whining and leave you free to finish whatever work you have to doThe mind is like a small innocent childIf youre skilled at looking after it itll be obedient happy and contented and will grow day by dayWhen the body and mind are full and content they wont feel hungryThey wont have to go opening up the pots and pans on the stove or pace around looking out the windows and doorsThey can sleep in peace without any disturbancesGhosts and demons  the pains of the khandhas  wont come and possess themThis way we can be at our ease because when we sit we sit with peopleWhen we lie down we lie down with peopleWhen we eat we eat with peopleWhen people live with people theres no problem but when they live with ghosts and demons theyre sure to squabble and never find any peaceIf we dont know how to evaluate and adjust our breathing theres no way our meditation will give any resultsEven if we sit till we die we wont gain any knowledge or understanding at allThere was once an old monk  years old years in the monkhood  who had heard good things about how I teach meditation and so came to study with meThe first thing he asked was What method do you teachBreath meditation I told himYou know  buddho buddhoAs soon as he heard that he said Ive been practicing that method ever since the time of Ajaan Mun  buddho buddho ever since I was young  and Ive never seen anything good come of itAll it does is buddho buddho without ever getting anywhere at allAnd now youre going to teach me to buddho some moreWhat forYou want me to buddho till I dieThis is what happens when people have no sense of how to adjust and evaluate their breathing Theyll never find what theyre looking for  which is why adjusting and spreading the breath is a very important part of doing breath meditationGetting to know yourself  becoming acquainted with your body your mind the elements knowing what they come from how they arise how they disband how theyre inconstant stressful and notself All of this you have to find out by exploring on your ownIf your knowledge simply follows whats in books or what other people tell you its knowledge that comes from labels and concepts not from your own discernmentIts not really knowledgeIf you know only what other people tell you youre following them down a road  and what could be good about thatThey might lead you down the wrong roadAnd if the road is dusty they might kick dust into your ears and eyesSo in your search for the truth dont simply believe what other people sayDont believe labelsPractice centering the mind until you gain knowledge on your ownOnly then will it be insightOnly then will it be trustworthyWhen you meditate you have to thinkIf you dont think you cant meditate because thinking forms a necessary part of meditationTake jhana for instanceUse your powers of directed thought to bring the mind to the object and your powers of evaluation to be discriminating in your choice of an objectExamine the object of your meditation until you see that its just right for youYou can choose slow breathing fast breathing short breathing long breathing narrow breathing broad breathing hot cool or warm breathing a breath that goes only as far as the nose a breath that goes only as far as the base of the throat a breath that goes all the way down to the heartWhen youve found an object that suits your taste catch hold of it and make the mind one focused on a single objectOnce youve done this evaluate your objectDirect your thoughts to making it stand outDont let the mind leave the objectDont let the object leave the mindTell yourself that its like eating Put the food in line with your mouth put your mouth in line with the foodDont missIf you miss and go sticking the food in your ear under your chin in your eye or on your forehead youll never get anywhere in your eatingSo it is with your meditationSometimes the one object of your mind takes a sudden sharp turn into the past back hundreds of yearsSometimes it takes off into the future and comes back with all sorts of things to clutter your mindThis is like taking your food sticking it up over your head and letting it fall down behind you  the dogs are sure to get it or like bringing the food to your mouth and then tossing it out in front of youWhen you find this happening its a sign that your mind hasnt been made snug with its objectYour powers of directed thought arent firm enoughYou have to bring the mind to the object and then keep after it to make sure it stays putLike eating Make sure the food is in line with the mouth and stick it right inThis is directed thought The food is in line with the mouth the mouth is in line with the foodYoure sure its food and you know what kind it is  main course or dessert coarse or refinedOnce you know whats what and its in your mouth chew it right upThis is evaluation examining reviewing your meditationSometimes this comes under threshold concentration  examining a coarse object to make it more and more refinedIf you find that the breath is long examine long breathingIf its short examine short breathingIf its slow examine slow breathing  to see if the mind will stay with that kind of breathing to see if that kind of breathing will stay with the mind to see whether the breath is smooth and unhinderedThis is evaluationWhen the mind gives rise to directed thought and evaluation you have both concentration and discernmentDirected thought and singleness of preoccupation fall under the heading of concentration evaluation under the heading of discernmentWhen you have both concentration and discernment the mind is still and knowledge can ariseBut if theres too much evaluation it can destroy your stillness of mindIf theres too much stillness it can snuff out thoughtYou have to watch over the stillness of your mind to make sure you have things in the right proportionsIf you dont have a sense of just right youre in for troubleIf the mind is too still your progress will be slowIf you think too much itll run away with your concentrationSo observe things carefullyAgain its like eatingIf you go shoveling food into your mouth you might end up choking to deathYou have to ask yourself Is it good for meCan I handle itAre my teeth strong enoughSome people have nothing but empty gums and yet they want to eat sugar cane Its not normalSome people even though their teeth are aching and falling out still want to eat crunchy foodsSo it is with the mind As soon as its just a little bit still we want to see this know that  we want to take on more than we can handleYou first have to make sure that your concentration is solidly based that your discernment and concentration are properly balancedThis point is very importantYour powers of evaluation have to be ripe your directed thought firmSay you have a water buffalo tie it to a stake and pound the stake deep into the groundIf your buffalo is strong it just might walk or run away with the stakeYou have to know your buffalos strengthIf its really strong pound the stake so that its firmly in the ground and keep watch over itIn other words if you find that the obsessiveness of your thinking is getting out of hand going beyond the bounds of mental stillness then fix the mind in place and make it extra still  but not so still that you lose track of thingsIf the mind is too quiet its like being in a dazeYou dont know whats going on at allEverything is dark blotted outOr else you have good and bad spells sinking out of sight and then popping up againThis is concentration without directed thought or evaluation with no sense of judgment Wrong ConcentrationSo you have to be observantUse your judgment  but dont let the mind get carried away by its thoughtsYour thinking is something separateThe mind stays with the meditation objectWherever your thoughts may go spinning your mind is still firmly based  like holding onto a post and spinning around and aroundYou can keep on spinning and yet it doesnt wear you outBut if you let go of the post and spin around three times you get dizzy and  Bang fall flat on your faceSo it is with the mind If it stays with the singleness of its preoccupation it can keep thinking and not get tired not get harmed because your thinking and stillness are right there togetherThe more you think the more solid your mind getsThe more you sit and meditate the more you thinkThe mind becomes more and more firm until all the Hindrances fall awayThe mind no longer goes looking for conceptsNow it can give rise to knowledgeThe knowledge here isnt ordinary knowledgeIt washes away your old knowledgeYou dont want the knowledge that comes from ordinary thinking and reasoning Let go of itYou dont want the knowledge that comes from directed thought and evaluation StopMake the mind quietStillWhen the mind is still and unhindered this is the essence of all thats skillful and goodWhen your mind is on this level it isnt attached to any concepts at allAll the concepts youve known  dealing with the world or the Dhamma however many or few  are washed awayOnly when theyre washed away can new knowledge ariseThis is why you should let go of concepts  all the labels and names you have for thingsYou have to let yourself be poorIts when people are poor that they become ingenious and resourcefulIf you dont let yourself be poor youll never gain discernmentIn other words you dont have to be afraid of being stupid or of missing out on thingsYou dont have to be afraid that youve hit a dead endYou dont want any of the insights youve gained from listening to others or from reading books because theyre concepts and therefore inconstantYou dont want any of the insights youve gained by reasoning and thinking because theyre concepts and therefore notselfLet all these insights disappear leaving just the mind firmly intent leaning neither to the left toward being displeased nor to the right toward being pleasedKeep the mind still quiet neutral impassive  set tallAnd there you are Right ConcentrationWhen Right Concentration arises in the mind it has a shadowWhen you can catch sight of the shadow appearing thats vipassana liberating insightThe knowledge you gain from Right Concentration doesnt come in the form of thoughts or ideasIt comes as Right ViewsWhat looks wrong to you is really wrongWhat looks right is really rightIf what looks right is really wrong thats Wrong ViewIf what looks wrong is really right again  Wrong ViewWith Right View though right looks right and wrong looks wrongTo put it in terms of cause and effect you see the four Noble TruthsYou see stress and it really is stressfulYou see the cause of stress arising and that its really causing stressThese are Noble Truths absolutely undeniably indisputably trueYou see that stress has a causeOnce the cause arises there has to be stressAs for the way to the disbanding of stress you see that the path youre following will without a doubt lead to LiberationWhether or not you go all the way what you see is correctThis is Right ViewAnd as for the disbanding of stress you see that there really is such a thingYou see that as long as youre on the path stress does in fact fall awayWhen you come to realize the truth of these things in your heart thats vipassanañanaTo put it even more simply You see that all things inside as well as out are undependableThe body is undependable aging is undependable death is undependableTheyre slippery characters constantly changing on youTo see this is to see inconstancyDont let yourself be pleased by inconstancyDont let yourself be upsetKeep the mind neutral on an even keelThats whats meant by vipassanaAs for stress Say we hear that an enemy is sufferingGlad to hear it we thinkHope they hurry up and die The heart has tiltedSay we hear that a friend has become wealthy and we become happy or a son or daughter is ill and we become sadOur mind has fallen in with suffering and stressWhyBecause were unskilledThe mind isnt centered  ie its not in Right ConcentrationWe have to look after the mindDont let it fall in with stressWhatever suffers let it suffer but dont let the mind suffer with itThe body may be in pain but the mind isnt painedLet the body go ahead and suffer but the mind doesnt sufferKeep the mind neutralDont be pleased by pleasure  pleasure is a form of stress you knowHow soIt can changeIt can rise and fallIt can be high and lowIt cant lastThats stressPain is also stress double stressWhen you gain this sort of insight into stress  when you really see stress  vipassana has arisen in the mindAs for anatta notself Once weve examined things and seen them for what they really are we dont make claims we dont display influence we dont try to show that we have the right or the power to bring things that are notself under our controlNo matter how hard we try we cant prevent birth aging illness and deathIf the body is going to be old let it be oldIf its going to hurt let it hurtIf it has to die let it dieDont be pleased by death either your own or that of othersDont be upset by death your own or that of othersKeep the mind neutralUnruffledUnfazedThis is sankharupekkhañana letting sankharas  all things fashioned and fabricated  follow their own inherent natureThis briefly is vipassana You see that all fabrications are inconstant stressful and notselfYou can disentangle them from your graspYou can let goThis is where it gets goodHow soYou dont have to wear yourself out lugging sankharas aroundTo be attached means to carry a load and there are five heaps we carry attachment to physical phenomena to feelings to concepts and labels to mental fabrications and to sensory consciousnessWe grab hold and hang onto these things thinking that theyre the selfGo ahead Carry them aroundHang one load from your left leg and one from your rightPut one on your left shoulder and one on your rightPut the last load on your headAnd now Carry them wherever you go  clumsy encumbered and comicalThe Buddha taught that whoever lacks discernment whoever is unskilled whoever doesnt practice concentration leading to liberating insight will have to be burdened with stress will always be loaded downIts a pityIts a shameTheyll never get awayTheir legs are burdened their shoulders burdened  and where are they goingThree steps forward and two steps backSoon theyll get discouraged and then after a while theyll pick themselves up and get going againNow when we see inconstancy  that all fabrications whether within us or without are undependable when we see that theyre stressful when we see that theyre not our self that they simply whirl around in and of themselves When we gain these insights we can put down our burdens ie let go of our attachmentsWe can put down the past  ie stop dwelling in itWe can let go of the future  ie stop yearning for itWe can let go of the present  ie stop claiming it as the selfOnce these three big baskets have fallen from our shoulders we can walk with a light stepWe can even danceWere beautifulWherever we go people will be glad to know usWhyBecause were not encumberedWhatever we do we can do with easeWe can walk run dance and sing  all with a light heartWere Buddhisms beauty a sight for sore eyes graceful wherever we goNo longer burdened no longer encumbered we can be at our easeThis is vipassanañanaThe earliest editions of Keeping the Breath in Mind contain a version of Step in Method that Ajaan Lee later shortened and revised to its present formSome people though find the original version helpful so here it isObserve the breath as it goes in and out noticing whether its comfortable or uncomfortable broad or constricted obstructed or freeflowing fast or slow short or long warm or coolIf the breath doesnt feel comfortable adjust it until it doesFor instance if breathing in long and out long is uncomfortable try breathing in short and out shortAs soon as you find that your breath feels comfortable let this comfortable breath sensation spread to the different parts of your bodyFor example each time you breathe in and out once think of an important part of the body as followsAs you let the breath pass into the bronchial tubes think of it as going all the way down the right side of your abdomen to the bladderAs you take another inandout breath think of the breath as going from the main arteries to the liver and heart on down through your left side to the stomach and intestinesAs you take another inandout breath think of the breath as going from the base of the throat all the way down the internal side of the spineAs you take another inandout breath think of letting the breath go from the base of the throat down the front of your chest through to the tip of the breastbone to the navel and out into the airAs you take another inandout breath inhale the breath into the palate down to the base of the throat on through the middle of the chest to the large intestine the rectum and out into the airOnce youve completed these five turns inside the body let the breath flow along the outside of the bodyAs you take an inandout breath think of inhaling the breath at the base of the skull and letting it go all the way down the external side of the spineNow if youre male think first of your right side both with the legs and with the armsAs you take an inandout breath think of the right buttock and of letting the breath run all the way down the right leg to the tips of your toesAs you take another inandout breath think of the left buttock and of letting the breath run all the way down the left leg to the tips of your toesAs you take another inandout breath think of the base of the skull and of letting the breath run down your right shoulder along your right arm to the tips of your fingersAs you take another inandout breath inhale the breath into the base of the skull and let it run down your left shoulder along your arm to the tips of your fingersAs you take another inandout breath inhale the breath into the area inside your skull thinking of your ears  eyes  nose  mouthOnce youve finished keep careful watch over your breathMake the breath refined light and freeflowingKeep the mind steady and still in this breathMake your mindfulness and alertness thorough and circumspectLet the various breath sensations join and permeate throughout the bodyLet the mind be neutral impassive and wellcomposedIf anything in this translation is inaccurate or misleading I ask forgiveness of the author and reader for having unwittingly stood in their wayAs for whatever may be accurate I hope the reader will make the best use of it translating it a few steps further into the heart so as to attain the truth to which it points The translatorAjaan Lee composed the following three short essays when he was hospitalized in late shortly over a year before his deathThe style of presentation  outlines that are just barely fleshed out  is typical of his later writingsHe seems to have intended that the essays be given to hospital patients as food for thought for them to ponder while undergoing treatmentAlthough the presentation is ecumenical the basic points are straight BuddhismThe explanation of the two types of disease in the first essay follows one of the central insights of the Buddhas Awakening the realization that events in the present are conditioned both by past kamma and by present kammaThe four principles of human values presented in the second essay correspond to the four agatis or types of prejudice that the Buddha warned against prejudice based on likes and desires dislikes and anger delusion and fearThe third essay The Buddhist Way is a brief outline of the Buddhas teachings based on the synopsis of the Ovada Patimokkha a discourse the Buddha gave at the beginning of his career to arahant disciples before sending them out to spread the teaching and on an analysis of one of the basic Buddhist concepts that of sankhara which means force fashioning or compounded thingIn its form the analysis of two types of sankharas  those on the level of the world and those on the level of the Dhamma  is original with Ajaan Lee and is based on a Thai reading of two Pali compounds sankharaloka and sankharadhammaFrom the point of view of Pali grammar sankhara functions as the adjective in each of these compounds the first compound refers to the world of compounded things the second refers to compounded things as phenomena in and of themselvesThe two compounds were taken over straight into Thai but because Thai places its adjectives after the nouns they modify Ajaan Lee has interpreted loka and dhamma as adjectives modifying sankhara and thus he arrives at his own novel interpretation of the termsHis understanding of the aggregate of consciousness the fifth aggregate is also interesting in that it differs from most scholarly interpretationsOtherwise the content of his analysis is standard and the points he makes form a convenient synopsis of Pali Buddhist teachingsThere are two ways in which diseases can arise in our bodiesPhysical causes Physically caused diseases are those that come about through disorders in the five physical properties  bWater the liquid parts such as saliva mucus blood etccFire the warmth in the bodydWind forces that move back and forth through the body such as the breatheSpace the empty spaces that lie throughout the body through which the various elements of the body mingle and interactThese include such things as the ear canal the nasal passages the mouth the pores of the skin etcWhen these properties become upset or unbalanced they provide one sort of opening for disease to arise called dhatusamutthanaKammic causes Kammic diseases are those that arise from kammacitta or acts of the mind in which the mind becomes preoccupied with various upsetting or unwanted topicsAs we think more and more of these things our mental energy weakens our mind gets upset or unbalanced and ultimately disease can ariseThere are two ways of curing disease  but before treating our diseases we should first examine ourselves to see how they came about so that well be in a better position to cure themThe two ways of curing disease are through Dhamma medicine depending on ourselves to improve ourselves turning our minds to topics that are good worthwhile and wiseFor example we may make a vow to do good in any number of ways such as donating food to monks in such and such a manner becoming ordained and observing precepts of such and such a sort sponsoring the making of a Buddha image of such and such a variety or saying our chants and meditating in such and such a wayIn some cases when a good intention arises in the heart and we feel happy and expansive it gives energy to the heart and inner strength to the body through which we can alleviate any diseases that have arisenSome additional food for thought for sick people and the doctors who treat themOur duty when we are sick is to examine ourselves to find out the causes of our diseaseIf we arent capable of knowing on our own we should search out those who are and who will give us adviceFor example they may tell us that the kind of disease we have should be treated with pharmaceutical medicineWe should then contact a doctor so that he or she will have a chance to relieve our painOnce weve received advice from the doctor we have two dutiesWe shouldnt concern ourselves with whether well recover or dieThats the doctors responsibilityOur one responsibility is to look after our mind  to free our mind from the disease and to turn our thoughts to good and skillful topics so as to strengthen our morale as a way of helping the doctor whos looking after our diseaseWhen doctor and patient help each other in this way neither will be a burden to the otherThe doctor has freedom in treating our body we have freedom in the area of the mind and thus well have a chance to lessen our sufferingEven if we die both we and the doctor will have been working to the full extent of our abilities the doctor caring for our body while we care for the mindEven if we die we dont lose well have our own inner goodness to take along with usThus when we treat our disease in this way we can be said to have two types of medicine working for us pharmaceutical medicines which are the affair of the doctor and dhamma medicine which is our own affairIn this way we and our doctor will be able to help each other in looking after the quality of our lifeThese are the duties of sick peopleNow for the duties of the doctor As doctors we should inform ourselves of the causes of diseaseIf we know that a particular disease comes from physical causes we should prescribe the proper medicinesIf we see that the disease comes from kammic causes we should use other methods to improve our patients moraleFor example we can use a pleasing bedside manner or get the patient to feel welldisposed toward making merit encouraging him or her to donate food to monks to meditate or chant to make a vow to ordain for a period of time etc all as a means of turning the patients thoughts in the proper directionThis is called dhammamedicineIn some cases a disease that normally requires a great deal of medicine will disappear after using only a little medicineExperienced doctors are sure to have met with cases like thisFor example a patient is seriously ill but if we can find a way to console him and boost his morale the symptoms  instead of worsening as they normally might  grow less severe instead of dying today the patient may live on into next week or next monthSome people when theyve stepped on a thorn think that theyve been bitten by a snake and this can cause the pain to flare up immediatelyOther people when theyve been bitten by a poisonous centipede think that theyve stepped on a thorn and this can keep the poison of the centipede from causing much painIf they then go to an experienced doctor who tells them that theyve been bitten by a centipede they can then become upset and the pain will flare upCases like this all offer proof for the role that kamma plays in causing diseaseThe word kamma refers to two things Sometimes diseases can arise from new acts of the mindThis is called kammacittaFor example when we feel extreme anger hatred love or restlessness the mind is agitated in full force and the defilements that enwrap it splash into the body where they mix with the various properties of the body  in the blood for instance which then flows to the various parts of the body causing weakness and fatigueIf blood of this sort stagnates in a particular part of the body disease will arise right thereThe mind becomes murky the properties of the body are murkyAt the very least well feel not up to parIf we dont hurry to find a way to correct the situation disease will ariseHere we can make an analogy The mind is like a fish in a pondIf a person stirs up the water with a stick the fish will have to swim around in circles and the mucus covering its body will slough off into the waterThe water will become murky the mud at the bottom of the pond will get stirred up and the fish wont be able to seeAfter a while the mucus from the fish will adhere to particles in the water providing food for algaeAs the algae multiply the water will grow stale and unfit for useIn the same way when mental defilements flare up in full strength the power of such mental acts can spread to cause diseases in the bodyIf the properties in the body flare up at the same time as the mind the disease will be hard to treat  or if its easy to treat it will go away slowlyThus kamma diseases in some cases arise first in the body and then spread to affect the mindThis is called kammavipakaSometimes they arise first in the mind and spread to affect the bodyThis is called kammacittaWhen a kamma disease arises and we know clearly whether it arises from the body or the mind we should treat it with the two sorts of medicine mentioned above which will provide effective means for relieving our sufferingI myself have experienced the truth of these points but to record my experiences in full would be a long drawnout affairSo I leave it to people of discernment to consider these things on their ownFreedom from disease is the greatest good fortuneChant this every day when you are sick in bedEveryone in the world wants justiceTo give the world justice we all  no matter what race or nationality we belong to  need to have human values in our heartsHuman values are not a creed or a religionWhen people are born into the world they want justice by their very natureSometimes they receive it sometimes they dontThis is because there are times when they let inhuman values interfere with human valuesWhen this is the case these inhuman values prevent them from receiving the justice they desireFor this reason I would like to point out a way that will help people throughout the world keep their minds in line with human valuesEven if we may have lapses from time to time well still be doing well as long as we can maintain long intervals between the lapsesIn your interaction with people and objects dont let yourself get carried away with angerEven if people behave in ways that are disagreeable or if the objects that come your way arent what you had hoped for you should still stop to consider whether those people have at least some good to them and whether those objects may be of at least some use to youWhen you can keep your mind in check in this way youll loosen yourself from the grip of anger and displeasure so that thoughts of good will can arise within you insteadThe result will be that those people will become your friends and allies the objects you get will be able to serve you in other waysFor instance suppose you want a chisel but you get a nailThis means that your hopes arent fulfilled but even so the nail can be of use to you in other ways in the futureIn addition thoughts of good will can foster longlasting composure and peace of mindThis then is a human value that should underlie our dealings with one another throughout the worldBe upright and straightforward in all your dealings behaving toward people behind their backs the same way you would behave to their facesEven when confronted with frightening intimidation you should make your heart audacious to the proper degreeToo much audacity can cause harm and the same holds true for being too timidFor example if you let yourself become intimidated in your business dealings your business will sufferIf youre too reckless or audacious that too can lead to missteps in your workThus you should have a sense of moderation and proportion so that your relationships with people and the various objects in the world will run properlyOnly then will you count as having human valuesWhatever you do in thought word or deed dealing with people or objects in the world you should first examine your motivationsOnly if theyre sound and reasonable should you listen to them and act in line with themThis will keep you from coming under the sway of delusionYou have to be endowed with the human values of circumspect mindfulness and reasonable discernmentThose who can behave in this way will have friends no matter what social grouping they joinTheyll bring about the growth and development of the various objects they deal with and will bring progress to themselves and to society at large  which is something that each and every one of us desiresThe world we live in has been here since long before any of us were bornEven our creeds and religions all gradually came into being long after the world didThe history of the human world is that sometimes the world is advanced in both material and spiritual terms leading to welfare for all sometimes humanity is so degenerate in both material and spiritual terms that it practically sinks into the belly of the seaSometimes the spiritual side is advanced with people living in peace and security while the material side is undevelopedWhen human beings have human values in their hearts material progress can bring happiness and wellbeing to allWhen people lack human values  when they trample human values underfoot by going overboard in exercising their power and influence  material progress can destroy the peace and wellbeing of human beings throughout the worldThere is a basic truth that when people are bad even good material objects can cause harm to people at large if people are moral and just even harmful objects can become beneficialWhen all the people in the world establish themselves firmly in human values then its as if we were all friends and relativesIf people dont have human values in their hearts even families fall apart friends become enemies  and when relationships on the small scale are like this war on the large scale will be unavoidableHow will we be able to escape itThus everyone in the world should develop human values so that we can all view one another as friends expressing in our behavior an attitude of good will and kindness for the sake of justice and fairness in the worldThe points I have made so far are principles of nature common to the entire worldEven people who adhere to different religions should assist one anotherWe should remember our common humanity and help one another on the human levelThe Buddha praised those who help others on the basis of common humanity and as for other religions I myself have met with a number of Roman Catholics and Protestants who when theyve come to our country seem to be wellmannered welleducated and possessed of strong human valuesFor example some of them have helped donate money to build temples and monasteriesThis has made me curious as to what their religion was and when I asked them they said that they were ChristianIt struck me then that their hearts had human values in full measure which is why they have progressed far in lifeAs for the teachings of Buddhism there is one point where the Buddha taught that when we deal with people outside of the religion we should give thought to our common humanity and not make religion an obstacleOtherwise it will cause harmWhen this is the case people who are wellversed in human values can fit perfectly into any society and can create strong bonds of friendship with one anotherThus I ask all who read this to consider the matter using their own discernmentWhat follows is a discussion of the Buddhist way a way discovered by a human being whom large numbers of people have respected and praised as being a worthy person who has shown us the way as wellWhen we study his teachings we are free to believe them or not as we see fit the man who discovered them never laid down any rules coercing us in any wayWhen a group of people sees that a doctrine can lead them to become good and they give that doctrine their respect and adherence it is said to be their religionAs for the religion or doctrine of the Buddha it can be summarized in three pointsWe should develop within ourselves all qualities that we know to be good and virtuous maintaining the virtues we already have  this is called arakkhasampada  and constantly aiming at developing the virtues we havent yet been able to acquireWhatever activities we may engage in we should do so with purity of heartWe should make our hearts pure and cleanIf we cant keep them that way constantly were still doing well if we can make them pure from time to timeAll three of these points are the aims of the Buddhas teachingsThe Buddha taught in line with the true nature of the worldHe said Khayavayadhamma sankhara appamadena sampadetha which means All sankharas once they have arisen decay by their very natureDont be heedless or complacentBe thoroughly mindful and completely alert and you will attain peace and securityWhat this means is this All things that appear in the world arising from actions are called sankharas  formations fashionings compounded thingsSankharas by their nature or of two sorts  sankharas on the level of the world and sankharas on the level of the DhammaSankharas on the level of the world refers to the eight ways of the world status fortune praise and pleasure which are things to which we all aspire but  sankharas being what they are unstable and inconstant  results of another sort may interfere Having had status we may lose itHaving had fortune we may lose itHaving been praised we may be criticizedHaving tasted the pleasure that come from material wealth we may become needy and destitute afflicted with suffering and painTherefore the Buddha taught us not to be so heedless as to be deluded by these thingsIf we cant keep this point in mind were sure to sufferSankharas on the level of the Dhamma refers to the properties aggregates and sense media that lie within us and that result from unawareness and the sankharas concocted by the mind giving rise to dhammasankharas on the outer levelThe liquid aspect such as the blood permeating throughout all parts of the body is called the water propertyThe forces such as the inandout breath that flow through the body are called the wind propertyThe aspect that gives warmth to all the parts of the body is called the fire propertyThe empty spaces in the body where the other properties can move enter and leave the passages that permit air to enter and leave and allow us to move  such as the ear canal the nasal passages and mouth all the way to the pores  are called the space propertyThese various aspects of the body if theres no consciousness overseeing them are like a dead flashlight battery that can no longer produce the power to give rise to brightness or movementAs long as consciousness is in charge it can cause the various qualities and parts of the body to be of use to living beingsGood and evil merit and demerit can arise only if consciousness is giving the ordersThus good and evil come ultimately from awareness itselfThis is called the property of consciousnessAll six of these properties are one class of sankharas on the level of the DhammabKhandha The various categories of things that we experience are called the five aggregates Feeling the feelings of pleasure pain and neither pleasure nor pain that result when consciousness and sense data come into contact with one another are called the aggregate of feelingPerception The act of labeling and identifying people and things both within and without is called the aggregate of perceptionFormations The thoughts and mental constructs that arise from the mind  good bad right wrong in line with the common nature of all thinking  are called the aggregate of formationsConsciousness Distinct awareness in terms of conventional suppositions  for example when the eye sees a visual object the ear hears a sound a smell comes to the nose a taste comes to the tongue a tactile sensation comes to the body or an idea arises in the intellect  being clearly aware through any of the senses that This is good thats bad this is subtle thats fine To be able to know in this way is called the aggregate of consciousnessAll five of these aggregates come down to body and mindThey are sankharas on the level of the Dhamma that arise from unawarenesscAyatana This term literally means the base or medium of all good and evilAltogether there are six sense media the senses of vision hearing smell taste feeling and ideationAll of these things are sankharas on the level of the DhammaThey arise as a result of unawareness ie knowledge that doesnt penetrate into the truthThus we have sankharas on the level of the world and sankharas on the level of the DhammaThe Buddha taught that all of these sankharas are undependable fleeting and unstableThey appear remain for a moment and then disbandThen they appear again going around in circlesThis is inconstancy and stressWhether theyre good or bad all sankharas have to behave in this wayWe cant force them to obey our wishesThus the Buddha taught that theyre notselfOnce weve developed precise powers of discernment well be able gradually to loosen our attachments to these sankharasAnd once weve stabilized our minds to the point of Right Concentration clear cognitive skill will arise within usWell clearly see the truth of sankharas on the level of the world and on the level of the Dhamma and will shed them from our heartsOur hearts will then gain release from all sankharas and attain the noblest happiness as taught by the Buddha independent of all physical and mental objectsAlthough this discussion of these two topics has been brief it can comprehend all aspects of the Buddhas teachingsTo summarize HeedfulnessWatchfulnessNoncomplacencyDont place your trust in any of these sankharasTry to develop within yourself whatever virtues should be acquired and attainedThats what it means not to be heedlessThe Pali Canon recognizes four levels of Awakening the first of which is called stream entryThis gains its name from the fact that a person who has attained this level has entered the stream flowing inevitably to nibbanaHeshe is guaranteed to achieve full awakening within seven lifetimes at most and in the interim will not be reborn in any of the lower realmsThis study guide on stream entry is divided into two partsThe first deals with the practices leading to stream entry the second with the experience of stream entry and its resultsThe practices leading to stream entry are encapsulated in four factorsThese factors form the framework for the first part of this study guideThe Canons treatment of these factors touches on questions of interest to all meditators regardless of whether their practice aims all the way to Awakening How can you recognize a trustworthy teacherHow can you tell the true Dhamma from counterfeit DhammaWhat are the rewards that come from listening to the DhammaWhich questions should you ask yourself in the course of the practiceWhat kind of practice qualifies as being in accordance with the DhammaWhat kind of qualities do you need to develop to benefit most from your practiceFor your practice to lead to Awakening you must develop reliable standards for answering these questionsThe Buddha offers some preliminary guidance on developing these standards in his instructions to the brahman teenager Kapadika BharadvajaTo what extent is there an awakening to the truthTo what extent does one awaken to the truthWe ask Master Gotama about awakening to the truthThere is the case Bharadvaja where a monk lives in dependence on a certain village or townThen a householder or householders son goes to him and observes him with regard to three mental qualities  qualities based on greed qualities based on aversion qualities based on delusion Are there in this venerable one any such qualities based on greed that with his mind overcome by these qualities he might say I know while not knowing or say I see while not seeing or that he might urge another to act in a way that was for hisher longterm harm  pain As he observes him he comes to know There are in this venerable one no such qualities based on greed His bodily behavior  verbal behavior are those of one not greedyAnd the Dhamma he teaches is deep hard to see hard to realize tranquil refined beyond the scope of conjecture subtle tobeexperienced by the wiseThis Dhamma cant easily be taught by a person whos greedyWhen on observing that the monk is purified with regard to qualities based on greed he next observes him with regard to qualities based on aversion based on delusion Are there in this venerable one any such qualities based on delusion that with his mind overcome by these qualities he might say I know while not knowing or say I see while not seeing or that he might urge another to act in a way that was for hisher longterm harm  pain As he observes him he comes to know There are in this venerable one no such qualities based on delusion His bodily behavior  verbal behavior are those of one not deludedAnd the Dhamma he teaches is deep hard to see hard to realize tranquil refined beyond the scope of conjecture subtle tobeexperienced by the wiseThis Dhamma cant easily be taught by a person whos deludedWhen on observing that the monk is purified with regard to qualities based on delusion he places conviction in himWith the arising of conviction he visits him  grows close to himGrowing close to him he lends earLending ear he hears the DhammaHearing the Dhamma he remembers itRemembering it he penetrates the meaning of those dhammasPenetrating the meaning he comes to an agreement through pondering those dhammasThere being an agreement through pondering those dhammas desire arisesWith the arising of desire he becomes willingWilling he contemplatesContemplating he makes an exertionExerting himself he both realizes the ultimate meaning of the truth with his body and sees by penetrating it with discernmentTo this extent Bharadvaja there is an awakening to the truthTo this extent one awakens to the truthI describe this as an awakening to the truthBut it is not yet the final attainment of the truthYes Master Gotama to this extent there is an awakening to the truthTo this extent one awakens to the truthWe regard this as an awakening to the truthBut to what extent is there the final attainment of the truthTo what extent does one finally attain the truthWe ask Master Gotama about the final attainment of the truthThe cultivation development  pursuit of those very same qualities to this extent Bharadvaja there is the final attainment of the truthTo this extent one finally attains the truthI describe this as the final attainment of the truthWith regard to external factors I dont envision any other single factor like friendship with admirable people as doing so much for a monk in training who has not attained the goal but remains intent on the unsurpassed safety from bondageA monk who is a friend with admirable people abandons what is unskillful and develops what is skillfulAs he was seated to one side VenAnanda said to the Blessed One This is half of the holy life lord having admirable people as friends companions  colleaguesDont say that AnandaDont say thatHaving admirable people as friends companions  colleagues is actually the whole of the holy lifeWhen a monk has admirable people as friends companions  colleagues he can be expected to develop  pursue the noble eightfold pathAnd how does a monk who has admirable people as friends companions  colleagues develop  pursue the noble eightfold pathThere is the case where a monk develops right view dependent on seclusion dependent on dispassion dependent on cessation resulting in letting goHe develops right resolve right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness right concentration dependent on seclusion dispassion cessation resulting in letting goThis is how a monk who has admirable people as friends companions  colleagues develops  pursues the noble eightfold pathAnd through this line of reasoning one may know how having admirable people as friends companions  colleagues is actually the whole of the holy life Its in dependence on me as an admirable friend that beings subject to birth have gained release from birth that beings subject to aging have gained release from aging that beings subject to death have gained release from death that beings subject to sorrow lamentation pain distress  despair have gained release from sorrow lamentation pain distress  despairAnd what does it mean to have admirable people as friendsThere is the case where a lay person in whatever town or village he may dwell spends time with householders or householders sons young or old who are advanced in virtueHe talks with them engages them in discussionsHe emulates consummate conviction in those who are consummate in conviction consummate virtue in those who are consummate in virtue consummate generosity in those who are consummate in generosity and consummate discernment in those who are consummate in discernmentThis is called having admirable people as friendsAnd what does it mean to be consummate in convictionThere is the case where a noble disciple has conviction is convinced of the Tathagatas Awakening Indeed the Blessed One is worthy  rightly selfawakened consummate in knowledge and conduct wellgone an expert with regard to the world unexcelled as a trainer for those people fit to be tamed the Teacher of devas  human beings awakened blessed This is called being consummate in convictionAnd what does it mean to be consummate in virtueThere is the case where a noble disciple abstains from taking life abstains from stealing abstains from illicit sexual conduct abstains from lying abstains from taking intoxicants that cause heedlessnessThis is called being consummate in virtueAnd what does it mean to be consummate in generosityThere is the case of a noble disciple his awareness cleansed of the stain of miserliness living at home freely generous openhanded delighting in being magnanimous responsive to requests delighting in the distribution of almsThis is called being consummate in generosityAnd what does it mean to be consummate in discernmentThere is the case where a noble disciple is discerning endowed with discernment of arising and passing away  noble penetrating leading to the right ending of stressThis is called being consummate in discernmentAdmirable friends are to be recognized both by what they say and by what they doFor the person who transgresses in one thing I tell you there is no evil deed that is not to be doneWhich one thingThis telling a deliberate lieA friend endowed with these three qualities is worth associating withWhich threeHeshe gives what is hard to give does what is hard to do endures what is hard to endureA friend endowed with these three qualities is worth associating withThese three things have been promulgated by wise people by people who are truly goodWhich threeGenerositygoingforth service to ones mother  fatherThese three things have been promulgated by wise people by people who are truly goodNow what is the level of a person of no integrityA person of no integrity is ungrateful does not acknowledge the help given to himThis ingratitude this lack of acknowledgment is second nature among rude peopleIt is entirely on the level of people of no integrityA person of integrity is grateful  acknowledges the help given to himThis gratitude this acknowledgment is second nature among admirable peopleIt is entirely on the level of people of integrityA person endowed with these four qualities can be known as a person of integrity Which fourThere is the case where a person of integrity when asked doesnt reveal another persons bad points to say nothing of when unaskedFurthermore when asked when pressed with questions he is one who speaks of another persons bad points not in full not in detail with omissions holding backThen again a person of integrity when unasked reveals another persons good points to say nothing of when askedFurthermore when asked when pressed with questions he is one who speaks of another persons good points in full  in detail without omissions without holding backThen again a person of integrity when unasked reveals his own bad points to say nothing of when askedFurthermore when asked when pressed with questions he is one who speaks of his own bad points in full  in detail without omissions without holding backThen again a person of integrity when asked doesnt reveal his own good points to say nothing of when unaskedFurthermore when asked when pressed with questions he is one who speaks of his own good points not in full not in detail with omissions holding backMonks a person endowed with these four

among human beingsThe opportunity to listen to the Dhamma is considered valuable both because it is rare and because it yields great benefitsHard the chance to hear the true DhammaThere are these five rewards in listening to the DhammaWhich five One hears what one has not heard beforeOne clarifies what one has heard beforeOne gets rid of doubtOnes views are made straightOnes mind grows sereneThese are the five rewards in listening to the DhammaTo obtain these benefits one must come to the Dhamma both with the right karmic background and with the right attitudeEndowed with these six qualities a person is capable of alighting on the lawfulness the rightness of skillful mental qualities even while listening to the true DhammaWhich sixHe is not endowed with a kamma obstruction a defilement obstruction or a resultofkamma obstruction he has conviction has the desire and is discerningEndowed with these six qualities a person is capable of alighting on the lawfulness the rightness of skillful mental qualities even while listening to the true DhammaIts also important to understand clearly the standards for distinguishing true Dhamma from falseThese standards come down to a pragmatic test How does one behave and what results come from ones behavior when one puts the Dhamma into practiceAs they were sitting to one side the Kalamas of Kesaputta said to the Blessed One Venerable sir there are some contemplatives  brahmans who come to KesaputtaThey expound  glorify their own doctrines but as for the doctrines of others they deprecate them revile them show contempt for them  disparage themAnd then other contemplatives  brahmans come to KesaputtaThey expound  glorify their own doctrines but as for the doctrines of others they deprecate them revile them show contempt for them  disparage themThey leave us simply uncertain  doubtful Which of these venerable contemplatives  brahmans are speaking the truth and which ones are lyingOf course you are uncertain KalamasOf course you are doubtfulWhen there are reasons for doubt uncertainty is bornSo in this case Kalamas dont go by reports by legends by traditions by scripture by conjecture by inference by analogies by agreement through pondering views by probability or by the thought This contemplative is our teacher When you know for yourselves that These qualities are unskillful these qualities are blameworthy these qualities are criticized by the wise these qualities when undertaken  carried out lead to harm  to suffering  then you should abandon themWhat do you think Kalamas When greed arises in a person does it arise for welfare or for harmFor harm lordAnd this greedy person overcome by greed his mind possessed by greed Doesnt he kill living beings take what is not given go after another persons wife tell lies and induce others to do likewise all of which is for longterm harm  sufferingYes lordSo what do you think Kalamas Are these qualities skillful or unskillfulUnskillful lordBlameworthy or blamelessBlameworthy lordCriticized by the wise or praised by the wiseCriticized by the wise lordWhen undertaken  carried out do they lead to harm  to suffering or notWhen undertaken  carried out they lead to harm  to suffering Now Kalamas dont go by reports by legends by traditions by scripture by conjecture by inference by analogies by agreement through pondering views by probability or by the thought This contemplative is our teacher When you know for yourselves that These qualities are skillful these qualities are blameless these qualities are praised by the wise these qualities when undertaken  carried out lead to welfare  to happiness  then you should enter  remain in themWhat do you think Kalamas When lack of greed arises in a person does it arise for welfare or for harmFor welfare lordAnd this ungreedy person not overcome by greed his mind not possessed by greed He doesnt kill living beings take what is not given go after another persons wife tell lies or induce others to do likewise all of which is for longterm welfare  happiness  rightYes lordSo what do you think Kalamas Are these qualities skillful or unskillfulSkillful lordBlameworthy or blamelessBlameless lordCriticized by the wise or praised by the wisePraised by the wise lordWhen undertaken  carried out do they lead to welfare  to happiness or notWhen undertaken  carried out they lead to welfare  to happinessGotami the qualities of which you may know These qualities lead  to passion not to dispassion to being fettered not to being unfettered to accumulating not to shedding to selfaggrandizement not to modesty to discontent not to contentment to entanglement not to seclusion to laziness not to aroused persistence to being burdensome not to being unburdensome You may categorically hold This is not the Dhamma this is not the Vinaya this is not the Teachers instructionAs for the qualities of which you may know These qualities lead  to dispassion not to passion to being unfettered not to being fettered to shedding not to accumulating to modesty not to selfaggrandizement to contentment not to discontent to seclusion not to entanglement to aroused persistence not to laziness to being unburdensome not to being burdensome You may categorically hold This is the Dhamma this is the Vinaya this is the Teachers instructionUpali the qualities of which you may know These qualities do not lead to utter disenchantment to dispassion to cessation to calm to direct knowledge to selfawakening nor to Unbinding You may categorically hold This is not the Dhamma this is not the Vinaya this is not the Teachers instructionAs for the qualities of which you may know These qualities lead to utter disenchantment to dispassion to cessation to calm to direct knowledge to selfawakening to Unbinding You may categorically hold This is the Dhamma this is the Vinaya this is the Teachers instructionThe test for the true Dhamma being pragmatic this means that even when you are convinced that you have heard the true Dhamma you must be careful to realize that simply hearing the truth is not enough to know it for sureThere are five things that can turn out in two ways in the herenowWhich fiveConviction liking unbroken tradition reasoning by analogy  an agreement through pondering viewsThese are the five things that can turn out in two ways in the herenowNow some things are firmly held in conviction and yet vain empty  falseSome things are not firmly held in conviction and yet they are genuine factual  unmistakenSome things are wellliked truly an unbroken tradition wellreasoned Some things are wellpondered and yet vain empty  falseSome things are not wellpondered and yet they are genuine factual  unmistakenIn these cases it isnt proper for a knowledgeable person who safeguards the truth to come to a definite conclusion Only this is true anything else is worthlessBut to what extent Master Gotama is there the safeguarding of the truthTo what extent does one safeguard the truthWe ask Master Gotama about the safeguarding of the truthIf a person has conviction his statement This is my conviction safeguards the truthBut he doesnt yet come to the definite conclusion that Only this is true anything else is worthless To this extent Bharadvaja there is the safeguarding of the truthTo this extent one safeguards the truthI describe this as the safeguarding of the truthBut it is not yet an awakening to the truthHaving heard the Dhamma it is important to bring appropriate attention  seeing things in terms of cause and effect  both to what you have heard and to your experiences in general for this one factor can make all the difference in the success or failure of your practiceWith regard to internal factors I dont envision any other single factor like appropriate attention as doing so much for a monk in training who has not attained the goal but remains intent on the unsurpassed safety from bondageA monk who attends appropriately abandons what is unskillful and develops what is skillfulI have heard that on one occasion a certain monk was dwelling among the Kosalans in a forest thicketNow at that time he spent the days abiding thinking evil unskillful thoughts ie thoughts of sensuality thoughts of ill will thoughts of harmfulnessThen the devata inhabiting the forest thicket feeling sympathy for the monk desiring his benefit desiring to bring him to his senses approached him and addressed him with this verseThe monk chastened by the devata came to his sensesAppropriate attention is essentially the ability to frame your understanding of experience in the right termsIn many cases this means framing the right questions for gaining insight into suffering and its endThis is the way leading to discernment when visiting a contemplative or brahman to ask What is skillful venerable sirWhat is unskillfulWhat is blameworthyWhat is blamelessWhat should be cultivatedWhat should not be cultivatedWhat having been done by me will be for my longterm harm  sufferingOr what having been done by me will be for my longterm welfare  happinessThere is the case where an uninstructed runofthemill persondoes not discern what ideas are fit for attention or what ideas are unfit for attentionThis being so he does not attend to ideas fit for attention and attends to ideas unfit for attentionAnd what are the ideas unfit for attention that he attends toWhatever ideas such that when he attends to them the unarisen effluent of sensuality arises and the arisen effluent of sensuality increases the unarisen effluent of becoming the unarisen effluent of ignorance arises and the arisen effluent of ignorance increases This is how he attends inappropriately Was I in the pastWas I not in the pastWhat was I in the pastHow was I in the pastHaving been what what was I in the pastShall I be in the futureShall I not be in the futureWhat shall I be in the futureHow shall I be in the futureHaving been what what shall I be in the future Or else he is inwardly perplexed about the immediate present Am IAm I notWhat am IHow am IWhere has this being come fromWhere is it boundAs he attends inappropriately in this way one of six kinds of view arises in him The view I have a self arises in him as true  established or the view I have no self or the view It is precisely by means of self that I perceive self or the view It is precisely by means of self that I perceive notself or the view It is precisely by means of notself that I perceive self arises in him as true  established or else he has a view like this This very self of mine  the knower that is sensitive here  there to theripening of good  bad actions  is the self of mine that is constant everlasting eternal not subject to change and will endure as long as eternityThis is called a thicket of views a wilderness of views a contortion of views a writhing of views a fetter of viewsBound by a fetter of views the uninstructed runofthemill person is not freed from birth aging  death from sorrow lamentation pain distress  despairHe is not freed I tell you from stressThe wellinstructed noble disciple discerns what ideas are fit for attention and what ideas are unfit for attentionThis being so he does not attend to ideas unfit for attention and attends to ideas fit for attention And what are the ideas fit for attention that he attends toWhatever ideas such that when he attends to them the unarisen effluent of sensuality does not arise and the arisen effluent of sensuality is abandoned the unarisen effluent of becoming the unarisen effluent of ignorance does not arise and the arisen effluent of ignorance is abandoned He attends appropriately This is stress This is the origination of stress This is the cessation of stress This is the way leading to the cessation of stressAs he attends appropriately in this way three fetters are abandoned in him identityview doubt and grasping at habits  practicesThese are called the effluents that are to be abandoned by seeingAppropriate attention can also mean framing the way you understand events as they occurSariputta my friend which things should

to add to what has been done still these things  when developed  pursued  lead both to a pleasant abiding in the herenow and to mindfulness  alertnessIn developing dispassion for the clingingaggregates appropriate attention is an important first step in practicing the Dhamma in accordance with the DhammaFor a monk practicing the Dhamma in accordance with the Dhamma this is what accords with the Dhamma that he keep cultivating disenchantment with regard to form that he keep cultivating disenchantment with regard to feeling that he keep cultivating disenchantment with regard to perception that he keep cultivating disenchantment with regard to fabrications that he keep cultivating disenchantment with regard to consciousnessAs he keeps cultivating disenchantment with regard to form feeling perception fabrications consciousness he comprehends form feeling perception fabrications consciousnessAs he comprehends form feeling perception fabrications consciousness he is totally released from form feeling perception fabrications consciousnessHe is totally released from sorrows lamentations pains distresses  despairsHe is totally released I tell you from suffering

of disenchantment dispassion  cessation with regard to aging  death birth becoming clingingsustenance craving feeling contact the six sense media name  form consciousness fabrications ignorance he deserves to be called a monk who is a speaker of DhammaIf he practices for the sake of disenchantment dispassion  cessation with regard to aging  death ignorance he deserves to be called a monk who practices the Dhamma in accordance with the DhammaIf  through disenchantment dispassion cessation and lack of clingingsustenance with regard to aging  death ignorance  he is released then he deserves to be called a monk who has attained Unbinding in the herenowThe practice leading to disenchantment dispassion and release follows a stepwise path of cause and effectNow I tell you clear knowing

monks and alertThis is our instruction to you allAnd how is a monk mindfulThere is the case where a monk remains focused on the body in  of itself  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the worldHe remains focused on feelings mind mental qualities in  of themselves  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the worldThis is how a monk is mindfulAnd how is a monk alertThere is the case where feelings are known to the monk as they arise known as they persist known as they subsideThoughts are known to him as they arise known as they persist known as they subsideDiscernment is known to him as it arises known as it persists known as it subsidesThis is how a monk is alertSo stay mindful monks and alertThis is our instruction to you allAnd how does a monk guard the doors of his sensesOn seeing a form with the eye he does not grasp at any theme or details by which  if he were to dwell without restraint over the faculty of the eye  evil unskillful qualities such as greed or distress might assail himOn hearing a sound with the ear On smelling an odor with the nose One tasting a flavor with the tongue On touching a tactile sensation with the body On cognizing an idea with the intellect he does not grasp at any theme or details by which  if he were to dwell without restraint over the faculty of the intellect  evil unskillful qualities such as greed or distress might assail himEndowed with this noble restraint over the sense faculties he is inwardly sensitive to the pleasure of being blamelessThis is how a monk guards the doors of his sensesNow Cunda there are three ways in which one is made pure by bodily action four ways in which one is made pure by verbal action and three ways in which one is made pure by mental actionAnd how is one made pure in three ways by bodily actionThere is the case where a certain person abandoning the taking of life abstains from the taking of lifeHe dwells with his rod laid down his knife laid down scrupulous merciful compassionate for the welfare of all living beingsAbandoning the taking of what is not given he abstains from taking what is not givenHe does not take in the manner of a thief things in a village or a wilderness that belong to others and have not been given by themAbandoning sensual misconduct he abstains from sensual misconductHe does not get sexually involved with those who are protected by their mothers their fathers their brothers their sisters their relatives or their Dhamma those with husbands those who entail punishments or even those crowned with flowers by another manThis is how one is made pure in three ways by bodily actionAnd how is one made pure in four ways by verbal actionThere is the case where a certain person abandoning false speech abstains from false speechWhen he has been called to a town meeting a group meeting a gathering of his relatives his guild or of the royalty if he is asked as a witness Come  tell good man what you know If he doesnt know he says I dont know If he does know he says I know If he hasnt seen he says I havent seen If he has seen he says I have seen Thus he doesnt consciously tell a lie for his own sake for the sake of another or for the sake of any rewardAbandoning false speech he abstains from false speechHe speaks the truth holds to the truth is firm reliable no deceiver of the worldAbandoning divisive speech he abstains from divisive speechWhat he has heard here he doesnt tell there to break those people apart from these people hereWhat he has heard there he doesnt tell here to break these people apart from those people thereThus reconciling those who have broken apart or cementing those who are united he loves concord delights in concord enjoys concord speaks things that create concordAbandoning abusive speech he abstains from abusive speechHe speaks words that are soothing to the ear that are affectionate that go to the heart that are polite appealing  pleasing to people at largeAbandoning idle chatter he abstains from idle chatterHe speaks in season speaks what is factual what is in accordance with the goal the Dhamma  the VinayaHe speaks words worth treasuring seasonable reasonable circumscribed connected with the goalThis is how one is made pure in four ways by verbal actionAnd how is one made pure in three ways by mental actionThere is the case where a certain person is not covetousHe does not covet the belongings of others thinking O that what belongs to others would be mine He bears no ill will and is not corrupt in the resolves of his heartMay these beings be free from animosity free from oppression free from trouble and may they look after themselves with ease He has right view and is not warped in the way he sees things There is what is given what is offered what is sacrificedThere are fruits  results of good  bad actionsThere is this world  the next worldThere is mother  fatherThere are spontaneously reborn beings there are contemplatives  brahmans who faring rightly  practicing rightly proclaim this world  the next after having directly known  realized it for themselves This is how one is made pure in three ways by mental actionThese Cunda are the ten courses of skillful action Now on whatever occasion a monk breathing in long discerns that he is breathing in long or breathing out long discerns that he is breathing out long or breathing in short discerns that he is breathing in short or breathing out short discerns that he is breathing out short trains himself to breathe in out sensitive to the entire body trains himself to breathe inout calming bodily fabrication On that occasion the monk remains focused on the body in  of itself  ardent alert  mindful  subduing greed  distress with reference to the worldI tell you monks that this  the inout breath  is classed as a body among bodies which is why the monk on that occasion remains focused on the body in  of itself  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the world On whatever occasion a monk trains himself to breathe inout sensitive to rapture trains himself to breathe inout sensitive to pleasure trains himself to breathe inout sensitive to mental fabrication trains himself to breathe inout calming mental fabrication On that occasion the monk remains focused on feelings in  of themselves  ardent alert  mindful  subduing greed  distress with reference to the worldI tell you monks that this  close attention to inout breaths  is classed as a feeling among feelings which is why the monk on that occasion remains focused on feelings in  of themselves  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the world On whatever occasion a monk trains himself to breathe inout sensitive to the mind trains himself to breathe inout satisfying the mind trains himself to breathe inout steadying the mind trains himself to breathe inout releasing the mind On that occasion the monk remains focused on the mind in  of itself  ardent alert  mindful  subduing greed  distress with reference to the worldI dont say that there is mindfulness of inout breathing in one of confused mindfulness and no alertness which is why the monk on that occasion remains focused on the mind in  of itself  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the world On whatever occasion a monk trains himself to breathe inout focusing on inconstancy trains himself to breathe inout focusing on dispassion trains himself to breathe inout focusing on cessation trains himself to breathe inout focusing on relinquishment On that occasion the monk remains focused on mental qualities in  of themselves  ardent alert  mindful  subduing greed  distress with reference to the worldHe who sees clearly with discernment the abandoning of greed  distress is one who oversees with equanimity which is why the monk on that occasion remains focused on mental qualities in  of themselves  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the worldThis is how mindfulness of inout breathing is developed  pursued so as to bring the four establishings of mindfulness to their culminationAnd how are the four establishings of mindfulness developed  pursued so as to bring the seven factors for awakening to their culmination On whatever occasion the monk remains focused on the body in  of itself  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the world on that occasion his mindfulness is steady  without lapseWhen his mindfulness is steady  without lapse then mindfulness as a factor for awakening becomes arousedHe develops it and for him it goes to the culmination of its development Remaining mindful in this way he examines analyzes  comes to a comprehension of that quality with discernmentWhen he remains mindful in this way examining analyzing  coming to a comprehension of that quality with discernment then analysis of qualities as a factor for awakening becomes arousedHe develops it and for him it goes to the culmination of its development In one who examines analyzes  comes to a comprehension of that quality with discernment unflagging persistence is arousedWhen unflagging persistence is aroused in one who examines analyzes  comes to a comprehension of that quality with discernment then persistence as a factor for awakening becomes arousedHe develops it and for him it goes to the culmination of its development In one whose persistence is aroused a rapture notoftheflesh arisesWhen a rapture notoftheflesh arises in one whose persistence is aroused then rapture as a factor for awakening becomes arousedHe develops it and for him it goes to the culmination of its development For one who is enraptured the body grows calm and the mind grows calmWhen the body  mind of an enraptured monk grow calm then serenity as a factor for awakening becomes arousedHe develops it and for him it goes to the culmination of its development For one who is at ease  his body calmed  the mind becomes concentratedWhen the mind of one who is at ease  his body calmed  becomes concentrated then concentration as a factor for awakening becomes arousedHe develops it and for him it goes to the culmination of its development He oversees the mind thus concentrated with equanimityWhen he oversees the mind thus concentrated with equanimity equanimity as a factor for awakening becomes arousedHe develops it and for him it goes to the culmination of its developmentThis is how the four establishings of mindfulness are developed  pursued so as to bring the seven factors for awakening to their culminationAnd how are the seven factors for awakening developed  pursued so as to bring clear knowing  release to their culminationThere is the case where a monk develops mindfulness as a factor for awakening dependent on seclusion dispassion cessation resulting in relinquishmentHe develops analysis of qualities as a factor for awakening persistence as a factor for awakening rapture as a factor for awakening serenity as a factor for awakening concentration as a factor for awakening equanimity as a factor for awakening dependent on seclusion dispassion cessation resulting in relinquishmentThis is how the seven factors for awakening when developed  pursued bring clear knowing  release to their culminationThe ability to follow this path to completion is not just a matter of mastering techniqueIt also depends on the ability to develop strong character traitsNow what

individualsA monk endowed with these seven qualities is worthy of gifts worthy of hospitality worthy of offerings worthy of respect an unexcelled field of merit for the worldTo practice the Dhamma in accordance with the Dhamma not only makes one worthy of respect it also is a way of showing respect and gratitude to the Buddha for his admirable friendship in creating the opportunity for hearing the true DhammaThen the Blessed One said to VenAnanda Ananda the twin saltrees are in full bloom even though its not the flowering seasonThey shower strew  sprinkle on the Tathagatas body in homage to himHeavenly coraltree blossoms are falling from the sky Heavenly sandalwood powder is falling from the sky Heavenly music is playing in the sky Heavenly songs are sung in the sky in homage to the TathagataBut it is not to this extent that a Tathagata is worshipped honored respected venerated or paid homage toRather the monk nun male lay follower or female lay follower who keeps practicing the Dhamma in accordance with the Dhamma who keeps practicing masterfully who lives in accordance with the Dhamma that is the person who worships honors respects venerates  pays homage to the Tathagata with the highest homageSo you should train yourselves We will keep practicing the Dhamma in accordance with the Dhamma we will keep practicing masterfully we will live in accordance with the Dhamma Thats how you should train yourselvesWhen treating the experience of stream entry and its results the Canon uses all three of its typical modes of discourse the narrative mode  stories about people who have attained stream entry the cosmological mode  descriptions of the afterdeath destinations awaiting those who have attained stream entry and what might be called the emptiness mode which describes mental states in and of themselves as they are directly experienced as absent or present both during and after stream entryThe material in this part of the study guide is presented in five sectionsThe first section The Arising of the Dhamma Eye discusses the experience of stream entry and concludes with a passage indicating why the experience is described in terms of the faculty of visionThe second section The Three Fetters discusses the three fetters of renewed existence that are cut with the arising of the Dhamma eye selfidentity views uncertainty and grasping at habits and practicesThe third section The Character of the Streamentererdiscusses the personal characteristics of a streamenterer that flow directly from the cutting of the first three fettersThis section focuses on three lists of the four factors of stream entry which are not to be confused with the four factors for stream entry discussed in the first part of this study guideThe fourth section Rewards discusses the rewards of stream entry that are come both in this life and in future livesThe final section Advice echoes the Buddhas last words to his disciples before entering total nibbanaThe discourse reporting those words  DN  also reports that the most backward of the monks present at the Buddhas passing away were streamenterersThe fact that his last words to them stressed the need for heedfulness underlies the fact that even streamenterers have to be wary of heedlessnessThis is especially true in the present day when many different meditation schools define the attainment of stream entry in such different terms raising the question of whose certification of stream entry is valid and whose is notThe safest course of action for all meditators  whether certified as streamenterers or not and whether that certification is valid or not  is to maintain an attitude of heedfulness with regard to all mental qualitiesThe term stream in stream entry refers to the point where all eight factors of the noble eightfold path come togetherSariputta The stream the stream thus it is saidAnd what Sariputta is the streamThis noble eightfold path lord is the stream right view right resolve right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness right concentrationVery good SariputtaVery goodThis noble eightfold path  right view right resolve right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness right concentration  is the streamAnd what is right viewKnowledge in terms of stress knowledge in terms of the origination of stress knowledge in terms of the cessation of stress knowledge in terms of the way of practice leading to the cessation of stress This is called right viewAnd what is right resolveBeing resolved on renunciation on nonill will on harmlessness This is called right resolveAnd what is right speechAbstaining from lying from divisive speech from abusive speech  from idle chatter This is called right speechAnd what is right actionAbstaining from taking life from stealing  from sexual intercourse This is called right actionAnd what is right livelihoodThere is the case where a disciple of the noble ones having abandoned dishonest livelihood keeps his life going with right livelihoodThis is called right livelihoodAnd what is right effortThere is the case where a monk generates desire endeavors arouses persistence upholds  exerts his intent for the sake of the nonarising of evil unskillful qualities that have not yet arisen for the sake of the abandoning of evil unskillful qualities that have arisen for the sake of the arising of skillful qualities that have not yet arisen for the maintenance nonconfusion increase plenitude development  culmination of skillful qualities that have arisenThis is called right effortAnd what is right mindfulnessThere is the case where a monk remains focused on the body in  of itself  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the worldHe remains focused on feelings in  of themselves the mind in  of itself mental qualities in  of themselves  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the worldThis is called right mindfulnessAnd what is right concentrationThere is the case where a monk  quite secluded from sensuality secluded from unskillful qualities  enters  remains in the first jhana rapture  pleasure born of seclusion accompanied by directed thought  evaluationWith the stilling of directed thoughts  evaluations he enters  remains in the second jhana rapture  pleasure born of concentration unification of awareness free from directed thought  evaluation  internal assuranceWith the fading of rapture he remains equanimous mindful  alert and senses pleasure with the bodyHe enters  remains in the third jhana of which the Noble Ones declare Equanimous  mindful he has a pleasant abiding With the abandoning of pleasure  pain  as with the earlier disappearance of elation  distress  he enters  remains in the fourth jhana purity of equanimity  mindfulness neither pleasure nor painThis is called right concentrationThe comingtogether of these factors is called the stream because it leads inevitably to two things just as the current of a tributary will lead inevitably to a major river and then to the seaIn the immediate present the stream leads directly to the arising of the Dhamma eye the vision that actually constitutes this first awakeningOver time the stream ensures that  in no more than seven lifetimes  one will be totally unboundWhat does the Dhamma eye see when it arisesThen VenAssaji gave this Dhamma exposition to Sariputta the wandererThen to Sariputta the wanderer as he heard this exposition of Dhamma there arose the dustless stainless Dhamma eye Whatever is subject to origination is all subject to cessationThis standard formula  it is repeated throughout the Canon  may not seem that remarkable an insightHowever the texts make clear that this insight is not a matter of belief or contemplation but of direct seeingAs the following passages show belief and contemplation may be conducive to the seeing  and an undefined level of belief and discernment may actually guarantee that someday in this lifetime the seeing will occur  but only with the actual seeing does there come a dramatic shift in the course of ones life and ones relationship to the DhammaMonks the eye is inconstant changeable alterableThe ear The nose The tongue The body The mind is inconstant changeable alterableForms Sounds Aromas Flavors Tactile sensations Ideas are

Perception Fabrications Consciousness is inconstant changeable alterableOne who has conviction  belief that these phenomena are this way is called a faithfollower one who has entered the orderliness of rightness entered the plane of people of integrity transcended the plane of the runofthemillHe is incapable of doing any deed by which he might be reborn in hell in the animal womb or in the realm of hungry ghostsHe is incapable of passing away until he has realized the fruit of stream entryOne who after pondering with a modicum of discernment has accepted that these phenomena are this way is called a Dhammafollower one who has entered the orderliness of rightness entered the plane of people of integrity transcended the plane of the runofthemillHe is incapable of doing any deed by which he might be reborn in hell in the animal womb or in the realm of hungry ghostsHe is incapable of passing away until he has realized the fruit of stream entryOne who knows and sees that these phenomena are this way is called a streamenterer steadfast never again destined for states of woe headed for selfawakeningTo Upali the householder as he was sitting right there there arose the dustless stainless Dhamma eye Whatever is subject to origination is all subject to cessationThen  having seen the Dhamma having reached the Dhamma known the Dhamma gained a footing in the Dhamma having crossed over  beyond doubt having had no more questioning  Upali the householder gained fearlessness and was independent of others with regard to the Teachers messagePart of what makes the arising of the Dhamma eye such a powerful experience is that the realization that Whatever is subject to origination is all subject to cessation must follow on a glimpse of what stands in opposition to all that is subject to origination ie a glimpse of the Unconditioned  deathlessnessSariputta the wanderer went to Moggallana the wandererMoggallana the wanderer saw him coming from afar and on seeing him said Your faculties are bright my friend your complexion pure  clearCould it be that you have attained the DeathlessYes my friend I have  Mv IThe connection between VenAssajis verse above discussing causation and the arising of the Dhamma eye in Sariputta suggests that realization conveyed by the Dhamma eye is not just an insight into the fleeting impermanent nature of ordinary experienceInstead it extends also to a realization of the conditioned dependent nature of that experienceOther passages describing in more detail the knowledge of a streamenterer  one who has entered the stream  show that this is in fact the caseThe Dhamma eye sees that things arise and pass away in line with a particular type of causality in which the effects of causes are felt immediately or over the course of timeAnd which is the noble method that he has rightly seen  rightly ferreted out through discernmentThere is the case where a disciple of the noble ones noticesWhen this is that isFrom the arising of this comes the arising of thatWhen this isnt that isntFrom the cessation of this comes the cessation of thatIn other wordsFrom ignorance as a requisite condition come fabricationsFrom fabrications as a requisite condition comes consciousnessFrom consciousness as a requisite condition comes nameformFrom nameform as a requisite condition come the six sense mediaFrom the six sense media as a requisite condition comes contactFrom contact as a requisite condition comes feelingFrom feeling as a requisite condition comes cravingFrom craving as a requisite condition comes clingingsustenanceFrom clingingsustenance as a requisite condition comes becomingFrom becoming as a requisite condition comes birthFrom birth as a requisite condition then aging  death sorrow lamentation pain distress  despair come into playSuch is the origination of this entire mass of stress  sufferingNow from the remainderless fading  cessation of that very ignorance comes the cessation of fabricationsFrom the cessation of fabrications comes the cessation of consciousnessFrom the cessation of consciousness comes the cessation of nameformFrom the cessation of nameform comes the cessation of the six sense mediaFrom the cessation of the six sense media comes the cessation of contactFrom the cessation of contact comes the cessation of feelingFrom the cessation of feeling comes the cessation of cravingFrom the cessation of craving comes the cessation of clingingsustenanceFrom the cessation of clingingsustenance comes the cessation of becomingFrom the cessation of becoming comes the cessation of birthFrom the cessation of birth then aging  death sorrow lamentation pain distress  despair all ceaseSuch is the cessation of this entire mass of stress  sufferingThis is the noble method that he has rightly seen  rightly ferreted out through discernmentWhen a disciple of the noble ones has seen well with right discernment this dependent coarising  these dependently coarisen phenomena as they are actually present it is not possible that he would run after the past thinking Was I in the pastWas I not in the pastWhat was I in the pastHow was I in the pastHaving been what what was I in the past or that he would run after the future thinking Shall I be in the futureShall I not be in the futureWhat shall I be in the futureHow shall I be in the futureHaving been what what shall I be in the future or that he would be inwardly perplexed about the immediate present thinking Am IAm I notWhat am IHow am IWhere has this being come fromWhere is it bound Such a thing is not possibleWhy is thatBecause the disciple of the noble ones has seen well with right discernment this dependent coarising  these dependently coarisen phenomena as they are actually presentThe insight of a streamenterer into the truths of causality on the one hand and of the Deathless on the other is accurate as far as it goes but it does not equal the intensity of the insight of the arahant  one who has reached the final level of awakeningThe differences between the two are suggested in the following simileMy friend although I have seen properly with right discernment as it actually is present that The cessation of becoming is Unbinding still I am not an arahant whose effluents are endedIts as if there were a well along a road in a desert with neither rope nor water bucketA man would come along overcome by heat oppressed by the heat exhausted dehydrated  thirstyHe would look into the well and would have knowledge of water but he would not dwell touching it with his bodyIn the same way although I have seen properly with right discernment as it actually is present that The cessation of becoming is Unbinding still I am not an arahant whose effluents are endedThe four levels of Awakening are defined by the extent to which they cut the ten fetters by which the mind binds itself to conditioned experienceAnd which are the five lower fettersSelfidentity views uncertainty grasping at habits  practices sensual desire  ill willThese are the five lower fettersAnd which are the five higher fettersPassion for form passion for what is formless conceit restlessness  ignoranceThese are the five higher fettersIn this community of monks there are monks who are arahants whose effluents are ended who have reached fulfillment done the task laid down the burden attained the true goal totally destroyed the fetter of becoming and who are released through right gnosisIn this community of monks there are monks who with the total ending of the five lower fetters are due to be reappear there to be totally unbound never again to return from that worldIn this community of monks there are monks who with the total ending of three fetters and with the attenuation of passion aversion  delusion are oncereturners who  on returning only one more time to this world  will make an ending to stressIn this community of monks there are monks who with the total ending of three fetters are streamwinners steadfast never again destined for states of woe headed for selfawakeningFor the streamenterer the arising of the Dhamma eye  with its insight into the causal principles underlying the origination and cessation of stress  is what cuts through the first three fettersHe attends appropriately This is stress This is the origination of stress This is the cessation of stress This is the way leading to the cessation of stressAs he attends appropriately in this way three fetters are abandoned in him selfidentity view doubt and grasping at habits  practicesThe Canon contains passages that amplify what it means to cut the first three of these fettersFirst selfidentity viewsBut lady how does selfidentity come aboutThere is the case friend Visakha where an uninstructed runofthemill person  who has no regard for noble ones is not wellversed or disciplined in their Dhamma who has no regard for men of integrity is not wellversed or disciplined in their Dhamma  assumes form to be the self or the self as possessing form or form as in the self or the self as in formHe assumes feeling to be the selfHe assumes perception to be the selfHe assumes fabrications to be the selfHe assumes consciousness to be the self or the self as possessing consciousness or consciousness as in the self or the self as in consciousnessThis is how selfidentity comes aboutBut lady how does selfidentity not come aboutThere is the case where a wellinstructed disciple of the noble ones  who has regard for noble ones is wellversed  disciplined in their Dhamma who has regard for men of integrity is wellversed  disciplined in their Dhamma  does not assume form to be the self or the self as possessing form or form as in the self or the self as in formHe does not assume feeling to be the selfHe does not assume perception to be the selfHe does not assume fabrications to be the selfHe does not assume consciousness to be the self or the self as possessing consciousness or consciousness as in the self or the self as in consciousnessThis is how selfidentity does not come aboutThe origination of selfidentity the origination of selfidentity it is said ladyWhich origination of selfidentity is described by the Blessed OneThe craving that makes for further becoming  accompanied by passion  delight relishing now here  now there  ie craving for sensual pleasure craving for becoming craving for nonbecoming This friend Visakha is the origination of selfidentity described by the Blessed OneThe cessation of selfidentity the cessation of selfidentity it is said ladyWhich cessation of selfidentity is described by the Blessed OneThe remainderless fading  cessation renunciation relinquishment release  letting go of that very craving This friend Visakha is the cessation of selfidentity described by the Blessed OneThe way of practice leading to the cessation of selfidentity the way of practice leading to the cessation of selfidentity it is said ladyWhich way of practice leading to the cessation of selfidentity is described by the Blessed OnePrecisely this noble eightfold path  right view right resolve right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness right concentration This friend Visakha is the way of practice leading to the cessation of selfidentity described by the Blessed OneWhat is the noble liberationThere is the case Ananda where a disciple of the noble ones considers this Sensuality here  now sensuality in lives to come sensual perceptions here  now sensual perceptions in lives to come forms here  now forms in lives to come formperceptions here  now formperceptions in lives to come perceptions of the imperturbable perceptions of the dimension of nothingness perceptions of the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception that is an identity to the extent that there is an identityThis is deathless the liberation of the mind through lack of clingingsustenanceMagandiya it is just as if there were a blind man who couldnt see black objects white blue yellow red the sun or the moonNow suppose that a certain man were to take a grimy oilstained rag and fool him saying Here my good man is a white cloth  beautiful spotless  clean The blind man would take it and wear itThen suppose his friends companions  relatives took him to a doctor and the doctor treated him with medicine purges from above  purges from below ointments  counterointments and treatments through the noseAnd thanks to the medicine his eyesight would appear  grow clearThen together with the arising of his eyesight he would abandon whatever passion  delight he felt for that grimy oilstained ragAnd he would regard that man as an enemy  no friend at all and think that he deserved to be killedMy gosh how long have I been fooled cheated  deceived by that man  his grimy oilstained rag Here my good man is a white cloth  beautiful spotless  cleanIn the same way Magandiya if I were to teach you the Dhamma  this freedom from Disease this Unbinding  and you on your part were to understand that freedom from Disease and see that Unbinding then together with the arising of your eyesight you would abandon whatever passion  delight you felt with regard for the five aggregates for sustenanceAnd it would occur to you My gosh how long have I been fooled cheated  deceived by this mindFor in clinging it was just form that I was clinging toit was just feeling just perception just fabrications just consciousness that I was clinging toWith my clinging as condition there is becoming birth aging  death sorrow lamentation pains distresses  despairs all come into playAnd thus is the origination of this entire mass of stressIn the following passage VenKhemaka  a monk who has attained the level of nonreturner and so has cut the first five fetters  indicates how selfidentity views may be cut even though the mind has yet to cut the conceit I am which ends only at the level of full awakeningFriends its not that I say I am form nor do I say I am something other than form Its not that I say I am feeling perception fabrications consciousness nor do I say I am something other than consciousness With regard to these five clingingaggregates I am has not been overcome although I dont assume that I am thisIts just like the scent of a blue red or white lotus If someone were to call it the scent of a petal or the scent of the color or the scent of a filament would he be speaking correctlyNo friendThen how would he describe it if he were describing it correctlyAs the scent of the flower Thats how he would describe it if he were describing it correctlyIn the same way friends its not that I say I am form nor do I say I am other than form Its not that I say I am feeling perception fabrications consciousness nor do I say I am something other than consciousness With regard to these five clingingaggregates I am has not been overcome although I dont assume that I am thisThe fetter of uncertainty is defined as doubt in the Awakening of the Buddha the truth of his Dhamma and the practice of his noble disciplesWhat this uncertainty boils down to is doubt as to whether there is a Deathless dimension and whether one can realize it through ones own effortsThe experience of the Deathless  following on the practice of the Dhamma to the point of entering the stream  cuts this fetter by confirming the possibility of a human beings awakening to the Deathless the correctness of the Buddhas teaching as a guide to entering the stream and the worthiness of those who have reached the streamThere is the case where the disciple of the noble ones is endowed with unwavering confidence in the Awakened One Indeed the Blessed One is worthy and rightly selfawakened consummate in knowledge  conduct wellgone an expert with regard to the world unexcelled as a trainer for those people fit to be tamed the Teacher of devas  human beings awakened blessedHe is endowed with unwavering confidence in the Dhamma The Dhamma is wellexpounded by the Blessed One to be seen here  now timeless inviting verification pertinent to be realized by the wise for themselvesHe is endowed with unwavering confidence in the Sangha The Sangha of the Blessed Ones disciples who have practiced well who have practiced straightforwardly who have practiced methodically who have practiced masterfully  in other words the four types of noble disciples when taken as pairs the eight when taken as individual types  they are the Sangha of the Blessed Ones disciples worthy of gifts worthy of hospitality worthy of offerings worthy of respect the incomparable field of merit for the world NOTEThe four pairs are the person on the path to stream entry the person experiencing the fruit of stream entry the person on the path to oncereturning the person experiencing the fruit of oncereturning the person on the path to nonreturning the person experiencing the fruit of nonreturning the person on the path to arahantship the person experiencing the fruit of arahantshipThe eight individuals are the eight types forming these four pairsThe fetter of grasping at habits and practices is often described in the Pali Canon with reference to the view that one becomes pure simply through performing rituals or patterns of behaviorThis view in turn is related to the notion that ones being is defined by ones actions If one acts in accordance with clearly defined habits and practices one is ipso facto pureAlthough the Canon recognizes the importance of habits and practices in the attaining the stream the experience of the Deathless shows the person who has attained the stream that one cannot define oneself in terms of those habits and practicesThus one continues to follow virtuous practices but without defining oneself in terms of themNow where do skillful habits cease without traceTheir cessation too has been stated There is the case where a monk is virtuous but not fashioned of virtueHe discerns as it actually is the awarenessrelease  discernmentrelease where his skillful habits cease without traceA standard formula in the Canon describes a streamenterer in terms of four factorsThe first three of these four factors of stream entry are directly related to the cutting of the fetter of uncertaintyThe fourth is related to the cutting of the fetter of grasping at habits and practicesThere is the case where the disciple of the noble ones is endowed with unwavering confidence in the Awakened One unwavering confidence in the Dhamma unwavering confidence in the Sangha Heshe is endowed with virtues that are appealing to the noble ones untorn unbroken unspotted unsplattered liberating praised by the wise untarnished leading to concentrationAlthough this is the standard list of the four factors of stream entry there are other lists that replace the fourth factor with other factorsSNdefines the fourth factor as follows Furthermore the disciple of the noble ones lives at home with an awareness cleansed of the stain of stinginess freely generous openhanded delighting in being magnanimous responsive to requests delighting in the distribution of almsSNdefines it as follows Furthermore the disciple of the noble ones is discerning endowed with discernment of arising  passing away  noble penetrating leading to the right ending of stressWhen these lists are collated we arrive at four qualities that describe a streamenterer conviction virtue generosity and discernmentANdescribes these as four qualities that lead to a lay persons happiness and wellbeing in lives to come Other passages in the Canon explore the implications of each of these four as embodied in a streamenterers behaviorConviction in the Triple Gem of the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha is not simply a matter of belief or devotionIt forces one to place trust in the principle of kamma  the principle of action and result in line with which one first gained entry to the streamEndowed with these five qualities a lay follower is a jewel of a lay follower a lotus of a lay follower a fine flower of a lay followerWhich fiveHeshe has conviction is virtuous is not eager for protective charms  ceremonies trusts kamma not protective charms  ceremonies does not search for recipients of hisher offerings outside and gives offerings here firstVirtue as practiced by the streamenterer is also a function of a deep trust in the principle of kamma and of a sympathy for others that arises from that trustAlthough streamenterers may still break the minor rules of training the depth of insight that informs their virtue ensures that their adherence to the basic principles of morality is unshakableThere is the case where a disciple of the noble ones reflects thus I love life and dont love deathI love happiness and abhor painNow if I  loving life and not loving death loving happiness and abhorring pain  were to be killed that would be displeasing  disagreeable to meAnd if I were to kill another who loves life and doesnt love death who loves happiness and abhors pain that would be displeasing  disagreeable to the otherWhat is displeasing  disagreeable to me is displeasing  disagreeable to othersHow can I inflict on others what is displeasing  disagreeable to me Reflecting in this way he refrains from taking life gets others to refrain from taking life and speaks in praise of refraining from taking lifeIn this way his bodily behavior is pure in three waysFurthermore he reflects thus If someone by way of theft were to take from me what I havent given that would be displeasing  disagreeable to me If someone were to commit adultery with my wives that would be displeasing  disagreeable to me If someone were to damage my wellbeing with a lie that would be displeasing  disagreeable to me If someone were to divide me from my friends with divisive speech that would be displeasing  disagreeable to me If someone were to address me with harsh speech that would be displeasing  disagreeable to me If someone were to address me with idle chatter that would be displeasing  disagreeable to meAnd if I were to address another with idle chatter that would be displeasing  disagreeable to the otherWhat is displeasing  disagreeable to me is displeasing  disagreeable to othersHow can I inflict on others what is displeasing  disagreeable to me Reflecting in this way he refrains from idle chatter gets others to refrain from idle chatter and speaks in praise of refraining from idle chatterIn this way his verbal behavior is pure in three waysMonks this recitation of more than training rules comes every fortnight in reference to which sons of good families desiring the goal train themselvesThere are these three trainings under which all that is gatheredWhich threeThe training in heightened virtue the training in heightened mind the training in heightened discernmentThese are the three trainings under which all that is gatheredThere is the case where a monk is wholly accomplished in virtue moderately accomplished in concentration and moderately accomplished in discernmentWith reference to the lesser and minor training rules he falls into offenses and rehabilitates himselfWhy is thatBecause I have not declared that to be a disqualification in these circumstancesBut as for the training rules that are basic to the holy life and proper to the holy life he is one of permanent virtue one of steadfast virtueHaving undertaken them he trains in reference to the training rulesWith the wasting away of three fetters he is a streamwinner never again destined for states of woe certain headed for selfawakeningGenerosityis actually a characteristic that must precede stream entryHowever the attainment of stream entry gives generosity a distinctive integrityMonks there are these five forms of stinginessWhich fiveStinginess as to ones monastery stinginess as to ones family stinginess as to ones gains stinginess as to ones status and stinginess as to the DhammaThese are the five forms of stinginessAnd the meanest of these five is this stinginess as to the DhammaWithout abandoning these five things one is incapable of realizing the fruit of stream entryWithout abandoning these five things one is incapable of realizing the fruit of stream entryWhich fiveStinginess as to ones monastery stinginess as to ones family stinginess as to ones gains stinginess as to ones status and ingratitudeThese five are a person of integritys giftsWhich fiveA person of integrity gives a gift with a sense of convictionA person of integrity gives a gift attentivelyA person of integrity gives a gift in seasonA person of integrity gives a gift with an empathetic heartA person of integrity gives a gift without adversely affecting himself or othersDiscernment is the character trait of the streamenterer that is most directly related to the cutting of the fetter of selfidentity viewsHowever its implications spread to other facets of right view as wellIn fact consummate in view is one of the epithets for a streamentererThe impact of being consummate in view extends not only to ones intellectual life but also to ones emotional life as wellThere is the case where a monk having gone to the wilderness to the root of a tree or to an empty dwelling considers thus Is there any internal enthrallment unabandoned in me that enthralled with which my enthralled mind would not know or see things as they actually are If a monk is enthralled with sensual passion then his mind is enthralledIf he is enthralled with ill will then his mind is enthralledIf he is enthralled with sloth and torpor then his mind is enthralledIf he is enthralled with restlessness and anxiety then his mind is enthralledIf he is enthralled with uncertainty then his mind is enthralledIf a monk is absorbed in speculation about this world then his mind is enthralledIf a monk is absorbed in speculation about the other world then his mind is enthralledIf a monk is given to arguing and quarreling and disputing stabbing others with weapons of the mouth then his mind is enthralledHe discerns that There is no enthrallment unabandoned in me that enthralled with which my enthralled mind would not know and see things as they actually areMy mind is well directed for awakening to the truths This is the first knowledge attained by him that is noble transcendent not held in common with runofthemill peopleFurthermore the disciple of the noble ones considers thus When I cultivate develop and pursue this view do I personally obtain serenity do I personally obtain UnbindingHe discerns that When I cultivate develop and pursue this view I personally obtain serenity I personally obtain Unbinding This is the second knowledge attained by him that is noble transcendent not held in common with runofthemill peopleFurthermore the disciple of the noble ones considers thus Is there outside of this any other contemplative or brahman endowed with the sort of view with which I am endowedHe discerns that There is no other contemplative or brahman outside endowed with the sort of view with which I am endowed This is the third knowledge attained by him that is noble transcendent not held in common with runofthemill peopleFurthermore the disciple of the noble ones considers thus Am I endowed with the character of a person consummate in view What is the character of a person consummate in viewThis is the character of a person consummate in view Although he may commit some kind of offence for which a means of rehabilitation has been laid down still he immediately confesses reveals and discloses it to the Teacher or to wise companions in the holy life having done that he undertakes restraint for the futureJust as a young tender infant lying on his back when he has hit a live ember with his hand or his foot immediately draws back in the same way this is the character of a person consummate in view although he may commit some kind of offence for which a means of rehabilitation has been laid down still he immediately confesses reveals and discloses it to the Teacher or to wise companions in the holy life having done that he undertakes restraint for the futureHe discerns that I am endowed with the character of a person consummate in view This is the fourth knowledge attained by him that is noble transcendent not held in common with runofthemill peopleFurthermore the disciple of the noble ones considers thus Am I endowed with the character of a person consummate in view What is the character of a person consummate in viewThis is the character of a person consummate in view although he may be active in the various affairs of his companions in the holy life he still has a keen regard for training in heightened virtue training in heightened mind  training in heightened discernmentJust as a cow with a new calf watches after her calf all the while she is grazing on grass in the same way this is the character of a person consummate in view Although he may be active in the various affairs of his companions in the holy life he still has a keen regard for training in heightened virtue training in heightened mind  training in heightened discernmentHe discerns that I am endowed with the character of a person consummate in view This is the fifth knowledge attained by him that is noble transcendent not held in common with runofthemill peopleFurthermore the disciple of the noble ones considers thus Am I endowed with the strength of a person consummate in view What is the strength of a person consummate in viewThis is the strength of a person consummate in view When the Dhamma  Vinaya proclaimed by the Tathagata is being taught he heeds it gives it attention engages it with all his mind hears the Dhamma with eager earsHe discerns that I am endowed with the strength of a person consummate in view This is the sixth knowledge attained by him that is noble transcendent not held in common with runofthemill peopleFurthermore the disciple of the noble ones considers thus Am I endowed with the strength of a person consummate in view What is the strength of a person consummate in viewThis is the strength of a person consummate in view When the Dhamma  Vinaya proclaimed by the Tathagata is being taught he gains understanding in the meaning gains understanding in the Dhamma gains gladness connected with the DhammaHe discerns that I am endowed with the strength of a person consummate in view This is the seventh knowledge attained by him that is noble transcendent not held in common with runofthemill peopleA disciple of the noble ones thus possessed of seven factors has well examined the character for the realization of the fruit of stream entryA disciple of the noble ones thus possessed of seven factors is endowed with the fruit of stream entryThere is a manner of reckoning whereby a monk who is a learner standing at the level of a learner can discern that I am a learner and whereby a monk who is an adept standing at the level of an adept can discern that I am an adeptAnd what is the manner of reckoning whereby a monk who is a learner standing at the level of a learner can discern that I am a learnerThere is the case where a monk is a learnerHe discerns as it actually is that This is stress This is the origination of stress This is the cessation of stress This is the path of practice leading to the cessation of stress This is a manner of reckoning whereby a monk who is a learner standing at the level of a learner can discern that I am a learnerFurthermore the monk who is a learner reflects Is there outside of this any contemplative or brahman who teaches the true genuine  accurate Dhamma like the Blessed One And he discerns No there is no contemplative or brahman outside of this Dhamma  Vinaya who teaches the true genuine  accurate Dhamma like the Blessed One This too is a manner of reckoning whereby a monk who is a learner standing at the level of a learner can discern that I am a learnerFurthermore the monk who is a learner discerns the five faculties the faculty of conviction persistence mindfulness concentration discernmentHe sees clear through with discernment their destiny excellence rewards  consummation but he does not touch them with his bodyThis too is a manner of reckoning whereby a monk who is a learner standing at the level of a learner can discern that I am a learnerAnd what is the manner of reckoning whereby a monk who is an adept standing at the level of an adept can discern that I am an adeptThere is the case where a monk who is an adept discerns the five faculties the faculty of conviction persistence mindfulness concentration discernmentHe touches with his body and sees clear through with discernment what their destiny excellence rewards  consummation areThis is a manner of reckoning whereby a monk who is an adept standing at the level of an adept can discern that I am an adeptFurthermore the monk who is an adept discerns the six sense faculties the faculty of the eye ear nose tongue body intellectHe discerns These six sense faculties will disband entirely everywhere  in every way without remainder and no other set of six sense faculties will arise anywhere or in any way This too is a manner of reckoning whereby a monk who is an adept standing at the level of an adept can discern that I am an adeptThen Anathapindika the householder went to where the wanderers of other persuasions were stayingOn arrival he greeted them courteouslyAfter an exchange of friendly greetings  courtesies he sat to one sideAs he was sitting there the wanderers said to him Tell us householder what views the contemplative Gotama hasVenerable sirs I dont know entirely what views the Blessed One hasWell wellSo you dont know entirely what views the contemplative Gotama hasThen tell us what views the monks haveI dont even know entirely what views the monks haveSo you dont know entirely what views the contemplative Gotama has or even that the monks haveThen tell us what views you haveIt wouldnt be difficult for me to expound to you what views I haveBut please let the venerable ones expound each in line with his position and then it wont be difficult for me to expound to you what views I haveWhen this had been said one of the wanderers said to Anathapindika the householder The cosmos is eternalOnly this is true anything otherwise is worthlessThis is the sort of view I haveAnother wanderer said to Anathapindika The cosmos is not eternalOnly this is true anything otherwise is worthlessThis is the sort of view I haveAnother wanderer said The cosmos is finite The cosmos is infinite The soul  the body are the same The soul is one thing and the body another After death a Tathagata exists After death a Tathagata does not exist After death a Tathagata both does  does not exist After death a Tathagata neither does nor does not existOnly this is true anything otherwise is worthlessThis is the sort of view I haveWhen this had been said Anathapindika the householder said to the wanderers As for the venerable one who says The cosmos is eternalOnly this is true anything otherwise is worthlessThis is the sort of view I have his view arises from his own inappropriate attention or in dependence on the words of anotherNow this view has been brought into being is fabricated willed dependently originatedWhatever has been brought into being is fabricated willed dependently originated that is inconstantWhatever is inconstant is stressThis venerable one thus adheres to that very stress submits himself to that very stress When this had been said the wanderers said to Anathapindika the householder We have each  every one expounded to you in line with our own positionsNow tell us what views you have
