The diligent are not powerless
Suffering can be overcome
Still knowing ourselves to be sunk in confusion and beset by myriad defilements we might regard Nibbana as too remote to do us much good here and now
We persist in seeing an unbridgeable chasm between saints and ordinary people like ourselves
We think practically everybody is like us while maybe there are one or two genuine saints in the world they presumably having just been born in that condition or with the exceptional good luck to get themselves elevated  who knows how
Yet the human condition is not according to Buddhism a fixed sentence to this or that level of wisdom and virtue
Beings are living at all stages of attainment and they do not stay in the same place
They rise through their own good efforts and decline through their own negligence in the endless action and reaction of intentional deeds and results of deeds
The Buddha did not teach the Dhamma for the entertainment of those already perfected he taught it for the benefit of fallible people like us who were struggling to avoid pain and make sense of the world
Even to those who came to him with no intention to scale high spiritual summits he imparted the progressive training of giving morality and mental development
Why
Because there is always scope for improvement and because the human alternatives are not limited to holy wisdom or cloddish ignorance
Suffering lessens and happiness increases when we make an effort to follow the Noble Eightfold Path whatever our present condition
In the classic formula the Dhamma is directly visible timeless calling one to come and see leading onwards to be personally realized by the wise Perhaps we cannot see Nibbana resplendent on the horizon but we can certainly make out the ground beneath our feet we can know when we draw a joyful breath or put behind us an old sorrow or refrain from a vicious act or compose an agitated mind
The Dhamma confers benefits here and now as well as in the future
Is there not satisfaction in performing a good deed with a clear mind
Is there not uplift in a moment of quiet contemplation saved from the tumult of the day
The Dhamma lightens our burdens in the present and gives us grounds for hope
What then does this have to do with the problems of love
Simply this
The Dhamma puts the delights and torments of love into perspective so that we can break the illusion of love as the highest of aspirations and most essential of desires
Henry Thoreau wrote The only remedy for love is to love more We might amend this to say The only remedy for love is to love better
The understanding and the practice of the Dhamma do not destroy our capacity to love or enjoy love  far from it
The Dhamma purges the grasping selfish qualities from our love and makes it purer and nobler
As we come to understand through personal experience the rightness and goodness of the path of Dhamma we may discover  slowly or suddenly  that the consuming passions we previously thought to be the only reasons for our existence are really not so and that something of wondrous value overarches them  indistinct as yet but flashing out now and again from the clouds of possibility
What do our heaving emotions matter compared with that
When we lean hard out of passion we will fall hard  such is the nature of attachment
But when we do not lean when instead we stand upright with an eye to the heights then the love we bestow flows out of us without weakening us like a superabundance of vigor
This is metta  lovingkindness devoid of selfishness
It becomes purer to the extent we realize it is not the purest it becomes happier to the extent we realize it is not the happiest
Nibbana surpasses all
If through our own ripening knowledge we appreciate that our ultimate and highest purpose should be Nibbana the absolute end of sorrow then all goals beneath that are cast in a new light
When we have something to live for that is higher than fame honor friendship or health  higher even than love  we can never be utterly impoverished or ruined
We are in fact in a much better position to enjoy whatever may be achieved in worldly life because we no longer depend solely on changeable circumstances for our happiness
Love cools friendships wane calamities carry off the good and the beautiful
Who can deny it
If we are to overcome despair and grief we must not invest ourselves obsessively in what is perishable
We need to keep our minds and consequently our actions as free as possible from craving and attendant defilements like covetousness and possessiveness
 Dhammapada vv 
While nobody can cut off craving simply by an act of will we can certainly loosen its frightful grip on us by following the path and paying attention to the ultimate deliverance that shines at its end
Love is never the poorer for being accompanied by wisdom
It is not harmed by being deprived of a crown
The agonies we endure and inflict in the name of love come from making love bear too heavy a weight
While we are in the world and engaged in the life of a householder we will naturally form attachments to family job friends and lovers but the suffering produced from these attachments will vary according to our wisdom and maturity
If we see nothing higher at all and abandon ourselves to the lottery of gaining and losing we will surely suffer great pain but if we keep the ideals of the Dhamma before us we will gain a measure of insulation against worldly inclemencies
According to Buddhism everything that has the nature of arising has the nature of ceasing so it is well to place our greatest faith in Nibbana which being beyond all concepts and limits does not arise and thus does not fluctuate with the teetering universe
An independent mind intent on deliverance is not a cold unfeeling mind but a mind whose love is uncalculated beneficent free  and empty of the furious I want of ego
If we don't live for love we won't die for it either
If the windows of our mind are open to the streaming light of Dhamma then that light will bathe our thoughts and actions and distinguish the skillful from the foolish
Even without understanding of the Dhamma most of us will distinguish in theory between love and infatuation
We think of infatuation as capricious irresponsible and shallow and true love as mature serious and steady  though in practice it is hard to tell where one ends and the other begins
At least we recognize some advantage to clear sight and reflection and this recognition grows sharper with actual experience of the Dhamma
We become less likely to throw ourselves at the feet of the adored object and more likely to stand erect honest and mindful ready to meet our fortune with bravery
To a world that knows nothing loftier than the convulsions of craving this may seem a loss but to one who truly experiences the refreshment of wisdom there comes no narrowness but rather a loosening of the bonds of fear and selfishness
One can love without compulsion out of free will
How gratifying when affection is given or received without a bill for services rendered
Even under promising circumstances there is no guarantee that love will be returned in equal measure or that it will last long or that it will provide unalloyed joy
When we depend on it entirely for our happiness we must dwell in the shadow of pain however bright our amorous interludes
What if we should lose our heart's support tomorrow
We're okay as long as we have each other we assure ourselves dreamily
But we will not have each other long
Quarrels time distance changes or finally death dissolve all unions of friends lovers and relatives plunging the unwary into despair and meaninglessness and if we have no wisdom we too may go creeping about the lonely streets with our eyes staring hungrily into other eyes and seeing the same hunger there
But in the way of the Buddha there is relief from distress and exile
In wisdom there is security
Because love is fragile and temporary it cannot protect us forever but if we relax our grip it may bloom even better allowing us to give and receive without encumbrance frenzy or fear offering to each other our strength instead of our weakness
In a sense the practice of Dhamma is like gradually filling the abyss of ignorance with knowledge until that terrible vacuum is appeased and neutralized and the heart no more cries for unknown succor
The perfected one clinging to nothing here or hereafter asks nothing and requires nothing so he is wholly free
His lovingkindness is just the overmeasure the overflowing of his goodness quite purified of the need the visceral wanting and the vacillation of ordinary attachment
While we cannot all at once purify our sentiments of their dross we can raise the aim of our thought and conduct and reflect on  indeed contemplate  the virtues of the Buddha and the noble ones who are free from taint
Their achievement is an image to set before our inner eye something higher to live for within and beyond the motions of our conventional life
No good thing prospers in ignorance
The more we understand this flawed universe the more skillfully we can live and the happier we will be
We love best when we do not love out of desperation

He has spent time in Thailand and Sri Lanka and currently resides in the United States
The Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creeds
Founded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topics
Its publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddha's discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practice
These works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first arose
In May of this year members of Le Refuge a Buddhist group located in Eguilles near AixenProvence invited me to lead a tenday retreat on the topics of breath meditation and anattā or notself
The retreat provided me with the rare opportunity to gather my thoughts on the topic of notself under one framework
The result was a series of eight evening talks edited transcripts of these talks form the body of this book
The talks draw on passages from the Pali Canon and on the writings and talks of the ajaans or teachers of the Thai forest tradition in which I was trained
For people unfamiliar with the Canon I have added passages from the discourses at the back of the book to flesh out some of the points made in the talks
These are followed by a glossary of Pali terms
For people unfamiliar with the Thai forest tradition you should know that it is a meditation tradition founded in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century by Ajaan Mun Bhuridatto
The other ajaans mentioned in the talks trained under him
Of these Ajaan Fuang and Ajaan Suwat were my teachers
Ajaan Fuang although he spent some time training directly under Ajaan Mun spent more time training under one of Ajaan Mun's students Ajaan Lee
Many people have helped with the preparation of this book
I would like to thank the people of Le Refuge who made the retreat possible and in particular Betty Picheloup the founder of the group and Claude LeNinan my excellent and meticulous interpreter throughout my stay in Provence
Here at Metta the monks at the monastery helped in preparing the manuscript as did Michael Barber Alexandra Kaloyanides Addie Onsanit Ginger Vathanasombat and Josie Wolf
A French translation of the all the talks and questionandanswer sessions during the retreat is currently in preparation
If you are comparing the talks here with their French equivalents please be aware that the French is based on transcriptions that are closer to the original talks than are the versions presented here

The Buddha's teaching on anattā or notself is often mystifying to many Westerners
When we hear the term notself we think that the Buddha was answering a question with a long history in our culture  of whether there is or isn't a self or a soul  and that his answer is perverse or confusing
Sometimes it seems to be No but the Buddha doesn't follow through with the implications of a real No  if there's no self how can there be rebirth
Sometimes his answer seems to be No with a hidden Yes but you wonder why the Yes is so hard to pin down
If you remember only one thing from these talks remember this that the Buddha in teaching notself was not answering the question of whether there is or isn't a self
This question was one he explicitly put aside
To understand why it's useful to look at the Buddha's approach to teaching  and to questions  in general
Once he was walking through a forest with a group of monks
He stooped down to pick up a handful of leaves and told the monks that the leaves in his hand were like the teachings he had given
As for the leaves in the forest they were like the knowledge he had gained in his awakening
The leaves in his hand covered just two issues how suffering is caused and how it can be ended
After his awakening the Buddha could have talked about anything at all but he chose to talk on just these two topics
To understand his teachings we have to understand not only what he said about suffering and its end but also why these topics were of utmost importance
The purpose of his teachings was to help people find true happiness
He didn't assume that all beings are inherently good or inherently bad but he did assume that they all want happiness
However they tend to be bewildered by their suffering so they need help in finding a way to genuine happiness
In fact this sense of bewilderment gives rise to one of the mind's most primal questions Is there anyone who knows how to put an end to this suffering The Buddha's teachings are a direct response to this burning gutlevel question providing people with something they desperately want and need advice on how to end their suffering
In other words the Buddha chose to share the most compassionate knowledge he could provide
Because people have trouble thinking straight when they're suffering they need reliable instruction in what really is causing their suffering and what they can do to put an end to it before they can actually find the way out of their suffering and arrive at true happiness
And it's important that these instructions not introduce other issues that will distract them from the main issue at hand
This is why the path to true happiness begins with right view the understanding that helps clear up the mind's bewilderment
Right view is not just a matter of having correct opinions about why there's suffering and what can be done about it
Right view also means knowing how you gain right opinions by asking the right questions learning which questions help put an end to suffering which questions get in the way and how to use this knowledge skillfully on the path to true happiness
This means that right view is strategic
In fact all of the Buddha's teachings are strategic
They are not simply to be discussed they are to be put to use and mastered as skills so as to arrive at their intended aim
The Buddha understood that the issues of our life are defined by our questions
A question gives a context to the knowledge contained in its answer  a sense of where that knowledge fits and what it's good for
Some questions are skillful in that they provide a useful context for putting an end to suffering whereas others are not
Once one of the Buddha's monks came to see him and asked him a list of ten questions the major philosophical questions of his time
Some of the questions concerned the nature of the world whether it was eternal or not finite or not others concerned the nature and existence of the self
The Buddha refused to answer any of them and he explained the reason for his refusal
He said it was as if a man had been shot by an arrow and was taken to a doctor and before the doctor could take the arrow out the man would insist that he find out first who had shot the arrow who had made the arrow what the arrow was made of what kind of wood what kind of feathers
As the Buddha said if the doctor tried to answer all of those questions the man would die first
The first order of business would be to take the arrow out
If the person still wanted to know the answer to those questions he could ask afterwards
In the same way the Buddha would answer only the questions that provided an answer to our primal question and helped put an end to suffering and stress
Questions that would get in the way he would put aside because the problem of stress and suffering is urgent
Usually when we hear the teaching on notself we think that it's an answer to questions like these Do I have a self
What am I
Do I exist
Do I not exist However the Buddha listed all of these as unskillful questions
Once when he was asked pointblank Is there a self
Is there no self he refused to answer
He said that these questions would get in the way of finding true happiness
So obviously the teaching on notself was not meant to answer these questions
To understand it we have to find out which questions it was meant to answer
As the Buddha said he taught two categorical teachings two teachings that were true across the board and without exceptions
These two teachings form the framework for everything else he taught
One was the difference between skillful and unskillful action actions that lead to longterm happiness and those that lead to longterm suffering
The other was the list of the four noble truths the truth of suffering the cause of suffering the end of suffering and the path to the end of suffering
If you want to put an end to suffering and stress these two categorical teachings carry duties or imperatives
In terms of the first teaching you want to avoid unskillful action and give rise to skillful action
In terms of the second the four truths are categories for framing your experience with each category carrying a specific duty you have to master as a skill
You need to know which of the truths you're encountering so that you can deal with that truth in the right way
Suffering must be comprehended the cause of suffering must be abandoned the end of suffering must be realized and the path to the end of suffering must be developed as a skill
These are the ultimate skillful actions which means that the mastery of the path is where the two sets of categorical teachings come together
The path begins with discernment  the factors of right view and right resolve  and discernment begins with this basic question about which actions are really skillful What when I do it will lead to longterm welfare and happiness The Buddha's teaching on notself  and his teaching on self  are in part answers to this question
To fit into this question perceptions of self and perceptions of notself are best viewed as kamma or actions actions of identification and disidentification
In the terms of the texts the perception of self is called an action of Imaking and mymaking The perception of notself is part of an activity called the notself contemplation Thus the question becomes When is the perception of self a skillful action that leads to longterm welfare and happiness when is the perception of notself a skillful action that leads to longterm welfare and happiness
This is the reverse of the way that the relationship between questions of kamma and notself are usually understood
If you've ever taken an introductory course on Buddhism you've probably heard this question If there is no self who does the kamma who receives the results of kamma This understanding turns the teaching on notself into a teaching on no self and then takes no self as the framework and the teaching on kamma as something that doesn't fit in the framework
But in the way the Buddha taught these topics the teaching on kamma is the framework and the teaching of notself fits into that framework as a type of action
In other words assuming that there really are skillful and unskillful actions what kind of action is the perception of self
What kind of action is the perception of notself
So to repeat the issue is not What is my true self but What kind of perception of self is skillful and when is it skillful what kind of perception of notself is skillful and when is it skillful
We already engage in these perceptions all of the time and have been doing so ever since we were children
We have many different perceptions of self
Each sense of self is strategic a means to an end
Each comes with a boundary inside of which is self and outside of which is notself And so our sense of what's self and what's notself keeps changing all of the time depending on our desires and what we see will lead to true happiness
Take an example from your childhood
Suppose you have a younger sister and someone down the street is threatening her
You want to protect her
At that moment she is very much your sister
She belongs to you so you will do whatever you can to protect her
Then suppose that when you've brought her home safely she begins to play with your toy car and won't give it back to you
Now she's no longer your sister
She's the Other
Your sense of your self and of what is yours and not yours has shifted
The boundary line between self and notself has changed
You've been doing this sort of thing  changing the boundaries of what's self and notself  all of the time
Think back on your life  or even for just a day  to see the many times your sense of self has changed from one role to another
Normally we create a sense of self as a strategy for gaining happiness
We look for what abilities we have in order to gain a happiness we want
Those abilities are then ours
The hand we can use to reach for the object we want is our hand the loud voice we can use to scare off the bullies threatening our sister is our voice
This is why the element of control is so essential to our sense of self We assume that the things we can control are us or ours
Then we also try to think about which part of ourselves will live to enjoy the happiness we're trying to gain
These things will change depending on the desire
Unfortunately our desires tend to be confused and incoherent
We're also unskillful in our understanding of what happiness is
Thus we often end up with an inconsistent and misinformed collection of selves
You can see this clearly as you meditate You find that the mind contains many different inner voices expressing many conflicting opinions as to what you should and shouldn't be doing to be happy
It's as if you have a committee inside the mind and the committee is rarely in order
That's because it's composed of selves you've collected from all your past strategies for trying to gain happiness and these strategies often worked at crosspurposes
Some of them seemed to work at a time when your standards for happiness were crude or you weren't really paying attention to the results you were getting  as when you threw a tantrum and got your mother to give you the food you wanted
These members of the committee tend to be deluded
Some of your strategies involved doing things you liked to do but actually led to suffering  as when you hit your sister and got your toy truck back
These members of the committee tend to be dishonest and deceitful They deny the suffering they caused
This is why your committee of selves is not an orderly gathering of saints
It's more like a corrupt city council
The Buddha's purpose in having us master perceptions of self and notself is to bring some clarity honesty and order to the committee to teach us how to engage in these activities of perception in a conscious consistent and skillful way that will lead to true happiness
It's important to understand this point for it helps to clear up a major misunderstanding that can cause us to resist the teaching on notself
We instinctively know that our strategies of selfmaking are for the sake of happiness so when we misunderstand the Buddha's notself teaching  thinking that it's a no self teaching and that he's trying to deny us of our selves  we're afraid that he's trying to deprive us of our strategies for finding happiness and protecting the happiness we've found
That's why we resist the teaching
But when we gain a proper understanding of his teaching we see that his aim is to teach us how to use perceptions of self and notself as strategies leading to a happiness that's reliable and true
In teaching notself he's not trying to deprive us of our strategies for happiness he's actually trying to show us how to expand and refine them so that we can find a happiness better than any happiness we've ever known
In terms of the Buddha's two categorical teachings the teaching on notself is a strategy for helping you with the duties they call for if you want to put an end to suffering and stress helping you to avoid unskillful action in the first categorical teaching and to comprehend stress and abandon its cause in the second
You do this in conjunction with some skillful selfstrategies that help you give rise to skillful actions and to develop the path
When you master these strategies properly they enable you to realize the end of suffering
This is why these teachings are included in the Buddha's handful of leaves
These are the main points that I'd like to discuss for the rest of the retreat
The important point to notice as we connect these talks with our meditation is that we can view our sense of self as an activity a process
It's something we do and something we can learn to do more skillfully
At the same time we'll look at our sense of what's notself  which is also an activity  and learn how to do that more skillfully too
When we learn to do this in the proper way we'll arrive at true happiness free from any suffering and stress
At that point questions of self and notself will be put aside
When you arrive at true happiness you no longer need strategies to protect it  the way you do for forms of happiness that are subject to change  because it's unconditioned
It doesn't depend on anything at all
The strategy of self is no longer needed and neither is the strategy of notself
As Ajaan Suwat one of my teachers once said when you find true happiness you don't ask who's experiencing it for that's not an issue
The experience itself is sufficient
It doesn't need anybody to watch over it
But to reach that point we have to learn how to develop our skill in employing both the strategies of self and the strategies of notself
These are the skills and strategies we'll be discussing each evening during the retreat
Tonight I'd like to talk more about why the Buddha refused to get involved in the issue of whether there is or is not a self
This will involve discussing in more detail two of the points I made last night
The first point is that the Buddha's teaching was strategic aimed at leading to a specific goal total freedom in the minds of his listeners
The second point is that as part of this larger strategy the Buddha had strategic reasons for putting questions of the existence or nonexistence of the self aside
Part of his teaching strategy was to divide questions into four types based on how they should be best approached for the purpose of putting an end to suffering and stress
The first type includes those that deserve a categorical answer in other words a straight yes or no this or that with no exceptions
The second type includes questions that deserve an analytical answer in which the Buddha would reanalyze the question before answering it
The third type includes questions that deserve a counterquestion
In other words he would question the questioner before answering the original question
And the fourth type includes questions that deserve to be put aside as useless  or even harmful  in the quest to put an end to suffering
And as I said the questions Is there a self
Is there no self are ones he put aside
Here's the passage where he explains why
Then Vacchagotta the wanderer went to the Blessed One and on arrival exchanged courteous greetings with him
After an exchange of friendly greetings and courtesies he sat down to one side
As he was sitting there he asked the Blessed One 'Now then master Gotama is there a self' When this was said the Blessed One was silent
'Then is there no self' The second time the Blessed One was silent
Then Vacchagotta the wanderer got up from his seat and left
Then not long after Vacchagotta the wanderer had left Venerable nanda said to the Blessed One 'Why Lord did the Blessed One not answer when asked a question by Vacchagotta the wanderer' And here's the Buddha's response nanda if I being asked by Vacchagotta the wanderer if there is a self were to answer that there is a self that would be conforming with those brahmans and contemplatives who are exponents of eternalism
If I being asked by Vacchagotta the wanderer if there is no self were to answer that there is no self that would be conforming with those brahmans and contemplatives who are exponents of annihilationism
If I being asked by Vacchagotta the wanderer if there is a self were to answer that there is a self would that be in keeping with the arising of knowledge that all phenomena are notself
And Venerable nanda said No Lord
Then the Buddha said And if I being asked by Vacchagotta the wanderer if there is no self were to answer that there is no self the bewildered Vacchagotta would become even more bewildered 'Does the self that I used to have now not exist'
Notice that only one of the Buddha's reasons for putting these questions aside concerns the person asking them Vacchagotta would be bewildered by the answer
The other three reasons state that any answer to these questions would either side with wrong views or would get in the way of an insight that as we will see is an important step at an advanced stage of the path
Also notice that the Buddha is not giving an analytical answer to either of Vacchagotta's questions nor is he giving a counterquestion such as What kind of self do you mean This rules out the idea that the notself teaching is aimed at negating specific ideas of self  in other words that the answer would depend on what you mean by self
However most popular misinterpretations of the notself teaching give just this kind of answer to these questions
In other words It depends on what kind of self we're talking about
Certain types of self exist whereas other types don't What this means is that these misinterpretations say that the Buddha didn't answer Vacchagotta's categorical question because it required an analytical answer
But as we have seen the Buddha knew how to give analytical answers to categorical questions whenever he needed to
And he had his reasons for putting these questions on the existence or nonexistence of the self aside
But because these popular misinterpretations are so pervasive it's important that we look at them in some detail to see why they are misinterpretations how they misunderstand the Buddha's approach and place obstacles in the path
Otherwise it's all too easy for us to fall into these misunderstandings ourselves
One misinterpretation is that the Buddha's notself teaching is aimed specifically at negating the view of self proposed in the Brahmanical Upanishads  that the self is permanent cosmic and identical with God  but the Buddha is not negating the fact that we each have an individual self
In other words he's saying Yes you have an individual self but No you don't have a cosmicGod self
The second misinterpretation is the exact opposite The Buddha is negating the idea that you have a small separate self but he's affirming the existence of a large interconnected cosmic self
In other words he's saying Yes you do have a connected self but No you don't have a separate self
The third misinterpretation is similar to the first but it introduces the idea that a self to be a true self has to be permanent
According to this interpretation the Buddha is affirming that the five aggregates are what you are but these five aggregates don't really qualify to be called a self because they aren't permanent
They're just processes
In other words No you don't have a self but Yes you're a bunch of processes the aggregates are what you are
None of these interpretations fit in with the Buddha's actual teachings or his actual approach to the question of whether there is or is not a self
They misrepresent the Buddha both for formal reasons  the fact that they give an analytical answer to a question the Buddha put aside  and for reasons of content They don't fit in with what the Buddha actually had to say on the topic of self and notself
For example with the first misinterpretation  that the Buddha is denying the cosmic self found in the Upanishads  it turns out that the Upanishads contain many different views of the self and the Buddha himself gives an analysis of those different kinds
He finds four main varieties
One is that the self has a form and is finite  for example that your self is your conscious body and will end when the body dies
The second type is that the self has a form and is infinite  for example the view that the self is equal to the cosmos
The third type is that the self is formless and finite
This is similar to the Christian idea of the soul It doesn't have a shape and its range is limited
The fourth view is that the self is formless and infinite  for example the belief that the self is the infinite spirit or energy that animates the cosmos
The Buddha says that each of these four varieties of selftheory comes in three different modes as to when and how the self is that way
One is that the self already is that way
Another is that the self naturally changes to be that way  for example when you fall asleep or when you die
The third is that the self is changeable through the will
In other words through meditation and other practices you can change the nature of your self  for example from being finite to being infinite
Multiply the four varieties of self by their three modes and you have twelve types of theories about the self
All of these theories the Buddha rejects
He doesn't agree with any of them because they all involve clinging which is something you have to comprehend and let go
This means that his notself teaching is not just negating specific types of self  such as a cosmic self a permanent self or an ordinary individual self
It negates every imaginable way of defining the self
As for the second misinterpretation that the Buddha is actually affirming the cosmic or interconnected self the evidence I've already given you shows that that cannot be the case
There is also a passage in the Canon where he says specifically that the idea of a cosmic self is especially foolish
His argument is this If there is a self there must be what belongs to a self
If your self is cosmic then the whole cosmos must belong to you
But does it
No
Does it lie under your control
No
Therefore it doesn't deserve to be called yours
As for the third misinterpretation  that the five aggregates aren't a self because they aren't permanent but nevertheless the five aggregates are what you are  the Buddha says repeatedly that it's not fitting to identify the aggregates as what I am
As we will see later he explains the five aggregates as the raw material from which you create your sense of self but that it's not skillful to think that they constitute what you are
Another problem with this misinterpretation is that it opens the Buddha to charges of lying in the many passages where he does refer to the self in a positive way  as when he says that the self is its own mainstay
If there really is no self at all why does he talk about it as if it exists
To get around this problem the interpretation introduces the distinction between two levels of truth conventional and ultimate
Thus it says when the Buddha is talking about self he's doing so only in a conventional way
On the ultimate level no self exists
The problem with this distinction is that the Buddha himself never uses it  it was introduced into the tradition at a much later date  and if it were so central to understanding his teachings you'd think that he would have mentioned it
But he didn't
There's also the problem that if the aggregates were what you are then  because nibbāna is the ending of the aggregates  that would mean that when you attain nibbāna you would be annihilated
The Buddha however denied that nibbāna was annihilation
At the same time what good would be the end of suffering if it meant total annihilation
Only people who hate themselves or hate all experience would go for it
And as for the idea that only a permanent identity deserves to be called a self It's not the case that the Buddha would tell you to create a sense of self around the experience of something unchanging or permanent
As we will see at an advanced level of the practice he tells you to develop the perception of notself even for the phenomenon of the deathless which is something that doesn't change
The problem with the act of selfidentification is not just that it's mistakenly focused on impermanent objects when it should be focused on permanent objects
It ultimately shouldn't be focused on anything at all because it always involves clinging regardless of what it's focused on and clinging involves suffering and stress
The whole point of the Buddha's teaching is to put an end to suffering and stress
So when the Buddha refused to answer Vacchagotta's questions it wasn't because he had an analytical answer in mind that he couldn't explain to Vacchagotta but would perhaps explain to others
It was because in order to avoid getting involved with issues that get in the way of putting an end to suffering these questions deserved to be put aside no matter who asked them
In fact there's another sutta passage that makes precisely this point No matter who you are if you try to answer the question Do I exist or Do I not exist or What am I you get entangled in views like I have a self or I have no self which the Buddha calls a thicket of views a wilderness of views The image is clear If you're entangled in a thicket or a wilderness you've wandered far from the path and will have trouble getting back on course
The main point to take from all of this is that the Buddha is not interested in defining what you are or what your self is
He's a lot more compassionate than that
He wants you to see how you define your own sense of self
After all you're not responsible for how he might define your self and his definition of your self is not really your problem
But you are responsible for the way you define yourself and that very much is your problem
When you define yourself through ignorance you suffer and you often cause the people around you to suffer as well
As a first step in putting an end to this suffering you have to bring awareness to the process by which you create your sense of self so that you can clearly see what you're doing and why it's causing that suffering
This is why the Buddha aims at getting you to understand that process in line with his two categorical teachings
He wants you to see how your act of selfdefinition fits within the four noble truths and to see when it's skillful and when it's not so that you can use this knowledge to put an end to suffering
When it's skillful you use it
When it's not you regard it as notself so that you can stop clinging to it and can put it aside
It's possible to create a huge variety of selves
As the Buddha once said the mind can take on more shapes than all the species of animals in the world
Think of what that means all the whales and insects and everything inbetween
Your selves are even more variegated than that
If you watch your sense of self during the day you'll see that it continually changes its shape like an amoeba
Sometimes it looks like a dog sometimes a person sometimes a heavenly being sometimes a shapeless blob
However all of these ways of creating a self can be analyzed down to the five aggregates form feeling perception fabrication and consciousness
The Buddha doesn't say that these aggregates are what your self is they're simply the raw materials from which you create your sense of self
As he notes you can create four different kinds of self out of each of these aggregates
Take the form of the body as an example
You can equate the aggregate with your self  for example you can say that your body is your self
You can also say that your self possesses that aggregate  for example that you have a self that possesses a body
You could also have the idea that your self is inside that aggregate  for example that you have a self inside the body
A few years back I got into a discussion with my older brother about how we had visualized the soul back when we were children
We both imagined that it was something inside the body but we had different ideas about what it looked like
Mine was less imaginative
Because the English word soul sounds like sole the bottom of your shoe I thought my soul looked like a glowing piece of leather in a dark space
However my brother was more imaginative
His soul looked like a rusty can with an iron rod stuck in it
Where he got that image I have no idea
At any rate those are examples of a self conceived of as being inside the body the third way you could define a soul around the aggregate of form
The fourth way that you can create a sense of self around an aggregate is to say that the aggregate lies inside your self
For example you have a cosmic self that encompasses your body that is larger than your body and your body moves around within that vast self
All of these ways of defining the self the Buddha says cause suffering
This is why he advises you ultimately to put them all aside
But some of them do have their uses on the path which is why he has you develop them in a skillful way before you drop them
So instead of getting into a discussion as to which type of self is your true self  or your ultimate self or your conventional self  the Buddha is more interested in showing you how your sense of self is an action
The adjectives he uses to describe actions are not ultimate or conventional They're skillful and unskillful These are the terms in which he wants you to understand your selves Are they skillful
Are they not
And because skill can be understood only through mastery the Buddha wants you to master these actions in practice
As it turns out each of the aggregates is also an action
When you take on the idea of form in the mind there is actually a decision in the mind to take on that form
That decision is an action
Feeling is also an action perception is an action fabrication is an action as is consciousness
If you cling to any of these activities that too is an action the act of taking delight in repeating that activity again and again
There are three reasons why it's useful to analyze your ways of creating a self in this fashion
First it shows that regardless of how you identify your self it always involves clinging
Wherever there's clinging there's also suffering and stress
This is why the ordinary way of creating a sense of self falls under the first noble truth
If the object you're clinging to changes you suffer from its change
Even if it changes for the better you realize that its nature is not permanent therefore it cannot be trusted
Even if you cling to the idea of something permanent the idea is itself impermanent as is the clinging to the idea
When you see the activity of creating a self in this way it gives rise to a sense of disenchantment and dispassion two emotions that can lead to release
That's the first reason why it is useful to think of the self as activity in this way When you see it as an activity it's easier to apply the perception of notself to it so that you can end the suffering that comes from clinging to it
The second reason for analyzing your ways of creating a self is that as the Buddha once said however you define your self you limit yourself
For example if you have the idea that you're intrinsically bad by nature something that's intrinsically bad can't make itself good
You would need an outside power to help you
This would discourage you from practicing
If you have the idea that you're intrinsically good by nature you would need to explain how something intrinsically good could suffer or could cause suffering also if it could lose its original pure nature then once you make it pure again what would keep it from losing its pure nature again
There's also the practical concern that if you believe you're intrinsically good it gives rise to complacency
You believe that any intuition that rises up from a quiet mind is trustworthy
In this way your idea of an intrinsically good self obscures your defilements
This is the opposite of what we sometimes hear  that our defilements obscure our intrinsically good nature  but if you believe your nature is intrinsically good then when defilements arise in the quiet mind and you identify them as the wisdom of your innate nature manifesting itself your belief in your intrinsic goodness has blinded you to what's actually going on
Also there are times in the meditation when the mind comes to a great state of emptiness space light and peace
If you're looking for an innately pure and good Buddha nature you could easily decide that that's your Buddha nature
However the Buddha advises that even a great state like that should be analyzed to see where there is still some inconstancy and stress  in other words to see that state of concentration as the result of actions and not as an innate state
Otherwise again you get complacent
And as the Buddha said complacency is the opposite of the source of goodness
The source of goodness or skill is heedfulness
You also place limitations on yourself if you hold to the idea that you have no self
How could you function
How could you insist that people treat you fairly
What motivation would you have to avoid unskillful actions and to develop the skills of the path

Even the idea of a cosmic self has its limitations
It prevents you from seeing how you're actually functioning in the world and how you're creating suffering through your Imaking and mymaking in the present moment
It also provides you with excuses for your unskillful feelings Whatever arises in the mind is simply the cosmos acting through you and you take no personal responsibility for it
I once heard of a woman on a retreat who discovered a strong desire for a man sitting in front of her  so strong that she couldn't stay in the same room
So she went back to meditate in her dormitory room and there she had a realization that this was not just her own desire but it was the force of cosmic desire manifesting through her and that she should just allow it to happen
When you believe something like that it's impossible to practice
As long as you don't see that these things have their causes in your individual mind you'll never be able to put an end to them
Every way of defining yourself also places a limitation on yourself in the sense that your definition of who you are and what belongs to you is going to conflict with somebody else's definition of who you are and what belongs to you
The Buddha has a special term for the type of thinking that starts with the thought of selfidentification I am the thinker He calls it papañca or objectification and says that it lies at the basis of all conflict
When you start thinking in these terms your thoughts turn around and bite you
So these are different ways in which defining what you are can give rise to limitations
When you learn how to drop these unskillful ways of creating a self  or even the idea that you have no self  you can free yourself from these limitations
Finally there's a third benefit that comes from looking at the creation of a self as an action You're free to create different senses of self that you can use as tools
You use them when they're needed and you can put them down when they're not
And in fact this is the Buddha's strategy
This is how we create a path to the end of suffering
We use conditioned things to reach the unconditioned
If you couldn't do that you wouldn't be able to reach the unconditioned  because the unconditioned is not something that can be used
All you have to work with is conditioned phenomena
The way you use conditioned phenomena is by learning how to master them as skills
In other words you turn these five aggregates into a path
You can think of the aggregates as bricks that you've been carrying in a sack over your shoulder weighing you down
But instead of carrying them you now put them down on the ground and make them into a path
For example when you're in a state of concentration the concentration is actually composed of the five aggregates
Form is your sense of the body as experienced from within which includes the breath
Feeling is the sense of pleasure or discomfort that can come with the breath
Perception is your mental image or label of breath that helps you to stick with the breath and to perceive the breath energy in different parts of the body
The Buddha once said that all states of concentration  except for the very highest  depend on perception because you have to keep a perception of the object in mind in order to stay with the object
As for fabrications they include sentences in your mind that talk about the breath or the body evaluating and adjusting the breath evaluating how well your concentration is going
And finally consciousness is your awareness of all of these other aggregateactivities
When brought together into a state of concentration in this way the five aggregates form a path
As you master this skill you get to see how you create your sense of self around these aggregates as the agent doing the concentration practice and as the person enjoying its benefits
This is why the ability to create a set of skillful selves falls under the fourth noble truth
This ability allows you to see the process of Imaking and mymaking in action
It allows you to understand the powers and limitations of intentional action in leading to true happiness
This understanding is what leads to freedom
So learn to use these aggregates  and the sense of self you build around them  as tools leading to freedom instead of as burdens weighing you down
There's a story that illustrates this principle in T
H
White's retelling of the King Arthur legend The Once and Future King
In this version of the story when Arthur is a young boy Merlin the magician turns him into different kinds of animals to teach him the lessons that can be learned from animals
In the final transformation young Arthur is turned into a badger and goes down to visit an old badger in his burrow
It turns out that the old badger is like an Oxford don with many papers spilling out of desks and shelves filling his burrow
He's written a thesis about why man has dominion over the animals and he reads his thesis to Arthur
His explanation is much like the creation story in the Bible except that when God creates all the animals he doesn't create them in different forms
He creates them all as identical embryos
Once they are created he lines them up and announces that he's going to give them a boon
He'll allow them to change the shape of their bodies in any way they want in order to survive better in the world
For example they can change their mouths into offensive weapons or their arms into wings
However there's one condition
Once they change their form they have to stick with it
So he said step up and choose your tools The different animals thought over their choices and one by one made their requests
The badgers being very practical asked to change their hands into garden forks their teeth into razors and their skin into shields
Some of the animals made choices that were very bizarre
For example a toad who was going to live in the Australian desert asked to swap its entire body for blotting paper to soak up the water from the seasonal rains and store it for the rest of the year
At the end of the sixth day there remained only one animal who had not changed its body parts for tools
That was man
So God asked man Well our little man you have thought over your choice for two days now
Obviously you have made a wise choice
What is it And the little man said If it pleases you I don't want to change any parts of my body for tools
I simply ask for the ability to make tools
For example if I want to swim I will make a boat
If I want to fly I will make a flying boat God was pleased
He said Well done
You have guessed our riddle
I will put you in charge of all of the other animals
They have limited themselves but you have not limited yourself
You will always have many potentials
If we take away the theological elements of this story we can draw a useful lesson from it about our ideas of self If we create a fixed view of who or what we are we limit ourselves
We keep on creating suffering and stress
But if we see that we can create many senses of self and can learn to use them as tools we'll be in charge of our happiness
We can use these tools to bring suffering and stress to an end
As with any tools we have to learn how to use them well and part of using them well is learning how and when to put them down
Otherwise they get in the way of what we're trying to do
If we carry them around all the time they weigh us down for no purpose at all
This is where the teaching on notself comes in
It too is an activity  a strategic activity  that has to be mastered as a skill knowing how to put down a particular sense of self when it's no longer skillful and ultimately when your selves have taken you as far as they can knowing how to let go of them all
When you understand both self and notself as activities in this way it's easy to see how the Buddha's teachings on this topic are answers to his basic question for fostering discernment What when I do it will lead to longterm welfare and happiness When through practice you've learned how to use perceptions of self and notself in a skillful way you'll know for yourself that these skills are a very effective answer to that question
So that's the message for tonight
For the next few nights we'll explore the different ways in which the Buddha gives us lessons in how to use perceptions of self and notself as tools on the path
Tonight I'd like to start looking at how we create a sense of self that can lead to longterm welfare and happiness focusing first on the question of why we would need to do this
We know that the Buddha often talked about notself but he also talked positively about self
He said that the self should be its own mainstay that it should observe itself and reprimand itself when it's gone astray and that there's a need to learn not to harm oneself
Here are some passages from the Dhammapada that speak positively of the role of self on the path
These passages show that a sense of self is an important part of the practice  especially a sense of self that encourages responsibility heedfulness and care
The question is Why would it be necessary to create this skillful sense of self
If ultimately you're going to develop the perception of notself why spend time developing a perception of self
The short answer is that the path is a skill and as with many other skills there are many different stages in mastering it
Sometimes you have to do one thing at one stage and turn around and erase it at another
It's like making a chair
At one stage you have to mark the wood with a pencil so that you can cut it properly but when you're ready to apply the final finish you have to sand the pencil marks away
The long answer begins with a fact that I mentioned last night that the path to the unconditioned is conditioned
In the Buddha's terminology it's fabricated
The fact that it's a fabricated path leading to an unfabricated goal means that you have to develop some fabricated qualities along the way that you'll have to let go when you arrive at the goal
Too often we focus on the goal without paying attention to the path but it's only through focusing on the path that you can arrive at the goal
If you focus all your attention off in the distance you won't see where you're actually stepping
You may trip and fall
So when you focus on the fact that the path is fabricated the first thing you have to notice is that it's something you have to put together through your own voluntary efforts
The path involves actively developing good qualities and letting go of bad qualities and you have to will yourself to do this
To motivate your will you need a healthy sense of self realizing that you'll benefit from fabricating the path and that you have within you the capabilities that the path requires
Only at the end of the path when you no longer need these forms of motivation can you let go of every possible sense of self
Also the act of fabricating the path requires strength and a healthy sense of self helps to nourish that strength
The Buddha's strategy here draws on an analogy he uses for explaining the process of suffering
In his first noble truth he identifies suffering as the five clingingaggregates
The word clinging here is the important part of the compound
The five aggregates are burdensome to the mind because we cling to them
Without the clinging they would not be a burden
Now the word for clinging upādāna also refers to the act of taking sustenance or food
The aggregates are things that we feed on feeding both in the physical sense and in the mental sense
For example we find mental nourishment in feelings and perceptions and fabrications
So the Buddha's basic analogy for the process of suffering is the act of feeding
He says that we feed on the aggregates in four ways
The first way is through passion for sensuality
Here sensuality means your obsession with sensual resolves and intentions
In other words you cling to thoughts about sensual pleasures
You can think for hours about a sensual pleasure and how to get it  as when you plan to go out for an excellent meal  even though the actual pleasure of the meal itself may last for only a short time
The obsession with thinking about sensuality is what constitutes the clinging
The second way that we cling to and feed on the aggregates is through our views about them  our opinions our theories about how the world works and what issues are important to hold opinions on
The most extreme form of clinging through views believes that simply holding a view can take you to heaven or whatever but the act of clinging to and feeding on views works in subtler ways as well
The third way we feed on the aggregates is through our attachment to certain habits and practices
We believe that things have to be done in certain ways in order to be right
The extreme form of this clinging is ritual The idea that simply performing an action properly regardless of your motivation carries a certain magical power that bends the world to your will or makes you better than other people
To lighten the mood I'd like to tell you a story that illustrates this particular form of attachment
It concerns a goose
There was once a biologist in Austria who raised a baby goose whose mother had died
The baby goose fixated on the biologist and followed him everywhere
Throughout the summer as long as the biologist was outside the goose would follow him around the yard of the house
When autumn came however the biologist knew he would have to take the goose inside
So one evening at the time when he would normally feed the goose he didn't feed the goose but instead walked into his house leaving the door open behind him
The goose followed him in
Now the entryway to the house was a long hallway that led from the door to a window on the other side of the house and halfway down the hall on the right was a stairway that led up to the second floor which was where the biologist lived
The goose on entering the house immediately freaked out because it had never been inside before
It went running to the window to escape but then discovered that it couldn't get out the window
Meanwhile the biologist climbed the stairs and called the goose
So the goose turned around and followed him up the stairs which is where the biologist fed him
From that point on every time the goose entered the house it would go first to the window then it would turn around and go up the stairs
As time passed the trip to the window got shorter and shorter until finally it was simply a matter of the goose's going to the far side of the stairway and shaking its foot at the window
Then it would climb the stairs
One evening the biologist was late coming home from work
The goose was very hungry so as soon as the biologist opened the door it ran up the stairs
Halfway up the stairs though it stopped and started shaking all over
Then very deliberately it walked down the stairs walked over to the window turned around and then went back up the stairs
Sound familiar
That's clinging to habits and practices the third way in which we feed on the aggregates
When we stay stuck on our habits and practices we're listening to our inner goose
The fourth way of feeding on the aggregates is through our ideas about what the self is and whether it exists or not
As we saw last night when we cling to ideas of what we are we get entangled in all sorts of complications
Now even though these four ways of clinging cause suffering they do provide some nourishment some strength to the mind
Otherwise we wouldn't bother feeding in this way
We see that the energy put into clinging is repaid by the strength we get from these activities
But as is the case with physical food mental food can be either good or bad for you
Even though unhealthy food can give you some strength it can also cause you health problems over the long term
The same principle applies to the mind
One way we can think of the path is as health food for the mind
We need this nourishment to give the mind strength for otherwise we wouldn't be able to engage in the fabrication needed for the path
Ultimately the path will bring the mind to a level of strength where it no longer needs to feed
But in the meantime we need mental food to develop the strength and stamina needed to bring us to that point
So the Buddha's strategy is to use some of these forms of clinging in a skillful way as steps on the path
We have to hold to right views
We have to hold to the precepts which are habits and the practice of jhāna right concentration which counts as a practice
We also need to develop a healthy sense of self which is selfreliant responsible and heedful
So we need to feed in these three ways
As for clinging to sensuality This is the one type of clinging that has no role on the path but we do require external conditions conducive to training the mind
We need a certain amount of sensory pleasure provided by food clothing shelter medicine and the pleasures of a peaceful quiet place to meditate
We're advised not to obsess over these things but if we haven't yet gotten to the point where we can maintain our mental center everywhere we have to hold to the principle of searching out surroundings conducive for the practice whenever we can
To wean the mind off its usual habit of feeding on sensuality we have to train it to enjoy the genuine health food provided by the other means of skillful clinging
This is one of the main reasons why we have to feed it with concentration
The pleasure and rapture of jhāna help provide the sense of wellbeing we need in the here and now to be willing to change our diet
And the practice of jhāna in turn needs to be well fed with right views and the healthy sense of selfesteem that comes from the habits of generosity and virtue
Otherwise we won't be able to endure the difficulties inherent in getting the mind to settle down and stay there
At the same time as concentration develops it provides an even greater sense of selfesteem which ensures that when you finally do apply the perception of notself to all phenomena in an allaround way you don't do it with neurotic selfhatred
This is an important point because sometimes the teaching on notself is used as an excuse for selfhatred
In other words I don't like myself so I'll deny that my self exists This is not healthy
But when you develop a healthy strength of concentration you understand that you've taken your healthy sense of self as far as it can go
At that point you're ready for the next step in spiritual maturity
You let go for the sake of greater health
It's only then that you no longer need to feed
But as long as the mind is on the path it needs to feed in a discerning way on views habits practices and a healthy sense of self
And as I already mentioned the five aggregates are what we feed on
This means that we have to learn to feed on the aggregates in such a way that they become factors of the path
For instance the second form of skillful feeding the practice of right concentration involves all five aggregates as we noted last night
The first form of skillful feeding the development of discernment in right view and right resolve requires the aggregates of perception and fabrication
So in this way we use the clingingaggregates as steps on the path
The purpose of this is to develop five strengths in the mind conviction persistence mindfulness concentration and discernment
These are the inner strengths that will bring the mind to the point where it no longer needs to feed
As we develop a healthy sense of self to feed these strengths we gain practical insight into how we create our sense of self
We also gain insight into our intentions
The Buddha is especially interested in having us understand the role of our sense of self as the agent that exerts control over our actions
This relates to his teaching on the role of kamma in the present moment
Our experience of the present moment is composed of three sorts of things the results of past actions present actions and the results of present actions
We have no control over the results of past actions but we do have some freedom  some element of control  in our choice of our present actions
The question of exactly how much control and how much freedom is something that we can discover only by trying to act as skillfully as we can with each moment
This is why the topic of skillful action is one of the Buddha's most basic teachings
We focus on learning more and more about the potentials and limitations of the freedom we have in the present moment because that is the area of awareness where the opening to ultimate freedom will be found
Now ultimate freedom is not the same as freedom of choice
It's a freedom from suffering that's totally unconditioned totally beyond space and time and so has nothing to do with questions of control or no control
It's just there
But you can find it only by exploring what freedom you have to act skillfully
This is why the Buddha doesn't encourage thoughts about essential nature about what you are or aren't and whether that's good or bad
He's more interested in having you see the level of freedom you can exercise around your choices in the present moment
In other words he's not interested in having you speculate about what the self is or isn't he's interested instead in having you watch how you define yourself with each action in the present
That's because the line between self and notself is determined by what you can and cannot control
The more precisely you see that line the closer you are to finding the true freedom where questions of control or no control no longer matter
This is another reason why the Buddha has us develop mindfulness and concentration together because you need both of these strengths acting together to observe the action of creating a sense of self or notself around that line between control and noncontrol
Mindfulness is what keeps remembering where to stay focused and what to keep doing to abandon what's unskillful and to develop what's skillful
Concentration is what maintains the steadiness of your gaze
So it's only through clinging to the practice of the path that you can find the line between control and noncontrol and can observe it closely
It's only through healthy clinging that you reach the point where you can really let go and be free
It's as if you're a bird in a cage
One wall of the cage is a door
If you cling to the other walls you stay stuck in the cage
But if you cling to the door then when the door is open you can fly away
In the same way you cling to the path
When the path comes together it leads to the opening where you gain freedom
The door swings open and you're free to fly wherever you want
In the words of the Dhammapada when you've reached that point your path  like that of birds through space  can't be traced
You're so free that you leave no footprints in the sky
Last night we talked about the reasons why it's important to develop a skillful sense of self on the path
Tonight we'll talk about the Buddha's instructions in how to do it and the lessons we learn from doing it well
The self strategy that the Buddha recommends using along the path derives from the question at the basis of discernment What when I do it will lead to my longterm welfare and happiness This question contains two ideas of self
The first is the idea of the self as agent the producer of happiness the second is the idea of the self as the consumer of happiness
When the question says What when I do it the I here in I do it is the self as producer
The my in my longterm welfare and happiness is the self as consumer of happiness
The idea of the self as agent also introduces the element of control which the Buddha says is essential to any idea of self
This was the point he made at the very beginning of his first discussion of notself If you have no real control over something how can you say that it's you or yours
It's only through the relative element of control you have over some of the aggregates that you can identify with them to begin with
Now the Buddha has us use both the idea of self as producer and the idea of self as consumer as part of our motivation for practice
For example concerning the self as producer there's a passage where Ven
nanda tells a nun that even though we practice to put an end to conceit it's only through a certain kind of conceit that we can actually practice
The conceit he's referring to is the conceit implicit in the idea If others can do this so can I This relates to our confidence  as producers of action  that we are competent to learn how to do things correctly and skillfully
This healthy sense of I gives us confidence that we can handle the path
Without it we wouldn't be able to attempt the path at all
The Buddha also teaches us to use the idea of self as consumer as motivation for the path
There's a passage in the Canon where he's apparently talking about a monk who's getting discouraged on the path and is thinking about going back to his lay life
Essentially he recommends that a monk in that situation ask himself Do you really love yourself
Are you going to content yourself simply with the food clothing shelter and medicine of lay life even though this means staying in the cycle of birth aging illness and death
Or would you really like to put an end to suffering The implication here is that if you really love yourself you should try to put an end to suffering
You should care for the self that's going to be consuming the results of your actions
So what should the self as producer do to show genuine goodwill for the self as consumer
The traditional answers for the Buddha's question  What when I do it will lead to my longterm welfare and happiness  fall into two classes
The first class gives specific do's and don'ts
The second class gives advice on how to determine for yourself what's the most skillful thing to do in a given situation
In the first class there are the practices called acts of merit generosity virtue and the development of goodwill
Each of these practices fosters a healthy sense of self
When the Buddha teaches generosity he emphasizes the fact that you're free to give
In fact when a king once asked him Who should I give things to the king expected that the Buddha would say Give to me and my disciples Instead the Buddha said Give wherever you feel inspired In other words he encouraged the king to practice generosity as a way of exercising his freedom to choose
The act of generosity is one of the first ways we realize that we do have freedom of choice
When you were a child the first time you realized you had that freedom was when you gave away something you didn't need to give
It wasn't on a holiday or somebody's birthday where you had to give something
It was when of your own accord you wanted to make a gift of something that was yours
A strong sense of wellbeing and selfworth came from that choice
When you're forced to give there's no special sense of selfworth
But if you give when there's no compulsion it gives rise to a sense of selfesteem You're not just a slave to your appetites
You have the noble heart that's willing to share pleasure with others
Similarly with the practice of virtue such as observing the five precepts or avoiding the ten courses of unskillful action When you realize that there are ways that you could get away with harming someone but you choose not to it gives rise to a very strong sense of selfworth
When you're tempted to do something that's unskillful but you learn how to say No to that temptation you realize again that you're not a slave to your defilements
This is how the practice of virtue develops skill in learning to deal with addictive behavior
For example suppose that you feel tempted to do something and you try to say No part of the mind will say Well you're going to say Yes in five minutes so why not say Yes now You learn how to say No I'm not going to fall for that trick
What I do in five minutes is not my responsibility right now
My responsibility is what I do right now If you keep this up you learn how to deal with all the tricks that the mind has to fool itself
This gives rise to a sense of competence and selfworth
It also gives you a lesson in the existence of choice which is an important element on the path
Meditation on goodwill also gives rise to a sense of great wellbeing and selfworth
On the one hand it reminds you that you do deserve to find true happiness
I don't know about France but in America many people say that they have trouble feeling goodwill for themselves
They don't feel worthy of true happiness
If you have that attitude it saps the strength you need to follow the path
But if you can remind yourself that true happiness isn't selfish or selfindulgent  it doesn't harm anyone and it also puts you in a better position to help other people  this gives you a healthy motivation to practice
On the other hand the ability to extend thoughts of goodwill to large numbers of people even those you don't like creates a spacious sense of your own nobility  the nobility that comes from not carrying grudges or playing favorites
All of these ways of practice give training in being more skillful and more mature in how you create your sense of I and mine At the same time they give you practice in learning how to disidentify with less skillful intentions such the desire to be stingy hurtful or mean
In this way you're gaining practice in developing the perceptions of self and notself in a skillful way
Now the Buddha realized that simply giving instructions in generosity virtue and meditation would not cover every situation in life
It's important that you also learn the skills to judge for yourself what is skillful in the areas where clearcut rules don't apply or two good general principles would pull you in opposite directions
So he also gave instructions on how to train yourself to judge situations wisely for yourself
I'll give an illustration of this principle
If you ever go to Alaska you'll discover that there are bears
Most of the people who encounter bears in Alaska have no previous experience with bears
They don't understand bears' habits or the etiquette of bears
Bears do have their etiquette you know
So in order to train strangers in how to deal with bears the Alaskan government used to post big signs around the state entitled Bear Awareness It's joke in English that doesn't work in French because the word bear in bear awareness can also be bare The signs listed ten points to remember when encountering bears
I can't remember all ten but the first nine gave specific do's and don'ts
For example if you see a bear do not run away
Even if the bear runs at you do not run off
Instead raise your hands so that you look large to the bear  bears have very poor eyesight  and stand your ground
At the same time speak to the bear in a calm reassuring voice to let the bear know that you mean it no harm
If the bear attacks you lie down and play dead
Usually the bear will lose interest and walk away
That was as far as the specific instructions took you
Then the sign told you that there's a situation where it couldn't tell you what to do  which is if the bear starts to chew on you  because the bear may have two different intentions
One it simply may be curious to see if you really are dead
The other is if the bear is hungry
So while you're lying there with the bear nibbling on you you have to decide which is the bear's motivation
If the bear is simply nibbling out of curiosity continue to play dead the bear will lose interest and walk away
However if the bear is hungry fight for all of your life
Poke your finger in its eyes and do whatever else you can think of to scare it away
Now to decide the bear's motivation in a situation like that requires a lot of mindfulness and alertness
In the same way as you're facing your daytoday life there will be areas where the Buddha's instructions on generosity virtue and goodwill give clear guidance and areas where they don't
In areas where they don't you have to develop your own mindfulness alertness and many other skillful qualities to determine the right thing to do
This principle is so important that it was the first thing the Buddha taught to his son
What do you think Rāhula What is a mirror for
For reflection sir
In the same way Rāhula bodily actions verbal actions  mental actions are to be done with repeated reflection
Whenever you want to perform a bodily action you should reflect on it 'This bodily action I want to perform  would it lead to selfaffliction to the affliction of others or to both
Is it an unskillful bodily action with painful consequences painful results' If on reflection you know that it would lead to selfaffliction to the affliction of others or to both it would be an unskillful bodily action with painful consequences painful results then any bodily action of that sort is absolutely unfit for you to do
But if on reflection you know that it would not cause affliction it would be a skillful bodily action with happy consequences happy results then any bodily act of that sort is fit for you to do
While you are performing a bodily action you should reflect on it 'This bodily action I am doing  is it leading to selfaffliction to the affliction of others or to both
Is it an unskillful bodily action with painful consequences painful results' If on reflection you know that it is leading to selfaffliction to affliction of others or both you should give it up
But if on reflection you know that it is not you may continue with it
Having performed a bodily action you should reflect on it If on reflection you know that it led to selfaffliction to the affliction of others or to both it was an unskillful bodily action with painful consequences painful results then you should confess it reveal it lay it open to the Teacher or to a knowledgeable companion in the holy life
Having confessed it you should exercise restraint in the future
But if on reflection you know that it did not lead to affliction it was a skillful bodily action with happy consequences happy results then you should stay mentally refreshed  joyful training day  night in skillful mental qualities
Having performed a mental action you should reflect on it If on reflection you know that it led to selfaffliction to the affliction of others or to both it was an unskillful mental action with painful consequences painful results then you should feel distressed ashamed  disgusted with it
Feeling distressed you should exercise restraint in the future
But if on reflection you know that it did not lead to affliction it was a skillful mental action with happy consequences happy results then you should stay mentally refreshed  joyful training day  night in skillful mental qualities
Rāhula all those contemplatives  brahmans in the course of the past who purified their bodily actions verbal actions  mental actions did it through repeated reflection on their bodily actions verbal actions  mental actions in just this way
All those contemplatives  brahmans in the course of the future who will purify their bodily actions verbal actions  mental actions will do it through repeated reflection on their bodily actions verbal actions  mental actions in just this way
All those contemplatives  brahmans at present who purify their bodily actions verbal actions  mental actions do it through repeated reflection on their bodily actions verbal actions  mental actions in just this way
Thus Rāhula you should train yourself 'I will purify my bodily actions through repeated reflection
I will purify my verbal actions through repeated reflection
I will purify my mental actions through repeated reflection' That's how you should train yourself
Notice the qualities of heart and mind that are developed by this kind of practice
First it teaches you to be observant  and in particular to be observant of your own actions their motivation and their results  because this is one area where we tend to engage in a lot of denial
The area of our motivations our actions and their results is the first area where we learn denial when we're children  as when we might have said It was already broken when I lay down on it The Buddha here is teaching you not to develop that attitude
If you actually broke it by stepping on it you should admit that you were the one who broke it
The Buddha's instructions here also teach you to have a healthy attitude toward your mistakes what we would call a healthy sense of shame one that comes with a high sense of selfesteem
You're not ashamed of yourself as a person but you are ashamed of any of your actions that have caused harm because you regard them as beneath you
This healthy shame is actually very helpful on the path because it enables you to see your mistakes as mistakes and it makes you want to stop making them the first steps in being able to learn from them
The Buddha's instructions also teach other healthy attitudes
For example compassion You want to make sure that your actions harm no one
Truthfulness If you make a mistake you should be willing to admit it to other people
Integrity Take responsibility for your actions
In particular however the Buddha's instructions here teach the most skillful sense of self to help you on the path a self that's always willing to learn
If your sense of pride or selfworth is built on the idea that you're already good you'll have trouble learning and trouble admitting mistakes
But if your pride or selfworth is built on the idea that you're always willing to learn then it opens many possibilities for developing more skill
It's the best kind of pride there is the most useful basis for skillful Imaking and mymaking
This is the kind of pride that can use a sense of shame integrity and all the other attitudes the Buddha is teaching here as means to negotiate with your less skillful selves the less skillful members of the committee and win them over to the path to true happiness
In the factors of the path this comes under right effort the ability to generate desire within yourself to do the right thing
Finally these instructions teach an important lesson about happiness that it is possible to find a happiness that also offers happiness to others
In other words your happiness does not have to depend on the pain of others
If it's gained through generosity virtue and goodwill it actually fosters their happiness too
In this way you learn not to draw a sharp line between your happiness and the happiness of those around you
And as a result you focus less on the word my in my happiness and take more interest in trying to master cause and effect what actions actually cause happiness both for yourself and for those around you
In this way the sense of self fades into the background and your sensitivity to cause and effect comes more to the fore
This is what enables you to get more and more skillful on the path  so that when bears attack you you'll be able to tell whether they're eating you out of curiosity or out of hunger
And that way you can deal skillfully with any situation you encounter on the path
Last night we discussed some of the traditional ways in which the Buddha taught a skillful sense of self  the self as the agent or producer of happiness and the self as the consumer of happiness  through the development of generosity virtue and meditation on goodwill
We also talked about some of the qualities the Buddha recommends for skillfully negotiating with the less skillful members of the mind's committee and motivating them to do the right thing
Tonight's talk approaches the same topics from a slightly different angle looking at them in terms of what modern psychology has to say about mature ego functioning
Sometimes you hear that the Buddha's teaching on notself is a teaching on nonego
This is actually a misunderstanding and it has two unfortunate consequences
The first is that for those who like the idea of nonego it becomes an excuse for selfhatred and for the practice of spiritual bypassing
An example of spiritual bypassing is this Suppose you have troubles in your life and you don't want to engage in the difficult business of trying to become more mature in dealing with others or negotiating the conflicting desires in your own mind
Instead you simply go and meditate you do prostrations you do chanting and you hope that those practices will magically make the problems in your life go away
This is called spiritual bypassing  an unskillful way of clinging to habits and practices
As you can imagine it's not very healthy  and not very effective
People often come back from meditation retreats and they still have the same problems they had before
The other problem in thinking that Buddhism teaches nonego is that those who understand the healthy functions of the ego believe that Buddhism lacks a proper appreciation of these functions
They think that Buddhist teachings are incomplete and need help from Western psychology in order to become a complete training of the mind
Actually the Buddha's teachings contain all the elements of healthy ego functioning
Even the notself teaching is treated by the Buddha as a type of healthy ego functioning
To explain these points I'd first like to touch a little bit on Freud's teaching on the ego
Freud divided mental functions into three types
The first is the id
Id functions are basically your brute wants and desires for pleasure
The second mental function is what he called the superego
Superego functions are basically your ideas about what you should do  the duties you believe you ought to fulfill
These are usually ideas you've picked up from society around you your parents your teachers your schools your church
Now in Freud's belief there is always going to be a conflict between these two types of functions
And if you were to give in totally to either id functions or superego functions you would die
At the same time there's an inevitable conflict between your id and the id of everyone around you
So in order to survive you need a third type of mental function ego functions which try to negotiate as best as possible between these two other incompatible functions  between what you want to do and what you believe society or God or whatever demands of you
Now the Buddha's teachings on the functions of the mind differ from Freud's in several ways
You have to remember that when Freud was practicing in nineteenth century Europe most of his patients had very unfriendly superegos because their ideas about what they should do had very little to do with their own happiness
These ideas mostly took the form of commands from a demanding competitive society or from God who could be very arbitrary and harsh
But in the Buddha's teaching every idea about what you should do depends on your desire for happiness
The Buddha was not the sort of person who simply saddled you with commandments about what you should and shouldn't do
Instead he placed a condition on his shoulds
He said that if you want true happiness this is what you need to do based on how cause and effect work
The duties he teaches are the duties in the four noble truths to comprehend suffering to abandon its cause to realize the cessation and to develop the path to that cessation
These are friendly duties because they aim at your genuine happiness
This changes the dynamic in the mind
To follow the Buddha's version of the superego would not kill you
As a result ego functioning in the Buddha's picture is not just a series of defense mechanisms for survival
It's actually the part of the mind that strategizes for longterm happiness to figure out ways to get the id to listen to a superego that's been trained to be genuinely wise
Remember that question that we asked earlier in the retreat What when I do it will lead to longterm welfare and happiness This is the question that informs both superego and ego functioning enabling them to work together in a friendly way
Another difference between the Buddha's teachings and Freud's is that the Buddha sees less inherent conflict between the needs of the id and the needs of the superego
As he says your true happiness doesn't need to conflict with the true happiness of society at large
Also unlike Freud the Buddha doesn't necessarily believe in brute irrational desire
Each desire comes with its own reasoning
And although its reasoning may be weak and faulty it nevertheless aims at happiness
At the same time each reason of the mind is associated with its own desire which is also aimed at happiness
Therefore there is no clear distinction between reason and desire
And because every desire is aimed at happiness there is a common ground where all desires can begin to negotiate to sort out which ones are more or less skillful in achieving their common aim
This means that from the Buddhist point of view the functions that Freud labeled as id ego and superego are different ways of defining your strategies for happiness
Each is a different sort of self The id is a foolish self that's very shortsighted
The superego is the wise self that looks for longterm happiness
And the ego is the negotiating self that tries to train the id to reason with it so that it'll be willing to listen to the wise superego
When these functions are brought together in a skillful way then  for example  the practice of generosity virtue and meditation brings a happiness that doesn't create clear boundaries between you and other people
Everyone benefits when you follow these strategies
In the Buddha's eyes one of the reasons that genuine happiness is genuine is because it doesn't need to take anything away from anyone else and can actually help contribute to other people's happiness too
Those are the differences
As for the similarities from the Freudian point of view there are five healthy ego functions suppression sublimation anticipation altruism and humor
As I explain each of these I'll show the ways in which the Buddha teaches all five as well
The first one is suppression
Suppression is when you realize that a desire is unhealthy or unskillful and you learn how to say No to it
This is different from repression
In repression you deny that you have the desire to begin with
In suppression you know you have the desire but you simply learn how to say No
In the Buddha's teachings this principle is similar to restraint
There's a famous passage in the Dhammapada where the Buddha says that if you see a greater happiness that comes from abandoning a lesser happiness you should be willing to let go of the lesser happiness in order to gain the greater happiness
This sounds very simple and commonsensical but it's not easy to practice and many people even resist the idea of practicing it
I have a friend who writes novels and teaches at a university
Every time she writes a new novel she's invited to read passages from her new novel at some of the university's alumni clubs
So each time she has to choose a selfcontained story from the novel to read to these groups
In her last novel the story she chose was about a young woman in th century China
The woman's mother had died and the father had promised that he would not remarry
But you know how fathers are
After two years he did remarry
Not only that he married a courtesan
Now the courtesan was very intelligent and she wanted to be a good stepmother to the girl
One night they were playing chess
As they were playing the stepmother was also using the occasion to teach the daughter an important lesson in life
The lesson was this If you want true happiness in life you have to decide that there's one thing you want more than anything else and that you're willing to sacrifice everything else for that one thing
Of course the daughter was half listening and half not listening as children often do to lessons like these but she began to notice that her stepmother was a sloppy chess player losing pieces all over the chessboard
So the daughter became more aggressive in her game
Well it turned out that the stepmother had done this as a trap and soon checkmate
The stepmother won
And of course the way she played chess was illustrating the lesson she was trying to teach the daughter You have to sacrifice some of your pieces in order to win
My friend read this story to three different groups and then had to stop
Nobody liked the story
Now maybe this tells you something about the attitudes of modern consumer culture but I think that it's also a general human characteristic
We want to win at chess and keep all our pieces
That is not a healthy ego function
The wisdom of suppression lies in realizing this that you have to sacrifice some things in order to gain what you really want
And this is what the Buddha teaches in restraint
If you see that any actions are unskillful you learn how to avoid them for the sake of a greater happiness
It's a trade
That's the first healthy ego function
The second one is sublimation
This is where when you realize that you have an unhealthy or an unskillful desire for happiness you don't just suppress it
You replace it with a more skillful way of finding happiness
This in the Buddha's teaching is precisely what concentration practice is about
If you can learn how to develop a sense of wellbeing refreshment and pleasure right here and now simply by focusing on your breath you find it much easier to let go of unskillful desires for happiness
That's the second healthy ego function
The third is anticipation
Anticipation is when you see future dangers and you prepare for them
The Buddha also teaches this principle in his teaching on the importance of heedfulness which is essentially a teaching that your actions do matter
There are dangers in life not only outside but also inside the mind
But you can also train the mind to act in a way that avoids those dangers
As the Buddha says a strong sense of heedfulness is what underlies all skillful behavior
Notice He doesn't say that our behavior is good because we're innately good
He says we behave well when we're heedful
We sense the dangers in life and we do what we can to avoid them
That's the third healthy ego functioning
The fourth is altruism which is the realization that you cannot look only for your own happiness but that your happiness has to also depend to some extent on the happiness of others
This principle in Buddhism is called compassion
There's a story from the Canon that shows how this quality is derived from heedfulness
One evening King Pasenadi is alone in his bedroom with his queen Mallikā
At a tender moment the king turns to the queen and asks her Is there anyone you love more than yourself Now you know what the king is thinking
He wants the queen to say Yes your majesty I love you more than I love myself And if this were a Hollywood movie that's what she would say
But this is not Hollywood
This is the Pali Canon
The queen says No
There's no one I love more than myself
And how about you
Is there anyone you love more than yourself And the king has to admit Well no That's the end of the scene
The king leaves the palace and goes to see the Buddha to tell him what happened and the Buddha says The queen is right
You can search the entire world and you will never find anyone you love more than yourself
In the same way all other beings love themselves fiercely But the conclusion the Buddha draws from this is interesting
He doesn't cite this as an excuse for selfishness
Instead he uses it as a rationale for compassion
He says that because all beings love themselves so fiercely if you really want happiness then you shouldn't harm others because otherwise your happiness won't last
There are two principles behind his reasoning here
One is that if your happiness depends on other people's suffering they won't stand for it
They'll try to destroy your happiness whenever they get the chance
Second the principle of sympathy If you see that your own happiness depends on other people's suffering deep in your heart you can't really be happy
So this is the basis for compassion
That's the fourth healthy ego function
The fifth healthy ego function is humor
The Buddha doesn't talk explicitly about this topic but there are many stories in the Canon that show his good sense of humor
I'll tell you two of them
The first is a story told by the Buddha concerning a monk who gains a vision of devas while meditating
The monk asks them Do you know where the end of the physical universe is And the devas say No we don't know but there is a higher level of devas
Maybe they know So the monk continues meditating and he gets to the next level of devas
He asks them the same question and he gets the same answer There's a higher level
Maybe they know This goes on for ten levels or so
Finally the last level of devas say No we don't know the end of the physical universe but there is the Great Brahma
He must know
If you meditate hard you may get to see him
The monk continues meditating until the Great Brahma appears in a flash of light
He asks his question of the Great Brahma and the Great Brahma responds I monk am Brahma the Great Brahma the Conqueror the Unconquered the AllSeeing AllPowerful the Sovereign Lord the Maker Creator Chief Appointer and Ruler Father of All That Have Been and Shall Be Now if this were the book of Job the monk would say I understand But again this is the Pali Canon
The monk says That's not what I asked you
I asked you where the end of the physical universe is Again the Great Brahma says I monk am Brahma the Great Brahma etc
Three times
Finally the Great Brahma pulls the monk aside by the arm and says Look I don't know but I have all of these devas in my entourage who believe that I know everything
They would be very disillusioned if they learned that I can't answer your question So he sends the monk back to the Buddha who answers the question after rephrasing it pointing to where the physical universe has no footing in the mind
That's one example of the Buddha's humor in the Canon
Another example concerns a monk Sāgata who had great psychic power
One day he did battle with a great firebreathing serpent and won
He ended up capturing the serpent in his bowl
People heard about this and were very impressed
They wanted to give him a very special gift so they went to ask a group of monks What is something that monks don't usually get But they asked the wrong group of monks
These monks said We don't usually get hard liquor So the next morning all the laypeople in the city prepared liquor for Sāgata
After drinking hard liquor at every house he passed out at the city gate
The Buddha came along with a group of monks saw Sāgata and told the monks to pick him up and take him back to the monastery
They laid him down on the ground with his head to the Buddha and his feet in the other direction
Now Sāgata didn't know where he was so he started turning around back and forth back and forth until finally his feet were pointed at the Buddha
The Buddha asked the monks Before didn't he show respect to us And the monks said Yes Is he showing respect now No And before didn't he do battle with a firebreathing serpent Yes Could he do battle with a salamander now No This is why we have a rule against drinking alcohol
Most of the humorous stories in the Canon are found in the Vinaya the section explaining the rules for the monks
I think this is very important
It shows a very humane approach to morality
If you live under a group of rules that lacks a sense of humor it can be very oppressive
Those rules can be very difficult to follow while maintaining a sense of reasonable and intelligent selfrespect
But when a sense of morality is based on a wise sense of humor it reveals an understanding of the foibles of human nature and the rules are easier to follow with dignity
This is why humor is a healthy ego function
If you can laugh at yourself in a goodnatured way it's a lot easier to drop your old unskillful habits without any selfrecrimination
That makes it a lot easier to practice
So as we can see the Buddha teaches all the five types of healthy ego functioning
This means that we cannot say that he is teaching nonego or egolessness
In fact these teachings on these five qualities are another way in which he teaches a healthy sense of self
We can also see that these teachings on developing a healthy ego include some of the basic virtues of the Buddha  discernment compassion and purity the discernment in anticipation sublimation and humor the compassion in altruism and the purity in suppression
In this way these three qualities of the Buddha come from healthy ego functioning in the intelligent pursuit of happiness
Unlike some religious teachers the Buddha doesn't encourage you to feel ashamed of your desire for happiness or to deny it
Instead he shows you how to train that desire so that it leads to true happiness and develops noble qualities of heart and mind along the way
He shows you how your ego can become wise compassionate and pure
Even the perception of notself if we apply it the right way is a healthy ego function
Remember we're not trying to let go of our sense of self because we hate it for that would encourage a form of neurosis
We're letting it go because we've come to understand through developing our skills on the path both the uses and the limitations of healthy perceptions of self
We're letting go to find a higher level of happiness  which is what healthy ego functioning is all about
The Buddha himself makes the point that the notself perception is to be used for the sake of happiness
'Monks do you see any clinging in the form of a doctrine of self which when you cling to it there would not arise sorrow lamentation pain grief and despair
And the monks respond No Lord
And the Buddha says Neither do What do you think if a person were to gather or to burn or do as he likes with the grass twigs branches and leaves here in Jeta's Grove would the thought occur to you 'It's us that this person is gathering burning or doing with as he likes'
The monks say No Lord
Why is that
Because those things are not our self nor do they pertain to our self
And then the Buddha says Even so monks whatever is not yours let go of it
Your letting go of it will be for your longterm welfare  happiness
What is not yours
Form is not yours
Let go of it
Your letting go of it will be for your longterm welfare  happiness
Feeling is not yours
Let go of it
Perception is not yours
Let go of it
Fabrications are not yours
Let go of them
Consciousness is not yours
Let go of it
Your letting go of it will be for your longterm welfare  happiness
This is a healthy and fruitful application of the perception of notself the topic we're going to take up tomorrow
For the past three days we've been talking about a skillful perception of self
Tonight and tomorrow night we'll be talking about the skillful perception of notself
These two perceptions actually go together because when you develop healthy self perceptions they help to ensure that you use notself perceptions in a healthy and mature way
You're not depriving yourself of your means for finding happiness
You're actually adding a new set of strategies that can help you find greater happiness
You realize that certain things lie beyond your control and that through accepting that fact and letting go of your identification with those things you can find happiness more easily and effectively
As the Buddha indicated in the passage we ended with last night we already have experience in applying the perception of notself to everyday experience
If you see people burning leaves and twigs and you know that those leaves and twigs don't belong to you you don't get upset
In fact if you think back to your childhood you realize that the perception of notself is something you've been developing all along and for this very reason It aids in your pursuit of happiness
The times when you learned that something was not under your control and you accepted the fact that it was futile to try to control it That enabled you to let it go as notself as not yours so that you could focus your efforts in areas where you could exert control
For example if one of your toys got broken and couldn't be fixed you learned that you could be happier if you stopped carrying it around and instead focused your attention on the toys that were still in goodenough shape to play with
In this way the perception of notself is the other side of the coin of the perception of self
Once you define self you draw a boundary around self what lies outside of that boundary is notself
If you do this skillfully it can focus your attention on the areas where your efforts can bear fruit and can help you avoid trying to control things that you can't
The general difficulty here is that some things lie to some extent under your control but not totally
There are also things that once were under your control but now no longer are  for example as in a relationship that has died
Another difficulty is when you feel a need for something even though you can't control it  as in a relationship that's very unstable
That sort of thing is difficult to accept as notself
Now these difficulties are made easier when you talk with other people who help you realize that these limits on your control are normal for everyone
In other words there's nothing particularly wrong with you
The other way of making this process easier is to find something else to control
For example when one relationship dies you find another one
Still we have the problem that sometimes we listen to the wrong people who encourage us to try to control things that we really cannot control perhaps through magical thinking
Magical thinking is the belief that something can be made good simply through the power of your thought or through the power of a ritual practice
Another frequently unskillful way to try to control things is through prayer
As the Buddha once said if prayer really worked there would be no poor people in the world no ugly people in the world no untimely deaths
The other extreme is when other people encourage you to give up exerting any control over anything at all
They tell you to try not to have desire for anything just accept everything as it is and be content that that's all you can do
This of course makes it impossible to practice the path
You simply try to clone awakening You hear that an awakened person has no desire so you tell yourself to have no desire an awakened person has no preferences so you tell yourself to have no preferences
This is twisting the horns of a cow in trying to get milk and seeing that no milk is coming out so you say Oh well there must be no way of getting milk because I've been twisting the horn for a long time
So I should just accept the fact that milk is unattainable
That's an unskillful use of the notself perception
The Buddha's strategy in using the perception of notself is to train you to understand accurately what does lie under your control and what doesn't abandoning what doesn't and then using what level of control you do have in a skillful direction so that you can ultimately put an end to suffering
Now just as there are two levels of right view  right view aimed at a happy rebirth and right view aimed at gaining total release  there are two levels in the Buddha's strategy in skillfully using the perception of notself
Tonight we'll talk about the first level  the skillful notself perceptions that will result in a happy rebirth  and we'll discuss the second level tomorrow
Some Western people have trouble with the teaching on rebirth but usually that's because we don't know how to use the teaching skillfully
To begin with it's important to understand that in teaching rebirth the Buddha was not just adopting a cultural assumption from his time
Rebirth was a hot topic in ancient India
Some people argued that it did happen others argued very strongly that it didn't with the argument centering around how you defined what a person was and then showing how what you were could or couldn't take birth
So when the Buddha was teaching rebirth he was consciously taking sides on the issue
But he did it in a novel way
Instead of trying to define what does or doesn't take rebirth  things you can't even see  he talked about rebirth as a process that happens through clinging and craving mental actions you can observe and can exert some control over
Now the Buddha never said that he could prove rebirth but he did say that it's a useful working hypothesis  and for two reasons
One is that the practice will ultimately confirm that it is true and second that it's useful for fostering skillful attitudes that help in developing the path
The idea of repeated rebirth might seem to be an extreme example of creating a large sense of self
After all there's a lot of I in thinking If I'm going to survive death I should plan for how and where I'm going to be reborn However the act of assuming rebirth is also an important lesson in notself because you can't assume that you can take everything with you
There's a lot of what's currently you and yours that you're going to have to leave behind
So you have to focus carefully on learning what you can and can't take with you
The things you can't take with you you have to let go as notself
This forces you to take a long hard look at what in this lifetime will be of value not only now but also after you die
This realization also forces heedfulness
Your only guarantee of a safe rebirth is when you've had your first taste of awakening
As long as you haven't yet had that taste your old kamma can drag you down to the lower realms at any time
So you have to develop a sense of urgency in the practice if you really want to find a happiness that's secure
You have to be prepared to go at any moment
Ajaan Lee often compared the process of preparing for rebirth to the process of preparing for a trip  or for a sudden forced emigration
You need to know what's good to take with you and what's best left behind and keep the things you'll really need close at hand
As when you go camping If you try to take too many things you weigh yourself down
If you don't take enough you starve and suffer other hardships
So you have to know what you really need
A story about Ajaan Lee illustrates this point
Once he was going to take a number of his students  both lay people and monks  on a trip into the forest
They were going to meet at the main train station in Bangkok take the train up to Lopburi and then go into the forest from there
Now Ajaan Fuang went along on the trip and he knew that if you went with Ajaan Lee you had to take as little as possible so he packed only a very small bag
But many of the other students didn't know this
Some of them brought three or four bags and large ones at that
Perhaps they thought they would hire porters in Lopburi to carry them into the forest
At any rate when they got to Hua Lampong the main station in Bangkok Ajaan Lee saw all of the bags that everyone had brought so instead of getting on the train he started walking up the train tracks
Now if the ajaan is walking on the tracks everyone else has to walk on the tracks
So very quickly people started walking behind him struggling to carry all their bags
After a while many of them started complaining that the bags were too heavy
At first Ajaan Lee said nothing and just kept walking
After a while as the complaints got more insistent all he said was If it's heavy throw it away
So one by one the students stopped to sort out their bags
Whatever they really needed they put in one bag
And as for the remaining bags they threw them into the lotus ponds on either side of the tracks
When they got to the railroad station at Saam Sen which is the next railroad station north of Hua Lampong Ajaan Lee saw that everybody's bags were small and manageable so he let them all get on the train
In this way he taught them an important lesson that you have to be very careful and selective about what you try to take with you
And what can you take with you
Two things
One is your actions the other is the qualities of the mind
Traditionally there are seven treasures you can take with you conviction virtue shame compunction learning the Dhamma generosity and discernment
These are inner treasures that can carry over into the next life
Think again of going on a camping trip
One way of keeping your baggage light is by having lots of skills knowing how to find what you need in the forest how to forage for food how to start a fire without matches how to build a shelter if you don't have a tent
In the same way by developing these seven inner treasures you take skills with you  skills you can use  and you don't have to load yourself down
The Canon gives other lists of qualities you can take with you as well such as the ten perfections generosity virtue renunciation discernment persistence endurance truth determination goodwill and equanimity
Notice that these lists contain the basic acts of merit generosity virtue and the development of goodwill
As we have already noted each of these meritorious actions gives lessons in developing a skillful sense of self
At the same time each also gives practice in developing a skillful sense of notself for each involves giving up something of lesser worth for the sake of something of greater worth
Each requires that you see the things of lesser worth as notself
For instance the Buddha recommends seeing generosity as a trade
Every time you give you gain something in return
You gain a higher state of mind the respect of others a sense of fellowship with the people around you and a more spacious sense of your life
You learn how to see that the item you give away is not yours and that the quality of mind developed through giving is more worth holding on to
The other forms of meritorious action also teach important lessons in notself
When you try to develop virtue you'll find voices in the committee of your mind that resist the precepts
You have to learn how not to identify with them  and how to do it skillfully  as part of developing virtue as a treasure or a perfection
Similarly with the practice of goodwill You learn to see ill will as something you don't want to identify with
As Ajaan Lee said if you have ill will for someone it's like leaving a magnet in the world
It'll pull you back to that person when you get reborn
So you want to learn to see thoughts of ill will as notself
There's another list of teachings that helps you take a longterm view of what's worth identifying with and what's not
It's called the eight worldly dhammas wealth loss of wealth status loss of status praise criticism pleasure pain
These the Buddha says are basically what the world has to offer  and it's not much is it
You notice that they come in pairs
It's impossible to have one without the other
If you try to hold onto your wealth you lose it anyhow
If you try to identify with whatever status you have it makes it difficult when you lose that status
The same with praise and criticism pleasure and pain
So it's best not to try to hold on to these things but it is possible to get good use out of them while you have them to use the things you can't take with you as means for developing qualities of mind that you can
For instance take a look at the money in your wallet
Is your name written on it
No it's the name of the government
They can take it back whenever they want to
It's not really yours
Even with your credit card It may have your name on it but it also has the bank's name and we know who's really in charge of it
So while you have that wealth try to make good use of it
Use it in a way that gives rise to virtues in the mind such as generosity and goodwill
Similarly with status Try to use the power that comes with status to do good for the world
When you suffer loss of wealth and loss of status learn how to take advantage of what they have to offer too
For example when you lose wealth and status you find out who your true friends are
You're also forced to become more ingenious in making do with little
This develops your discernment and ingenuity
When praise comes try to use the praise in a skillful way
Remember that the people praising you are trying to encourage you to keep on doing something
Don't let the praise go to your head thinking that you're already good enough and that you don't have to try to do better
At the same time though you have to remember that when people praise you they sometimes have ulterior motives
They may be encouraging you to do something that isn't really right so you have to be careful
As for criticism if the criticism is true you've learned something important about yourself something that you can learn to correct within yourself
Your faults are easy to hide from yourself which is why the Buddha says that if someone points them out to you think of that person as someone who's pointing out treasure
If the criticism is false you've learned something about the other person
It may not be something you want to learn but it's good to know
Ajaan Lee also said to watch out for status and praise
Once you have a high status and people praise you they confine you with their desires
If on the other hand you have no status and people call you a dog remember that dogs have no laws
They can go wherever they want
What this means is that you learn how to take advantage of all of these things when they come whether they're good or bad and realize that none of them will last permanently
You can't really hold to them as yours you have to see them as notself but if you use them to develop good qualities of the mind you've gotten the best use out of them developing good qualities that you can use in this lifetime and that will carry over after death
You've made a wise trade
The Buddha also says that when you learn how to look at gain and loss over the very longterm over many lifetimes it helps you to overcome your attachment both to wealth and to disappointment and grief
He says to remind yourself that you have already experienced extremes of wealth and poverty many times in many different lifetimes so you shouldn't get carried away with whatever wealth you have in this lifetime or jealous of other people's wealth or upset about whatever poverty you fall into
Realize that material things come and go but the state of your mind is the most important thing you have
This is how you develop the discernment to deal skillfully with whatever comes your way both in this life and in the next
In other words the Buddha has you look at life and death over the long term realizing that in order to develop good qualities in the mind you have to abandon your attachments your sense of self around many things
But this is a trade a very wise and advantageous trade
You gain many important skillful mental qualities in return
Now this is not just an exercise in delayed gratification because even in the present moment you gain a healthy sense of self one that's always trying to learn how to do what is skillful always trying to learn from mistakes and always willing to learn how to let go of unhealthy ways of identification
Contemplating these facts gives you a sense of empowerment of command
You can shape the life that you want the life that will give rise to longterm happiness both now and in the future
However this contemplation also gives rise to a sense of heedfulness
You see that you need to be careful in how you order your priorities
Eventually though it gives rise to a sense of disenchantment
You realize that things like wealth and status praise and pleasure come and go come and go and they begin to lose their allure
You don't want to make them your top priority
This combined sense of empowerment heedfulness and disenchantment is a healthy combination
On the one hand the element of empowerment keeps you from trying to take the shortcut of giving up at the beginning of the path
In other words you don't just say I'll just accept the way things are and not really strive for anything better and try to find peace that way Instead you try to find peace by developing your powers and you discover that a great measure of happiness can be found in this way
You gain discernment in deciding what is really important in life and what sorts of happiness are more valuable than others
In this way you're actually pushing against the characteristics of inconstancy stress and notself
You try to find a sense of happiness that is somewhat constant easeful and to some extent under your control
But then you run up against the limitations of this sort of activity
You work hard to get good things in life but then to develop generosity you have to give them away
By following the precepts you gain a good lifetime but even a good lifetime involves aging illness and death
Even heavenly beings have to die
You also realize that over the long term the comfort that comes from good actions can often lead to heedlessness and complacency People born into good conditions all too easily take them for granted and get lazy
They start abusing their good fortune
So even the good things in life contain their dangers
And when you take a longterm view whatever narratives you plan for your next lifetime begin to seem petty because given that there's all that aging illness and death there are going to be many many tears
As the Buddha once said which do you think is greater
The tears you have shed over many lifetimes or the water in the ocean
And the answer is the tears
There's another sutta that makes a similar point but more graphically
The Buddha once asked some monks Which do you think is greater
All the water in the oceans or the blood you have shed from having your head cut off
Think of all the times you've been a cow and you had your head cut off
Think of all the times you've been a sheep and had your head cut off
All the times you've been a pig and had your head cut off
All the many times you've been a human being but you were a thief and had your head cut off
All the many times you were a highway robber and had your head cut off
The many times you committed adultery and had your head cut off
For each case the blood is more than all the water in the oceans
The monks who heard this talk all became arahants right away
When you think about things like this you start looking for release
You see that even the greatest happiness in the realms of rebirth has its limitations and that the only really true happiness is freedom
That's when you're ready for the transcendent level of the Buddha's teaching on notself
Which is what we'll discuss tomorrow night
Last night we talked about the teaching on notself on the mundane level as it relates to the issue of rebirth and kamma
On this level you apply the perception of notself in a selective way
You look at the skills you can take with you you figure out what things would prevent you from taking good skills with you and you try to perceive the second set of things as notself
In this way you can develop the conditions for a good rebirth and the ability to deal with whatever you may encounter as you go through the cycle of death and rebirth
But as you contemplate the issue of rebirth you begin to see that even if you develop good mental qualities the whole process is still very risky and uncertain
When things get comfortable it's very easy to get complacent and to forget to keep working at developing good qualities
And even the best life in the cosmos has to end in separation and death
You've experienced these sufferings countless times in the past and if you don't gain release from the process of rebirth you'll have to endure the same sufferings countless times in the future
When this realization goes deeply into the heart you're ready for the transcendent teaching on notself
That's the topic for tonight's talk
The transcendent teaching on notself derives from transcendent right view and transcendent right view comes in two stages
The first stage sees experience in terms of the four noble truths of suffering its origination its cessation and the path of practice leading to its cessation
As you may remember each of these truths carries a duty If you want to put an end to suffering suffering should be comprehended its cause should be abandoned its cessation should be realized and the path to its cessation should be developed as a skill
The purpose of the transcendent teaching on notself is to help you perform each of these duties
In the first noble truth the Buddha identifies suffering with the five clingingaggregates
Notice that the aggregates themselves are not suffering
The mind suffers because it clings to them
As I've already mentioned clinging is also similar to the process of feeding
We keep doing something again and again  that's the clinging  as a means of finding happiness That's the feeding
A good example of this is an experiment some neurobiologists once did with mice
They located the pleasure center in each mouse's brain and planted a little electrode in there
When the mice pushed their heads against a little bar the bar would give a mild electric stimulation to the pleasure center
They got so addicted to pressing their heads against the bar  doing it again and again and again  that they forgot to eat and they died
They were feeding on a pleasure that was very immediate and intense but provided no nourishment
That's why they died
The same principle applies to the human mind
We usually feed on the aggregates in a way that provides no real nourishment and so our goodness dies
On the transcendent level of right view the Buddha has us use the perception of notself as a means for comprehending this clinging and feeding to the point where we feel no more passion for it
But his approach is a little indirect
As we've already seen instead of telling you simply to stop feeding on the aggregates he has you turn them into a path the health food that gives strength to the mind to the point where it no longer needs to feed
The primary example of this is the practice of right concentration
As we've already said right concentration is composed of the five aggregates and the feelings of ease rapture and refreshment that come from right concentration are health food for the mind
You learn through this practice that you can find a sense of happiness that comes from within and you no longer need to go looking for nourishment outside
To develop this sort of concentration you have to apply the perception of notself in a selective way
You hold on to your concentration and apply the perception of notself to any distracting thoughts that would pull you away from the object of your concentration
As you gain skill and maturity in applying this perception in this way it can enable you to let go of many attachments to other lesser forms of happiness that you now realize you no longer need in particular the pleasures of sensuality
When you realize you no longer need them you find that there was nothing really there
One of my favorite cartoons shows a group of cows in a pasture
One of the cows is jerking its head up in a sudden state of surprise and realization saying Hey wait a minute
This is grass
We've been eating grass
The Canon has a similar story
A blind man has been given an old dirty rag and told that it's a clean white cloth
He's very protective of his clean white cloth
But then his relatives take him to a doctor and the doctor cures his blindness
He looks at the cloth and realizes that he was fooled It's just a dirty old rag
The Dhamma point both in the cartoon and in the story is that we often blindly look for pleasure in things that  when we come to our senses  we realize were never all that satisfying to begin with
In some cases the pleasure is actually unhealthy causing you to do things you later regret
The practice of jhāna provides the perspective that allows you to step back from your sensual passions and all your other unskillful ways of looking for pleasure to see that they weren't worth the effort put into gaining them
This forces you to step back from the unskillful committee members that push for those ways of looking for pleasure and to ask whether you want to continue associating and identifying with them or not
This process isn't always easy
You tend to identify with those unskillful committee members because you associate them with pleasure
But the practice of jhāna helps make this process of disidentification possible
When you can see that  in comparison to the blameless pleasure of jhāna  these other committee members also bring you stress and pain you can more easily regard them as notself
You can let them go
As the practice of jhāna matures there eventually comes a point when you realize that only one attachment remains blocking unconditioned happiness and that's attachment to the path itself in particular to the practice of concentration and the development of discernment
This is where the Buddha starts having you apply the transcendent teaching on notself all around and not just selectively
In other words you apply the perception of notself to every instance of clinging to the aggregates even to the aggregates that go into jhāna and discernment
This is how the notself teaching helps you with the duties of comprehending stress and abandoning every form of craving clinging passion or delight that would give rise to stress
The following passage shows the main stages in this process
First you master the state of jhāna
Then you try to develop perceptions that give rise to a sense of dispassion for the jhāna
Once you've developed that sense of dispassion you develop the perception in which you see allaround dispassion and cessation as desirable
Then you learn how to drop even that perception and stay right there
That the Buddha says is where full awakening can occur
Suppose that an archer or archer's apprentice were to practice on a straw man or mound of clay so that after a while he would become able to shoot long distances to fire accurate shots in rapid succession and to pierce great masses
In the same way there is the case where a monk enters  remains in the first jhāna rapture  pleasure born of seclusion accompanied by directed thought  evaluation
He regards whatever phenomena there that are connected with form feeling perception fabrications  consciousness as inconstant stressful a disease a cancer an arrow painful an affliction alien a disintegration an emptiness notself
He turns his mind away from those phenomena and having done so inclines his mind to the property of deathlessness 'This is peace this is exquisite  the resolution of all fabrications the relinquishment of all acquisitions the ending of craving dispassion cessation Unbinding'
Staying right there he reaches the ending of the fermentations
Or if not then  through this very Dhammapassion this Dhammadelight and from the total wasting away of the first five fetters  he is due to be reborn there to be totally unbound never again to return from that world

A couple of points in this passage need to be explained
First When the Buddha talks about the ending of fermentation he's talking about awakening
The fermentations are the defilements that come bubbling up in the mind
Second  with regard to the second stage where the Buddha says to perceive the aggregates in the jhāna as inconstant stressful etc
 there are other passages in the Canon that expand on this point
In these passages the Buddha recommends that you apply three questions derived from the original question that he said was the basis of discernment What when I do it will lead to my longterm welfare and happiness At this point in the practice he recommends looking more closely at the idea of longterm happiness
Focus on the word longterm You know that jhāna is a longterm happiness but now you realize that longterm is no longer good enough
It's inconstant
The Pali term here anicca is sometimes translated as impermanent but that's not what it really means
Its opposite nicca describes something that's done constantly and reliably
You can depend on it
But if something is anicca it's unreliable
It wavers
If you try to base your happiness on it you have to keep tensing up around it  like trying to find some rest while sitting on a chair with wobbly uneven legs
So when you see that even the longterm happiness of jhāna is inconstant  unreliable and wavering  you realize that it's not really all that pleasant
Even in what pleasure it does offer there is stress
And because there's stress why would you want to claim it as yours
This line of thinking corresponds to the three questions that the Buddha has you ask at this stage in the practice
The first is Is this constant And the answer is No
That leads to the next question If it's inconstant is it pleasant Again the answer is No
That leads to the third question If something is inconstant and stressful is it fitting to say that 'This is me this is myself this is what I am' In other words Is it skillful to lay claim to this And the answer again is No
Now notice that the Buddha is not asking you to come to the conclusion that there is no self
He's simply asking you to see if this way of creating a sense of self is skillful
His method of analysis when it's consistently applied to all of the aggregates gives rise to a sense of disenchantment and dispassion for any possible type of clinging
But notice You're not doing this out of pessimism
You're doing this for the sake of your own true happiness but now it's better than longterm longer than longterm
You want something totally timeless and reliable
As that passage just now indicated sometimes this series of questions leads to full awakening but sometimes it doesn't
It leads instead to the state of nonreturn
Now the level of awakening at nonreturn is not bad
A group of people once came to see my teacher Ajaan Fuang
They had been studying Buddhist philosophy and had heard that he was a good teacher but they didn't know what he taught
So they came and asked him to teach them
He said OK close your eyes and focus on your breath And they said No no no we can't do that He asked Why And they said If we focus on the breath we'll get stuck on jhāna and then we'll be reborn as brahmās And Ajaan Fuang responded What's wrong with being reborn as a brahmā
Even nonreturners are born as brahmās
And being reborn as a brahmā is better than being reborn as a dog
In other words if you haven't attained jhāna it's hard to let go of sensual passions
And people stuck on sensual passions  even if they've studied Buddhist philosophy  can easily be reborn as dogs
So the dangers of jhāna and nonreturn are much slighter than the dangers of not reaching those attainments
Still if possible the Buddha does encourage you to try to go beyond the level of nonreturn and gain full awakening
This is where he brings in another teaching another perception
In Pali the phrase is Sabbe dhammā anattā which means All phenomena are notself This applies both to fabricated phenomena and unfabricated phenomena
And it's important to note here that this perception is part of the path not the goal
In other words it's not the conclusion you come to when you arrive at awakening it's a perception you use to get beyond your last attachments
As the above passage states what keeps a nonreturner from gaining total awakening is a type of passion and delight passion for the deathless and delight in the deathless
Passionanddelight is another term for clinging
Even when the mind lets go of its clinging and passion for the aggregates there still is something it may cling to the experience of the deathless that follows after letting go of the aggregates
The mind can regard its experience of the deathless as a phenomenon as an object of the mind
Where there is an object there is a subject  the knowing self the sense of I am  and this provides a foothold for passion and delight to arise You instinctively want to control whatever you like and so you try to control the experience of the deathless even though the idea of control here is superfluous  the deathless isn't going to change on you  and counterproductive The self created around this desire for control actually gets in the way of total freedom
To counter this tendency toward control the Buddha here has you apply the perception that all phenomena are notself even to the experience of the deathless
This is what gets rid of the I in I am
There's another passage relevant to this point where the Buddha says that when you see all phenomena arising and passing away  and this includes everything including the path and your clinging to the deathless  when you watch everything arising arising arising all the time the idea of nonexistence doesn't occur to the mind
When you see these things passing away passing away passing away the idea of existence doesn't occur to the mind
At that point the ideas of existence and nonexistence are irrelevant to your experience
All you see is stress arising stress passing away
This has several ramifications
If ideas of existence and nonexistence don't occur to you then the question of whether the self exists or doesn't exist wouldn't occur to you either
This gets rid of the am in I am This also does away with your fear of going out of existence if things are let go because the mind isn't thinking in those terms
At the same time you're reaching the higher stage of transcendent right view with a higher and more refined level of duty
As you remember with the four noble truths each of the truths has a duty but in this case  when you see everything arising and passing away simply as stress  all the duties are reduced to one You comprehend things to the point of dispassion
This means that you let go let go let go even of concentration even of discernment even of the act of clinging to the deathless
In the words of Ajaan Mun all four noble truths are turned into one
They all carry the same duty which is to let go of everything
This allows the mind to experience nibbāna not as a phenomenon but as a total experience
At this point you've found total happiness which no longer needs any protection no longer needs to be maintained
There's no longer any issue of control or noncontrol
There's no need for the strategy of self to create this happiness and no need for a sense of self to consume or experience it
Where you don't draw a line to define self there's no line to define notself
Where there's no clinging there's no need for the strategy of notself
So strategies of self or notself are all put aside
Even the strategy of dispassion itself gets put aside
At this point the mind no longer has need for any strategies at all because it has found a happiness that's truly solid
It's not a phenomenon it's a happiness
The Buddha calls it a special form of consciousness that doesn't need to be experienced through the six senses or what he calls the all
It's directly experienced as total freedom
And at the moment of awakening there's no experience of the six senses
However after the moment of awakening when the mind returns to the experience of the senses this sense of freedom stays
The Canon illustrates this with an image  not a pretty image but very memorable
The image is this Suppose there's a dead cow
You take a knife and remove the skin cutting all of the tendons and tissues that connect the skin to the cow
Then you put the skin back on
The question is Is the skin still attached to the cow as it was before
And the answer is No
Even though it's right next to the cow it's no longer attached
In the same way the practice of discernment is like a knife
It cuts through all of the attachments between the senses and their objects
Once the attachments are gone then even if you put the knife away you cannot connect things in the way they were before
The eye still sees forms the ear hears sounds but there's a sense that these things are no longer joined
As I said the image isn't pretty but it conveys the point that once total freedom is found it's never lost
One final point
As we said in one of the earlier talks you are limited by what you are obsessed with
You define yourself by your obsessions and attachments and that sort of definition places limitations on you
When there are no longer any attachments or obsessions you are no longer defined
And because you are no longer defined you can't be described as existing not existing neither or both
In other words ideas of the existence of the self and the nonexistence of the self no longer apply
As for perceptions of self and notself those are like the knife that has been used to cut things through but now has been put aside
Several years ago I was reading an article in a magazine in which a man was describing his childhood in New York City
His parents had come from Eastern Europe to live in America and because the family was poor they put a lot of emphasis on his education
They encouraged him to get as much education as he could
One detail in their encouragement I found very insightful
Every day when the young boy came home from school the mother didn't ask him what he had learned that day
Instead she asked him What questions did you ask today The mother was very wise because she realized that it's through questions that we give shape to our knowledge to understand how one piece of knowledge relates to other pieces of knowledge and to figure out the best way to use our knowledge
This is why it's important to shape our questions skillfully for if we don't we give the wrong shape to everything else we know and we won't get the best use out of our knowledge
This principle applies very directly to the Buddha's teachings  which are all strategic  and in particular to the teaching on notself
To understand this teaching we have to understand what questions it's answering
If you've ever been in an introductory course on Buddhism you've probably heard this question If there is no self what does the action and what receives the results of the action Our discussions this week show that this question is misconstrued in two ways
The first is that the Buddha never said that there is no self and he never said that there is a self
The question of whether a self does or doesn't exist is a question he put aside
The second reason for why the question is misconstrued is because it has the framework backwards
It's taking the teaching of notself as the framework and kamma as something that's supposed to fit inside the framework
Actually the relationship is the other way around
Kamma is the framework and the teaching of notself is meant to fit in the framework
In other words the Buddha takes the teachings on skillful and unskillful kamma as his basic categorical teaching
Within that context the question on self and notself becomes When is a perception of self skillful kamma and when is a perception of notself skillful kamma
And when are they not skillful
So to get the most use out of the teachings on self and notself we have to approach them with these questions in mind
The Buddha is not trying to define what you are
He's not trying to fit you into a box
He's more concerned with helping you
He tries to show you how you define yourself so that you can learn how to use that process of selfdefinition in a way that leads to the ultimate goal of his teaching the end of suffering and the attainment of ultimate freedom ultimate happiness
In this way the teachings on self and notself are part of the answer to the question What when I do it will lead to my longterm welfare and happiness
In this context the Buddha talks about the process of what he calls Imaking and mymaking with the purpose of showing you how to engage in these actions in a skillful way
Normally we engage in these processes all of the time
We create a sense of I in two ways around what we can control in order to attain happiness and around the aspects of our experience  our mind our body  that we hope will taste happiness
In other words we have a sense of our self as the agent or producer of happiness and our self as the consumer of happiness
We start out very early in life developing our sense of self in these ways
And we create many different selves
Remember the story I told about your little sister
When bullies down the street are threatening her she is very much your sister
When you get her home safely and she takes your toy car she is no longer your sister
She's the Other
This shows that your sense of self is changing all the time  like an amoeba taking on many different forms
So it's good to understand that the sense of self is a strategy and that we engage in this strategy making many selves all the time
Sometimes they're mutually coherent sometimes not
Sometimes they're honest and straightforward and sometimes not
This is something that becomes very apparent during meditation
As we've been mentioning throughout this week your mind is like a committee
Each member of the committee is a different self that you've created and nurtured at some point during your life as a particular strategy for attaining a particular happiness
Sometimes they get along sometimes they don't
Sometimes they tell the truth sometimes they lie
When you start meditating you encounter them all
The skill of meditation lies in learning how to achieve some order and honesty among the members of the committee identifying with the more skillful ones trying to keep the unskillful ones under control and bringing some truth to their interactions so that you can bring the mind into jhāna
The idea of notself is also a strategy that we've used many times
We've learned that after identifying with some things for one purpose or to fulfill one desire we have to disidentify with them for the purpose of fulfilling another desire
For example you may identify with your fingernails when they look attractive but when they get too long you have to cut them and throw the cutoff pieces away
As with our various perceptions of self our perceptions of notself can be either skillful or unskillful
Sometimes we try to lay claim to things that we cannot control and sometimes we try to deny that we have any responsibility for things that we can control
In the Buddha's teaching on how to put an end to suffering he asks you to make skillful use of both kinds of strategies  self strategies and notself strategies  and to learn how to employ them ever more skillfully with more awareness more discernment to help with the duties of the four noble truths
The line between what you think is self and notself is determined by your sense of control
If you look carefully at the aggregates  form feeling perception fabrication and consciousness  you can see that you have no absolute control over them but you do have relative control
For example when you tell your body to move it moves when you tell your mind to think about certain things it'll think about them
But your control here is not absolute
Someday you'll tell the body to move and it won't budge
There's the story in the Canon of a king eighty years old who tells a young monk When I was young it was as if I had the strength of two men
But now when I mean to put my foot in one place it goes someplace else The same happens with your mind
There are times when you want it to think and it won't think or it'll think about things you don't want to think about
This lesson has been impressed on me very strongly this week
When I was studying French in high school I actually got an award as the best French student in my class
But now when I try to say something in French nothing comes out
This may tell you something about the American education system but it also has to do with the fact that the mind is never totally under one's control
And the situation gets worse as you get older
So the Buddha recommends while you have some control over the body and mind that you make use of that control to help put an end to suffering
When the body and mind are relatively healthy and strong you have enough control to use them as a path to the end of suffering
You start with the Buddha's first set of categorical teachings to abandon unskillful actions and develop skillful ones in their place
You use the aggregates to be generous to develop virtue and to develop the mind through meditation
As you're trying to gain skill in these practices you come facetoface with the committee inside
For example when you want to be generous some of the members of the committee like the idea of making bread to give to your friends and some don't
Similarly with the precepts Some of the committee members like the idea of letting the mosquito live and others want to slap it dead
And with meditation Some members of the committee want to focus on the breath and some want to think about what to do tomorrow
So part of the skill of the practice lies in learning how to sort out the members of the committee and to develop strategies for dealing with them effectively
You learn to use the healthy ego functions of anticipation suppression sublimation altruism and humor to train the less skillful members of the committee
As you do this you begin to gain skill in creating a useful sense of self and notself
Now there are stages in the practice
After the first set of categorical teachings you move to the second the four noble truths
As we mentioned last night when you put the mind on the path you take the raw material of the aggregates and turn them into jhāna
This is an important step in the practice because as the mind gets into a state of jhāna it finds new ways of feeding and new ways of understanding what is and isn't necessary for happiness
This focuses your attention more and more on your ability to create a sense of wellbeing inside and helps you to see lesser forms of pleasure as notself
You have a solid foundation for letting them go
When your skill is secure you're ready for the higher level of right view where you start applying the perception of notself across the board
This is the step where you see that even though the levels of jhāna are a form of longterm welfare and happiness nevertheless they are still uncertain and inconstant
This is a sign that your sense of happiness has become more refined and your standards for happiness have become higher
This is when the Buddha recommends that you develop the perception that even the pleasure of jhāna is inconstant stressful and notself
This gives rise to a sense of dispassion
To do this he recommends refining the question that lies at the beginning of wisdom What when I do it will lead to my longterm welfare and happiness At this stage your sensitivity to pleasure and happiness leads you to the realization that longterm happiness is no longer good enough
It's no longer good enough for you to want to call it my So now regardless of whatever comes up in the mind the questions become Is this constant No
If something is inconstant is it easeful or stressful Stressful
And if it's stressful is it fitting to call it me or mine Here again the answer is No
You apply these questions to all things even to any perception you may have about the deathless
This is what inclines the mind to a state of unfabricated happiness
What this means is that at the beginning of the path you don't just say that everything is notself and leave it at that
You don't try to clone awakening telling yourself that Awakened people have no desire so I'll have no desire too
I won't even desire awakening
Awakened people are beyond good and evil so I'll go beyond good and evil too This kind of thinking doesn't get you on the path
In fact it keeps you off the path
So instead of starting out by saying that everything is notself you try to develop your powers over what you can control
You push against the characteristics of inconstancy stress and notself and you see how far you can push before they push back
And you discover that as you push you can gain a large measure of pleasure and happiness
You develop discernment and wisdom in deciding what's really important in life which sorts of happiness are more valuable than others
This is how the mind develops the noble treasures of conviction virtue shame compunction learning the Dhamma generosity and discernment
You learn how to hold on to these qualities for the time being and you regard as notself whatever goes against them
Similarly you develop the pleasure of concentration because you see that this is much more longterm than any other pleasure
This gives you a solid foundation from which you can let go of lesser pleasures in particular the pleasures of sensuality
Having access to this higher form of pleasure also enables you to look at suffering and pain without being afraid of them
That way you can look at them for the purpose of comprehending them
Normally when we look at pain we look at it with the idea either of trying to do away with it or of running away from it
In neither way though do we get to comprehend the suffering or the pain
But if you have a sense of confidence and good humor in the face of pain  the confidence and good humor that can come from a state of good solid concentration  then you can look carefully at the pain to the point where you really understand it
This enables you to perform the task with regard to the first noble truth which is to comprehend it
In addition to confidence the practice of jhāna also gives you a sense of competence
You've mastered an important skill and learned how to bring some order to your committee
This way  when you run into the limitations of even the most skillfully constructed mental states and start applying the perception of notself to everything including the path  it's not through selfhatred
It's simply through the mature realization that this is as far as intention can take you
At that point the mind is truly ready for an unconditioned happiness
And here is where you see the genius of the Buddha's strategy
When the mind becomes more and more focused on the pleasures of jhāna all of your clinging gets focused in one place a place of great stability and clarity so that you can watch clinging in action
Because you see that the state of concentration is the one thing worth controlling your sense of self is focused there as well so you can clearly see it in action too
Once all your clinging is focused here then when you're finally ready to cut this one last form of clinging there's no further clinging to any fabricated phenomena at all
This is why when you learn how to apply the perception of notself even to jhāna there's an opening to the deathless
And when you can apply the perception of notself to the phenomenon of the deathless the mind goes beyond all phenomena and arrives at ultimate freedom and ultimate happiness  total freedom total happiness  as a direct pure experience
At this point you can put all your strategies down
Because this happiness is totally unconditioned you don't need a producer and you don't need a consumer
There's no issue of control or no control
There's just the absolute unshakable experience of freedom
Many of the forest ajaans have emphasized this point in their teachings that in the attainment of awakening you put aside both self and notself
Several years back there was a controversy in Thailand as to whether nibbāna was self or notself
The issue was even argued in the newspapers
So one day someone went to ask Ajaan Mahā Boowa Is nibbāna self or notself And his answer was Nibbāna is nibbāna That was it
He then went on to explain how self and notself are tools on the path how both are put down when the path has done its work and how neither applies to the experience of nibbāna
Ajaan Suwat one of my teachers also said that when you've experienced deathless happiness you don't really care if there's something experiencing it or not
The experience is sufficient in and of itself
What we've been describing here is a special kind of consciousness that lies beyond the aggregates The texts call it consciousness without surface Once it's been attained then freedom is never lost
The mind no longer tries to define itself and because it's not defined it can't be described
What we can learn from all of these points is how to employ questions in the practice
You try to avoid questions that are not helpful in putting an end to suffering and you adopt questions that are
These are the questions that lead to discernment and you refine discernment by refining these questions as you use them strategically
For example you start with the question about what leads to longterm welfare and happiness
Then you refine it to the questions that apply the three perceptions of inconstancy stress and notself to all the aggregates
Then you refine that perception even further to the perception that all phenomena are notself and then you finally drop that perception as well to abandon clinging in all its forms
Even the perception of dispassion that results from those perceptions is something you ultimately put aside
So it's through these skillful questions that discernment is developed
This was the way that the Buddha himself found awakening
He looked at his actions and noticed that he was actually creating suffering
That is to say he was looking both at the actions and at the results
Then he said I'm trying to act for the purpose of happiness but why am I creating suffering
Is it actually possible to act in a way that does lead to happiness And he had the courage to ask that question continually and to keep testing his answers to that question to see how far it would take him
This inquiry involves two qualities that are absolutely essential to any successful meditation
The first is learning how to be observant  and not just observant in general but being particularly observant of your actions and their results
When you're looking into the present moment this is what you should look for What am I doing
What's the result of what I'm doing
Is this acceptable or not If it's not that's when you bring in the other quality which is ingenuity Is there some other way that I can act that would be more skillful
This means that as we practice we have to be willing to experiment  which means willing to take risks and make mistakes but always willing to learn from those mistakes
This relates to the most skillful form of selfidentity you can take along the path  the self that takes pride in always being willing to learn from its actions  because this is how you see the noble truths
After all all the truths are actions and results
When you're acting on craving you're engaged in the second noble truth
When you're developing mindfulness concentration and discernment you're engaged in the fourth noble truth the path
And when you master as skills the duties appropriate to each of the truths that's when you really know the truths  and as Ajaan Lee says only when you really know things in practice like this can you let them go
This is how you find awakening
The more you exercise your freedom to act skillfully the more you understand what it means to have freedom of choice
The more closely you look at and understand this freedom through exercising it day by day in all of your actions both inner and outer the closer you come to a freedom that's absolute  and that answers every really burning question you have
Both formerly  now it is only stress that I describe and the cessation of stress
And what is the result of stress
There are some cases in which a person overcome with stress his mind exhausted grieves mourns laments beats his breast  becomes bewildered
Or one overcome with stress his mind exhausted comes to search outside 'Who knows a way or two to stop this stress' I tell you monks that stress results either in bewilderment or in search
It's just as if a man were wounded with an arrow thickly smeared with poison
His friends  companions kinsmen  relatives would provide him with a surgeon and the man would say 'I won't have this arrow removed until I know whether the man who wounded me was a noble warrior a brahman a merchant or a worker' He would say 'I won't have this arrow removed until I know the given name  clan name of the man who wounded me until I know whether he was tall medium or short until I know whether he was dark ruddybrown or goldencolored until I know his home village town or city until I know whether the bow with which I was wounded was a long bow or a crossbow until I know whether the bowstring with which I was wounded was fiber bamboo threads sinew hemp or bark until I know whether the shaft with which I was wounded was wild or cultivated until I know whether the feathers of the shaft with which I was wounded were those of a vulture a stork a hawk a peacock or another bird until I know whether the shaft with which I was wounded was bound with the sinew of an ox a water buffalo a langur or a monkey' He would say 'I won't have this arrow removed until I know whether the shaft with which I was wounded was that of a common arrow a curved arrow a barbed a calftoothed or an oleander arrow' The man would die and those things would still remain unknown to him
In the same way if anyone were to say 'I won't live the holy life under the Blessed One as long as he does not declare to me that The cosmos is eternal or that 'The cosmos is not eternal' 'The cosmos is finite' 'The cosmos is infinite' 'The soul is the same thing as the body' 'The soul is one thing and the body another' 'After death a Tathāgata exists' 'After death a Tathāgata does not exist' 'After death a Tathāgata both exists  does not exist' or that After death a Tathāgata neither exists nor does not exist' the man would die and those things would still remain undeclared by the Tathāgata
So Māluṅkyaputta remember what is undeclared by me as undeclared and what is declared by me as declared
And what is undeclared by me
'The cosmos is eternal' is undeclared by me
'The cosmos is not eternal' is undeclared by me
'The cosmos is finite' 'The cosmos is infinite' 'The soul is the same thing as the body' 'The soul is one thing and the body another' 'After death a Tathāgata exists' 'After death a Tathāgata does not exist' 'After death a Tathāgata both exists  does not exist' 'After death a Tathāgata neither exists nor does not exist' is undeclared by me
And why are they undeclared by me
Because they are not connected with the goal are not fundamental to the holy life
They do not lead to disenchantment to dispassion to cessation to calm to direct knowledge to selfawakening to unbinding
That's why they are undeclared by me
And what is declared by me
'This is stress' is declared by me
'This is the origination of stress' is declared by me
'This is the cessation of stress' is declared by me
'This is the path of practice leading to the cessation of stress' is declared by me
And why are they declared by me
Because they are connected with the goal are fundamental to the holy life
They lead to disenchantment to dispassion to cessation to calm to direct knowledge to selfawakening to unbinding
That's why they are declared by me
As Ven
nanda was sitting there the Blessed One said to him I say categorically nanda that bodily misconduct verbal misconduct  mental misconduct should not be done
Given that the Blessed One has declared lord that bodily misconduct verbal misconduct  mental misconduct should not be done what drawbacks can one expect when doing what should not be done
 One can fault oneself observant people on close examination criticize one one's bad reputation gets spread about one dies confused and  on the breakup of the body after death  one reappears in the plane of deprivation the bad destination the lower realms in hell
I say categorically nanda that good bodily conduct good verbal conduct  good mental conduct should be done
Given that the Blessed One has declared lord that good bodily conduct good verbal conduct  good mental conduct should be done what rewards can one expect when doing what should be done
 One doesn't fault oneself observant people on close examination praise one one's good reputation gets spread about one dies unconfused and  on the breakup of the body after death  one reappears in the good destinations in the heavenly world
Cunda there are three ways in which one is made impure by bodily action four ways in which one is made impure by verbal action and three ways in which one is made impure by mental action
And how is one made impure in three ways by bodily action
There is the case where a certain person takes life is brutal bloodyhanded devoted to killing  slaying showing no mercy to living beings
He takes what is not given
He takes in the manner of a thief things in a village or a wilderness that belong to others and have not been given by them
He engages in sexual misconduct
He gets sexually involved with those who are protected by their mothers their fathers their brothers their sisters their relatives or their Dhamma those with husbands those who entail punishments or even those crowned with flowers by another man
This is how one is made impure in three ways by bodily action
And how is one made impure in four ways by verbal action
There is the case where a certain person engages in false speech
When he has been called to a town meeting a group meeting a gathering of his relatives his guild or of the royalty if he is asked as a witness 'Come  tell good man what you know' If he doesn't know he says 'I know' If he does know he says 'I don't know' If he hasn't seen he says 'I have seen' If he has seen he says 'I haven't seen' Thus he consciously tells lies for his own sake for the sake of another or for the sake of a certain reward
He engages in divisive speech
What he has heard here he tells there to break those people apart from these people here
What he has heard there he tells here to break these people apart from those people there
Thus breaking apart those who are united and stirring up strife between those who have broken apart he loves factionalism delights in factionalism enjoys factionalism speaks things that create factionalism
He engages in harsh speech
He speaks words that are harsh cutting bitter to others abusive of others provoking anger and destroying concentration
He engages in idle chatter
He speaks out of season speaks what isn't factual what isn't in accordance with the goal the Dhamma  the Vinaya words that are not worth treasuring
This is how one is made impure in four ways by verbal action
And how is one made impure in three ways by mental action
There is the case where a certain person is covetous
He covets the belongings of others thinking 'O that what belongs to others would be mine' He bears ill will corrupt in the resolves of his heart 'May these beings be killed or cut apart or crushed or destroyed or may they not exist at all' He has wrong view is warped in the way he sees things 'There is nothing given nothing offered nothing sacrificed
There is no fruit or result of good or bad actions
There is no this world no next world no mother no father no spontaneously reborn beings no brahmans or contemplatives who faring rightly  practicing rightly proclaim this world  the next after having directly known  realized it for themselves' This is how one is made impure in three ways by mental action
These Cunda are the ten courses of unskillful action
Now Cunda there are three ways in which one is made pure by bodily action four ways in which one is made pure by verbal action and three ways in which one is made pure by mental action
And how is one made pure in three ways by bodily action
There is the case where a certain person abandoning the taking of life abstains from the taking of life
He dwells with his rod laid down his knife laid down scrupulous merciful compassionate for the welfare of all living beings
Abandoning the taking of what is not given he abstains from taking what is not given
He does not take in the manner of a thief things in a village or a wilderness that belong to others and have not been given by them
Abandoning sensual misconduct he abstains from sexual misconduct
He does not get sexually involved with those who are protected by their mothers their fathers their brothers their sisters their relatives or their Dhamma those with husbands those who entail punishments or even those crowned with flowers by another man
This is how one is made pure in three ways by bodily action
And how is one made pure in four ways by verbal action
There is the case where a certain person abandoning false speech abstains from false speech
When he has been called to a town meeting a group meeting a gathering of his relatives his guild or of the royalty if he is asked as a witness 'Come  tell good man what you know' If he doesn't know he says 'I don't know' If he does know he says 'I know' If he hasn't seen he says 'I haven't seen' If he has seen he says 'I have seen' Thus he doesn't consciously tell a lie for his own sake for the sake of another or for the sake of any reward
Abandoning false speech he abstains from false speech
He speaks the truth holds to the truth is firm reliable no deceiver of the world
Abandoning divisive speech he abstains from divisive speech
What he has heard here he does not tell there to break those people apart from these people here
What he has heard there he does not tell here to break these people apart from those people there
Thus reconciling those who have broken apart or cementing those who are united he loves concord delights in concord enjoys concord speaks things that create concord
Abandoning harsh speech he abstains from harsh speech
He speaks words that are soothing to the ear that are affectionate that go to the heart that are polite appealing  pleasing to people at large
Abandoning idle chatter he abstains from idle chatter
He speaks in season speaks what is factual what is in accordance with the goal the Dhamma  the Vinaya
He speaks words worth treasuring seasonable reasonable circumscribed connected with the goal
This is how one is made pure in four ways by verbal action
And how is one made pure in three ways by mental action
There is the case where a certain person is not covetous
He does not covet the belongings of others thinking 'O that what belongs to others would be mine' He bears no ill will and is not corrupt in the resolves of his heart
'May these beings be free from animosity free from oppression free from trouble and may they look after themselves with ease' He has right view and is not warped in the way he sees things 'There is what is given what is offered what is sacrificed
There are fruits  results of good  bad actions
There is this world  the next world
There is mother  father
There are spontaneously reborn beings there are brahmans  contemplatives who faring rightly  practicing rightly proclaim this world  the next after having directly known  realized it for themselves' This is how one is made pure in three ways by mental action
These Cunda are the ten courses of skillful action
And which have I taught and declared to be categorical teachings
'This is stress' I have taught and declared to be a categorical teaching
'This is the origination of stress' 'This is the cessation of stress' 'This is the path of practice leading to the cessation of stress' I have taught and declared to be a categorical teaching
And why have I taught and declared these teachings to be categorical
Because they are conducive to the goal conducive to the Dhamma and basic to the holy life
They lead to disenchantment to dispassion to cessation to calm to direct knowledge to selfawakening to unbinding
That's why I have taught and declared them to be categorical
Now this monks is the noble truth of stress Birth is stressful aging is stressful death is stressful sorrow lamentation pain distress  despair are stressful association with the unbeloved is stressful separation from the loved is stressful not getting what is wanted is stressful
In short the five clingingaggregates are stressful
And this monks is the noble truth of the origination of stress the craving that makes for further becoming  accompanied by passion  delight relishing now here  now there  ie craving for sensuality craving for becoming craving for nonbecoming
And this monks is the noble truth of the cessation of stress the remainderless fading  cessation renunciation relinquishing release  letting go of that very craving
And this monks is the noble truth of the way of practice leading to the cessation of stress precisely this noble eightfold path  right view right resolve right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness right concentration
'This noble truth of stress is to be comprehended' 'This noble truth of the origination of stress is to be abandoned' 'This noble truth of the cessation of stress is to be realized' 'This noble truth of the way of practice leading to the cessation of stress is to be developed'
This is the way leading to discernment when visiting a contemplative or brahman to ask 'What is skillful venerable sir
What is unskillful
What is blameworthy
What is blameless
What should be cultivated
What should not be cultivated
What having been done by me will be for my longterm harm  suffering
Or what having been done by me will be for my longterm welfare  happiness'
There are these four ways of answering questions
Which four
There are questions that should be answered categorically
There are questions that should be answered with an analytical answer
There are questions that should be answered with a counterquestion
There are questions that should be put aside
These are the four ways of answering questions
There is the case where an uninstructed runofthemill person  who has no regard for noble ones is not wellversed or disciplined in their Dhamma who has no regard for men of integrity is not wellversed or disciplined in their Dhamma  doesn't discern what ideas are fit for attention or what ideas are unfit for attention
This being so he doesn't attend to ideas fit for attention and attends to ideas unfit for attention
This is how he attends inappropriately 'Was I in the past
Was I not in the past
What was I in the past
How was I in the past
Having been what what was I in the past
Shall I be in the future
Shall I not be in the future
What shall I be in the future
How shall I be in the future
Having been what what shall I be in the future' Or else he is inwardly perplexed about the immediate present 'Am I
Am I not
What am I
How am I
Where has this being come from
Where is it bound'
As he attends inappropriately in this way one of six kinds of view arises in him The view I have a self arises in him as true  established or the view I have no self or the view It is precisely by means of self that I perceive self or the view It is precisely by means of self that I perceive notself or the view It is precisely by means of notself that I perceive self arises in him as true  established or else he has a view like this This very self of mine  the knower that is sensitive here  there to the ripening of good  bad actions  is the self of mine that is constant everlasting eternal not subject to change and will endure as long as eternity
This is called a thicket of views a wilderness of views a contortion of views a writhing of views a fetter of views
Bound by a fetter of views the uninstructed runofthemill person is not freed from birth aging  death from sorrow lamentation pain distress  despair
He is not freed I tell you from suffering  stress
The wellinstructed disciple of the noble ones  who has regard for noble ones is wellversed  disciplined in their Dhamma who has regard for men of integrity is wellversed  disciplined in their Dhamma  discerns what ideas are fit for attention and what ideas are unfit for attention
This being so he doesn't attend to ideas unfit for attention and attends to ideas fit for attention
He attends appropriately This is stress This is the origination of stress This is the cessation of stress This is the way leading to the cessation of stress
As he attends appropriately in this way three fetters are abandoned in him identityview doubt and grasping at habits  practices
These are called the fermentations to be abandoned by seeing
To what extent nanda does one delineate when delineating a self
Either delineating a self possessed of form and finite one delineates that 'My self is possessed of form and finite' Or delineating a self possessed of form and infinite one delineates that 'My self is possessed of form and infinite' Or delineating a self formless and finite one delineates that 'My self is formless and finite' Or delineating a self formless and infinite one delineates that 'My self is formless and infinite'
Now the one who when delineating a self delineates it as possessed of form and finite either delineates it as possessed of form and finite in the present or of such a nature that it will become possessed of form and finite or he believes that 'Although it is not yet that way I will convert it into being that way' This being the case it is proper to say that a fixed view of a self possessed of form and finite obsesses him
Monks where there is a self would there be 'belonging to my self'
Yes lord
Or monks where there is what belongs to self would there be 'my self'
Yes lord
Monks where a self or what belongs to self are not pinned down as a truth or reality then the viewposition  'This cosmos is the self
After death this I will be constant permanent eternal not subject to change
I will stay just like that for an eternity'  Isn't it utterly  completely a fool's teaching
Monks I can imagine no one group of beings more variegated than that of common animals
Common animals are created by mind
And the mind is even more variegated than common animals
Thus one should reflect on one's mind with every moment 'For a long time has this mind been defiled by passion aversion  delusion' From the defilement of the mind are beings defiled
From the purification of the mind are beings purified
Just as a dog tied by a leash to a post or stake keeps running around and circling around that very post or stake in the same way an uninstructed runofthemill person  who has no regard for noble ones is not wellversed or disciplined in their Dhamma who has no regard for people of integrity is not wellversed or disciplined in their Dhamma  assumes form to be the self or the self as possessing form or form as in the self or the self as in form
He assumes feeling to be the self or the self as possessing feeling or feeling as in the self or the self as in feeling
He assumes perception to be the self or the self as possessing perception or perception as in the self or the self as in perception
He assumes fabrications to be the self or the self as possessing fabrications or fabrications as in the self or the self as in fabrications
He assumes consciousness to be the self or the self as possessing consciousness or consciousness as in the self or the self as in consciousness
He keeps running around and circling around that very form that very feeling that very perception those very fabrications that very consciousness
He is not set loose from form not set loose from feeling from perception from fabrications not set loose from consciousness
He is not set loose from birth aging  death from sorrows lamentations pains distresses  despairs
He is not set loose I tell you from suffering  stress
And why do you call it 'form'
Because it is afflicted thus it is called 'form' Afflicted with what
With cold  heat  hunger  thirst with the touch of flies mosquitoes wind sun  reptiles
Because it is afflicted it is called form
And why do you call it 'feeling'
Because it feels thus it is called 'feeling' What does it feel
It feels pleasure it feels pain it feels neitherpleasurenorpain
Because it feels it is called feeling
And why do you call it 'perception'
Because it perceives thus it is called 'perception' What does it perceive
It perceives blue it perceives yellow it perceives red it perceives white
Because it perceives it is called perception
And why do you call them 'fabrications'
Because they fabricate fabricated things thus they are called 'fabrications' What do they fabricate as a fabricated thing
For the sake of formness they fabricate form as a fabricated thing
For the sake of feelingness they fabricate feeling as a fabricated thing
For the sake of perceptionhood For the sake of fabricationhood For the sake of consciousnesshood they fabricate consciousness as a fabricated thing
Because they fabricate fabricated things they are called fabrications
And why do you call it 'consciousness'
Because it cognizes thus it is called consciousness
What does it cognize
It cognizes what is sour bitter pungent sweet alkaline nonalkaline salty  unsalty
Because it cognizes it is called consciousness
Thus an instructed disciple of the noble ones reflects in this way 'I am now being chewed up by form
But in the past I was also chewed up by form in the same way I am now being chewed up by present form
And if I delight in future form then in the future I will be chewed up by form in the same way I am now being chewed up by present form' Having reflected in this way he becomes indifferent to past form does not delight in future form and is practicing for the sake of disenchantment dispassion and cessation with regard to present form
If one stays obsessed with form monk that's what one is measured by
Whatever one is measured by that's how one is classified
If one stays obsessed with feeling perception fabrications
If one stays obsessed with consciousness that's what one is measured by
Whatever one is measured by that's how one is classified
But if one doesn't stay obsessed with form monk that's not what one is measured by
Whatever one isn't measured by that's not how one is classified
If one doesn't stay obsessed with feeling perception fabrications
If one doesn't stay obsessed with consciousness that's not what one is measured by
Whatever one isn't measured by that's not how one is classified
The Blessed One said And which craving is the ensnarer that has flowed along spread out and caught hold with which this world is smothered  enveloped like a tangled skein a knotted ball of string like matted rushes and reeds and does not go beyond transmigration beyond the planes of deprivation woe  bad destinations
These cravingverbalizations dependent on what is internal and cravingverbalizations dependent on what is external
And which are the cravingverbalizations dependent on what is internal
There being 'I am' there comes to be 'I am here' there comes to be 'I am like this' 'I am otherwise' 'I am bad' 'I am good' 'I might be' 'I might be here' 'I might be like this' 'I might be otherwise' 'May I be' 'May I be here' 'May I be like this' 'May I be otherwise' 'I will be' 'I will be here' 'I will be like this' 'I will be otherwise' These are the cravingverbalizations dependent on what is internal
And which are the cravingverbalizations dependent on what is external
There being 'I am because of this' there comes to be 'I am here because of this' there comes to be 'I am like this because of this' 'I am otherwise because of this' 'I am bad because of this' 'I am good because of this' 'I might be because of this' 'I might be here because of this' 'I might be like this because of this' 'I might be otherwise because of this' 'May I be because of this' 'May I be here because of this' 'May I be like this because of this' 'May I be otherwise because of this' 'I will be because of this' 'I will be here because of this' 'I will be like this because of this' 'I will be otherwise because of this' These are the cravingverbalizations dependent on what is external
Thus there are cravingverbalizations dependent on what is internal and cravingverbalizations dependent on what is external
These are called the cravingverbalizations
Thus with cravingverbalizations of this sort in the past in the future and in the present there are cravingverbalizations
This monks is craving the ensnarer that has flowed along spread out and caught hold with which this world is smothered  enveloped like a tangled skein a knotted ball of string like matted rushes and reeds and does not go beyond transmigration beyond the planes of deprivation woe  bad destinations
Form monks is notself
If form were self this form would not lend itself to disease
It would be possible with regard to form 'Let my form be thus
Let my form not be thus' But precisely because form is notself this form lends itself to disease
And it is not possible with regard to form 'Let my form be thus
Let my form not be thus'
Feeling is not self
Perception is not self
Fabrications are not self
Consciousness is notself
If consciousness were self this consciousness would not lend itself to disease
It would be possible with regard to consciousness 'Let my consciousness be thus
Let my consciousness not be thus' But precisely because consciousness is notself consciousness lends itself to disease
And it is not possible with regard to consciousness 'Let my consciousness be thus
Let my consciousness not be thus'
Now at that moment this line of thinking appeared in the awareness of a certain monk So  form is notself feeling is notself perception is notself fabrications are notself consciousness is notself
Then what self will be touched by the actions done by what is notself
Then the Blessed One realizing with his awareness the line of thinking in that monk's awareness addressed the monks It's possible that a senseless person  immersed in ignorance overcome with craving  might think that he could outsmart the Teacher's message in this way 'So  form is notself feeling is notself perception is notself fabrications are notself consciousness is notself
Then what self will be touched by the actions done by what is notself' Now monks haven't I trained you in counterquestioning with regard to this  that topic here  there
What do you think  Is form constant or inconstant Inconstant lord And is that which is inconstant easeful or stressful Stressful lord And is it fitting to regard what is inconstant stressful subject to change as 'This is mine
This is my self
This is what I am' No lord
 Is feeling constant or inconstant Inconstant lord
 Is perception constant or inconstant Inconstant lord
 Are fabrications constant or inconstant Inconstant lord
What do you think monks  Is consciousness constant or inconstant Inconstant lord And is that which is inconstant easeful or stressful Stressful lord And is it fitting to regard what is inconstant stressful subject to change as 'This is mine
This is my self
This is what I am' No lord
Thus monks any form whatsoever that is past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or near Every form is to be seen with right discernment as it has come to be 'This is not mine
This is not my self
This is not what I am'
Any feeling whatsoever
Any perception whatsoever
Any fabrications whatsoever
Any consciousness whatsoever that is past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or near Every consciousness is to be seen with right discernment as it has come to be 'This is not mine
This is not my self
This is not what I am'
Seeing thus the instructed disciple of the noble ones grows disenchanted with form disenchanted with feeling disenchanted with perception disenchanted with fabrications disenchanted with consciousness
Disenchanted he becomes dispassionate
Through dispassion he is released
With release there is the knowledge 'Released' He discerns that 'Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task done
There is nothing further for this world' That is what the Blessed One said
Gratified the monks delighted in the Blessed One's words
And while this explanation was being given the minds of sixty monks through lack of clinging were fully released from fermentations
To what extent nanda does one assume when assuming a self
Assuming feeling to be the self one assumes that 'Feeling is my self' 'Feeling is not my self My self is oblivious ' 'Neither is feeling my self nor is my self oblivious to feeling but rather my self feels in that my self is subject to feeling'
Now one who says 'Feeling is my self' should be addressed as follows 'There are these three feelings my friend  feelings of pleasure feelings of pain and feelings of neither pleasure nor pain
Which of these three feelings do you assume to be the self
At a moment when a feeling of pleasure is sensed no feeling of pain or of neither pleasure nor pain is sensed
Only a feeling of pleasure is sensed at that moment
At a moment when a feeling of pain is sensed no feeling of pleasure or of neither pleasure nor pain is sensed
Only a feeling of pain is sensed at that moment
At a moment when a feeling of neither pleasure nor pain is sensed no feeling of pleasure or of pain is sensed
Only a feeling of neither pleasure nor pain is sensed at that moment
Now a feeling of pleasure is inconstant fabricated dependent on conditions subject to passing away dissolution fading and cessation
A feeling of pain is inconstant fabricated dependent on conditions subject to passing away dissolution fading and cessation
A feeling of neither pleasure nor pain is inconstant fabricated dependent on conditions subject to passing away dissolution fading and cessation
Having sensed a feeling of pleasure as 'my self' then with the cessation of one's very own feeling of pleasure 'my self' has perished
Having sensed a feeling of pain as 'my self' then with the cessation of one's very own feeling of pain 'my self' has perished
Having sensed a feeling of neither pleasure nor pain as 'my self' then with the cessation of one's very own feeling of neither pleasure nor pain 'my self' has perished
Thus he assumes assuming in the immediate present a self inconstant entangled in pleasure and pain subject to arising and passing away he who says 'Feeling is my self' Thus in this manner nanda one does not see fit to assume feeling to be the self
As for the person who says 'Feeling is not the self My self is oblivious' he should be addressed as follows 'My friend where nothing whatsoever is sensed at all would there be the thought I am' No lord
Thus in this manner nanda one does not see fit to assume that 'Feeling is not my self My self is oblivious'
As for the person who says 'Neither is feeling my self nor is my self oblivious but rather my self feels in that my self is subject to feeling' he should be addressed as follows 'My friend should feelings altogether and every way stop without remainder then with feeling completely not existing owing to the cessation of feeling would there be the thought I am' No lord
Thus in this manner nanda one does not see fit to assume that 'Neither is feeling my self nor is my self oblivious but rather my self feels in that my self is subject to feeling'
Now nanda in as far as a monk does not assume feeling to be the self nor the self as oblivious nor that 'My self feels in that my self is subject to feeling' then not assuming in this way he does not cling to anything in the world
Not clinging he is not agitated
Unagitated he is totally unbound right within
He discerns that 'Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task done
There is nothing further for this world'
If anyone were to say with regard to a monk whose mind is thus released that 'The Tathāgata exists after death' is his view that would be mistaken that 'The Tathāgata does not exist after death' that 'The Tathāgata both exists and does not exist after death' that 'The Tathāgata neither exists nor does not exist after death' is his view that would be mistaken
Why
Having directly known the extent of designation and the extent of the objects of designation the extent of expression and the extent of the objects of expression the extent of description and the extent of the objects of description the extent of discernment and the extent of the objects of discernment the extent to which the cycle revolves Having directly known that the monk is released
The view that 'Having directly known that the monk released does not see does not know' would be mistaken
Even though a disciple of the noble ones has clearly seen with right discernment as it has come to be that sensuality is of much stress much despair  greater drawbacks still  if he has not attained a rapture  pleasure apart from sensuality apart from unskillful mental qualities or something more peaceful than that  he can be tempted by sensuality
But when he has clearly seen with right discernment as it has come to be that sensuality is of much stress much despair  greater drawbacks and he has attained a rapture  pleasure apart from sensuality apart from unskillful mental qualities or something more peaceful than that he cannot be tempted by sensuality
Just as the royal frontier fortress has a gatekeeper  wise experienced intelligent  to keep out those he doesn't know and to let in those he does for the protection of those within and to ward off those without in the same way a disciple of the noble ones is mindful highly meticulous remembering  able to call to mind even things that were done  said long ago
With mindfulness as his gatekeeper the disciple of the ones abandons what is unskillful develops what is skillful abandons what is blameworthy develops what is blameless and looks after himself with purity
Just as a royal frontier fortress has large stores of grass timber  water for the delight convenience  comfort of those within and to ward off those without in the same way the disciple of the noble ones quite secluded from sensuality secluded from unskillful qualities enters  remains in the first jhana  rapture  pleasure born of seclusion accompanied by directed thought  evaluation  for his own delight convenience  comfort and to alight on Unbinding
Just as a royal frontier fortress has large stores of rice  barley for the delight convenience  comfort of those within and to ward off those without in the same way the disciple of the noble ones with the stilling of directed thoughts  evaluations enters  remains in the second jhana  rapture  pleasure born of concentration unification of awareness free from directed thought  evaluation  internal assurance  for his own delight convenience  comfort and to alight on Unbinding
Just as a royal frontier fortress has large stores of sesame green gram  other beans for the delight convenience  comfort of those within and to ward off those without in the same way the disciple of the noble ones with the fading of rapture remains equanimous mindful  alert and senses pleasure with the body
He enters  remains in the third jhana  of which the noble ones declare 'Equanimous  mindful he has a pleasant abiding'  for his own delight convenience  comfort and to alight on Unbinding
Just as a royal frontier fortress has large stores of tonics  ghee fresh butter oil honey molasses  salt  for the delight convenience  comfort of those within and to ward off those without in the same way the disciple of the noble ones with the abandoning of pleasure  pain as with the earlier disappearance of joy  distress enters  remains in the fourth jhana  purity of equanimity  mindfulness neitherpleasurenorpain  for his own delight convenience  comfort and to alight on Unbinding

Ven
nanda 'This body comes into being through conceit
And yet it is by relying on conceit that conceit is to be abandoned' Thus it was said
And in reference to what was it said
There is the case sister where a monk hears 'The monk named suchandsuch they say through the ending of the fermentations has entered  remains in the fermentationfree awarenessrelease  discernmentrelease having directly known  realized them for himself right in the here  now' The thought occurs to him 'The monk named suchsuch they say through the ending of the fermentations has entered  remains in the fermentationfree awarenessrelease  discernmentrelease having directly known  realized them for himself right in the here  now
Then why not me' Then at a later time he abandons conceit having relied on conceit
And what is the self as a governing principle
There is the case where a monk having gone to a wilderness to the foot of a tree or to an empty dwelling reflects on this 'It's not for the sake of robes that I have gone forth from the home life into homelessness it's not for the sake of almsfood for the sake of lodgings or for the sake of this or that state of becoming that I have gone forth from the home life into homelessness
Simply that I am beset by birth aging  death by sorrows lamentations pains distresses  despairs beset by stress overcome with stress Perhaps the end of this entire mass of suffering  stress might be known Now if I were to seek the same sort of sensual pleasures that I abandoned in going forth from home into homelessness  or a worse sort  that would not be fitting for me' So he reflects on this 'My persistence will be aroused  not lax my mindfulness established  not confused my body calm  not aroused my mind centered  unified' Having made himself his governing principle he abandons what is unskillful develops what is skillful abandons what is blameworthy develops what is unblameworthy and looks after himself in a pure way
This is called the self as a governing principle

Just as the footprints of all legged animals are encompassed by the footprint of the elephant and the elephant's footprint is reckoned the foremost among them in terms of size in the same way all skillful qualities are rooted in heedfulness converge in heedfulness and heedfulness is reckoned the foremost among them
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery
Now at that time King Pasenadi Kosala was together with Queen Mallikā in the upper palace
Then he said to her Mallikā is there anyone more dear to you than yourself
No your majesty she answered
There is no one more dear to me than myself
And what about you your majesty
Is there anyone more dear to you than yourself
No Mallikā
There is no one more dear to me than myself
Then the king descending from the palace went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side
As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One Just now I was together with Queen Mallikā in the upper palace
I said to her 'Is there anyone more dear to you than yourself'
'No your majesty' she answered
'There is no one more dear to me than myself
And what about you your majesty
Is there anyone more dear to you than yourself'
'No Mallikā
There is no one more dear to me than myself' Then on realizing the significance of that the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed
Searching all directions
with your awareness
you find no one dearer
than yourself
In the same way others
are fiercely dear to themselves
So you shouldn't hurt others
if you love yourself
Then Anāthapiṇḍika the householder went to the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down to him sat to one side
As he was sitting there the Blessed One said to him These five things householder are welcome agreeable pleasant  hard to obtain in the world
Which five
Long life is welcome agreeable pleasant  hard to obtain in the world
Beauty is welcome agreeable pleasant  hard to obtain in the world
Happiness is welcome agreeable pleasant  hard to obtain in the world
Status is welcome agreeable pleasant  hard to obtain in the world
Rebirth in heaven is welcome agreeable pleasant  hard to obtain in the world
Now I tell you these five things are not to be obtained by reason of prayers or wishes
If they were to be obtained by reason of prayers or wishes who here would lack them
It's not fitting for the disciple of the noble ones who desires long life to pray for it or to delight in doing so
Instead the disciple of the noble ones who desires long life should follow the path of practice leading to long life
In so doing he will attain long life either human or divine
It's not fitting for the disciple of the noble ones who desires beauty to pray for it or to delight in doing so
Instead the disciple of the noble ones who desires beauty should follow the path of practice leading to beauty
In so doing he will attain beauty either human or divine
It's not fitting for the disciple of the noble ones who desires happiness to pray for it or to delight in doing so
Instead the disciple of the noble ones who desires happiness should follow the path of practice leading to happiness
In so doing he will attain happiness either human or divine
It's not fitting for the disciple of the noble ones who desires status to pray for it or to delight in doing so
Instead the disciple of the noble ones who desires status should follow the path of practice leading to status
In so doing he will attain status either human or divine
It's not fitting for the disciple of the noble ones who desires rebirth in heaven to pray for it or to delight in doing so
Instead the disciple of the noble ones who desires rebirth in heaven should follow the path of practice leading to rebirth in heaven
In so doing he will attain rebirth in heaven
And what is right view
Right view I tell you is of two sorts There is right view with fermentations siding with merit resulting in the acquisitions and there is noble right view without fermentations transcendent a factor of the path
And what is the right view that has fermentations sides with merit  results in acquisitions
'There is what is given what is offered what is sacrificed
There are fruits  results of good  bad actions
There is this world  the next world
There is mother  father
There are spontaneously reborn beings there are contemplatives  brahmans who faring rightly  practicing rightly proclaim this world  the next after having directly known  realized it for themselves' This is the right view that has fermentations sides with merit  results in acquisitions
And what is the right view that is without fermentations transcendent a factor of the path
The discernment the faculty of discernment the strength of discernment analysis of qualities as a factor for awakening the path factor of right view in one developing the noble path whose mind is noble whose mind is free from fermentations who is fully possessed of the noble path
This is the right view that is without fermentations transcendent a factor of the path
Monks there are these seven treasures
Which seven
The treasure of conviction the treasure of virtue the treasure of shame the treasure of compunction the treasure of listening the treasure of generosity the treasure of discernment
And what is the treasure of conviction
There is the case where a disciple of the noble ones has conviction is convinced of the Tathāgata's awakening 'Indeed the Blessed One is pure and rightly selfawakened consummate in knowledge  conduct wellgone an expert with regard to the world unexcelled as a trainer for those people fit to be tamed the Teacher of divine  human beings awakened blessed' This is called the treasure of conviction
And what is the treasure of virtue
There is the case where a disciple of the noble ones abstains from taking life abstains from stealing abstains from illicit sexual conduct abstains from lying abstains from taking intoxicants that cause heedlessness
This monks is called the treasure of virtue
And what is the treasure of shame
There is the case where a disciple of the noble ones feels shame at bodily misconduct verbal misconduct mental misconduct
This is called the treasure of shame
And what is the treasure of compunction
There is the case where a disciple of the noble ones feels compunction at bodily misconduct verbal misconduct mental misconduct
This is called the treasure of compunction
And what is the treasure of listening
There is the case where a disciple of the noble ones has heard much has retained what heshe has heard has stored what heshe has heard
Whatever teachings are admirable in the beginning admirable in the middle admirable in the end that  in their meaning  expression  proclaim the holy life that is entirely complete  pure Those heshe has listened to often retained discussed accumulated examined with hisher mind and wellpenetrated in terms of hisher views
This is called the treasure of listening
And what is the treasure of generosity
There is the case of a disciple of the noble ones his awareness cleansed of the stain of stinginess living at home freely generous openhanded delighting in being magnanimous responsive to requests delighting in the distribution of alms
This is called the treasure of generosity
And what is the treasure of discernment
There is the case where a disciple of the noble ones is discerning endowed with discernment of arising  passing away  noble penetrating leading to the right ending of stress
This is called the treasure of discernment
These monks are the seven treasures
And what is comprehension
Any ending of passion ending of aversion ending of delusion This is called comprehension
When you see with discernment
'All fabrications are inconstant'
'All fabrications are stressful'
'All phenomena are notself' 
you grow disenchanted with stress
 This is the path
 to purity
Then Ven
Khemaka leaning on his staff went to the elder monks and on arrival exchanged courteous greetings with them
After an exchange of friendly greetings  courtesies he sat to one side
As he was sitting there the elder monks said to him Friend Khemaka this 'I am' of which you speak What do you say 'I am'
Do you say 'I am form' or do you say 'I am something other than form'
Do you say 'I am feeling perception fabrications consciousness' or do you say 'I am something other than consciousness''
This 'I am' of which you speak What do you say 'I am'
Friends it's not that I say 'I am form' nor do I say 'I am something other than form' It's not that I say 'I am feeling perception fabrications consciousness' nor do I say 'I am something other than consciousness' With regard to these five clingingaggregates 'I am' has not been overcome although I don't assume that 'I am this'
It's just like the scent of a blue red or white lotus If someone were to call it the scent of a petal or the scent of the color or the scent of a filament would he be speaking rightly
No friend
Then how would he describe it if he were describing it rightly
As the scent of the flower That's how he would describe it if he were describing it rightly
In the same way friends it's not that I say 'I am form' nor do I say 'I am other than form' It's not that I say 'I am feeling perception fabrications consciousness' nor do I say 'I am something other than consciousness' With regard to these five clingingaggregates 'I am' has not been overcome although I don't assume that 'I am this'
Friends even though a noble disciple has abandoned the five lower fetters he still has with regard to the five clingingaggregates a lingering residual 'I am' conceit an 'I am' desire an 'I am' obsession
But at a later time he keeps focusing on the phenomena of arising  passing away with regard to the five clingingaggregates 'Such is form such its origin such its disappearance
Such is feeling Such is perception Such are fabrications Such is consciousness such its origin such its disappearance' As he keeps focusing on the arising  passing away of these five clingingaggregates the lingering residual 'I am' conceit 'I am' desire 'I am' obsession is fully obliterated
Just like a cloth dirty  stained Its owners give it over to a washerman who scrubs it with salt earth or lye or cowdung and then rinses it in clear water
Now even though the cloth is clean  spotless it still has a lingering residual scent of salt earth or lye or cowdung
The washerman gives it to the owners the owners put it away in a scentinfused wicker hamper and its lingering residual scent of salt earth lye or cowdung is fully obliterated
In the same way friends even though a noble disciple has abandoned the five lower fetters he still has with regard to the five clingingaggregates a lingering residual 'I am' conceit an 'I am' desire an 'I am' obsession
But at a later time he keeps focusing on the phenomena of arising  passing away with regard to the five clingingaggregates 'Such is form such its origin such its disappearance
Such is feeling Such is perception Such are fabrications Such is consciousness such its origin such its disappearance' As he keeps focusing on the arising  passing away of these five clingingaggregates the lingering residual 'I am' conceit 'I am' desire 'I am' obsession is fully obliterated
When this was said the elder monks said to Ven
Khemaka We didn't crossexamine Ven
Khemaka with the purpose of troubling him just that Ven
Khemaka is capable of declaring the Blessed One's message teaching it describing it setting it forth revealing it explaining it making it plain  just as he has in fact declared it taught it described it set it forth revealed it explained it made it plain
That is what Ven
Khemaka said
Gratified the elder monks delighted in his words
And while this explanation was being given the minds of sixtysome monks through no clinging were fully released from fermentations  as was Ven
Khemaka's
As he was sitting to one side Ven
Kaccāyana Gotta said to the Blessed One Lord 'Right view right view' it is said
To what extent is there right view
By  large Kaccāyana this world is supported by a polarity that of existence  nonexistence
But when one sees the origination of the world as it actually is with right discernment 'nonexistence' with reference to the world doesn't occur to one
When one sees the cessation of the world as it actually is with right discernment 'existence' with reference to the world doesn't occur to one
By  large Kaccāyana this world is in bondage to attachments clingings  biases
But one such as this doesn't get involved with or cling to these attachments clingings fixations of awareness biases or obsessions nor is he resolved on 'my self' He has no uncertainty or doubt that mere stress when arising is arising stress when passing away is passing away
In this his knowledge is independent of others
It's to this extent Kaccāyana that there is right view
'Everything exists' That is one extreme
'Everything doesn't exist' That is a second extreme
Avoiding these two extremes the Tathāgata teaches the Dhamma via the middle From ignorance as a requisite condition come fabrications
From fabrications as a requisite condition comes consciousness
From consciousness as a requisite condition comes nameform
From nameform as a requisite condition come the six sense media
From the six sense media as a requisite condition comes contact
From contact as a requisite condition comes feeling
From feeling as a requisite condition comes craving
From craving as a requisite condition comes clingingsustenance
From clingingsustenance as a requisite condition comes becoming
From becoming as a requisite condition comes birth
From birth as a requisite condition then aging  death sorrow lamentation pain distress  despair come into play
Such is the origination of this entire mass of stress  suffering
Now from the remainderless fading  cessation of that very ignorance comes the cessation of fabrications
From the cessation of fabrications comes the cessation of consciousness
From the cessation of consciousness comes the cessation of nameform
From the cessation of nameform comes the cessation of the six sense media
From the cessation of the six sense media comes the cessation of contact
From the cessation of contact comes the cessation of feeling
From the cessation of feeling comes the cessation of craving
From the cessation of craving comes the cessation of clinging sustenance
From the cessation of clingingsustenance comes the cessation of becoming
From the cessation of becoming comes the cessation of birth
From the cessation of birth then aging  death sorrow lamentation pain distress  despair all cease
Such is the cessation of this entire mass of stress  suffering
'Consciousness without surface endless radiant all around has not been experienced through the earthness of earth the liquidity of liquid the fieriness of fire the windiness of wind the allness of the all'
Just as if a skilled butcher or butcher's apprentice having killed a cow were to carve it up with a sharp carving knife so that  without damaging the substance of the inner flesh without damaging the substance of the outer hide  he would cut sever  detach only the skin muscles connective tissues  attachments in between
Having cut severed  detached the outer skin and then covering the cow again with that very skin if he were to say that the cow was joined to the skin just as it had been Would he be speaking rightly
No venerable sir
Why is that
Because if the skilled butcher or butcher's apprentice having killed a cow were to cut sever  detach only the skin muscles connective tissues  attachments in between and having covered the cow again with that very skin then no matter how much he might say that the cow was joined to the skin just as it had been the cow would still be disjoined from the skin
This simile sisters I have given to convey a message
The message is this The substance of the inner flesh stands for the six internal media the substance of the outer hide for the six external media
The skin muscles connective tissues  attachments in between stand for passion  delight
And the sharp knife stands for noble discernment  the noble discernment that cuts severs  detaches the defilements fetters  bonds in between
There is the case where a monk has heard 'All things are unworthy of attachment' Having heard that all things are unworthy of attachment he directly knows every thing
Directly knowing every thing he comprehends every thing
Comprehending every thing he sees all themes as something separate
He sees the eye as something separate
He sees forms as something separate
He sees eyeconsciousness as something separate
He sees eyecontact as something separate
And whatever arises in dependence on eyecontact  experienced either as pleasure as pain or as neitherpleasurenorpain  that too he sees as something separate
He sees the ear as something separate
He sees the nose as something separate
He sees the tongue as something separate
He sees the body as something separate
He sees the intellect as something separate
He sees ideas as something separate
He sees intellectconsciousness as something separate
He sees intellectcontact as something separate
And whatever arises in dependence on intellectcontact  experienced either as pleasure as pain or as neitherpleasurenorpain  that too he sees as something separate
This is how a monk knows this is how a monk sees so that ignorance is abandoned and clear knowing arises
Sensing a feeling of pleasure one discerns that it is fleeting not grasped at not relished
Sensing a feeling of pain Sensing a feeling of neither pleasure nor pain one discerns that it is fleeting not grasped at not relished
Sensing a feeling of pleasure one senses it disjoined from it
Sensing a feeling of pain Sensing a feeling of neither pleasure nor pain one senses it disjoined from it

What do you think Anurādha Do you regard form as the Tathāgata  No lord
Do you regard feeling as the Tathāgata  No lord
Do you regard perception as the Tathāgata  No lord
Do you regard fabrications as the Tathāgata  No lord
Do you regard consciousness as the Tathāgata  No lord
What do you think Anurādha Do you regard the Tathāgata as being in form Elsewhere than form In feeling Elsewhere than feeling In perception Elsewhere than perception In fabrications Elsewhere than fabrications In consciousness Elsewhere than consciousness  No lord
What do you think Do you regard the Tathāgata as formfeelingperceptionfabricationsconsciousness  No lord
Do you regard the Tathāgata as that which is without form without feeling without perception without fabrications without consciousness  No lord
And so Anurādha  when you can't pin down the Tathāgata as a truth or reality even in the present life  is it proper for you to declare 'Friends the Tathāgata  the supreme man the superlative man attainer of the superlative attainment  being described is described otherwise than with these four positions The Tathāgata exists after death does not exist after death both does  does not exist after death neither exists nor does not exist after death'
No lord
Very good Anurādha
Very good
Both formerly  now it is only stress that I describe and the cessation of stress
In the same way Vaccha any form by which one describing the Tathāgata would describe him That the Tathāgata has abandoned its root destroyed made like a palmyra stump deprived of the conditions of existence not destined for future arising
Freed from the classification of form Vaccha the Tathāgata is deep boundless hard to fathom like the sea
'Reappears' doesn't apply
'Does not reappear' doesn't apply
'Both does  does not reappear' doesn't apply
'Neither reappears nor does not reappear' doesn't apply
Any feeling Any perception Any fabrication
Any consciousness by which one describing the Tathāgata would describe him That the Tathāgata has abandoned its root destroyed made like a palmyra stump deprived of the conditions of existence not destined for future arising
Freed from the classification of consciousness Vaccha the Tathāgata is deep boundless hard to fathom like the sea
Freed dissociated  released from ten things Bāhuna the Tathāgata dwells with unrestricted awareness
Which ten
Freed dissociated  released from form the Tathāgata dwells with unrestricted awareness
Freed dissociated  released from feeling Freed dissociated  released from perception Freed dissociated  released from fabrications Freed dissociated  released from consciousness Freed dissociated  released from birth Freed dissociated  released from aging Freed dissociated  released from death Freed dissociated  released from stress Freed dissociated  released from defilement the Tathāgata dwells with unrestricted awareness
Just as a red blue or white lotus born in the water and growing in the water rises up above the water and stands with no water adhering to it in the same way the Tathāgata  freed dissociated  released from these ten things  dwells with unrestricted awareness
This analysis of the Path is intended as a guide to lead practicing Buddhists to peace and wellbeing in terms both of the world and of the Dhamma
Wellbeing in terms of the world includes such things as fortune status praise and pleasure
These four things depend on our conducting ourselves properly along the right path
If we follow the wrong path though we are bound to meet with loss of fortune loss of status censure and criticism suffering and pain
The fact that we experience these things may well be due to deficiencies in our own conduct
So if our practice of the right path  the Noble Eightfold Path  is to lead us to peace in terms both of the world and of the Dhamma we will first have to study it so that we understand it rightly and then conduct ourselves in line with its factors
Then if we have aims in terms of the world we'll get good results
Our fortune status good name and pleasure will be solid and lasting
Even after we die they will continue to appear in the world
If however we see that fortune status praise and pleasure are inconstant undependable and subject to change we should immediately start trying to study and develop the qualities that will lead our hearts in the direction of peace
We are then sure to meet with results that parallel those of the world
For example status  the paths of streamentry oncereturning nonreturning and arahantship fortune  the gaining of the fruition of streamentry oncereturning nonreturning and arahantship These forms of status and fortune don't deteriorate
They stay with us always
At the same time we'll receive praise and pleasure in full measure inasmuch as Buddhists chant in praise virtually every night and day that The followers of the Blessed One conduct themselves well conduct themselves uprightly conduct themselves for the sake of knowledge conduct themselves masterfully Similarly our pleasure will be solid and lasting steeping and refreshing the heart with the Dhamma not subject to death or decay
This is called niramisa sukha pleasure free from the baits of the world quiet and cool genuine and unchanging the pleasure for which people who practice the Buddha's teachings aspire
Like gold No matter in what land or nation it may fall it remains gold by its very nature and is bound to be desired by people at large
In the same way the mental traits of people who follow the right path in terms of the Dhamma are bound to give rise to genuine pleasure and ease
Even when they die from this world their fortune status good name and pleasure in terms of the Dhamma will not leave them
Thus Buddhists who aim at progress and happiness should study ponder and put into practice  as far as they can  all eight factors of the Noble Path set out here as a guide to practice
There may however be some mistakes in what is written here because I have aimed more at the meaning and practice than at the letter of the scriptures
So wherever there may be mistakes or deficiencies please forgive me
I feel certain though that whoever practices in line with the guidelines given here is sure to meet  to at least some extent  with ease of body and mind in terms both of the world and of the Dhamma in accordance with his or her own practice and conduct
May each and every one of you meet with progress and happiness
All of the Buddha's teachings and their practice can be summed up in a mere eight factors 
Right Resolve thinking in ways that will lead to wellbeing
Right Speech speaking in line with the truth
Right Action being correct and upright in one's activities
Right Livelihood maintaining oneself in ways that are honest and proper
Right Effort exerting oneself in line with all that is good
Right Mindfulness always being mindful of the person or topic that forms one's point of reference
Right Concentration keeping the mind correctly centered in line with the principles of the truth not letting it fall into the ways of Wrong Concentration
Right View Seeing in line with the truth means seeing the four Noble Truths  
B
Samudaya the origin of physical and mental stress ie ignorance and such forms of craving as sensual desire
Right View sees that these are the causes of all stress
Nirodha the ending and disbanding of the causes of stress causing stress to disband as well leaving only the unequaled ease of nibbana
D
Magga the practices that form a path leading to the end of the causes of stress ie ignorance  false knowledge partial and superficial and craving  struggling that goes out of proportion to the way things are
Both of these factors can be abandoned through the power of the Path the practices we need to bring to maturity within ourselves through circumspect discernment
Discernment can be either mundane or transcendent but only through the development of concentration can transcendent discernment or insight arise seeing profoundly into the underlying truth of all things in the world
In short there are two sides to Right View
 and that good knowing properly giving rise to good in our thoughts words and deeds leads to ease of body and mind for ourselves and others
In other words Right View sees that shoddiness is something that good people don't like and that shoddy people don't like it either
This is what is meant by seeing in line with the truth
For this reason people of discernment should always act in ways that are good and true if they are to qualify as having Right View
Right Resolve There are three ways of thinking that will lead to wellbeing 
B
Abyapadasankappa resolving to weaken dismantle and destroy any evil in our thoughts in other words trying to shed from the heart and mind any thoughts of ill will we may have toward people who displease us
Avihinsasankappa resolving not to think in ways that aim at punishing or doing violence to others or in ways that would lead to harm for other people or living beings
No matter how good or evil other people may be we don't give rein to thoughts of envy jealousy or competitiveness
We can shed these things from the heart because they are harmful to us  and when we can do ourselves harm there is nothing to keep us from harming others
In short there are two sides to Right Resolve
 the intention to develop within ourselves whatever will give rise to ease comfort and pleasure for the mind until we reach the point where peace and ease are absolute This is classed as having good will toward ourselves
Only then can we qualify as having Right Resolve
Right Speech Speaking in line with the truth has four forms 
B
Not speaking divisively eg talking about this person to that person so as to give rise to misunderstandings leading to a fallingout between the two
Not speaking harsh or vulgar words casting aspersions on a person's family race or occupation in ways that are considered base by the conventions of the world
D
Not speaking idly ie in ways that are of no benefit to the listener  for instance criticizing or gossiping about the faults of other people in ways that don't serve to remind our listeners to correct their own faults or grumbling ie complaining over and over about something until our listeners can't stand it any longer the way a drunkard grumbles repeatedly without saying anything worthwhile or speaking extravagantly  even if what we say may be good if it goes over our listeners' heads it serves no purpose or babbling ie speaking excessively without any aim Talking at great length without really saying anything serves no purpose at all and fits the phrase A waste of words a waste of breath a waste of time
In short
 Say only things that are true and good that will give knowledge to our listeners or bring them to their senses
Even then though we should have a sense of time place and situation if our words are to qualify as Right Speech
Don't hope to get by on good words and good intentions alone
If what you say isn't right for the situation it can cause harm
Suppose for instance that another person does something wrong
Even though you may mean well if what you say strikes that person the wrong way it can cause harm
There's a story they tell about a monk who was walking across an open field and happened to meet up with a farmer carrying a plow over his shoulder and a hoe in his hand wearing a palmleaf hat and a waistcloth whose ends weren't tucked in
On seeing the monk the farmer raised his hands in respect without first putting himself in order
The monk meaning well wanted to give the farmer a gentle reminder and so said Now that's not the way you pay respect to a monk is it If it isn't the farmer replied then to hell with it As a result the gentle reminder ended up causing harm
Right Action being upright in our activities
With reference to our personal actions this means adhering to the three principles of virtuous conduct 
B
Not stealing concealing embezzling or misappropriating the belongings of other people
Not engaging in immoral or illicit sex with the children or spouses of other people
With reference to our work in general Right Action means this Some of our undertakings are achieved through our physical activity
Before engaging in them we should first evaluate them to see just how beneficial they will be to ourselves and others and to see whether or not they are clean and pure
If we see that they will cause suffering or harm we should refrain from them and choose only those activities that will lead to ease convenience and comfort for ourselves and others
Action here includes every physical action we take sitting standing walking and lying down the use of every part of the body eg grasping or taking with our hands as well as the use of our senses of sight hearing smell taste and feeling
All of this counts as physical activity or action
External action can be divided into five sorts
b
Agriculture putting the land to use eg growing crops running farms and orchards so as to gain wealth and prosperity from what is termed the wealth in the soil
c
Industry extracting and transforming the resources that come from the earth but in their natural state can't give their full measure of ease and convenience and thus need to be transformed eg making rice into flour or sweets turning fruits or tubers into liquid  for instance making orange juice making solids into liquids  eg smelting ore or liquids into solids
All of these activities have to be conducted in honesty and fairness to qualify as Right Action
d
Commerce the buying selling and trading of various objects for the convenience of those who desire them as a way of exchanging ease convenience and comfort with one another  on high and low levels involving high and lowquality goods between people of high low and middling intelligence
This should be conducted in honesty and fairness so that all receive their share of justice and convenience
e
Labor working for hire searching for wealth in line with the level of our abilities whether low middling or high
Our work should be up to the proper standards and worthy  in all honesty and fairness  of the wages we receive
In short Right Action means
 improving the objects with which we deal so that they can become clean and honest too
Clean things  whether many or few  are always good by their very nature
Other people may or may not know but we can't help knowing each and every time
Thus before we engage in any action so as to make it upright and honest we first have to examine and weigh things carefully being thoroughly circumspect in using our judgment and intelligence
Only then can our actions be in line with right moral principles
Right Livelihood
In maintaining ourselves and supporting our families expending our wealth for the various articles we use or consume we must use our earnings  coming from our Right Actions  in ways that are in keeping with moral principles
Only then will they provide safety and security fostering the freedom and peace in our life that will help lead to inner calm
For example there are four ways of using our wealth rightly so as to foster our own livelihood and that of others providing happiness for all 
B
Support expending what wealth we can afford to provide for the ease and comfort of our family and close friends
Aid expending our wealth or our energies for the sake of the common good  for example by helping the government either actively or passively
Actively means donating a sum of money to a branch of the government such as setting up a fund to foster any of its various activities
Passively means being willing to pay our taxes for the sake of the nation not trying to be evasive or uncooperative
Our wealth will then benefit both ourselves and others
D
Offerings This means making gifts of the four necessities of life to support Buddhism
This is a way of paying homage to the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha that will serve the purposes of the religion
At the same time it's a way of earning inner wealth termed ariyadhana A person observing the principles of Right Livelihood who does this will reap benefits both in this life and in the next
The wealth we have rightfully earned though if we don't have a sense of how to use it properly can cause us harm both in this life and in lives to come
Thus in expending our wealth in the area of charity we should do so honestly
In the area of support we should use forethought and care
The same holds true in the areas of aid and offerings
Before making expenditures we should consider the circumstances carefully to see whether or not they're appropriate
If they aren't then we shouldn't provide assistance
Otherwise our wealth may work to our harm
If we provide help to people who don't deserve it  for instance giving assistance to thieves  the returns may be detrimental to our own situation
The same holds true in making offerings to the religion
If a monk has no respect for the monastic discipline doesn't observe the principles of morality neglects his proper duties  the threefold training  and instead behaves in ways that are deluded misguided and deceitful then whoever makes offerings to such a monk will suffer for it in the end as in the saying
Now we may think that a monk's evil is his own business as long as we're doing good
This line of thinking ought to be right but it may turn out to be wrong
Suppose for instance that a group of people is playing cards in defiance of the law
You're not playing with them you're just sitting at the table watching
But if the authorities catch you they're sure to take you along with the group no matter how much you may protest your innocence
In the same way whoever makes offerings without careful forethought may end up reaping harm and such a person can't be classified as maintaining Right Livelihood
In short there are two sides to Right Livelihood
 We should give help to other people as we are able so as to provide them with comfort and wellbeing
This is what it means to maintain Right Livelihood
Right Effort
There are four ways of exerting ourselves in line with the Dhamma 
B
Make a persistent effort to prevent evil from arising and use restraint to put a halt to whatever evil may be in the process of arising  as when greedy desires that go against the principles of fairness appear within you
For instance suppose you have a tenacre plot of land that you haven't utilized fully and yet you go infringing on other people's property This is classed as greedy desire a path to trouble and suffering for yourself and others
Now this doesn't mean that you aren't allowed to eat and live or that you aren't allowed to work and search for wealth
Actually those who have the enterprise to make whatever land or wealth they own bear fruit or even increasing fruit were praised by the Buddha as utthanasampada enterprising industrious people who will gain a full measure of welfare in this lifetime
Greedy desires here mean any desires that go beyond our proper limits and infringe on other people
This sort of desire is bound to cause harm and so is classed as a kind of evil
When such a desire arises in the heart you should use restraint to put a halt to it
This is what is meant by preventing evil from arising
Another example is anger arising from either good or bad intentions that when unfulfilled lead to feelings of irritation and dissatisfaction
Such feelings should be stilled
Don't let them flare up and spread for anger is something you don't like in other people and they don't like it in you
Thus it's classed as a kind of evil
You should exert restraint and keep your mind on a steady and even keel
Your anger won't then have a chance to grow and will gradually fade away
This is what's meant by making a persistent effort to keep evil from taking root and sprouting branches
Or take delusion  knowledge that doesn't fit the truth You shouldn't jump to conclusions
Restrain yourself from making snap judgments so that you can first examine and consider things carefully
For instance sometimes you understand right to be wrong and wrong to be right This is delusion
When right looks wrong to you your thoughts words and deeds are bound to be wrong out of line with the truth and so can cause you to slip into ways that are evil
When wrong looks right to you your thoughts words and deeds are also bound to be wrong and out of line with the truth
Suppose that a black crow looks white to you or an albino buffalo black When people who see the truth meet up with you disputes can result
This is thus a form of evil
Or suppose that you have good intentions but act out of delusion If you happen to do wrong  for example giving food to monks at times when they aren't allowed to eat all because of your own ignorance and delusion  you'll end up causing harm
Therefore you should be careful to observe events and situations searching for knowledge so as to keep your thoughts and opinions in line
Delusion then won't have a chance to arise
This is classed as making an effort to exercise restraint so that evil won't arise
As for whatever evil you've already abandoned don't let it return
Cut off the evil behind you and fend off the evil before you
Evil will thus have a chance to fade away
Make a persistent effort to give rise to the good within yourself
For example 
Silasampada Be a person of mature virtue whose words and deeds are in proper order whose behavior is in line with the principles of honesty leading to purity
These are truly human values that we should foster within ourselves
Cagasampada Be magnanimous and generous in making donations and offerings to others finding reward in the fruits of generosity
For example we may give material objects so as to support the comfort and convenience of others in general The fruits of our generosity are bound to find their way back to us
Or we may be magnanimous in ways that don't involve material objects
For instance when other people mistreat or insult us through thoughtlessness or carelessness we forgive them and don't let our thoughts dwell on their faults and errors
This is called the gift of forgiveness or the gift of justice
It brings the highest rewards
Paññasampada Be a person of mature discernment whose thinking is circumspect and whose sense of reason is in line with the truth
All four of these qualities are classed as forms of goodness
If they haven't yet arisen within you you should give rise to them
They will reward you with wellbeing in body and mind
D
Make a persistent effort to maintain the good in both of its aspects cause and effect
In other words keep up whatever good you have been doing and as for the results  mental comfort ease and lightheartedness  maintain that sense of ease so that it can develop and grow just as a mother hen guards her eggs until they turn into baby chicks with feathers tails sharp beaks and strong wings able to fend for themselves
The results of the good we have done if we care for them well are bound to develop until they take us to higher levels of attainment
For instance when our hearts have had their full measure of mundane happiness so that we develop a sense of enough we're bound to search for other forms of happiness in the area of the Dhamma developing our virtue concentration and discernment to full maturity so as to gain release from all suffering and stress meeting with the peerless ease described in the phrase
When we have done good in full measure and have maintained it well until it's firmly established within us we should then make the effort to use that good with discretion so as to benefit people in general
In short Do what's good maintain what's good and have a sense of how to use what's good  in keeping with time place and situation  so as to give rise to the greatest benefit and happiness
Whoever can do all of this ranks as a person established in Right Effort
Right Mindfulness
There are four foundations of mindfulness or frames of reference for establishing the mind in concentration 
A
Contemplation of the body as a frame of reference Focus mindfulness on the body as your frame of reference
The word body refers to what is produced from the balance of the elements or properties earth  the solid parts such as hair of the head hair of the body nails teeth skin etc water  the liquid parts eg saliva catarrh blood etc fire  warmth eg the fires of digestion wind  eg the breath space  the empty places between the other elements that allow them to come together in proper proportion consciousness  the awareness that permeates and brings together the other elements in a balanced way so that they form a body
There are four ways of looking at the body 
The inner body the meeting place of the six elements  earth water fire wind space and consciousness  the body itself forming the first four
Center your mindfulness in the body considering it from four angles
b
Separate it into its parts
c
Consider how the mingling of the elements leads to such forms of filthiness as saliva mucus blood lymph and pus which permeate throughout the body
d
Consider it as inconstant  it's unstable always changing and deteriorating as stressful  it can't last  no matter what good or evil you may do it changes with every inandout breath and as notself  some of its aspects no matter how you try to prevent them can't help following their own inherent nature
The body viewed from any of these four aspects can serve as a frame of reference
But although our frame of reference may be right if we aren't circumspect and fully aware or if we practice in a misguided way we can come to see wrong as right to the point where our perceptions become skewed
For example if we see an old person a sick person or a dead person we may become so depressed and despondent that we don't want to do any work at all on the level of either the world or the Dhamma and instead want simply to die so as to get away from it all
Or in examining the elements  earth water fire wind space and consciousness  we may come to the conclusion that what's inside is nothing but elements what's outside is nothing but elements and we can't see anything above and beyond this so that our perception of things becomes skewed seeing that there's no man no woman This is what can lead monks to sleep with women and abandon their precepts eating food in the evening and drinking alcohol thinking that it's only elements eating elements so there shouldn't be any harm
Or we may consider the filthy and unattractive aspects of the body until we've reach a point where things seem so foul and disgusting that we can't eat at all and simply want to escape
Some people on reaching this point want to jump off a cliff or into the river to drown
Or we may view things as inconstant stressful and notself but if we act deludedly without being circumspect in our discernment the mind can become a turmoil
If our foundation  our concentration  isn't strong enough for this sort of investigation it can lead to a distressing sense of alienation of being trapped in the body
This is called skewed perception and it can lead to corruptions of insight all because we aren't circumspect and skilled in training the mind
We may feel that we already know but knowledge is no match for experience as in the old saying
So in dealing with this frame of reference if we want our path to be smooth and convenient with no stumps or thorns we should focus on the sensation of the body in and of itself ie on one of the elements as experienced in the body such as the breath
The body in and of itself Focus on a single aspect of the body such as the inandout breath
Don't pay attention to any other aspects of the body
Keep track of just the breath sensations
For example when the breath comes in long and goes out long be aware of it
Focus on being aware at all times of whether your breathing feels easy or difficult
If any part of the body feels uncomfortable adjust your breathing so that all parts of the body feel comfortable with both the inbreath and the out and so that the mind doesn't loosen its hold and run after any outside allusions to past or future which are the sources of the Hindrances
Be intent on looking after the inandout breath adjusting it and letting it spread so as to connect and coordinate with the other aspects of the breath in the body just as the air stream in a Coleman lantern spreads kerosene throughout the threads of the mantle
One of the preliminary signs of the breath will then appear a sense of reliefgiving brightness filling the heart or a lump or ball of white like cottonwool
The body will feel at peace  refreshed and full
The properties of the body will be balanced and won't interfere or conflict with one another
This is termed kayapassaddhi kayaviveka  serenity and solitude of the body
As for awareness it's expanded and broad  mahaggatam cittam  sensitive throughout to every part of the body
Mindfulness is also expanded spreading throughout the body
This is called the great frame of reference enabling you to know how cause and effect operate within the body
You'll see which kinds of breath create which kinds maintain and which kinds destroy
You'll see feelings of breath arising remaining and disbanding liquid feelings arising remaining and disbanding solid feelings arising remaining and disbanding feelings of warmth arising remaining and disbanding feelings of space arising remaining and disbanding you'll see consciousness of these various aspects arising remaining and disbanding
All of this you will know without having to drag in any outside knowledge to smother the awareness that exists on its own by its very nature within you and is always there to tell you the truth
This is termed mindfulness and alertness in full measure
It appears as a result of selftraining and is called paccattam something that exists on its own knows on its own and that each person can know only for him or her self
The body in the mind When the breath is in good order clean and bright and the heart is clear then internal visions may appear from the power of thought
Whatever you may think of you can make appear as an image  near or far subtle or gross giving rise to knowledge or completely lacking in knowledge true or false
If you're circumspect mindful and alert these things can give rise to knowledge and cognitive skill
If you aren't you may fall for the images you see
For example you may think of going somewhere and then see an image of yourself floating in that direction
You center your awareness in the image and float along with your thoughts until you get carried away losing track of where you originally were
This way you get engrossed in traveling through heaven or hell meeting with good things and bad being pleased or upset by what you see
As a result your concentration degenerates because you aren't wise to the nature of the image of the body in the mind
If though you can think to restrain your train of thought and focus on the image as a phenomenon in the present the image will return to join your primary sense of the body
You'll then see that they are equal in nature
Neither is superior to the other
The nature of each is to arise remain and then dissolve
Awareness is simply awareness and sensations are simply sensations
Don't fasten onto either
Let go of them and be neutral
Be thoroughly mindful and alert with each mental moment
This level of sensation if you're adept and knowledgeable can lead to knowledge of previous lives knowledge of where living beings are reborn after death and knowledge that does away with the fermentations of defilement
If you aren't wise to this level of sensation though it can lead to ignorance craving and attachment causing the level of your practice to degenerate
The image or sensation that arises through the power of the mind is sometimes called the rebirth body or the astral body
But even so you shouldn't become attached to it
Only then can you be said to be keeping track of the body as a frame of reference on this level
B
Contemplation of feelings as a frame of reference The mental act of tasting or savoring the objects of the mind  eg taking pleasure or displeasure in them  is termed vedana or feeling
If we class feelings according to flavor there are three 
Dukkhavedana stress and pain for body and mind
Upekkhavedana neutral feelings neither pleasure nor pain
If we class them according to range or source there are four
Inner feelings feelings that arise within the body as when any of the four properties  earth water fire or wind  change either through our present intentions or through the results of past actions giving rise to pleasure pain or neutral feelings
Feelings in and of themselves feelings regarded simply as part of the stream of feelings
For example pleasure pain and neutral feelings occur in different mental moments they don't all arise in the same moment
When one of them arises such as pain focus right on what is present
If pleasure arises keep the mind focused in the pleasure
Don't let it stray to other objects that may be better or worse
Stay with the feeling until you know its truth in other words until you know whether it's physical pleasure or mental pleasure whether it results from past actions or from what you are doing in the present
Only when your mindfulness is focused in this way can you be said to be viewing feelings in and of themselves
Feelings in the mind moods that arise in the mind independent of any object
Simply by thinking we can give rise to pleasure or pain good or bad accomplished entirely through the heart
Each of these four kinds of feelings can serve as an object for tranquillity and insight meditation
Each can serve as a basis for knowledge
Contemplation of the mind as a frame of reference taking as our preoccupation states that arise in the mind
The term mind refers to two conditions  awareness and thinking
Awareness of thinking can cause the mind to take on different states good or bad
If we classify these states by their characteristics there are three good bad and neutral
b
Vitadosacitta the mind when it isn't incited or roused to irritation by its objects
c
Vitamohacitta the mind when it isn't deluded intoxicated or outwitted by its objects
Bad mental states are also of three sorts  
b
Sadosacitta the mind irritated or aroused to anger
c
Samohacitta the mind deluded and ignorant of the truth
Neutral mental states which arise from being neither pleased nor displeased or when mental activity occurs without affecting the condition of awareness for good or bad  are called avyakata indeterminate
If we classify mental states according to their range or source there are three  
Inner mental states thoughts that arise within us with reference to the present either right or wrong good or bad
Mental states in and of themselves mental fashioning  the act of thinking arising from awareness the act of awareness arising from thinking taking such forms as consciousness intellect mindfulness alertness discernment knowledge
Whichever one of these mental states may be arising and remaining in the present moment focus your attention exclusively on it
For example knowledge of a certain sort may appear either on its own or as the result of deliberation it may or may not be intended
Whatever arises focus your mindfulness and alertness on it until you know the stages in the workings of the mind knowing for instance which mental state is the intentional act which the result and which mere activity
Keep focused exclusively on these states until you can see mental states simply as mental states knowledge simply as knowledge intelligence as intelligence
Be thoroughly circumspect mindful and discerning at each mental moment until you are able to let go of all mental states without being caught up on what they are supposed to refer to mean or represent
Only then can you be said to be keeping track of mental states in and of themselves as a frame of reference
D
Contemplation of mental qualities as a frame of reference Mental qualities that can serve as bases for mindfulness leading to peace and respite for the mind are of three kinds  
Byapada illwill stepping into a mood of discontent that arises from certain sorts of individuals or situations that when we brood on them cause the mind to focus on what we find displeasing until it becomes irritated and aroused
Thinamiddha drowsiness torpor dullness giving rise to laziness apathy and discouragement
Uddhaccakukkucca restlessness and anxiety thinking more than we want to or need thoughts that go out of control drifting further and further away until we may even lose sense of our own body
Thinking that has no order or bounds is sure to cause harm
Vicikiccha doubt hesitancy uncertainty about issues dealing with the world or the Dhamma doubt about certain individuals about their teachings about our own conduct and practices
This comes from not having enough mindfulness or alertness to keep the mind in check and from not knowing where the Hindrances come from
We should realize that  to put it briefly  the Hindrances come from concepts that allude to either the past or the future
So when we want to ward them off we should let go of these concepts and focus our attention in on the present and the Hindrances will weaken away
Inner mental qualities The skillful mental qualities we should foster within ourselves are five counting their component factors and four counting their levels in other words  
 Vicara evaluating and adjusting the breath so that it becomes comfortable to the point where it spreads throughout the entire body coordinating and connecting the various breathsensations existing within us
 Piti rapture refreshment fullness of body and mind
 Sukha pleasure ease of body and mind
 Ekaggata The mind enters into a single object such as the breath ie all five of these factors deal with a single topic
The second jhana has three factors
 Sukha The sense of ease for body and mind becomes greater so that it can relieve mental discomfort
This leads the mind to abandon its evaluating and adjusting
 Ekaggata The mind enters into a subtle and gentle level of breath with a feeling of spaciousness and relief throughout the body
This subtle breath bathes and pervades the entire body so that the mind becomes absolutely snug with its one object
The third jhana The singleness of the mind's object becomes even more refined leaving just a feeling of ease of body and mind the result of steadying the mind in a single object
This is called ekaggatasukha  all that remains is singleness and ease
The fourth jhana Upekkha  the breath sensations in the body are still so that we can do without the inandout breath
The still breath fills all the various parts of the body
The four physical properties are all quiet and still
The mind is still having abandoned past and future entering into its object that forms the present
The mind is firmly focused on one object This is ekaggata the second factor of the fourth jhana
Mindfulness and alertness are present in full measure and thus give rise to mental brightness
When mindfulness is strong it turns into cognitive skill when alertness is strong it turns into intuitive insight seeing the truth of physical sensations and mental acts whether near or far gross or subtle our own or those of others
This knowledge appears exclusively within our own body and mind and we can realize it on our own This is what is meant by the word paccattam
Mental qualities in and of themselves
This refers to mental qualities of another level that appear after the above qualities have been developed
Intuitive knowledge arises eg  
anam udapadi intuitive sensitivity thoroughly penetrating
This refers to the three forms of intuitive knowledge beginning with the ability to remember previous lives
Pañña udapadi Liberating discernment arises
Vijja udapadi Cognitive skill  clear open penetrating and true  arises within one
These forms of knowledge arise on their own  not for ordinary people but for those who have developed concentration
Discernment here refers to the discernment that comes from mental training and development not to the ordinary discernment coming from concepts we've remembered or thought out
This is discernment that arises right at the heart
Cognitive skill here is a high level of knowledge termed pariññaya dhamma thorough comprehension that arises within from having explored the four Noble Truths beginning with stress which is the result of such causes as ignorance and craving
Knowledge arises enabling us to cut the tap root of stress by performing the task of abandoning the cause
When this is done stress disbands and ceases the cause doesn't flare up again This is nirodha
And the knowledge that steps in to eliminate the cause of stress is the Path the way leading to release from all stress and suffering made possible by the eye of the mind composed of  
This is the eye of the mind
In short we have dukkha physical and mental stress and samudaya the cause of stress
These two are one pair of cause and effect functioning in the world
Another pair is nirodha the disbanding and cessation of all stress and maggacitta the mind following the right path causing the causes of stress  ignorance and craving  to disband
In other words when the physical and mental stress from which we suffer is ended through the power of the mind on the Path the mind is freed from all disruptions and fermentations and doesn't latch onto cause or effect pleasure or pain good or evil the world or the Dhamma
It abandons all supposings assumptions wordings and conventions
This is deathlessness a quality that doesn't arise doesn't change doesn't vanish or disband and that doesn't fasten onto any quality at all
In other words it can let go of conditioned phenomena and doesn't fasten onto unconditioned phenomena
It lets go of each phenomenon in line with that phenomenon's own true nature
Thus the saying Sabbe dhamma anatta  No phenomenon is the self the self isn't any phenomenon
All supposings and assumptions  all meanings  are abandoned
This is nibbana
All of this is called seeing mental qualities in and of themselves  ie seeing the higher aspect of mental qualities that arises from their more common side
Right Concentration the way to discernment knowledge and release If we class concentration according to how it's practiced in general there are two sorts right and wrong
A
Wrong Concentration Why is it called wrong
Because it doesn't give rise to the liberating insight that leads to the transcendent qualities
For example after attaining a certain amount of concentration we may use it in the wrong way as in magic  hypnotizing other people or spirits of the dead so as to have them in our power or exerting magnetic attraction so as to seduce or dupe other people  all of which causes the heart to become deceitful and dishonest
Or we may use concentration to cast spells and practice sorcery displaying powers in hopes of material reward
All of these things are based on nothing more than momentary concentration
Another type of Wrong Concentration is that used to develop forms of knowledge falling outside of the Buddha's teachings and belonging to yogic doctrines and practices for example staring at an external object  such as the sun or the moon  or at certain kinds of internal objects
When the mind becomes steady for a moment you lose your sense of the body and become fastened on the object to the point where your mindfulness and alertness lose their moorings
You then drift along in the wake of the object in whatever direction your thoughts may take you up to see heaven or down to see hell seeing true things and false mixed together liking or disliking what you see losing your bearings lacking the mindfulness and alertness that form the present
Another instance of Wrong Concentration is when  after you've begun practicing to the point where you've attained threshold concentration  you then stare down on the present focusing say on the properties of breath fire or earth forbidding the mind to think staring down getting into a trance until the property becomes more and more refined the mind becomes more and more refined using force to suppress the mind until awareness becomes so dim that you lose mindfulness and alertness and all sense of the body and mind Everything is absolutely snuffed out and still with no selfawareness
This is called the plane of nonperception where you have no perception of anything at all
Your awareness isn't wellrounded your mindfulness lacks circumspection and as a result discernment has no chance to arise
This is called Wrong Concentration Wrong Release a mental blank  no awareness of past present or future
Another instance of Wrong Concentration is when we can give rise to momentary concentration threshold concentration all the way to the four levels of jhana but aren't adept at entering and leaving these levels so that we focus in until only the property of consciousness is left with no sense of the body This is called arupa jhana
Bodily processes disappear leaving only the four types of mental acts which form the four levels of arupa jhana the first being when we focus on a feeling of space or emptiness
The mind attains such a relaxed sense of pleasure that we may take it to be a transcendent state or nibbana and so we search no further becoming idle and lazy making no further effort because we assume that we've finished our task
In short we simply think or focus without having any finesse in what we're doing  entering leaving or staying in place  and as a result our concentration becomes wrong
B
Right Concentration This starts with threshold concentration which acts as the basis for the four levels of jhana beginning with the first vitakka thinking of whichever aspect of the body you choose to take as your object such as the four physical properties starting with the inandout breath
And then vicara adjusting expanding letting the breath sensations flow throughout the body and at the same time evaluating the results you obtain
For instance if the body feels uncomfortable or constricted adjust the breath until it feels right throughout the body
The mind then sticks to its single object This is termed ekaggata
When mindfulness enters into the body keeping the breath in mind and alertness is present in full measure keeping track of the causes that produce results congenial to body and mind then your sense of the body will benefit
Bathed with mindfulness and alertness it feels light malleable and full  saturated with the power of mindfulness and alertness
The mind also feels full This is termed piti
When both body and mind are full they grow quiet like a child who having eaten his fill rests quiet and content
This is the cause of pleasure on the level of the Dhamma termed sukha
These factors taken together form one stage of Right Concentration
As you continue practicing for a length of time the sense of fullness and pleasure in the body becomes greater
Ekaggata  interest and absorption in your one object  becomes more intense because you have seen the results it produces
The mind becomes steady and determined focused with full mindfulness and alertness thoroughly aware of both body and mind and thus you can let go of your thinking and evaluating and enter the second jhana
The second jhana has three factors
Ekaggata Keep the mind with its one object the breath which is now more subtle and refined than before leaving simply a feeling of piti fullness of body and mind
The sensations of the body don't clash with one another
The four properties  earth water fire and wind  are properly balanced
The mind and body don't interfere with each other so both feel full and satisfied
The body feels pleasant  solitary and quiet
The mind too feels pleasant and at ease  solitary and quiet
When you're mindful alert and adept at doing this  entering staying in place and withdrawing  sidebenefits will result
For example knowledge of certain matters will arise either on its own or after you've posed a question in the mind
Doubts about certain issues will be put to rest
As the sense of bodily pleasure grows stronger the sense of mental pleasure and ease grows stronger as well and thus you can let go of the sense of fullness
Awareness at this point becomes refined and so can detect a subtle level of the breath that feels bright open soothing and spacious
This enables you to go on to the third jhana
The third jhana has two factors pleasure and singleness of preoccupation
The pleasure you've been experiencing begins to waver in flashes as it reaches saturation point and begins to change
You thus become aware of another subtler level of sensation and so the mind shifts to a sense of openness and emptiness
The breath grows still with no moving in or out full in every part of the body
This allows you to let go of the sense of pleasure
The mind enters this stage through the power of mindfulness and alertness
Awareness is tranquil and still bright in the present steady and on its own
It lets go of the breath and is simply observant
The mind is still with no shifting back and forth
Both breath and mind are independent
The mind can let down its burdens and cares
The heart is solitary and one infused with mindfulness and alertness
When you reach this stage and stay with it properly you're practicing the fourth jhana
The fourth jhana has two factors
Ekaggata Your object becomes absolutely one
Upekkha You can let go of all thoughts of past and future the five Hindrances are completely cut away
The mind is solitary clear and radiant
The six properties  earth water fire wind space and consciousness  become radiant
The heart feels spacious and clear thoroughly aware all around through the power of mindfulness and alertness
As mindfulness becomes tempered and strong it turns into intuitive knowledge enabling you to see the true nature of body and mind sensations and mental acts past present and future
When this happens if you aren't skilled you can become excited or upset
In other words you may develop pubbenivasanussatiñana the ability to remember previous lives
If what you see is good you may get engrossed which will cause your mindfulness and alertness to weaken
If what you see is bad or displeasing you may get upset or distressed so intent on what you remember that your sense of the present is weakened
Or you may develop cutupapatañana The mind focuses on the affairs of other individuals and you see them as they die and are reborn on differing levels
If you get carried away with what you see your reference to the present will weaken
If you find this happening you should take the mind in hand
If anything pleasing arises hold back and keep mindfulness firm
Don't let yourself fall into kamasukhallikanuyoga contentment and delight
If anything bad or displeasing arises hold back  because it can lead to attakilamathanuyoga discontentment and distress
Draw the mind into the present and guard against all thoughts of approval and disapproval
Keep the mind neutral
This is the middle way the mental attitude that forms the Path and gives rise to another level of awareness in which you realize for instance how inconstant it is to be a living being When things go well you're happy and pleased when things go badly you're pained and upset
This awareness enables you truly to know the physical sensations and mental acts you're experiencing and leads to a sense of disenchantment termed nibbidañana
You see all fashionings as inconstant harmful stressful and hard to bear as lying beyond the control of the heart
At this point the mind disentangles itself This is termed viragadhamma dispassion
It feels no desire or attraction it doesn't gulp down or lie fermenting in sensations or mental acts past present or future
It develops a special level of intuition that comes from within
What you never before knew now you know what you never before met with now you see through the power of mindfulness and alertness gathering in at a single point and turning into asavakkhayañana enabling you to disentangle and free yourself from mundane states of mind  in proportion to the extent of your practice  and so attain the transcendent qualities beginning with streamentry
All of this is termed Right Concentration being skilled at entering staying in place and withdrawing giving rise to 
Right View correct views in line with the truth
Right Practice in which you conduct yourself with full circumspection in all aspects of the triple training with virtue concentration and discernment coming together in the heart
This then is Right Concentration
For the most part people who have attained true insight have done so in the four levels of jhana
Although there may be others who have gone wrong in the practice of jhana we'll achieve the proper results if we study so as to gain an understanding and adjust our practice so as to bring it into line
This ends the discussion of Right Concentration
All that we have discussed so far can be summarized under three headings Right View and Right Resolve come under the heading of discernment Right Speech Right Action and Right Livelihood under the heading of virtue and Right Effort Right Mindfulness and Right Concentration under the heading of concentration
So altogether we have virtue concentration and discernment
There are three levels of virtue 
Observance of these precepts or rules  dealing merely with words and deeds  forms the lower or preliminary level of virtue which is what makes us into fullfledged human beings
Majjhimasila the medium level of virtue ie keeping watch over your words and deeds so that they cause no harm and in addition keeping watch over your thoughts so as to keep our mental kamma upright in three ways 
b
Abyapada abandoning thoughts of ill will hatred and vengeance and developing thoughts of good will instead thinking of the good aspects of the people who have angered us
When people make us angry it comes from the fact that our dealings with them  in which we associate with and assist one another  sometimes lead to disappointment
This gives rise to dislike and irritation which in turn cause us to brood so that we develop hurt feelings that grow into anger and thoughts of retaliation
Thus we should regard such people from many angles for ordinarily as human beings they should have some good to them
If they don't act well toward us they may at least speak well to us
Or if they don't act or speak well to us perhaps their thoughts may be wellmeaning to at least some extent
Thus when you find your thoughts heading in the direction of anger or dislike you should sit down and think in two ways 
Anger is something worthless like the scum floating on the surface of a lake
If we're stupid we won't get to drink the clean water that lies underneath or if we drink the scum we may catch a disease
A person who is bad to you is like someone sunk in filth
If you're stupid enough to hate or be angry with such people it's as if you wanted to go sit in the filth with them
Is that what you want
Think about this until any thoughts of ill will and anger disappear
c
Sammaditthi abandoning wrong views and mental darkness
If our minds lack the proper training and education we may come to think that we and all other living beings are born simply as accidents of nature that father and mother have no special meaning that good and evil don't exist
Such views deviate from the truth and can dissuade us from restraining the evil that lies within us and from searching for and fostering the good
To believe that there's no good or evil that death is annihilation is Wrong View  a product of shortsighted thinking and poor discernment seeing things for what they aren't
So we should abandon such views and educate ourselves searching for knowledge of the Dhamma and associating with people wiser than we so that they can show us the bright path
We'll then be able to reform our views and make them Right which is one form of mental uprightness
Virtue on this level when we can maintain it well will qualify us to be heavenly beings
The qualities of heavenly beings which grow out of human values will turn us into human beings who are divine in our virtues for to guard our thoughts words and deeds means that we qualify for heaven in this lifetime
This is one aspect of the merit developed by a person who observes the middle level of virtue
Uparimasila higher virtue where virtue merges with the Dhamma in the area of mental activity
There are two sides to higher virtue  
Ill will lies at the essence of killing for it causes us to destroy our own goodness and that of others  and when our minds can kill off our own goodness what's to keep us from killing other people and animals as well
Restlessness lies at the essence of taking what isn't given
The mind wanders about taking hold of matters concerning other people sometimes their good points sometimes their bad
To fasten onto their good points isn't too serious for it can give us at least some nourishment
As long as we're going to steal other people's business and make it our own we might as well take their silver and gold
Their bad points though are like trash they've thrown away  scraps and bones with nothing of any substance  and yet even so we let the mind feed on them
To know that other people are possessive of their bad points and guard them well and yet still to take hold of these things to think about should be classed as a form of taking what isn't given
Sensual desires lie at the essence of sensual misconduct
The mind feels an attraction for sensual objects  thoughts of past or future sights sounds smells tastes or tactile sensations  or for sensual defilements  passion aversion or delusion  to the point where we forget ourselves
Mental states such as these can be said to overstep the bounds of propriety in sensual matters
Doubt lies at the essence of lying
In other words our minds are unsure with nothing reliable or true to them
We have no firm principles and so drift along under the influence of all kinds of thoughts and preoccupations
Drowsiness is intoxication  discouragement dullness forgetfulness with no mindfulness or restraint watching over the mind
This is what it means to be drugged or drunk
All of these unskillful qualities are things we should eliminate by training the heart along the lines of
b
Bhavanakicca qualities to be developed 
Vicara Evaluate and be observant
Be sensitive to whether or not you've received a sense of comfort and relaxation from your in and outbreathing
If not tend to the breath and adjust it in a variety of ways eg in long and out long in long and out short in short and out short in short and out long in slow and out slow in fast and out fast in gently and out gently in strong and out strong in throughout the body and out throughout the body
Adjust the breath until it gives good results to both body and mind and you'll be able to kill off feelings of ill will and hatred
Piti When you get good results  for instance when the subtle breath sensations in the body merge and flow together permeating the entire sense of the body  the breath is like an electric wire the various parts of the body such as the bones are like electricity poles mindfulness and alertness are like a power source and awareness is thus bright and radiant
Both body and mind feel satisfied and full
This is piti or rapture which can kill off feelings of drowsiness
Sukha Now that feelings of restlessness and anxiety have disappeared a sense of pleasure and ease for body and mind arises
This pleasure is what kills off restlessness
Ekaggata Doubts and uncertainty fade into the distance
The mind reaches oneness of object in a state of normalcy and equilibrium
This normalcy of mind which is maintained through the power of the discipline of mindfulness forms the essence of virtue firmness steadiness stability
And the resulting flavor or nourishment of virtue is tranquillity lightheartedness and a sense of independence for the mind
When freedom of this sort arises within us this is called the development of silanussati the mindfulness of virtue
This is virtue that attains excellence  leading to the paths their fruitions and nibbana  and thus can be called uparimasila higher virtue
To summarize there are three levels of virtue external intermediate and internal
In ultimate terms however there are two  
Transcendent virtue virtue that's constant and sure going straight to the heart bathing the heart with its nourishment
This arises from the practice of tranquillity meditation and insight meditation
Tranquillity meditation forms the cause and insight meditation the result discovering the true nature of the elements aggregates and senses seeing clearly the four Noble Truths in proportion to our practice of the Path abandoning the first three of the Fetters 
b
Vicikiccha doubt concerning what's genuine and true and what's counterfeit and false
The power of Right View allows us to see that the quality to which we awaken exists at all times and that the true qualities enabling us to awaken also exist and are made effective through the power of the practices we're following
Our knowledge is definite and true
Our doubts concerning the virtues of the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha are cleared up for good
This is called becoming a niyatapuggala a person who is certain and sure
c
Silabbataparamasa When the heart abandons this Fetter it no longer fondles theories concerning moral virtue it's no longer stuck merely on the level of manners and activities
Good and evil are accomplished through the heart activities and actions are something separate
Even though people who reach this level do good  taking the precepts making gifts and offerings or meditating in line with the good customs of the world  they're not caught up on any of these things because their hearts have reached the nourishment of virtue
They aren't stuck on the particulars ie their actions and activities nor are they stuck on the purpose ie the meaning or intent of their various good manners
Their hearts dwell in the nourishment of virtue tranquillity stability normalcy of mind
Just as a person who has felt the nourishment that comes from food permeating his body isn't stuck on either the food or its flavor  because he's received the benefits of the nourishment it provides  in the same way the hearts of people who have reached the essence of virtue are no longer stuck on manners or activities particulars or purposes because they've tasted virtue's nourishment
This is thus classed as transcendent virtue the first stage of nibbana
Even though such people may be destined for further rebirth they're special people apart from the ordinary
Any person whose practice reaches this level can be counted as fortunate as having received dependable wealth like ingots of gold
Just as gold can be used as currency all over the world because it has special value for all human beings  unlike paper currency whose use is limited to specific countries  in the same way a heart that's truly attained virtue has a value in this life that will remain constant in lives to come
Thus a person who has reached this level has received part of the Noble Wealth of those who practice the religion
Concentration has three levels 
Kamavacarakhanikasamadhi The mind keeps thinking coming to rest and running along after skillful preoccupations  either internal or external  on the sensory level sights sounds smells flavors tactile sensations or ideas
An example of this is when the mind becomes quiet and rested for a moment as we sit chanting or listening to a sermon
In other words the mind grows still for momentary periods in the same way that a person walks One foot takes a step while the other foot rests on the ground providing the energy needed to reach one's goal
This is thus called momentary concentration something possessed by people all over the world
Whether or not we practice concentration the mind is always behaving this way by its very nature
This is what is called the bhavangacitta or bhavangapada The mind stops for a moment and then moves on
In developing higher levels of concentration we have to start out with this ordinary level as our basis
Otherwise the higher levels probably wouldn't be possible
Still this level of concentration can't be used as a basis for discernment which is why we have to go further in our practice
Rupavacaraupacarasamadhi This refers to the first jhana in which the mind comes inward to rest on a single preoccupation within the body fixing its attention for example on the inandout breath
When the mind stays with its one object this is called ekaggata
At the same time there's mindfulness keeping the breath in mind This is called vitakka
The mind then adjusts and expands the various aspects of the breath throughout the entire body evaluating them mindfully with complete circumspection This is called alertness or vicara which is what is aware of causes and results
Mindfulness the cause is what does the work
Thus vitakka and vicara cooperate in focusing on the same topic
We are then aware of the results as they arise  feelings of fullness pleasure and ease for body and mind
At this point the mind lets down its burdens and concerns to rest for a while like a person walking along who meets with something pleasing and attractive and so stops to look Both feet are standing still stepping neither forward nor back
If we aren't skilled enough to go on any further we'll then retreat
If we see results  such as signs and visions  arising in the mind we may get excited and so cause our original preoccupation to waver or fade
Like a person sitting on a chair If he sees something appealing in front of him he may become so interested that he leans forward and reaches out his hand he may even begin to budge a bit from his seat or stand up completely
In the same way if we get engrossed in visions thoughts or views while we're engaged in threshold concentration we can become excited and pleased  we may even think that we've reached the transcendent  and this can cause our concentration to degenerate
If we try to do it again and can't we may then seize the opportunity to say that we've gone beyond the practice of concentration so that we can now take the way of discernment  thinking pondering and letting go in line with nothing more than our own views and ideas
This though is not likely to succeed because our knowledge has no firm basis or core like a wheel with no axle or hub How can it get anywhere
The power of threshold concentration if we don't watch after it well is bound to deteriorate and we'll be left with nothing but old leftover concepts
Rupavacaraappanasamadhi This refers to the practice of all four levels of rupa jhana
The first jhana has five factors directed thought evaluation fullness pleasure and singleness of preoccupation
The second level has three fullness pleasure and singleness of preoccupation
The third has two pleasure and singleness of preoccupation and the fourth has two equanimity and singleness of preoccupation
Fixed penetration in the realm of form means that the mind focuses on the internal sense of the body remaining steadily with a single object  such as the inandout breath  until it reaches jhana beginning with the first level which is composed of directed thought evaluation fullness pleasure and singleness of preoccupation
When you see results arising focus in on those results and they will then turn into the second level which has three factors fullness pleasure and singleness of preoccupation
As your focus becomes stronger it causes the sense of fullness to waver so you can now let go of that sense of fullness and your concentration turns into the third jhana in which only two factors are left pleasure and singleness of preoccupation
The mind has few burdens its focus is strong and the sense of inner light is radiant
This causes the feeling of pleasure to waver so that you can let go of that sense of pleasure and the mind attains oneness in a very subtle preoccupation
The preoccupation doesn't waver and neither does the mind
It stands firm in its freedom
This is called equanimity and singleness of preoccupation which form the fourth jhana
Mindfulness is powerful alertness complete
Both are centered on a single preoccupation without getting snagged on any other allusions or perceptions
This mental state is called the fourth jhana which has two factors Equanimity is the external attitude of the mind as for the real factors they're mindfulness and singleness steady and firm
The mind experiences a sense of brightness the radiance that arises from its state of fixed penetration
Mindfulness and alertness are circumspect and allround and so give rise to skill and proficiency in practicing jhana  in focusing staying in place stepping through the various levels withdrawing going back and forth
When the mind behaves as you want it to no matter when you practice only then does this truly qualify as fixed penetration the basis for the arising of three qualities intuitive knowledge discernment and cognitive skill
Intuitive knowledge here refers to knowledge or sensitivity of a deep and extraordinary sort
For example 
Cutupapatañana the ability to focus on the death and rebirth of other living beings  sometimes in good destinations sometimes in bad  together with the causes that lead them to be reborn in such ways
This gives rise to a sense of weariness and disenchantment with sensations and mental acts body and mind
Asavakkhayañana knowing how to put an end to the defilements of the heart in accordance with the knowledge  the clear vision of the four Noble Truths  that accompanies the particular transcendent path reached
And there are still other forms of extraordinary knowledge such as iddhividhi the ability to display supernormal powers to make an image of oneself appear to other people dibbasota clairaudience dibbacakkhu clairvoyance  ie the ability to see objects at tremendous distances
Discernment refers to discriminating knowledge clear comprehension knowledge in line with the truth
For example  
Dhammapatisambhida acumen with regard to mental qualities knowing how to explain deep and subtle points so that other people will understand
Niruttipatisambhida acumen with regard to different languages
According to the texts this includes knowing foreign languages and the languages of various other living beings by means of the eye of discernment
Patibhanapatisambhida acumen with regard to expression being fluent in making explanations and quickwitted in debate knowing the most strategic way to express things
All of these forms of discernment can arise from training the mind to attain fixed penetration
Vijja  clear open knowledge free from any further concealments and aloka  brilliance radiance streaming out in all directions  enable us to see the true nature of sensations and mental acts in accordance with our powers of intuitive discernment
Cognitive skill refers to clear uncanny knowledge that arises from the mind's being firmly fixed in jhana
There are eight sorts 
Manomayiddhi psychic powers influencing events through the power of thought
Iddhividhi the ability to display powers making one's body appear in a variety of ways
Dibbacakkhu clairvoyance
Dibbasota clairaudience
Cetopariyañana the ability to know the mental states of other people
Pubbenivasanussatiñana the ability to remember previous lives
Asavakkhayañana the ability to put an end to the fermentations that defile the heart
Thus jhana on the level of fixed penetration is extremely important
It can give us support on all sides  on the level of the world and of the Dhamma  and can bring success in our various activities both in our worldly affairs and in our Dhamma duties leading us on to the transcendent
To summarize there are two kinds of concentration
That which helps us to fulfill our duties on the level of the Dhamma leading to vipassanañana or asavakkhayañana the knowledge that enables us  in accordance with the discernment and cognitive skills that arise  to abandon or cut off completely the mental currents that tend in the direction of the Fetters This is termed transcendent concentration
Discernment is of three kinds 
Cintamayapañña discernment that comes from reflecting
Bhavanamayapañña discernment that comes from developing the mind
Sutamayapañña is the discernment that comes from having listened a great deal like the Venerable Ananda
Listening here though includes studying and taking interest in a variety of ways paying attention taking notes asking questions and taking part in discussions so as to become quickwitted and astute
Education of all kinds comes down to two sorts learning the basic units such as the letters of the alphabet their sound and pronunciation so as to understand their accepted usage and learning how to put them together  for instance how to combine the letters so as to give rise to words and meanings  as when we complete our elementary education so that we won't be at a loss when we're called on to read and write in the course of making a living
In the area of the religion we have to study the letters of the Pali alphabet their combinations their meanings and pronunciation
If we don't understand clearly we should take an interest in asking questions
If we have trouble memorizing we should jot down notes as a way of aiding our memory and expanding our concepts
In addition we have to study by means of our senses
For example when we see a visual object we should find out its truth
When we hear sounds or words we should find out their truth
When we smell an aroma we should consider it to see what it comes from
We should take an interest in flavors so that we know what they come from and in tactile sensations  the heat and cold that touch the body  by studying such things as the way weather behaves
All of these forms of education are ways of giving rise to astuteness  both in the area of the world and in the area of the Dhamma  because they constitute a basic level of knowledge like the primary education offered in schools
Cintamayapañña refers to thinking and evaluating so as to learn the meaning and truth of one's beginning education
This level of education draws out the meaning of the knowledge we have gained through studying
When we gain information we should reflect on it until we understand it so that we will be led by our sense of reason and not by gullibility or ignorance
This is like a person who has used his knowledge of the alphabet to gain knowledge from books to complete his secondary education
Such a person has reached the level where he can think things through clearly
In the area of the Dhamma the same holds true
Once we have learned the basics we should research and think through the content of the Teaching until we give rise to an understanding so that we can conduct ourselves correctly in line with the methods and aims taught by the sages of the past
This level of discernment is what prepares us to conduct ourselves properly in line with the truths of the Doctrine and Discipline
This is classed as an aspect of pariyatti dhamma Dhamma on the level of theory
By learning the language and meaning of the Teaching we can become astute as far as theory is concerned but if we don't use that knowledge to train ourselves it's as if we studied a profession  such as law  but then went out to become bandits so that our knowledge wouldn't give its proper results
For this reason we've been taught still another method which is the wellspring of discernment or mastery  ie the mental activity termed bhavanamayapañña
Bhavanamayapañña discernment that arises exclusively from training the mind in concentration
In other words this level of discernment isn't related to the old observations we've gained from the past because our old observations are bound to obscure the new observations imbued with the truth that can arise only right at the mind
When you engage in this form of practice focus exclusively on the present taking note of a single thing not getting involved with past or future
Steady the mind bringing it into the present
Gather virtue concentration and discernment all into the present
Think of your meditation object and bring your powers of evaluation to bear on it  say by immersing mindfulness in the body focusing on such objects as the inandout breath
When you do this knowledge will arise
anam udapadi Intuitive knowledge of things we have never before studied or known will appear
For example pubbenivasanussatiñana  the ability to remember our present life and past lives cutupapatañana  the ability to know living beings as they die and are reborn  well or poorly happily or miserably  knowing the causes and results of how they fare asavakkhayañana  the ability to cleanse ourselves of the fermentations that defile the mind thinning them out or eliminating them altogether as we are able
These three forms of knowledge don't arise for people who simply study or think things through in ordinary ways
They form a mental skill that arises from the practice of concentration and are an aspect of Dhamma on the level of practice
Another aspect  pañña udapadi Clear discernment of the true nature of the elements aggregates and senses arises
We can focus on these things by way of the mind and know them in terms of the four Noble Truths stress which arises from a cause ie ignorance and craving and then nirodha the ceasing and disbanding of stress which occurs as the result of a cause ie the Path composed of practices for the mind
These things can be known by means of the discernment that arises exclusively and directly within us and is termed the eye of discernment or the eye of Dhamma the eye of the mind awakening from its slumbers
Vijja udapadi The eight forms of cognitive skill which follow the laws of cause and effect  means of practice that bring us results  can arise in a quiet mind
Aloko udapadi Brightness clarity relief and emptiness arise in such a mind
Thus the discernment that results from developing the mind differs from the beginning stages of discernment that come from studying and reflecting
Study and reflection are classed as Dhamma on the level of theory and can give only a preliminary level of knowledge
They're like a person who has awakened but has yet to open his eyes
The discernment that comes from developing the mind though is like waking up and seeing the truth  past present and future  in all four directions
We can clearly see stress its cause its disbanding and the Path to its disbanding and so can absolutely abandon the first set of Fetters
Our hearts will then flow to nibbana just as the water in a mountain cataract is sure to flow to the sea
They will flow to their natural truth the mental fullness and completeness of a person who has practiced mental development until discernment arises within
We will meet with a special form of skill  transcendent skill  whose power will stay with us always a quality that's certain and sure termed certain truth certain wisdom making us people certain for nibbana
So this level of discernment  termed the discernment of liberating insight  is especially important
It arises on its own not from cogitating along the lines of old concepts we've learned but from abandoning them
Old concepts are what obscure the new knowledge that's ready to arise
The nature of liberating insight is like an electric light Simply press the switch once and things all around are made bright
In the same way when the mind reaches a stage of readiness insight will arise in a single mental instant and everything will become clear elements aggregates and the sense media
We'll know on the one hand what's inconstant stressful and notself and on the other hand what's uncommon ie niccam  what's constant and true sukham  true happiness termed niramisasukha and atta  the self
The eye of the mind can know both sides and let go both ways
It's attached neither to what's inconstant stressful and notself nor to what's constant good and right
It can let these things go in line with their true nature
The knowledge that comes from discernment cognitive skill and intuitive insight it can let go as well
It isn't attached to views  for there's yet another separate sort of reality that has no this or that In other words it doesn't have the view or conceit I am It lets go of the assumptions that That's the self That's notself That's constant That's inconstant That arises That doesn't arise It can let go of these things completely
That's the Dhamma and yet it doesn't hold onto the Dhamma which is why we say that the Dhamma is notself
It also doesn't hold on to the view that says notself It lets go of views causes and effects and isn't attached to anything at all dealing with wordings or meanings conventions or practices
This then is discernment that arises from the development of the mind
To summarize The discernment that comes from studying and reflecting is classed as Dhamma on the level of theory
The discernment that comes from developing the mind is classed as Dhamma on the level of practice
The results that arise are two 
Transcendent discernment awareness that goes beyond the ordinary giving rise to clear realization within
People who reach this level are said to have awakened and opened their eyes which is what is meant by Buddho
To summarize everything there are three main points 
Concentration which in terms of where its principles are found is the Suttanta Pitaka
Discernment which in terms of where its principles are found is the Abhidhamma Pitaka
Expressed in terms of their meaning they refer to three modes of behavior to be developed  
Concentration steadying the mind in a single preoccupation not latching onto thoughts of the past or future holding fast to the present
Concentration is a means of killing off bhavatanha ie mental states that stray off into thoughts of past and future
The act of straying is craving for becoming looking for a new place to take birth
This is what is meant by sambhavesin When concentration arises the mind can let go of such craving
Discernment circumspect knowledge that guards over the mind to keep it from being influenced involved and attached
Discernment is what enables us to abandon vibhavatanha in that the characteristic of this form of craving is the wavering that occurs in the mental moment arising in the present
This we can perceive through intuitive discernment
Discernment knows stress intuitive knowledge cuts the root of stress cognitive skill  clear knowledge of past future and present  distinguishes cause result and release without being attached This is what's meant by the skill of release
And that is the heart of the Buddha's teachings
On the level of the human body diseases are explained as resulting from the aggravation or imbalance of any of these four physical properties
Diseases are classified by how they feel Fevers are attributed to the fire property dizziness and faintness to the wind property constipation to the earth property etc
Wellbeing is defined as a state in which none of these properties is dominant
All are quiet unaroused balanced and still
There are a number of lists of dhatus given in the Pali canon
The six dhatus are the four physical properties plus space and cognizance
The dhatus are the six senses their respective objects and the acts of consciousness associated with each
If this translation is in any way inaccurate or misleading I ask forgiveness of the author and reader for having unwittingly stood in their way
As for whatever may be accurate  conducive to the aims intended by the author  I hope the reader will make the best use of it translating it a few steps further into the heart so as to attain those aims
 The translator
Ajaan Fuang my teacher once discovered that a snake had moved into his room
Every time he entered the room he saw it slip into a narrow space behind a storage cabinet
And even though he tried leaving the door to the room open during the daytime the snake wasn't willing to leave
So for three days they lived together
He was very careful not to startle the snake or make it feel threatened by his presence
But finally on the evening of the third day as he was sitting in meditation he addressed the snake quietly in his mind
He said Look it's not that I don't like you
I don't have any bad feelings for you
But our minds work in different ways
It'd be very easy for there to be a misunderstanding between us
Now there are lots of places out in the woods where you can live without the uneasiness of living with me And as he sat there spreading thoughts of metta to the snake the snake left
When Ajaan Fuang first told me this story it made me stop and reconsider my understanding of what metta is
Metta is a wish for happiness  true happiness  and the Buddha says to develop this wish for ourselves and everyone else With metta for the entire cosmos cultivate a limitless heart But what's the emotional quality that goes along with that wish
Many people define it as lovingkindness implying a desire to be there for other people to cherish them to provide them with intimacy nurture and protection
The idea of feeling love for everyone sounds very noble and emotionally satisfying
But when you really stop to think about all the beings in the cosmos there are a lot of them who  like the snake  would react to your lovingkindness with suspicion and fear
Rather than wanting your love they would rather be left alone
Others might try to take unfair advantage of your lovingkindness reading it as a sign either of your weakness or of your endorsement of whatever they want to do
In none of these cases would your lovingkindness lead to anyone's true happiness
When this is the case you're left wondering if the Buddha's instructions on universal metta are really realistic or wise
But as I learned from Ajaan Fuang's encounter with the snake metta is not necessarily an attitude of lovingkindness
It's more an attitude of goodwill  wishing the other person well but realizing that true happiness is something that each of us ultimately will have to find for him or herself and sometimes most easily when we go our separate ways
This understanding of metta is borne out in the Pali Canon first of all in the word itself
The Pali language has another word for love  pema  whereas metta is related to the word mitta or friend
Universal metta is friendliness for all
The fact that this friendliness equates with goodwill is shown in the four passages in the Canon where the Buddha recommends phrases to hold in mind when developing thoughts of metta
These phrases provide his clearest guide not only to the emotional quality that underlies metta but also to the understanding of happiness that explains why it's wise and realistic to develop metta for all
The first set of phrases comes in a passage where the Buddha recommends thoughts to counter ill will
These phrases are chanted daily in Theravada communities the world over
Notice that last statement May they look after themselves with ease You're not saying that you're going to be there for all beings all the time
And most beings would be happier knowing that they could depend on themselves rather than having to depend on you
I once heard a Dharma teacher say that he wouldn't want to live in a world where there was no suffering because then he wouldn't be able to express his compassion  which when you think about it is an extremely selfish wish
He needs other people to suffer so he can feel good about expressing his compassion
A better attitude would be May all beings be happy
May they be able to look after themselves with ease That way they can have the happiness of independence and selfreliance
Another set of metta phrases is in the Karaniya Metta Sutta
They start out with a simple wish for happiness
But then they continue with a wish that all beings avoid the causes that would lead them to unhappiness
In repeating these phrases you wish not only that beings be happy but also that they avoid the actions that would lead to bad karma to their own unhappiness
You realize that happiness has to depend on action For people to find true happiness they have to understand the causes for happiness and act on them
They also have to understand that true happiness is harmless
If it depends on something that harms others it's not going to last
Those who are harmed are sure to do what they can to destroy that happiness
And then there's the plain quality of sympathy If you see someone suffering it's painful
If you have any sensitivity at all it's hard to feel happy when you know that your happiness is causing suffering for others
So again when you express goodwill you're not saying that you're going to be there for them all the time
You're hoping that all beings will wise up about how to find happiness and be there for themselves
The Karaniya Metta Sutta goes on to say that when you're developing this attitude you want to protect it in the same way that a mother would protect her only child
Some people misread this passage  in fact many translators have mistranslated it  thinking that the Buddha is telling us to cherish all living beings the same way a mother would cherish her only child
But that's not what he's actually saying
To begin with he doesn't mention the word cherish at all
And instead of drawing a parallel between protecting your only child and protecting other beings he draws the parallel between protecting the child and protecting your goodwill
This fits in with his other teachings in the Canon
Nowhere does he tell people to throw down their lives to prevent every cruelty and injustice in the world but he does praise his followers for being willing to throw down their lives for their precepts
The verses here carry a similar sentiment You should be devoted to cultivating and protecting your goodwill to make sure that your virtuous intentions don't waver
This is because you don't want to harm anyone
Harm can happen most easily when there's a lapse in your goodwill so you do whatever you can to protect this attitude at all times
This is why as the Buddha says toward the end of the sutta you should stay determined to practice this form of mindfulness the mindfulness of keeping in mind your wish that all beings be happy to make sure that it always informs the motivation for everything you do
This is why the Buddha explicitly recommends developing thoughts of metta in two situations where it's especially important  and especially difficult  to maintain skillful motivation when others are hurting you and when you realize that you've hurt others
If others are harming you with their words or actions  even if bandits were to carve you up savagely limb by limb with a twohandled saw  the Buddha recommends training your mind in this way
In doing this the Buddha says you make your mind as expansive as the River Ganges or as large as the earth  in other words larger than the harm those people are doing or threatening to do to you
He himself embodied this teaching after Devadatta's attempt on his life
As he told Mara  who had come to taunt him while he was resting from a painful injury  I lie down with sympathy for all beings When you can maintain this enlarged state of mind in the face of pain the harm that others can do to you doesn't seem so overwhelming and you're less likely to respond in unskillful ways
You provide protection  both for yourself and for others  against any unskillful things you otherwise might be tempted to do
As for the times when you realize that you've harmed others the Buddha recommends that you understand that remorse is not going to undo the harm so if an apology is appropriate you apologize
In any case you resolve not to repeat the harmful action again
Then you spread thoughts of goodwill in all directions
This accomplishes several things
It reminds you of your own goodness so that you don't  in defense of your selfimage  revert to the sort of denial that refuses to admit that any harm was done
It strengthens your determination to stick with your resolve not to do harm
And it forces you to examine your actions to see their actual effect If any of your other habits are harmful you want to abandon them before they cause further harm
In other words you don't want your goodwill to be just an ungrounded floating idea
You want to apply it scrupulously to the nittygritty of all your interactions with others
That way your goodwill becomes honest
And it actually does have an impact which is why we develop this attitude to begin with to make sure that it truly animates our thoughts words and deeds in a way that leads to a happiness harmless for all
Finally there's a passage where the Buddha taught the monks a chant for spreading goodwill to all snakes and other creeping things
The story goes that a monk meditating in a forest was bitten by a snake and died
The monks reported this to the Buddha and he replied that if that monk had spread goodwill to all four great families of snakes the snake wouldn't have bitten him
Then the Buddha taught the monks a protective chant for expressing metta not only for snakes but also for all beings
The last statement in this expression of metta takes into consideration the truth that living together is often difficult  especially for beings of different species that can harm one another  and the happiest policy for all concerned is often to live harmlessly apart
These different ways of expressing metta show that metta is not necessarily the quality of lovingkindness
Metta is better thought of as goodwill and for two reasons
The first is that goodwill is an attitude you can express for everyone without fear of being hypocritical or unrealistic
It recognizes that people will become truly happy not as a result of your caring for them but as a result of their own skillful actions and that the happiness of selfreliance is greater than any happiness that comes from dependency
The second reason is that goodwill is a more skillful feeling to have toward those who would react unskillfully to your lovingkindness
There are probably people you've harmed in the past who would rather not have anything to do with you ever again so the intimacy of lovingkindness would actually be a source of pain for them rather than joy
There are also people who when they see that you want to express lovingkindness would be quick to take advantage of it
And there are plenty of animals out there who would feel threatened by any overt expressions of love from a human being
In these cases a more distant sense of goodwill  that you promise yourself never to harm those people or those beings  would be better for everyone involved
This doesn't mean that lovingkindness is never an appropriate expression of goodwill
You simply have to know when it's appropriate and when it's not
If you truly feel metta for yourself and others you can't let your desire for warm feelings of love and intimacy render you insensitive to what would actually be the most skillful way to promote true happiness for all
Okay everyone pay attention
Don't let your mind focus on this person or that
Create the feeling that right now you're sitting alone on a mountain or in a forest somewhere all by yourself
What do you have sitting here right now
Just body and mind that's all only these two things
Everything sitting in this physical lump here is body Mind is what's aware of sense impressions and is thinking in the present
These two things are also called nama and rupa
Nama refers to what has no rupa or form
All thoughts and sensations such as feelings perceptions thoughtfabrications and consciousness are nama
They're all formless
When the eye sees forms those forms are called rupa
The awareness of forms is called nama
Together they're called nama and rupa or simply body and mind
Understand that what's sitting here in the present moment is just body and mind
Everything comes out of these two things
If you want peace these are the only things you have to know
But the mind at present is still untrained
It's dirty
Unclean
It's not the primal mind
We have to train it by making it peaceful from time to time
Some people think that concentration means sitting but the truth of the matter is that standing sitting walking and lying down are part of the practice too
You can practice concentration at any time
Concentration literally means firm intent To practice concentration you don't have to imprison the mind
Some people think I have to go look for some peace to sit without any issues arising at all
I want to sit in total silence but that's a dead person not a live one
To practice concentration is to give rise to knowledge to give rise to discernment
Concentration is a firm intent focused on a single object
What kind of object is a single object
The proper object
Ordinarily we want to sit in total silence
People come and say I try to sit in concentration but my mind won't stay put
First it runs off one place then it runs off somewhere else
I don't know how to make it stop still It's not the sort of thing you can stop
You're not trying to stop it from running for the running is where it's aware of itself
People complain It runs off and I pull it back again then it walks off again and I pull it back once more So they just sit there pulling back and forth like this
They think their mind's running around but actually the only things that run are our impressions
For example look at this hall here Wow you say it's so big But the hall isn't what's big just our impression of it
Actually this hall is just the size it is not big not small but we run around after our impressions of things
Meditating to find peace You have to understand what this word peace is
If you don't understand it you won't be able to find it
For example suppose you brought a pen with you to the monastery today one that you love an expensive one that cost or baht
And suppose that on your way here you put the pen in your front pocket but later you took it out and put it somewhere else like your back pocket
Now when you feel for it in your front pocket It's not there
You panic
You panic because you don't see the truth of the matter
You get all upset
Standing walking coming and going you can't stop worrying about your lost pen
Your misunderstanding causes you to suffer What a shame
I've only had it for a few days and now it's lost
But then you remember Oh of course
When I went to bathe I put the pen in my back pocket As soon as you remember this you feel better already even without seeing your pen
See that
You're happy already you can stop worrying about your pen
You're sure about it now
As you walk along you run your hand over your back pocket and there it is
Your mind was lying to you
Your pen wasn't lost but the mind lied to you that it was
You suffered because you didn't know
Now when you see the pen and your doubts are gone your worries calm down
This sort of peace and calm comes from seeing the cause of the problem samudaya the cause of suffering
As soon as you're sure that the pen is in your back pocket there's nirodha the cessation of suffering
So you have to contemplate to find peace
What people usually refer to as peace is simply the calming of the mind not the calming of the defilements
You're just sitting on top of your defilements like a rock sitting on the grass
The grass can't grow because the rock is sitting on it
In three or four days you take the rock off the grass and it starts growing again
The grass didn't really die
It was just suppressed
The same holds for sitting in concentration The mind is calmed but the defilements aren't which means that concentration isn't for sure
To find real peace you have to contemplate
Concentration is one kind of peace like the rock sitting on the grass
You can leave it there many days but when you pick it up the grass starts growing again
That's only temporary peace
The peace of discernment is like never picking up the rock just leaving it there where it is
The grass can't possibly grow again
That's real peace the calming of the defilements for sure
That's discernment
We speak of discernment and concentration as separate things but actually they're one and the same
Discernment is just the movement of concentration
They come from the same mind but go in different directions with different characteristics like this mango here
A small mango eventually grows larger and larger until it's ripe
It's all the same mango
They're not different ones
When it's small it's this mango
When it's large it's this mango
When it's ripe it's this mango
Only its characteristics change
When you practice the Dhamma one condition is called concentration the later condition is called discernment but in fact virtue concentration and discernment are all the same thing just like the mango
Actually in practicing the Dhamma whatever happens you have to start from the mind
Do you know what this mind is
What is the mind like
What is it
Where is it
Nobody knows
All we know is that we want to go over here or over there we want this and we want that the mind feels happy or sad but the mind itself we can't know
What is the mind
The mind isn't is anything
We've come up with the supposition that whatever receives impressions both good and bad we call heart or mind Like the owner of a house
Whoever receives the guests is the owner of the house
The guests can't receive the owner
The owner stays put at home
When guests come to see him he has to receive them
Who receives sense impressions
Who lets go of sense impressions
That's what we call mind But we don't understand it so we think around in circles What is the mind
What is the heart Don't confuse the issue like this
What is it that receives impressions
Some impressions it likes and some it doesn't
Who is that
Is there something that likes and dislikes
Sure there is but we don't know what it's like
That's what we call mind Understand
Don't go looking far away
In our practice it's not necessary to talk of concentration or vipassana just call it practicing the Dhamma that's enough
And start following this practice from your own mind
What is the mind
The mind is what receives or is aware of sense impressions
With some sense impressions there's pleasure with others there's sorrow
The thing that receives impressions leads us to happiness and suffering right and wrong but it isn't a thing
We suppose it to be a thing but it's really only namadhamma
Is goodness a thing
Is evil
Do happiness and suffering have a shape
No
Are they round or square
How short or long
Do you know
They're namadhamma
They can't be compared to things  but we know that they're there
So we're told to begin the practice by calming the mind
Make it aware
If the mind is aware it'll be at peace
Some people don't go for awareness
They just want to have peace to the point where there's nothing  so they never learn anything
If we don't have this one who knows what is there to base our practice on
With no long there's no short with no right there's no wrong
People these days keep studying looking to understand what's right and what's wrong what's good and evil but they don't know neitherrightnessnorwrongness
All they're looking to know is what's right and wrong I'm going to take only what's right
I won't take what's wrong
Why should I If you try to take only what's right in a short while it'll go wrong
It's right for the sake of wrong
People keep searching for what's right and wrong but they don't try to find what's neitherrightnessnorwrongness
They study about good and bad they search for merit and evil but they don't study the point where there's neither merit nor evil
They study issues of long and short but the issue of neither long nor short they don't study
This knife has a blade a back and a handle
When you pick it up can you lift only the blade
Can you lift only the back of the blade or the handle
The handle is the handle of the knife the back the back of the knife the blade the blade of the knife
When you pick up the knife you pick up all three parts together
In the same way if you pick up what's good what's bad must follow
People search for what's good and try to throw away what's bad but they don't study what's neither good nor bad
If you don't study this things never come to an end
If you pick up goodness badness comes along with it
It follows right along
If you pick up happiness suffering follows along
They're connected
The practice of clinging to what's good and rejecting what's bad is the Dhamma of children Dhamma for children to toy around with
Sure if you want you can take just this much but if you grab onto what's good what's bad will follow
The end of this path gets all cluttered up
So it's not so good
Take a simple example
You have children
Now suppose you want to take only the love and not the hatred
This is the thinking of someone who doesn't understand these two things
If you take the love hatred will come running in its wake
So when you set your heart on practicing the Dhamma you have to use discernment
Study what's good to see what it's like
Study what's bad in as much detail as you can
Now when you're acquainted with good and bad what will you take
If you take the good bad comes running in its wake
You don't study what's neither good nor bad
That's what people have to be dragged to study
I'm going to be like this I'm going to be like that  but we never say I'm not going to be anything because there isn't any me This we don't study
All we want to take is goodness
If we get goodness we don't understand it
We get intoxicated with it
If things get too good they'll start to go bad and so we keep running back and forth like this
We rest the mind to make it calm in order to become acquainted with what receives sense impressions to see what it is
That's why we're told to keep track of the mind to keep track of what knows Train the mind to be pure
How pure should you make it
If it's really pure the mind should be above both good and evil pure even above purity
Done
Only then are things over and done
When we practice sitting in concentration that's just a temporary kind of peace
When it's peaceful issues arise
If there's an issue there's what knows the issue tests it questions it keeps after it examines it
If the mind is simply blank then nothing happens
Some people really imprison the mind thinking that that sort of peace is the genuine practice but genuine peace is not just peace of mind
It's not just peaceful in that way
I want to take just the ease and happiness and not the stress and suffering Once you're peaceful in this way taking just the ease and happiness after a while it gets uncomfortable
Discomfort comes in its wake
Get so that there's no happiness and suffering in the mind
That's where there's real peace
This is a subject that people rarely study rarely understand
To train the mind in the right way to make it bright to develop discernment Don't think you can do it by sitting and making it just still
That's the rock sitting on the grass
People jump to the conclusion that concentration is sitting
That's just a name for concentration but really if the mind has concentration walking is concentration sitting is concentration  concentration with the walking concentration with the sitting the standing the lying down
That's the practice
Some people complain I can't meditate
It's too irritating
Whenever I sit down I think of this and that I think of my house and my family
I can't do it
I've got too much bad kamma
I should let my bad kamma run out first and then come back and try meditating Go ahead just try it
Try waiting until your bad kamma runs out
This is how we think
Why do we think like this
That's what we're studying
As soon as we sit the mind goes way over there
We track it down and bring it back  and then it goes off again
This is how we study
But most of us want to skip class
We're like a student who skips class who doesn't want to study his lessons
We don't want to see the mind when it's happy when it's suffering
We don't want to see it change but what will we ever know
You have to stay with the changing like this
Get acquainted with this Oh the mind is like this
One moment it thinks of that the next moment it thinks of this that's its ordinary nature Know it when it thinks
Know when its thoughts are good when they're bad when they're right and wrong
Know what it's like
When we know the affairs of the mind then even if we're simply sitting thinking about this or that the mind is still in concentration
If we know what it's up to we don't get irritated or distracted
Let me give you an example
Suppose you have a pet monkey at home
It doesn't sit still
It likes to jump around and grab hold of things
That's how monkeys are
Now you come to the monastery
We have a monkey here too and this monkey doesn't stay still either
It jumps around and grabs things just the same but it doesn't irritate you does it
Why
Because you're acquainted with monkeys
You know what they're like
If you know just one monkey no matter how many provinces you go to no matter how many monkeys you see they don't irritate you right
That's someone who understands monkeys
If we understand monkeys then we won't become monkeys
If you don't understand monkeys then as soon as you see a monkey you become a monkey yourself right
When you see it grabbing this and that you think Grrr You get angry and irritated
That damned monkey That's someone who doesn't understand monkeys
Someone who knows monkeys sees that the monkey at home and the monkey in the monastery are the same monkey and so why should they irritate you
When you understand what monkeys are like that's enough
You can be at peace
If the monkey runs around it's only the monkey running
You don't run around with it
You don't become a monkey too
If it jumps in front of you and behind you you don't get irritated by the monkey  because you understand monkeys and so you don't become a monkey
If you don't understand monkeys you become a monkey  understand
This is how things grow calm
We have to know sense impressions observe sense impressions
Some are likable some are not but so what
That's their business
That's what they're like
Just like monkeys
All monkeys are the same monkey
We understand sense impressions
Sometimes they're likable sometimes they're not
That's what they're like
We have to get acquainted with them
When we're acquainted with them we let them go
Sense impressions aren't for sure
They're inconstant stressful and notself
We keep looking at them in that way
When the eye ear nose tongue body and mind receive impressions we know them just like knowing monkeys
This monkey is just like the monkey at home
Then we can be at peace
When sense impressions arise know them
Why run after them
Impressions aren't for sure
One minute they're one way the next minute another
Sometimes they stay as they were before
They exist through change
And all of us here exist through change
The breath goes out then it comes back in
It changes like this
Try only breathing in Can you do that
How many minutes would you last
Or try just breathing out without breathing in
If there were no change could you survive
You wouldn't survive at all
You need to have both the inbreath and the outbreath
Only then can you walk to the monastery
If you just held your breath all the way coming here you'd be dead by now
You wouldn't have made it
So understand this
Sense impressions are the same
They have to be there
If they weren't there you couldn't develop any discernment
If there were no wrong there could be no right
You have to be right first before you can see what's wrong
Or you have to be wrong first before you can recognize what's right
That's the way things normally are
If you're a student of the mind the more sense impressions the better
But if you don't like sense impressions if you don't want to deal with them you're like the student who skips class who doesn't want to learn or to listen to his teacher
These sense impressions are teaching us
When we know sense impressions in this way we're practicing Dhamma
We know what they're like when they calm down we know what their issues are  just like seeing monkeys
The monkey in your home doesn't irritate you
When you see the monkey here it doesn't irritate you  because you understand monkeys right
You can be at ease
The practice of Dhamma is like this
It's not very far away
It's right with us
The Dhamma isn't about divine beings or anything like that
It's simply about us about what we're doing right now
Contemplate yourself
Sometimes there's happiness sometimes suffering sometimes comfort sometimes irritation sometimes you love that person sometimes you hate this person
This is Dhamma
See
To know this Dhamma you have to read your sense impressions
Only when you're acquainted with them can you let them go
That way you can be at ease
The realization will come flashing up Hmm
This isn't for sure When your impression changes This isn't for sure You can be at your ease in the same way that you can be at ease when seeing monkeys
You won't have any doubts
If you're acquainted with sense impressions you're acquainted with the Dhamma
You can let go of sense impressions
You see that there's nothing for sure about sensations in any way at all
Have you ever been happy
Have you ever been sad
You don't have to answer I can answer for you Yes Are these things for sure
No
This notforsureness is the Buddha
The Buddha is the Dhamma
The Dhamma is what's not for sure
Whoever sees that things aren't for sure sees for sure that that's the way they are
The way they are doesn't change into anything else
That's the way things are
That's what the Dhamma is like
And that's what the Buddha is like
If you see the Dhamma you see the Buddha if you see the Buddha you see the Dhamma
If you know inconstancy notforsureness you'll let things go of your own accord
You won't grasp onto them
You may say Don't break my glass But can you prevent something breakable from breaking
If it doesn't break now it'll break later on
If you don't break it someone else will
If someone else doesn't break it one of the chickens will
The Buddha says to accept this
He penetrated all the way to seeing that this glass is already broken
This glass that isn't broken he saw as already broken
Whenever you pick up the glass put water in it drink from it and put it down he tells you to see that it's already broken
Understand
The Buddha's understanding was like this
He saw the broken glass in the unbroken one
Whenever its time is up it'll break
Develop this attitude
Use the glass look after it
Then one day it slips out of your hand Smash No problem
Why no problem
Because you saw it as broken before it broke
But usually people say I've taken such good care of this glass
Don't ever let it break Later on the dog breaks it I'll kill that damn dog You hate the dog for breaking your glass
If your child breaks it you hate him too
You hate whoever breaks it
Why
Because you've dammed yourself up so that the water can't flow
You've made a dam without a spillway
The only thing the dam can do is burst right
When you make a dam you have to make a spillway too
When the water rises up to a certain level it can flow off safely to the side
When it's full to the brim it can flow out the spillway
You need to have a spillway like this
Seeing inconstancy is the spillway of the Noble Ones
When you see things this way you can be at peace
That's the practice of the Dhamma
So I've learned to hold that whether standing walking sitting or lying down I keep on practicing using mindfulness to watch over and protect the mind
That's concentrationThat's discernment
They're both the same thing
They differ only in their characteristics
If we really see inconstancy which means that things aren't for sure when we penetrate to see clearly that things aren't for sure then what we see is for sure
Sure in what way
Sure that that's the way things are
They don't change into any other way
Understand
When you know just this much you know the Buddha
You've done reverence to him
You've done reverence to his Dhamma
Take this principle and mull it over
As long as you don't abandon the Buddha you won't suffer
As soon as you abandon him you'll suffer immediately
You'll suffer as soon as you abandon the principles of inconstancy stress and notself
If you can practice just this much it's enough
Suffering won't arise or if it does arise you can snuff it out easily
And that will be a cause for suffering not to arise in the future
That's where things finish at the point where suffering doesn't arise
And why doesn't suffering arise
Because we're careful around the cause of suffering or samudaya
For instance if this glass were to break normally you'd experience suffering right
We know that this glass will be a cause for suffering so we get rid of the cause
All dhammas arise because of a cause
When they cease it's also because of a cause
Now if there's suffering on account of this glass here if you get angry and suffer from the anger If we reflect beforehand that this glass is already broken even when it isn't the cause dies away
When there's no longer any suffering that means it ceases
That's nirodha
That's all there is
Don't stray away from this point
Just keep working away right here
Contemplate right here
Start out by contemplating your own mind
To put it in really basic terms you should all have the five precepts as your foundation
You don't have to go study the Pali Canon
Watch your five precepts
Keep working at them always
Do this with care
At first you'll make mistakes
When you realize it stop come back and start over again
Maybe you'll go astray and make another mistake
When you realize it start over again each and every time
Your mindfulness will gain a higher frequency like water poured from a kettle
If we tilt the kettle just a little the water comes out in drops glug glug glug
There are breaks in the flow
If we tilt the kettle a little bit more the drops become more frequent glugglugglug
If we tilt the kettle even further the glugs disappear and the water turns into a steady stream
There are no more drops
Where did they go
They didn't go anywhere
They've changed into a steady stream of water
They've become so frequent that they're beyond frequency
They meld into one another in a stream of water
The Dhamma is just like this talking in analogies because the Dhamma doesn't have anything
It isn't round doesn't have any corners
There's no way to get acquainted with it except through comparisons like this
If you understand this you understand the Dhamma
Don't think that the Dhamma lies far away from you
It lies right with you it's about you
Take a look
One minute happy the next minute sad satisfied then angry at this person hating that person It's all Dhamma
Look yourself
What's trying to give rise to suffering
When you've done something that causes suffering turn around and undo it
Turn around and undo it
You haven't seen it clearly
When you see it clearly there's no more suffering
The cause has been put out
Once you've killed the cause of suffering there are no more conditions for it to arise
If suffering is still arising if you don't really know it you have to endure it That's not yet right
To put it in really simple terms wherever you're stuck wherever there's too much suffering right there you're wrong
Whenever you're so happy that the mind starts swelling up  there Wrong again
Whichever side it comes from doesn't matter
Bring everything together to this one point and keep exploring
If you practice like this you'll be mindful whether you're standing walking sitting or lying down coming or going whatever you're doing
If you're always mindful and alert you're sure to know right and wrong happiness and suffering
When you're acquainted with these things you'll know how to undo them so that there won't be any suffering
You won't let there be suffering
I have people study concentration like this
When it's time to sit in meditation then sit
That's not wrong
You have to know that too
But concentration isn't just sitting
You have to let the mind encounter different things then register them and bring them up to contemplate
Contemplate to know what
Contemplate to see Oh
That's inconstant
Stressful
Notself
It's not for sure Everything is not for sure let me tell you
This is so beautiful I really like it That's not for sure
I don't like this at all Tell it It too is not for sure
Right
Absolutely
No mistake
But look at what happens
This time I'm going to get this thing right for sure You've gone off the track already
Don't
No matter how much you like something you should reflect that it's not for sure
When we eat some kinds of food we think Wow
That's so delicious
I really like that There will be that feeling in the heart but you have to reflect It's not for sure Do you want to test how it's not for sure
Take your favorite food and eat it every day
Every single day okay
Eventually you'll complain This doesn't taste so good anymore You'll think Actually I prefer that kind of food That's not for sure either
Everything has to go from one thing to the next just like breathing in and out
We have to breathe in and breathe out
We exist because of change
Everything depends on change like this
These things lie right with us nowhere else
If we no longer have any doubts then we can sit in comfort stand in comfort
Concentration isn't just sitting
Some people sit until they fall into a stupor
They might as well be dead
They can't tell north from south
Don't take it that far
If you feel sleepy then walk
Change your posture
Use your discernment
If you're totally sleepy then lie down
As soon as you wake up get right up and continue your efforts
Don't let yourself get carried away with the comfort of lying down
If you're a meditator you have to practice like this
Have reasons for what you do
Discernment
Circumspection
You can't not be circumspect
You can't just know one side of things
You have to know the full circle like this
Start knowing from your own mind and body seeing them as inconstant
They're not for sure neither body nor mind
The same goes for everything
It's not for sure
Keep this in mind when you think food is so delicious
You have to tell yourself It's not for sure You have to punch your likes first
Whatever the mind likes you have to tell it It's not for sure Punch it first
But usually these things just punch you every time
If you don't like something and suffer because you don't like it it's punched you
If she likes me I like her It's punched you
You don't punch it at all
You have to understand in this way
Whenever you like anything just say to yourself This isn't for sure Whenever you don't like something say to yourself This isn't for sure Keep at this and you'll see the Dhamma for sure
That's how it has to be
Practice in all postures sitting standing walking lying down
You can feel anger in any posture right
Walking you can feel anger sitting you can feel anger lying down you can feel anger
Sometimes you feel desire while lying down while walking while sitting
So you have to practice in all four postures consistently without any front or back
Keep at it like this
Only then can your knowledge be all around
When you sit to get the mind to settle down an issue starts running in
Before it's finished another one comes running in
If they run in like this tell yourself It's not for sure Punch it before it gets a chance to punch you
Punch it with It's not for sure
You have to know its weak point
If you know that all things aren't for sure all the thinking in your heart will gradually unravel gradually unravel
You've seen that that's what's sure about it
Whenever you've seen that something isn't for sure then even when lots of things come passing in they're all the same
On a later day you contemplate again and they're all still just the same
Have you ever seen flowing water
Have you ever seen still water
If your mind is peaceful it's like still flowing water
Have you ever seen still flowing water
There
You've only seen flowing water and still water
You've never seen still flowing water
Right there right where your thinking can't take you where the mind is still but can develop discernment
When you look at your mind it'll be like flowing water and yet still
It looks like it's still it looks like it's flowing so it's called still flowing water
That's what it's like
That's where discernment can arise
All the things in the world are suppositions that we've supposed into being
Once we've supposed them we fall for our own supposings so nobody lets them go
They turn into views and pride into attachment
This attachment is something that never ends
It's an affair of samsara that flows without respite with no way of coming to closure
But if we really know our suppositions we'll know release
If we really know release we'll know our suppositions
That's when you know the Dhamma that can come to closure
Take people for instance
When we start out we're born without names
The fact that we have names comes from their being supposed into being
I've thought about this and seen that if you don't really know suppositions they can cause a lot of harm
Actually suppositions are simply things for us to use
If we understand what they're for that's enough
Know that if we didn't have suppositions there'd be nothing we could say to one another no language to use with one another
When I went abroad I saw Westerners sitting in meditation in row after row
When they got up after sitting men and women together sometimes they'd go and touch one another on the head one person after another
When I saw this I thought Hmm if we set up a supposition anywhere and cling to it it gives rise to defilements right there If we're willing to let go of our suppositions we can be at peace
Like the generals and colonels men of rank and position who come to see me
When they come they say Oh please touch my head That shows that they're willing so there's nothing wrong with it
You can rub their heads and they're even glad you did it
But if you rubbed their heads in the middle of the street there'd be a big fuss
This is because of clinging
So I've seen that letting go is really comfortable
When they agree to having their heads touched they've supposed that there's nothing wrong with it
And there is nothing wrong with it just like rubbing a head of cabbage or a head of lettuce
But if you rubbed their heads in the middle of the road they wouldn't stand for it for sure
It's all a matter of willingness  accepting giving up letting go
When you can do this things are light
Wherever you're clinging there's becoming right there birth right there poison and danger right there
The Buddha taught about suppositions and he taught to undo suppositions in the right way to turn them into release
Don't cling to them
The things that arise in the world are all suppositions
That's how they come into being
When they've arisen and been supposed we shouldn't fall for them for that leads to suffering
The affairs of supposition and convention are extremely important
Whoever can let them go is free from suffering
But they're an activity of this world of ours
Take Boonmaa for instance
He's the District Commissioner
His old friend Saengchai isn't a district commissioner but they've been friends from way back
Now that Boonmaa has been appointed district commissioner there's a supposition right there but you have to know how to use it in an appropriate way because we still live in the world
If Saengchai goes to the district offices and pats Boonmaa on the head it's not right
Even if Saengchai thinks about all the old times when they worked together as traveling tailors and about that time they almost died it's still not right for him to go playing around with Boonmaa's head in front of other people
You have to show a little respect and practice in line with our social suppositions
Only then can we live together in peace
No matter how long you've been friends he's now the district commissioner
You have to show him some deference
When he leaves the district offices and goes home that's when you can pat him on the head
It's the district commissioner's head you're patting but when you do it in his home it doesn't matter
If you were to do it in the government offices in front of a lot of people it'd be wrong
This is called showing respect
If you know how to use suppositions in this way they serve a purpose
No matter how long you've been close friends if you touch him on the head in front of a lot of people he's sure to get angry  after all he's now the district commissioner
This is all there is to our behavior in the world You need a sense of time and place and of the people you're with
So we're taught to be intelligent to have a sense of suppositions and a sense of release
Understand them when you use them
If you use them properly there's no problem
If you don't use them properly it's offensive
What does it offend
It offends people's defilements that's all  because people live with defilement
There are suppositions you have to follow with certain groups certain people certain times and places
If you follow them appropriately you can be said to be smart
You have to know where these things come from and how far they lead
We have to live with suppositions but we suffer when we cling to them
If you understand suppositions simply as suppositions and explore them until you come to release there are no problems
As I've often said before we were laymen and now we're monks
Before we were supposed to be laymen but now having gone through the ordination chant we're supposed to be monks
But we're monks on the level of supposition not genuine monks not monks on the level of release
If we practice so that our minds are released from all their fermentations step by step as streamwinners oncereturners nonreturners all the way to arahantship then all our defilements will be abandoned
Even when we say that someone is an arahant that's just a supposition  but he's a genuine monk
In the beginning we start with suppositions like this
In the ordination ceremony they agree to call you a monk but does that mean you can suddenly abandon your defilements
No
It's like taking a fistful of sand and saying Suppose this is salt Is it salt
Sure it is but only on the level of supposing
It's not genuine salt
If you were to put it into a curry it wouldn't serve any purpose
If you were to argue that it's genuine salt the answer would have to be No
That's what's meant by supposition
The word release is something supposed into being but what it actually is lies beyond supposition
When there's release all our suppositions are released
That's all there is to it
Can we live without suppositions
No
If we didn't have suppositions we wouldn't know how to talk with each other
We wouldn't know where things come from and how far they go
We wouldn't have any language to speak with one another
So suppositions have their purposes  the purposes we're supposed to use them for
For example people have different names even though they're all people just the same
If we didn't have names you wouldn't know how to call the person you wanted
For instance if you wanted to call a particular person in a crowd and said Person
Person that would be useless
No one would answer because they're all person But if you called Jan
Come here then Jan would come
The others wouldn't have to
This is how suppositions serve a purpose
Things get accomplished
So there are ways for us to train ourselves that arise from suppositions
If we know both supposition and release in the proper way we can get along
Suppositions have their uses but in reality there really isn't anything there
There isn't even a person there
There's just a set of natural conditions born of their causal factors
They develop in dependence on causal factors stay for a while and before long they fall apart
You can't stop that from happening
You can't really control it
That's all there is
It's just a supposition but without suppositions we'd have nothing to say no names no practice no work no language
Suppositions and conventions are established to give us a language to make things convenient that's all
Take money for example
In the past there wasn't any paper money
Paper was just paper without any value
Then people decided that silver money was hard to store so they turned paper into money
And so it serves as money
Maybe someday in the future a new king will arise who doesn't like paper money
He'll have us use wax droppings instead  take sealing wax melt it stamp it into lumps and suppose it to be money
We'll be using wax droppings all over the country getting into debt all because of wax droppings
Let alone wax droppings we could take chicken droppings and turn them into money
It could happen
All our chicken droppings would be cash
We'd be fighting and killing one another over chicken droppings
Even when they propose new forms for things if everybody agrees to the new supposition it works
As for the silver we started out with nobody really knows what it is
The ore we call silver Is it really silver
Nobody knows
Somebody saw what it was like came up with the supposition of silver and that's what it was
That's all there is to the affairs of the world
We suppose something into being and that's what it is  because we live with suppositions
But to turn these things into release to get people to know genuine release That's hard
Our house our money our possessions our family our children our relatives are ours simply on the level of supposition
But actually on the level of the Dhamma they're not really ours
We don't like to hear this but that's the way they actually are
If we don't have any suppositions around them they have no value
Or if we suppose them to have no value they have no value
But if we suppose them to have value they do
This is the way things are
These suppositions are good if we know how to use them
Even this body of ours isn't really ours
We just suppose it to be so
It's a supposition
If you try to find a genuine self within it you can't
There are just elements that are born continue for a while and then die
Everything is like this
There's no real true substance to it but it's proper that we have to use it
For example what do we need to stay alive
We need food
If our life depends on food as its nourishment as a support we need to use then we should use it to achieve its purpose
That's how the Buddha taught new monks
Right from the very beginning he taught the four supports clothing food shelter medicine
He taught that we should contemplate these things
If we don't contemplate them in the morning we should contemplate them in the evening after we've used them
Why does he have us contemplate them so often
To realize that as long as we're alive we can't escape these things
You'll use these things all your life he said but don't fall for them
Their purpose is just to keep life going
If we didn't have these things we couldn't meditate couldn't chant couldn't contemplate
For the time being we have to depend on these things but don't get attached to them
Don't fall for the supposition that they're yours
They're supports for keeping you alive
When the time comes you'll have to give them up
In the meantime though even though the idea that they're yours is just a supposition you have to take care of them
If you don't take care of them you suffer
Like a cup for instance
Someday in the future the cup is going to break
If it breaks no big deal  but as long as you're alive you should take good care of it because it's your utensil
If it breaks you'll be put to trouble
If it's going to break let it be broken in a way that can't be helped
The same goes for the four supports that we're taught to contemplate
They're requisites for those who've gone forth
Understand them but don't cling to them to the point where the clinging becomes a big lump of craving and defilement in the heart and makes you suffer
Use them just for the purpose of keeping alive and that's enough
Suppositions and release are related like this continually
Even though we use suppositions don't place your trust in their being true
They're true only on the level of supposing
If you cling to them suffering will arise because you don't understand them in line with what they really are
The same holds for issues of right and wrong
Some people see wrong as right and right as wrong but whose right and wrong they are nobody knows
Different people make different suppositions about what's right and wrong so we have to know these things in every case
But the Buddha was afraid that it would lead to suffering if we got into arguments because issues of this sort never come to closure
One person says right another says wrong One says wrong another says right But actually we don't really know right and wrong at all
All we need is to learn how to use them for our comfort so that we can put them to work in a proper way
Don't let them harm you or harm others
Keep things neutral in this way
That serves our purposes
In short both suppositions and release are simply dhammas
One is higher than the other but they're synonyms
There's no way we can guarantee for sure that this has to be this or that has to be that so the Buddha said to just put it down as not for sure No matter how much you like something you have to know that it's not for sure
No matter how much you dislike something you have to understand that it's not for sure
And these things really aren't for sure
Keep practicing until they're dhammas
Past present or future Make them all an affair of Dhamma practice
And it comes to closure at the point where there's nothing more
You've let go
Everything ends when you've put down the burden
I'll give you an analogy
One person asks Why is the flag fluttering
It must be because there's wind Another person says It's fluttering because there's a flag This sort of thing never comes to an end
The same as the old riddle Which came first the chicken or the egg This never comes to an end
It just keeps spinning around in its circles
All these things are simply suppositions
They arise from our supposing
So you have to understand suppositions and conventions
If you understand them you'll understand inconstancy stress and notself
This is a preoccupation that leads straight to nibbana
Training and teaching people is really hard you know
Some people have their opinions
You tell them something and they say No
You tell them the truth and they say it's not true
I'll take what's right for me you take what's right for you There's no end to this
If you don't let go there'll be suffering
I've told you before about the four men who go into the forest
They hear a chicken crowing Ekkkiekkekkkk One of them comes up with the question Who says that's a rooster
Who says it's a hen For the fun of it three of them put their heads together and say it's a hen
The other one says it's a rooster
They argue back and forth like this without stopping
Three of them say it's a hen and only one of them says it's a rooster
How could a hen crow like that he asks
Well it's got a mouth doesn't it they reply
The one person argues until he starts crying
Actually it was a rooster crowing in line with our standard suppositions but the one person had to argue until he started to cry
Yet on the ultimate level they were all wrong
The words rooster and hen are just suppositions
If you asked the chicken Are you a rooster it wouldn't answer
If you asked Are you a hen it wouldn't give any explanation
But we have our conventions These features are the features of a rooster these features the features of a hen
The rooster's crow is like this a hen's squawk is like that
These are suppositions that are stuck in our world
But in truth there's no rooster no hen
To speak on the level of the world's suppositions the one person was right but to argue to the point of crying doesn't serve any purpose at all
That's all there is to it
So the Buddha taught not to cling to these things
If we don't hold onto things how can we practice
We practice because of notclinging
To bring your discernment in here is hard
This is why it's hard not to cling
You need to use sharp discernment to contemplate this
Only then will you get anywhere
When you think about it for the sake of relieving suffering it doesn't depend on whether you have a lot of things or a little
Whether you're happy or sad content or discontent it starts from your discernment
To go beyond suffering depends on discernment seeing things in line with their truth
The Buddha taught us to train ourselves to contemplate to meditate
Meditation means undoing these problems in line with the way they are
These are the issues the issues of birth aging illness and death
These are really common ordinary things
This is why he has us contemplate them continually
He has us meditate on birth aging illness and death
Some people don't understand why we have to contemplate them
We already know birth they say
We already know death
They're such ordinary issues So true
A person who investigates these things again and again will see
When you see you can gradually undo these problems
Although you may still have some clinging if you have the discernment to see that these things are normal you'll be able to relieve suffering
This is why we practice for the sake of undoing suffering
The basic principles of the Buddha's teaching aren't much just suffering arising and suffering passing away
That's why these things are called noble truths
If you don't know these things you suffer
If you argue from pride and opinions there's no end to it
To get the mind to relieve its suffering and be at ease you have to contemplate what's happened in the past what's in the present what's going to be in the future
What can you do not to be worried about birth aging illness and death
There will be some worries but if you can learn to understand them for what they are suffering will gradually lessen because you don't hug it to your chest
Newcomers to Buddhism often ask whether a person's lifestyle has any special bearing on their ability to progress along the Buddha's path and in particular whether the Buddha had a compelling reason for establishing a monastic order governed by guidelines quite different from those that hold sway over the lay Buddhist community
Doesn't it seem they ask that a lay person who follows the Buddhist precepts in daily life should be able to advance just as rapidly as a monk or nun and attain the same level of enlightenment
And if this is so doesn't that mean that the entire monastic lifestyle becomes something superfluous or at best a mere matter of personal choice no more relevant to one's spiritual development than whether one trains to become a doctor or an engineer
If we suspend concern for questions of status and superiority and simply consider the two modes of life in their ideal expression the conclusion would have to follow that the monastic life lived in the way envisioned by the Buddha is the one that conduces more effectively to the final goal
According to the Pali canon the ultimate goal of the Dhamma is the attainment of Nibbana the destruction of all defilements here and now and ultimate release from samsara the round of rebirths
This attainment comes about by eliminating craving and ignorance through the practice of the Noble Eightfold Path
The Eightfold Path is open equally to both monastics and lay followers monastic ordination does not confer any privileged access to the path or an empowerment that enables a monk or nun to make more rapid progress than a lay follower
But while this is so the fact remains that the monastic life was expressly designed by the Buddha to facilitate complete dedication to the practice of the path in its three stages of virtue concentration and wisdom and thus provides the optimal conditions for spiritual progress
The monastic lifestyle does so precisely because the final goal is a state of renunciation the relinquishment of all acquisitions and from the outset the monk's life is rooted in renunciation
In going forth the monk leaves behind family possessions and worldly position and even the outer marks of personal identity symbolized by hair beard and wardrobe
By shaving the head and donning the yellow robe the monk has given up  in principle at least  any claim to a unique identity as his own
Outwardly indistinguishable from a hundred thousand other monks he has become simply a Sakyaputtiya samana an ascetic who follows the Sakyan son
The life of the monk involves radical simplicity contentment with the barest requisites the need to be patient in difficulty
The monastic lifestyle places the monk in dependence on the generosity and kindness of others and imposes on him an intricate code of discipline the Vinaya designed to foster the essential renunciant virtues of simplicity restraint purity and harmlessness
These virtues provide a sound basis for the higher attainments in concentration and insight which are essentially stages in the progressive purification of the mind and the deepening of insight
Of prime importance too is the external freedom ideally provided by the monastic life
The monastic schedule leaves the monk free from extraneous demands on his time and energy allowing him to devote himself fully to the practice and study of the Dhamma
Of course as the monastic life is lived today monks take on many responsibilities not originally mentioned in the canonical texts and in a traditional Buddhist country the village temple has become the hub of religious activity with the monks functioning as virtual priests for the wider Buddhist community
But here we are concerned with the canonical picture of the monastic life
If the monk's life so conceived did not promote smoother progress toward the goal it seems there would have been no sound reason for the Buddha to have established a monastic order or to have encouraged men and women so inclined to go forth from the home life into homelessness
While the attainment of Nibbana is the ultimate goal of early Buddhism it is not the only goal and one of the shortcomings in the way Theravada Buddhism has been presented to the West is the onesided emphasis placed on the final goal over the provisional aspect of the Teaching
In traditional Buddhist lands few Buddhists see Nibbana as an immediately realistic prospect
The great majority both lay and monastic regard the path as a course of gradual practice gradual progress and gradual achievement extending over many lives
Their practice as Buddhist followers centers around the performance of meritorious deeds and methodical mental purification rooted in the confidence that the kammic law of causality and the spiritual power of the Dhamma will sustain them in their quest for deliverance
To make clear the choices facing the lay follower we might posit two alternative models of the Buddhist lay life
On the first model lay life is seen as a field for gradual progress toward the goal through the development of wholesome qualities such as generosity moral virtue kindness and understanding
The immediate aim is not direct realization of the highest truth but the accumulation of merits leading to a happy rebirth and gradual progress toward Nibbana
The second model recognizes the capacity of lay followers for reaching the stages of awakening in this life itself and advocates strict moral discipline and strenuous effort in meditation to attain deep insight into the truth of the Dhamma
While there are in Buddhist countries lay people who follow the path of direct realization their number is much smaller than those who pursue the alternative model
The reason should be obvious enough the stakes are higher and include a capacity for inward renunciation rare among those who must raise a family work at a fulltime job and struggle to survive in a ruggedly competitive world
We should note further a point of prime importance this second model of the Buddhist lay life becomes effective as a means to higher attainment precisely because it emulates the monastic model
Thus to the extent that a lay follower embarks on the practice of the direct path to realization he or she does so by conforming to the lifestyle of a monk or nun
These two conceptions of the lay life need not be seen as mutually exclusive for an earnest lay follower can adopt the first model for his or her normal routine and also stake out periods to pursue the second model eg by curtailing social engagements devoting time to deep study and meditation and occasionally going on extended retreats
Though a monastic lifestyle might be more conducive to enlightenment than a busy life within the world when it comes to individuals rather than models all fixed preconceptions collapse
Some lay people with heavy family and social commitments manage to make such rapid progress that they can give guidance in meditation to earnest monks and it is not rare at all to find sincere monks deeply committed to the practice who advance slowly and with difficulty
While the monastic life lived according to the original ideal may provide the optimal outer conditions for spiritual progress the actual rate of progress depends on personal effort and on the store of qualities one brings over from previous lives and often it seems individuals deeply enmeshed in the world are better endowed in both respects than those who enter the Sangha
In any case whether for monk nun or layperson the path to Nibbana is the same the Noble Eightfold Path
Whatever one's personal circumstances may be if one is truly earnest about realizing the final goal of the Dhamma one will make every effort to tread this path in the way that best fits the particular circumstances of one's life
As the Buddha himself says Whether it be a householder or one gone forth it is the one of right practice that I praise not the one of wrong practice
The Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creeds
Founded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topics
Its publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddha's discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practice
These works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first arose
 Dhammapada 
This book is a short introduction to the basic principles of Buddhism the Buddha the Dhamma and Sangha also known as the Triple Gem or the Triple Refuge
The material is divided into three parts an introductory essay on the meaning of refuge and the act of going for refuge a series of readings drawn from the earliest Buddhist texts illustrating the essential qualities of the Triple Gem and a set of essays explaining aspects of the Triple Gem that often provoke questions in those who are new to the Buddha's teachings
This last section concludes with an essay that summarizes in a more systematic form many of the points raised in the earlier parts of the book
The readings on Dhamma form the core of the book organized in a pattern  called a graduated discourse  that the Buddha himself often used when introducing his teachings to new listeners
After beginning with the joys of generosity he would describe the joys of a virtuous life followed by the rewards of generosity and virtue to be experienced here and after death in heaven the drawbacks of sensual pleasures even heavenly ones and the rewards of renunciation
Then when he sensed that his listeners were inclined to look favorably on renunciation as a way to true happiness he would discuss the central message of his teaching the four noble truths
My hope is that this introduction will help answer many of the questions that newcomers bring to Buddhism and will spark new questions in their minds as they contemplate the possibility of developing within their own lives the qualities of refuge exemplified by the Triple Gem
The act of going for refuge marks the point where one commits oneself to taking the Dhamma or the Buddha's teaching as the primary guide to one's life
To understand why this commitment is called a refuge it's helpful to look at the history of the custom
In preBuddhist India going for refuge meant proclaiming one's allegiance to a patron  a powerful person or god  submitting to the patron's directives in hopes of receiving protection from danger in return
In the early years of the Buddha's teaching career his new followers adopted this custom to express their allegiance to the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha but in the Buddhist context this custom took on a new meaning
Buddhism is not a theistic religion  the Buddha is not a god  and so a person taking refuge in the Buddhist sense is not asking for the Buddha personally to intervene to provide protection
Still one of the Buddha's central teachings is that human life is fraught with dangers  from greed anger and delusion  and so the concept of refuge is central to the path of practice in that the practice is aimed at gaining release from those dangers
Because the mind is the source both of the dangers and of release there is a need for two levels of refuge external refuges which provide models and guidelines so that we can identify which qualities in the mind lead to danger and which to release and internal refuges ie the qualities leading to release that we develop in our own mind in imitation of our external models
The internal level is where true refuge is found
Although the tradition of going to refuge is an ancient practice it is still relevant for our own practice today for we are faced with the same internal dangers that faced people in the Buddha's time
We still need the same protection as they
When a Buddhist takes refuge it is essentially an act of taking refuge in the doctrine of karma It's an act of submission in that one is committed to living in line with the principle that actions based on skillful intentions lead to happiness while actions based on unskillful intentions lead to suffering it's an act of claiming protection in that by following the teaching one hopes to avoid the misfortunes that bad karma engenders
To take refuge in this way ultimately means to take refuge in the quality of our own intentions for that's where the essence of karma lies
The refuges in Buddhism  both on the internal and on the external levels  are the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha also known as the Triple Gem
They are called gems both because they are valuable and because in ancient times gems were believed to have protective powers
The Triple Gem outdoes other gems in this respect because its protective powers can be put to the test and can lead further than those of any physical gem all the way to absolute freedom from the uncertainties of the realm of aging illness and death
The Buddha on the external level refers to Siddhattha Gotama the Indian prince who renounced his royal titles and went into the forest meditating until he ultimately gained Awakening
To take refuge in the Buddha means not taking refuge in him as a person but taking refuge in the fact of his Awakening placing trust in the belief that he did awaken to the truth that he did so by developing qualities that we too can develop and that the truths to which he awoke provide the best perspective for the conduct of our life
The Dhamma on the external level refers to the path of practice the Buddha taught to this followers
This in turn is divided into three levels the words of his teachings the act of putting those teachings into practice and the attainment of Awakening as the result of that practice
This threeway division of the word Dhamma acts as a map showing how to take the external refuges and make them internal learning about the teachings using them to develop the qualities that the Buddha himself used to attain Awakening and then realizing the same release from danger that he found in the quality of Deathlessness that we can touch within
The word Sangha on the external level has two senses conventional and ideal
In its ideal sense the Sangha consists of all people lay or ordained who have practiced the Dhamma to the point of gaining at least a glimpse of the Deathless
In a conventional sense Sangha denotes the communities of ordained monks and nuns
The two meanings overlap but are not necessarily identical
Some members of the ideal Sangha are not ordained some monks and nuns have yet to touch the Deathless
All those who take refuge in the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha become members of the Buddha's fourfold assembly of followers monks nuns male lay devotees and female lay devotees
Although there's a widespread belief that all Buddhist followers are members of the Sangha this is not the case
Only those who are ordained are members of the conventional Sangha only those who have glimpsed the Deathless are members of the ideal Sangha
Nevertheless any followers who don't belong to the Sangha in either sense of the word still count as genuine Buddhists in that they are members of the Buddha's parisa
When taking refuge in the external Sangha one takes refuge in both senses of the Sangha but the two senses provide different levels of refuge
The conventional Sangha has helped keep the teaching alive for more than years
Without them we would never have learned what the Buddha taught
However not all members of the conventional Sangha are reliable models of behavior
So when looking for guidance in the conduct of our lives we must look to the living and recorded examples provided by the ideal Sangha
Without their example we would not know that Awakening is available to all and not just to the Buddha and how Awakening expresses itself in real life
On the internal level the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha are the skillful qualities we develop in our own minds in imitation of our external models
For instance the Buddha was a person of wisdom purity and compassion
When we develop wisdom purity and compassion in our own minds they form our refuge on an internal level
The Buddha tasted Awakening by developing conviction persistence mindfulness concentration and discernment
When we develop these same qualities to the point of attaining Awakening too that Awakening is our ultimate refuge
This is the point where the three aspects of the Triple Gem become one beyond the reach of greed anger and delusion and thus totally secure
'Indeed the Blessed One is worthy and rightly selfawakened consummate in knowledge and conduct wellgone an expert with regard to the cosmos unexcelled as a trainer for those people fit to be tamed the Teacher of divine and human beings awakened blessed'
'The Dhamma is wellexpounded by the Blessed One to be seen here and now timeless inviting verification pertinent to be realized by the wise for themselves'
'The Sangha of the Blessed One's disciples who have practiced well who have practiced straightforwardly who have practiced methodically who have practiced masterfully  in other words the four types of noble disciples when taken as pairs the eight when taken as individual types  they are the Sangha of the Blessed One's disciples worthy of gifts worthy of hospitality worthy of offerings worthy of respect the incomparable field of merit for the world'
I lived in refinement utmost refinement total refinement
My father even had lotus ponds made in our palace one where redlotuses bloomed one where white lotuses bloomed one where blue lotuses bloomed all for my sake
I used no sandalwood that was not from Varanasi
My turban was from Varanasi as were my tunic my lower garments and my outer cloak
A white sunshade was held over me day and night to protect me from cold heat dust dirt and dew
I had three palaces one for the cold season one for the hot season one for the rainy season
During the four months of the rainy season I was entertained in the rainyseason palace by minstrels without a single man among them and I did not once come down from the palace
Whereas the servants workers and retainers in other people's homes are fed meals of lentil soup and broken rice in my father's home the servants workers and retainers were fed wheat rice and meat
Even though I was endowed with such fortune such total refinement the thought occurred to me When an untaught runofthemill person himself subject to aging not beyond aging sees another who is aged he is horrified humiliated and disgusted oblivious to himself that he too is subject to aging not beyond aging
If I  who am subject to aging not beyond aging  were to be horrified humiliated and disgusted on seeing another person who is aged that would not be fitting for me As I noticed this the young person's intoxication with youth entirely dropped away
Even though I was endowed with such fortune such total refinement the thought occurred to me When an untaught runofthemill person himself subject to illness not beyond illness sees another who is ill he is horrified humiliated and disgusted oblivious to himself that he too is subject to illness not beyond illness
And if I  who am subject to illness not beyond illness  were to be horrified humiliated and disgusted on seeing another person who is ill that would not be fitting for me As I noticed this the healthy person's intoxication with health entirely dropped away
Even though I was endowed with such fortune such total refinement the thought occurred to me When an untaught runofthemill person himself subject to death not beyond death sees another who is dead he is horrified humiliated and disgusted oblivious to himself that he too is subject to death not beyond death
And if I  who am subject to death not beyond death  were to be horrified humiliated and disgusted on seeing another person who is dead that would not be fitting for me As I noticed this the living person's intoxication with life entirely dropped away
Before my Awakening when I was still an unawakened Bodhisatta being subject myself to birth aging illness death sorrow and defilement I sought what was subject to birth aging illness death sorrow and defilement
The thought occurred to me Why am I being subject myself to birth defilement seeking what is subject to birth defilement
What if I were to seek the unborn unaging unailing undying sorrowless undefiled unsurpassed security from bondage Unbinding
So at a later time when I was still young blackhaired endowed with the blessings of youth in the first stage of life I shaved off my hair and beard  though my parents wished otherwise and were grieving with tears on their faces  and I put on the ochre robe and went forth from the home life into homelessness
Having gone forth in search of what might be skillful seeking the unexcelled state of sublime peace I went to where Alara Kalama was staying and on arrival said to him I want to practice in this doctrine and discipline
When this was said he replied to me You may stay here
This doctrine is such that a wise person can soon enter and dwell in his own teacher's knowledge having realized it for himself through direct knowledge
I quickly learned the doctrine
As far as mere lipreciting and repetition I could speak the words of knowledge the words of the elders and I could affirm that I knew and saw  I along with others
I thought It isn't through mere conviction alone that Alara Kalama declares 'I have entered and dwell in this Dhamma having realized it directly for myself' Certainly he dwells knowing and seeing this Dhamma So I went to him and said To what extent do you declare that you have entered and dwell in this Dhamma When this was said he declared the dimension of nothingness
I thought Not only does Alara Kalama have conviction persistence mindfulness concentration and discernment
I too have conviction persistence mindfulness concentration and discernment
Suppose I were to endeavor to realize for myself the Dhamma that Alara Kalama declares he has entered and dwells in So it was not long before I entered and dwelled in that Dhamma having realized it for myself through direct knowledge
I went to him and said Friend Kalama is this the extent to which you have entered and dwell in this Dhamma having realized it for yourself through direct knowledge
Yes This is the extent to which I too have entered and dwell in this Dhamma having realized it for myself through direct knowledge
It is a gain for us a great gain for us that we have such a companion in the holy life As I am so are you as you are so am Come friend let us now lead this community together
In this way did Alara Kalama my teacher place me his pupil on the same level with himself and pay me great honor
But the thought occurred to me This Dhamma leads not to disenchantment to dispassion to cessation to stilling to direct knowledge to Awakening nor to Unbinding but only to reappearance in the dimension of nothingness So dissatisfied with that Dhamma I left
Now Aggivessana these three similes  spontaneous never before heard  appeared to me
Suppose there were a wet sappy piece of timber lying in the water and a man were to come along with an upper firestick thinking 'I'll light a fire
I'll produce heat' Now what do you think
Would he be able to light a fire and produce heat by rubbing the upper firestick in the wet sappy timber lying in the water
No Master Gotama So it is with any brahman or contemplative who does not live withdrawn from sensuality in body and mind and whose desire infatuation urge thirst and fever for sensuality is not relinquished and stilled within him Whether or not he feels painful racking piercing feelings due to his striving he is incapable of knowledge vision and unexcelled selfawakening
Then a second simile  spontaneous never before heard  appeared to me
Suppose there were a wet sappy piece of timber lying on land far from water and a man were to come along with an upper firestick thinking 'I'll light a fire
I'll produce heat' Now what do you think
Would he be able to light a fire and produce heat by rubbing the upper firestick in the wet sappy timber lying on land
No Master Gotama So it is with any brahman or contemplative who lives withdrawn from sensuality in body only but whose desire infatuation urge thirst and fever for sensuality is not relinquished and stilled within him Whether or not he feels painful racking piercing feelings due to his striving he is incapable of knowledge vision and unexcelled selfawakening
Then a third simile  spontaneous never before heard  appeared to me
Suppose there were a dry sapless piece of timber lying on land far from water and a man were to come along with an upper firestick thinking 'I'll light a fire
I'll produce heat' Now what do you think
Would he be able to light a fire and produce heat by rubbing the upper firestick in the dry sapless timber lying on land
Yes Master Gotama So it is with any brahman or contemplative who lives withdrawn from sensuality in body and mind and whose desire infatuation urge thirst and fever for sensuality is relinquished and stilled within him Whether or not he feels painful racking piercing feelings due to his striving he is capable of knowledge vision and unexcelled selfawakening
I thought 'Suppose that I clenching my teeth and pressing my tongue against the roof of my mouth were to beat down constrain and crush my mind with my awareness' So just as if a strong man seizing a weaker man by the head or the throat or the shoulders would beat him down constrain and crush him in the same way I beat down constrained and crushed my mind with my awareness
As I did so sweat poured from my armpits
But although tireless persistence was aroused in me and unmuddled mindfulness established my body was aroused and uncalm because of the painful exertion
But the painful feeling that arose in this way did not invade my mind or remain
I thought 'Suppose I were to become absorbed in the trance of nonbreathing' So I stopped the inbreaths and outbreaths in my nose and mouth
As I did so there was a loud roaring of winds coming out my earholes just like the loud roar of winds coming out of a smith's bellows So I stopped the inbreaths and outbreaths in my nose and mouth and ears
As I did so extreme forces sliced through my head just as if a strong man were slicing my head open with a sharp sword Extreme pains arose in my head just as if a strong man were tightening a turban made of tough leather straps around my head Extreme forces carved up my stomach cavity just as if a butcher or his apprentice were to carve up the stomach cavity of an ox There was an extreme burning in my body just as if two strong men grabbing a weaker man by the arms were to roast and broil him over a pit of hot embers
But although tireless persistence was aroused in me and unmuddled mindfulness established my body was aroused and uncalm because of the painful exertion
But the painful feeling that arose in this way did not invade my mind or remain
Devas on seeing me said 'Gotama the contemplative is dead' Other devas said 'He isn't dead he's dying' Others said 'He's neither dead nor dying he's an arahant for this is the way arahants live'
I thought 'Suppose I were to practice going altogether without food' Then devas came to me and said 'Dear sir please don't practice going altogether without food
If you go altogether without food we'll infuse divine nourishment in through your pores and you will survive on that' I thought 'If I were to claim to be completely fasting while these devas are infusing divine nourishment in through my pores I would be lying' So I dismissed them saying 'Enough'
I thought 'Suppose I were to take only a little food at a time only a handful at a time of bean soup lentil soup vetch soup or pea soup' So I took only a little food at a time only handful at a time of bean soup lentil soup vetch soup or pea soup
My body became extremely emaciated
Simply from my eating so little my limbs became like the jointed segments of vine stems or bamboo stems My backside became like a camel's hoof My spine stood out like a string of beads My ribs jutted out like the jutting rafters of an old rundown barn The gleam of my eyes appeared to be sunk deep in my eye sockets like the gleam of water deep in a well My scalp shriveled and withered like a green bitter gourd shriveled and withered in the heat and the wind The skin of my belly became so stuck to my spine that when I thought of touching my belly I grabbed hold of my spine as well and when I thought of touching my spine I grabbed hold of the skin of my belly as well If I urinated or defecated I fell over on my face right there Simply from my eating so little if I tried to ease my body by rubbing my limbs with my hands the hair  rotted at its roots  fell from my body as I rubbed
I thought 'Whatever brahmans or contemplatives in the past have felt painful racking piercing feelings due to their striving this is the utmost
None have been greater than this
Whatever brahmans or contemplatives in the future in the present are feeling painful racking piercing feelings due to their striving this is the utmost
None is greater than this
But with this racking practice of austerities I have not attained any superior human state any distinction in knowledge or vision worthy of the noble ones
Could there be another path to Awakening'
I thought 'I recall once when my father the Sakyan was working and I was sitting in the cool shade of a roseapple tree then  quite withdrawn from sensuality withdrawn from unskillful mental qualities  I entered and remained in the first jhana rapture and pleasure born from withdrawal accompanied by directed thought and evaluation
Could that be the path to Awakening' Then following on that memory came the realization 'That is the path to Awakening So why am I afraid of that pleasure that has nothing to do with sensuality nothing to do with unskillful mental qualities' I thought 'I am no longer afraid of that pleasure but it is not easy to achieve that pleasure with a body so extremely emaciated' So I took some solid food some rice and porridge
Now five monks had been attending on me thinking 'If Gotama our contemplative achieves some higher state he will tell us' But when they saw me taking some solid food  some rice and porridge  they were disgusted and left me thinking 'Gotama the contemplative is living luxuriously
He has abandoned his exertion and is backsliding into abundance'
So when I had taken solid food and regained strength then  quite withdrawn from sensuality withdrawn from unskillful mental qualities I entered and remained in the first jhana rapture and pleasure born from withdrawal accompanied by directed thought and evaluation
But the pleasant feeling that arose in this way did not invade my mind or remain
With the stilling of directed thoughts  evaluations I entered and remained in the second jhana rapture and pleasure born of composure unification of awareness free from directed thought and evaluation  internal assurance With the fading of rapture I remained in equanimity mindful and alert and physically sensitive of pleasure
I entered and remained in the third jhana of which the Noble Ones declare 'Equanimous and mindful he has a pleasant abiding' With the abandoning of pleasure and pain  as with the earlier disappearance of elation and distress  I entered and remained in the fourth jhana purity of equanimity and mindfulness neither pleasure nor pain
But the pleasant feeling that arose in this way did not invade my mind or remain
When the mind was thus concentrated purified bright unblemished rid of defilement pliant malleable steady and attained to imperturbability I directed it to the knowledge of recollecting my past lives
I recollected my manifold past lives ie one birth two five ten fifty a hundred a thousand a hundred thousand many eons of cosmic contraction many eons of cosmic expansion many eons of cosmic contraction and expansion 'There I had such a name belonged to such a clan had such an appearance
Such was my food such my experience of pleasure and pain such the end of my life
Passing away from that state I rearose there
There too I had such a name belonged to such a clan had such an appearance
Such was my food such my experience of pleasure and pain such the end of my life
Passing away from that state I rearose here' Thus I remembered my manifold past lives in their modes and details
This was the first knowledge I attained in the first watch of the night
Ignorance was destroyed knowledge arose darkness was destroyed light arose  as happens in one who is heedful ardent and resolute
But the pleasant feeling that arose in this way did not invade my mind or remain
When the mind was thus concentrated purified bright unblemished rid of defilement pliant malleable steady and attained to imperturbability I directed it to the knowledge of the passing away and reappearance of beings
I saw  by means of the divine eye purified and surpassing the human  beings passing away and reappearing and I discerned how they are inferior and superior beautiful and ugly fortunate and unfortunate in accordance with their kamma 'These beings  who were endowed with bad conduct of body speech and mind who reviled the noble ones held wrong views and undertook actions under the influence of wrong views  with the breakup of the body after death have reappeared in the plane of deprivation the bad destination the lower realms in hell
But these beings  who were endowed with good conduct of body speech and mind who did not revile the noble ones who held right views and undertook actions under the influence of right views  with the breakup of the body after death have reappeared in the good destinations in the heavenly world' Thus  by means of the divine eye purified and surpassing the human  I saw beings passing away and reappearing and I discerned how they are inferior and superior beautiful and ugly fortunate and unfortunate in accordance with their kamma
This was the second knowledge I attained in the second watch of the night
Ignorance was destroyed knowledge arose darkness was destroyed light arose  as happens in one who is heedful ardent and resolute
But the pleasant feeling that arose in this way did not invade my mind or remain
When the mind was thus concentrated purified bright unblemished rid of defilement pliant malleable steady and attained to imperturbability I directed it to the knowledge of the ending of the mental effluents
I discerned as it had come to be that 'This is stress This is the origination of stress This is the cessation of stress This is the way leading to the cessation of stress These are effluents This is the origination of effluents This is the cessation of effluents This is the way leading to the cessation of effluents' My heart thus knowing thus seeing was released from the effluent of sensuality released from the effluent of becoming released from the effluent of ignorance
With release there was the knowledge 'Released' I discerned that 'Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task done
There is nothing further for this world'
This was the third knowledge I attained in the third watch of the night
Ignorance was destroyed knowledge arose darkness was destroyed light arose  as happens in one who is heedful ardent and resolute
But the pleasant feeling that arose in this way did not invade my mind or remain
Now at that time Subhadda the Wanderer was staying in Kusinara
He heard that 'Tonight in the last watch of the night the total Unbinding of Gotama the contemplative will take place' Then this thought occurred to him 'I have heard the elder wanderers teachers of teachers saying that only once in a long long time do Tathagatas  worthy ones rightly selfawakened  appear in the world
Tonight in the last watch of the night the total Unbinding of Gotama the contemplative will take place
Now there is a doubt that has arisen in me but I have faith that he could teach me the Dhamma in such a way that I might abandon that doubt'
So he went to the Mallan Sal Tree grove and on arrival said to Ven
Ananda 'I have heard the elder wanderers teachers of teachers saying that only once in a long long time do Tathagatas  worthy ones rightly selfawakened  appear in the world
Tonight in the last watch of the night the total Unbinding of Gotama the contemplative will take place
Now there is a doubt that has arisen in me but I have faith that he could teach me the Dhamma in such a way that I might abandon that doubt
It would be good Ven
Ananda if you would let me see him'
When this was said Ven
Ananda said to him 'Enough friend Subhadda
Do not bother the Blessed One
The Blessed One is tired'
For a second time For a third time Subhadda the Wanderer said to Ven
Ananda 'It would be good Ven
Ananda if you would let me see him'
For a third time Ven
Ananda said to him 'Enough friend Subhadda
Do not bother the Blessed One
The Blessed One is tired'
Now the Blessed One heard the exchange between Ven
Ananda and Subhadda the Wanderer and so he said to Ven
Ananda 'Enough Ananda
Do not stand in his way
Let him see the Tathagata
Whatever he asks me will all be for the sake of knowledge and not to be bothersome
And whatever I answer when asked he will quickly understand'
So Ven
Ananda said to Subhadda the Wanderer 'Go ahead friend Subhadda
The Blessed One gives you his leave'
Then Subhadda went to the Blessed One and exchanged courtesies and after the exchange of courtesies sat to one side
As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One 'Lord these brahmans and contemplatives each with his group each with his community each the teacher of his group an honored leader wellregarded by people at large  ie Purana Kassapa Makkhali Gosala Ajita Kesakambalin Pakudha Kaccayana Sañjaya Belatthaputta and the Nigantha Nathaputta Do they all have direct knowledge as they themselves claim or do they all not have direct knowledge or do some of them have direct knowledge and some of them not'
'Enough Subhadda
Put this question aside
I will teach you the Dhamma
Listen and pay close attention
I will speak'
'Yes lord' Subhadda answered and the Blessed One said 'In any doctrine and discipline where the noble eightfold path is not found no contemplative of the first second third fourth order is found
But in any doctrine and discipline where the noble eightfold path is found contemplatives of the first second third fourth order are found
The noble eightfold path is found in this doctrine and discipline and right here there are contemplatives of the first second third fourth order
Other teachings are empty of knowledgeable contemplatives
And if the monks dwell rightly this world will not be empty of arahants
And no contemplative of the second third fourth order
Other teachings are empty of knowledgeable contemplatives
And if the monks dwell rightly this world will not be empty of arahants'
Then Subhadda the Wanderer said 'Magnificent lord magnificent
In many ways has the Blessed One made the Dhamma clear  just as if one were to place upright what has been overturned to reveal what has been hidden to point out the way to one who is lost or to set out a lamp in the darkness so that those with eyes might see forms
I go to the Blessed One for refuge and to the Dhamma and to the community of monks
Let me obtain the going forth in the Blessed One's presence let me obtain admission'
'Anyone Subhadda who has previously belonged to another sect and who desires the going forth and admission in this doctrine and discipline must first undergo probation for four months
If at the end of four months the monks feel so moved they give him the going forth and admit him to the monk's state
But I know distinctions among individuals in this matter'
'Lord if that is so I am willing to undergo probation for four years
If at the end of four years the monks feel so moved let them give me the going forth and admit me to the monk's state'
Then the Blessed One said to Ven
Ananda 'Very well then Ananda give Subhadda the going forth'
'Yes lord' Ananda answered
Then Subhadda said to Ven
Ananda 'It is a gain for you Ananda a great gain that you have been anointed here in the Teacher's presence with the pupil's anointing'
Then Subhadda the Wanderer received the going forth and the admission in the Blessed One's presence
And not long after his admission  dwelling alone secluded heedful ardent and resolute  he in no long time reached and remained in the supreme goal of the holy life for which clansmen rightly go forth from home into homelessness knowing and realizing it for himself in the here and now
He knew 'Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task done
There is nothing further for the sake of this world' And thus Ven
Subhadda became another one of the arahants the last of the Blessed One's facetoface disciples
Then the Blessed One addressed the monks 'I exhort you monks All processes are subject to decay
Bring about completion by being heedful' Those were the Tathagata's last words
Then the Blessed One entered the first jhana
Emerging from that he entered the second
Emerging from that he entered the third the fourth the dimension of the infinitude of space the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness the dimension of nothingness the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception the cessation of perception and feeling
Then Ven
Ananda said to Ven
Anuruddha The Blessed One sir has entered total Unbinding
No friend the Blessed One has not entered total Unbinding
He has attained the cessation of perception and feeling
Then emerging from the cessation of perception and feeling the Blessed One entered the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception the dimension of nothingness the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness the dimension of the infinitude of space the fourth jhana the third the second the first jhana
Emerging from the first jhana he entered the second the third the fourth jhana
Emerging from the fourth jhana he entered total Unbinding in the interim
When the Blessed One had attained total Unbinding Sakka ruler of the gods uttered this stanza
There are these five facts that one should reflect on often whether one is a woman or a man lay or ordained
Which five
I am subject to aging have not gone beyond aging
I am subject to illness have not gone beyond illness
I am subject to death have not gone beyond death
I will grow different separate from all that is dear and appealing to me
I am the owner of my actions heir to my actions born of my actions related through my actions and have my actions as my arbitrator
Whatever I do for good or for evil to that will I fall heir
These are the five facts that one should reflect on often whether one is a woman or a man lay or ordained
Now based on what line of reasoning should one often reflect that I am subject to aging have not gone beyond aging
There are beings who are intoxicated with a youth's intoxication with youth
Because of that intoxication with youth they conduct themselves in a bad way in body in speech and in mind
But when they often reflect on that fact that youth's intoxication with youth will either be entirely abandoned or grow weaker
Now based on what line of reasoning should one often reflect that I am subject to illness have not gone beyond illness
There are beings who are intoxicated with a healthy person's intoxication with health
Because of that intoxication with health they conduct themselves in a bad way in body in speech and in mind
But when they often reflect on that fact that healthy person's intoxication with health will either be entirely abandoned or grow weaker
Now based on what line of reasoning should one often reflect that I am subject to death have not gone beyond death
There are beings who are intoxicated with a living person's intoxication with life
Because of that intoxication with life they conduct themselves in a bad way in body in speech and in mind
But when they often reflect on that fact that living person's intoxication with life will either be entirely abandoned or grow weaker
Now based on what line of reasoning should one often reflect that I will grow different separate from all that is dear and appealing to me
There are beings who feel desire and passion for the things they find dear and appealing
Because of that passion they conduct themselves in a bad way in body in speech and in mind
But when they often reflect on that fact that desire and passion for the things they find dear and appealing will either be entirely abandoned or grow weaker
Now based on what line of reasoning should one often reflect that I am the owner of my actions heir to my actions born of my actions related through my actions and have my actions as my arbitrator
Whatever I do for good or for evil to that will I fall heir
There are beings who conduct themselves in a bad way in body in speech and in mind
But when they often reflect on that fact that bad conduct in body speech and mind will either be entirely abandoned or grow weaker
Now a noble disciple considers this I am not the only one subject to aging who has not gone beyond aging
To the extent that there are beings  past and future passing away and rearising  all beings are subject to aging have not gone beyond aging When heshe often reflects on this the path take birth
Heshe sticks with that path develops it cultivates it
As heshe sticks with that path develops it and cultivates it the fetters are abandoned the latent tendencies destroyed

I do not see any one quality by which unarisen skillful qualities arise and arisen unskillful qualities subside like friendship with admirable people
When a person is friends with admirable people unarisen skillful qualities arise and arisen unskillful qualities subside
Now what TigerPaw is friendship with admirable people
There is the case where a lay person in whatever town or village he may dwell spends time with householders or householders' sons young or old who are advanced in virtue
He talks with them engages them in discussions
He emulates consummate conviction in those who are consummate in conviction consummate virtue in those who are consummate in virtue consummate generosity in those who are consummate in generosity and consummate discernment in those who are consummate in discernment
This is called friendship with admirable people
A female noble disciple who grows in terms of these five types of growth grows in the noble growth grasps hold of what is essential what is excellent in the body
Which five
She grows in terms of conviction in terms of virtue in terms of learning in terms of generosity in terms of discernment
Growing in terms of these five types of growth the female noble disciple grows in the noble growth grasps hold of what is essential what is excellent in the body
 S XXXVII
'Kamma should be known
The cause by which kamma comes into play should be known
The diversity in kamma should be known
The result of kamma should be known
The cessation of kamma should be known
The path of practice for the cessation of kamma should be known' Thus it has been said
Why was it said
Intention I tell you is kamma
Intending one does kamma by way of body speech and intellect
And what is the cause by which kamma comes into play
Contact
And what is the diversity in kamma
There is kamma to be experienced in purgatory kamma to be experienced in the realm of common animals kamma to be experienced in the realm of the hungry shades kamma to be experienced in the human world kamma to be experienced in the celestial worlds
And what is the result of kamma
The result of kamma is of three sorts I tell you that which arises right here and now that which arises later and that which arises following that
And what is the cessation of kamma
From the cessation of contact is the cessation of kamma
And what is the way leading to the cessation of kamma
Just this noble eightfold path right view right resolve right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness right concentration
Now when a noble disciple discerns kamma in this way the cause by which kamma comes into play in this way the diversity of kamma in this way the result of kamma in this way the cessation of kamma in this way and the path of practice leading to the cessation of kamma in this way then he discerns this penetrative holy life as the cessation of kamma
The Buddha What do you think Rahula What is a mirror for
Rahula For reflection sir
The Buddha In the same way Rahula bodily acts verbal acts and mental acts are to be done with repeated reflection
Whenever you want to perform a bodily act you should reflect on it 'This bodily act I want to perform  would it lead to selfaffliction to the affliction of others or to both
Is it an unskillful bodily act with painful consequences painful results' If on reflection you know that it would lead to selfaffliction to the affliction of others or to both it would be an unskillful bodily act with painful consequences painful results then any bodily act of that sort is absolutely unfit for you to do
But if on reflection you know that it would not cause affliction it would be a skillful bodily act with happy consequences happy results then any bodily act of that sort is fit for you to do
While you are performing a bodily act you should reflect on it 'This bodily act I am doing  is it leading to selfaffliction to the affliction of others or to both
Is it an unskillful bodily act with painful consequences painful results' If on reflection you know that it is leading to selfaffliction to affliction of others or both you should give it up
But if on reflection you know that it is not you may continue with it
Having performed a bodily act you should reflect on it If on reflection you know that it led to selfaffliction to the affliction of others or to both it was an unskillful bodily act with painful consequences painful results then you should confess it reveal it lay it open to the Teacher or to a knowledgeable companion in the holy life
Having confessed it you should exercise restraint in the future
But if on reflection you know that it did not lead to affliction it was a skillful bodily act with happy consequences happy results then you should stay mentally refreshed and joyful training day and night in skillful mental qualities
Having performed a mental act you should reflect on it If on reflection you know that it led to selfaffliction to the affliction of others or to both it was an unskillful mental act with painful consequences painful results then you should feel horrified humiliated and disgusted with it
Feeling horrified you should exercise restraint in the future
But if on reflection you know that it did not lead to affliction it was a skillful mental act with happy consequences happy results then you should stay mentally refreshed and joyful training day and night in skillful mental qualities
Rahula all the brahmans and contemplatives in the course of the past who purified their bodily acts verbal acts and mental acts did it through repeated reflection on their bodily acts verbal acts and mental acts in just this way
All the brahmans and contemplatives in the course of the future All the brahmans and contemplatives at present who purify their bodily acts verbal acts and mental acts do it through repeated reflection on their bodily acts verbal acts and mental acts in just this way
Therefore Rahula you should train yourself 'I will purify my bodily acts through repeated reflection
I will purify my verbal acts through repeated reflection
I will purify my mental acts through repeated reflection' Thus you should train yourself
That is what the Blessed One said
Pleased Ven
Rahula delighted in the Blessed One's words
These five things are welcome agreeable pleasant and hard to obtain in the world
Which five
Long life beauty pleasure status rebirth in heaven Now I tell you these five things are not to be obtained by reason of prayers or wishes
If they were to be obtained by reason of prayers or wishes who here would lack them
It is not fitting for the noble disciple who desires long life to pray for it or to delight in doing so
Instead the noble disciple who desires long life should follow the path of practice leading to long life
In so doing he will attain long life either human or divine

I have heard that at one time the Blessed One was staying in Savatthi at Jeta's Grove Anathapindika's monastery
Then a certain deva in the far extreme of the night her extreme radiance lighting up the entirety of Jeta's Grove approached the Blessed One
On approaching having bowed down to the Blessed One she stood to one side
As she was standing there she addressed him with a verse
These are the five rewards of generosity One is dear and appealing to people at large one is admired by good people one's good name is spread about one does not stray from the rightful duties of the householder and with the breakup of the body at death one reappears in a good destination in the heavenly worlds
If beings knew as I know the results of giving and sharing they would not eat without having given nor would the stain of miserliness overcome their minds
Even if it were their last bite their last mouthful they would not eat without having shared if there were someone to receive their gift
But because beings do not know as I know the results of giving and sharing they eat without having given
The stain of miserliness overcomes their minds
Now on that occasion Princess Sumana  with an entourage of ladiesinwaiting riding on carriages  went to where the Buddha was staying
On arrival having bowed down she sat to one side
As she was sitting there she said to the Blessed One Suppose there were two disciples of the Blessed One equal in conviction virtue and discernment but one was a giver of alms and the other was not
At the breakup of the body after death they would reappear in a good destination in the heavenly world
Having become devas would there be any distinction any difference between the two
Yes there would said the Blessed One
The one who was a giver of alms on becoming a deva would surpass the other in five areas in divine life span divine beauty divine pleasure divine status and divine power And if they were to fall from there and reappear in this world Having become human beings would there be any distinction any difference between the two
Yes there would said the Blessed One
The one who was a giver of alms on becoming a human being would surpass the other in five areas in human life span human beauty human pleasure human status and human power And if they were to go forth from home into the homeless life of a monk Having gone forth would there be any distinction any difference between the two
Yes there would said the Blessed One
The one who was a giver of alms on going forth would surpass the other in five areas He would often be asked to make use of robes it would be rare that he wouldn't be asked
He would often be asked to take food to make use of shelter to make use of medicine it would be rare that he wouldn't be asked
His companions in the holy life would often treat him with pleasing actions pleasing words pleasing thoughts and present him with pleasing gifts and rarely with unpleasing And if both were to attain arahantship would there be any distinction any difference between their attainments of arahantship
In that case I tell you that there would be no difference between the two as to their release
It is awesome lord and astounding
Just this is reason enough to give alms to make merit in that it benefits one as a deva as a human being and as a monk

Cleansing with regard to the body Cunda is threefold cleansing with regard to speech is fourfold and cleansing with regard to the mind threefold

Abandoning divisive speech he abstains from divisive speech
What he has heard here he does not tell there to break those people apart from these people here

He believes There is what is given what is offered what is sacrificed
There are fruits and results of good and bad actions
There is this world and the next world
There is mother and father

There are these five benefits in being virtuous in being consummate in virtue
Which five
There is the case where a virtuous person consummate in virtue through not being heedless in his affairs amasses a great quantity of wealth His good name is spread about When approaching an assembly of nobles brahmans householders or contemplatives he does so unabashed and with assurance He dies without becoming delirious With the breakup of the body after death he reappears in a good destination in the heavenly world
These are the five benefits in being virtuous in being consummate in virtue
The Buddha Suppose that a Universal Monarch possessed the seven treasures and the four forms of prowess
Now what do you think
Would he experience pleasure and joy
The monks Yes lord
Then taking a small stone the size of his hand the Blessed One said What do you think
Which is larger this small stone that I have taken the size of my hand or the Himalayas king of mountains
It is minuscule the small stone It does not count beside the Himalayas the king of mountains
It is not even a small fraction
There is no comparison
In the same way the pleasure and joy that the Universal Monarch experiences on account of his seven treasures and four forms of prowess do not count beside the pleasures of heaven
They are not even a small fraction
There is no comparison
Now what is the allure of sensuality
There are monks these five strings of sensuality
Which five
Forms cognizable via the eye  agreeable pleasing charming endearing fostering desire enticing
Sounds cognizable via the ear Aromas cognizable via the nose Flavors cognizable via the tongue Tactile sensations cognizable via the body  agreeable pleasing charming endearing fostering desire enticing
Now whatever pleasure or joy arises in dependence on these five strings of sensuality that is the allure of sensuality
And what is the drawback of sensuality
There is the case where on account of the occupation by which a clansman makes a living  whether checking or accounting or calculating or plowing or trading or cattle tending or archery or as a king's man or whatever the occupation may be  he faces cold he faces heat being harassed by mosquitoes flies wind sun and creeping things dying from hunger and thirst
Now this drawback in the case of sensuality this mass of stress visible here and now has sensuality for its reason sensuality for its source sensuality for its cause the reason being simply sensuality
If the clansman gains no wealth while thus working and striving and making effort he sorrows grieves and laments beats his breast becomes distraught 'My work is in vain my efforts are fruitless' Now this drawback too in the case of sensuality this mass of stress visible here and now has sensuality for its reason
If the clansman gains wealth while thus working and striving and making effort he experiences pain and distress in protecting it 'How shall neither kings nor thieves make off with my property nor fire burn it nor water sweep it away nor hateful heirs make off with it' And as he thus guards and watches over his property kings or thieves make off with it or fire burns it or water sweeps it away or hateful heirs make off with it
And he sorrows grieves and laments beats his breast becomes distraught 'What was mine is no more' Now this drawback too in the case of sensuality this mass of stress visible here and now has sensuality for its reason
Furthermore it is with sensuality for the reason sensuality for the source sensuality for the cause the reason being simply sensuality that kings quarrel with kings nobles with nobles brahmans with brahmans householders with householders mother with child child with mother father with child child with father brother with brother sister with sister brother with sister sister with brother friend with friend
And then in their quarrels brawls and disputes they attack one another with fists or with clods or with sticks or with knives so that they incur death or deadly pain
Now this drawback too in the case of sensuality this mass of stress visible here and now has sensuality for its reason
Furthermore it is with sensuality for the reason sensuality for the source that taking swords and shields and buckling on bows and quivers charge into battle massed in double array while arrows and spears are flying and swords are flashing and there they are wounded by arrows and spears and their heads are cut off by swords so that they incur death or deadly pain
Now this drawback too in the case of sensuality this mass of stress visible here and now has sensuality for its reason
Furthermore it is with sensuality for the reason sensuality for the source that taking swords and shields and buckling on bows and quivers charge slippery bastions while arrows and spears are flying and swords are flashing and there they are splashed with boiling cow dung and crushed under heavy weights and their heads are cut off by swords so that they incur death or deadly pain
Now this drawback too in the case of sensuality this mass of stress visible here and now has sensuality for its reason sensuality for its source sensuality for its cause the reason being simply sensuality
And what is the emancipation from sensuality
Whatever is the subduing of passion and desire the abandoning of passion and desire for sensuality that is the emancipation from sensuality
Which do you think is greater the tears you have shed while transmigrating and wandering this long time  crying and weeping from being joined with what is displeasing from being separated from what is pleasing  or the water in the four great oceans This is the greater The tears you have shed Why is that
From an inconceivable beginning comes transmigration
A beginning point is not evident although beings hindered by ignorance and fettered by craving are transmigrating and wandering on
Long have you thus experienced stress experienced pain experienced loss swelling the cemeteries  long enough to become disenchanted with all conditioned things enough to become dispassionate enough to be released
Janussonin I hold that there is no one who subject to death is not afraid or in terror of death
The Buddha There are those who subject to death are afraid and in terror of death
And there are those who subject to death are not afraid or in terror of death
And who is the person who subject to death is afraid and in terror of death
There is the case of the person who has not abandoned passion desire fondness thirst fever and craving for sensuality
When he comes down with a serious disease the thought occurs to him O those beloved sensual pleasures will be taken from me and I will be taken from them He grieves and is tormented weeps beats his breast and grows delirious
Furthermore there is the case of the person who has not abandoned passion desire fondness thirst fever and craving for the body
When he is touched by a serious disease the thought occurs to him O my beloved body will be taken from me and I will be taken from my body He grieves and is tormented weeps beats his breast and grows delirious
Furthermore there is the case of the person who has not done what is good has not done what is skillful has not given protection to those in fear and instead has done what is evil savage and cruel
When he comes down with a serious disease the thought occurs to him After death I am headed for the destination of those who have done what is evil savage and cruel He grieves and is tormented weeps beats his breast and grows delirious
Furthermore there is the case of the person in doubt and perplexity who has not arrived at certainty with regard to the True Dhamma
When he comes down with a serious disease the thought occurs to him How doubtful and perplexed I am
I have not arrived at any certainty with regard to the True Dhamma He grieves and is tormented weeps beats his breast and grows delirious
This is another person who subject to death is afraid and in terror of death
And who is the person who is not afraid or in terror of death
There is the case of the person who has abandoned passion desire fondness thirst fever and craving for sensuality who has abandoned passion desire fondness thirst fever and craving for the body who has done what is good what is skillful has given protection to those in fear and has not done what is evil savage or cruel who has no doubt or perplexity who has arrived at certainty with regard to the True Dhamma
When he comes down with a serious disease he does not grieve is not tormented does not weep or beat his breast or grow delirious
This is another person who subject to death is not afraid or in terror of death
Now at that time Ven
Bhaddiya Kaligodha on going to a forest to the foot of a tree or to an empty dwelling would repeatedly exclaim What bliss
What bliss Many monks heard him repeatedly exclaim What bliss
What bliss and on hearing him the thought occurred to them There's no doubt but that Ven
Bhaddiya Kaligodha is not enjoying the holy life for when he was a householder he enjoyed royal pleasures so that now on recollecting them he is exclaiming What bliss
What bliss They went to the Blessed One and told him and he told a certain monk Come monk
In my name call Bhaddiya saying The Teacher calls you my friend
Yes lord the monk answered
Then Ven
Bhaddiya went to where the Blessed One was staying and on arrival having bowed down sat to one side
As he was sitting there the Blessed One said to him Is it true Bhaddiya that on going to a forest to the foot of a tree or to an empty dwelling you repeatedly exclaim What bliss
What bliss
Yes lord
What do you have in mind that you repeatedly exclaim What bliss
What bliss
Before when I was a householder maintaining my reign I had guards posted within and without the royal apartments within and without the city within and without the countryside
But even though I was thus guarded thus protected I dwelled in fear  agitated distrustful and afraid
But now on going alone to a forest to the foot of a tree or to an empty dwelling I dwell without fear unagitated confident and unafraid  unconcerned unruffled my wants satisfied with my mind like a wild deer
This is what I have in mind that I repeatedly exclaim What bliss
What bliss
Now this monks is the noble truth of stress Birth is stressful aging is stressful death is stressful sorrow lamentation pain distress and despair are stressful association with the unbeloved is stressful separation from the loved is stressful not getting what is wanted is stressful
In short the five aggregates for sustenance are stressful
And this monks is the noble truth of the origination of stress the craving that makes for further becoming  accompanied by passion and delight relishing now here and now there  ie craving for sensual pleasure craving for becoming craving for nonbecoming
And this monks is the noble truth of the cessation of stress the remainderless fading and cessation renunciation relinquishment release and letting go of that very craving
And this monks is the noble truth of the way leading to the cessation of stress precisely this Noble Eightfold Path  right view right intention right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness right concentration
Vision arose insight arose discernment arose knowledge arose illumination arose within me with regard to things never heard before 'This is the noble truth of stress''This noble truth of stress is to be comprehended''This noble truth of stress has been comprehended'
'This is the noble truth of the origination of stress''This noble truth of the origination of stress is to be abandoned''This noble truth of the origination of stress has been abandoned'
'This is the noble truth of the cessation of stress''This noble truth of the cessation of stress is to be directly experienced''This noble truth of the cessation of stress has been directly experienced'
'This is the noble truth of the way leading to the cessation of stress''This noble truth of the way leading to the cessation of stress is to be developed''This noble truth of the way leading to the cessation of stress has been developed'
And monks as long as this knowledge and vision of mine  with its three rounds and twelve permutations concerning these four noble truths as they actually are  was not pure I did not claim to have directly awakened to the unexcelled right selfawakening But as soon as this knowledge and vision of mine  with its three rounds and twelve permutations concerning these four noble truths as they actually are  was truly pure then did I claim to have directly awakened to the unexcelled right selfawakening The knowledge and vision arose in me 'Unshakable is my release
This is the last birth
There is now no further becoming'
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying at Varanasi in the Game Refuge at Isipatana
There he addressed the group of five monks
'Physical form monks is not the self
If physical form were the self this physical form would not lend itself to disease
One could get physical form to be like this and not be like that
But precisely because physical form is not the self it lends itself to disease
And one cannot get physical form to be like this and not be like that
'Feeling is not the self Perception is not the self Mental fabrications are not the self
'Consciousness is not the self
If consciousness were the self this consciousness would not lend itself to disease
One could get consciousness to be like this and not be like that
But precisely because consciousness is not the self it lends itself to disease
And one cannot get consciousness to be like this and not be like that
'What do you think monks  Is physical form constant or inconstant'  'Inconstant Lord'  'And whatever is inconstant Is it easeful or stressful'  'Stressful Lord'  'And is it right to assume with regard to whatever is inconstant stressful subject to change that This is mine
This is my self
This is what I am'  'No Lord'
'Is feeling constant or inconstant Is perception constant or inconstant Are mental fabrications constant or inconstant
'Is consciousness constant or inconstant'  'Inconstant Lord'  'And whatever is inconstant Is it easeful or stressful'  'Stressful Lord'  'And is it right to assume with regard to whatever is inconstant stressful subject to change that This is mine
This is my self
This is what I am'  'No Lord'
'Thus monks any physical form whatsoever  past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or near every physical form  is to be seen as it actually is with right discernment as This is not mine
This is not my self
This is not what I am
'Any feeling whatsoever Any perception whatsoever Any mental fabrications whatsoever
'Any consciousness whatsoever  past future or present internal or external blatant or subtle common or sublime far or near every consciousness  is to be seen as it actually is with right discernment as This is not mine
This is not my self
This is not what I am
'Seeing thus the instructed noble disciple grows disenchanted with the body disenchanted with feeling disenchanted with perception disenchanted with mental processes and disenchanted with consciousness
Disenchanted he grows dispassionate
Through dispassion he is released
With release there is the knowledge Released He discerns that Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task done
There is nothing further for this world'
That is what the Blessed One said
Glad at heart the group of five monks delighted at his words
And while this explanation was being given the hearts of the group of five monks through not clinging were released from the mental fermentations
And what is the noble method that is rightly seen and rightly ferreted out by discernment
There is the case where a noble disciple notices
In other words
Now from the remainderless fading and cessation of that very ignorance comes the cessation of fabrications
From the cessation of fabrications comes the cessation of consciousness
From the cessation of consciousness comes the cessation of nameandform
From the cessation of nameandform comes the cessation of the six sense media
From the cessation of the six sense media comes the cessation of contact
From the cessation of contact comes the cessation of feeling
From the cessation of feeling comes the cessation of craving
From the cessation of craving comes the cessation of clingingsustenance
From the cessation of clingingsustenance comes the cessation of becoming
From the cessation of becoming comes the cessation of birth
From the cessation of birth then old age and death sorrow lamentation pain distress and despair all cease
Such is the cessation of this entire mass of stress and suffering
This is the noble method that is rightly seen and rightly ferreted out by discernment
Monks what is the noble eightfold path
Right view right resolve right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness right concentration
And what is right view
Knowledge with regard to stress knowledge with regard to the origination of stress knowledge with regard to the cessation of stress knowledge with regard to the way of practice leading to the cessation of stress This is called right view
And what is right resolve
Being resolved on renunciation on freedom from ill will on harmlessness This is called right resolve
And what is right speech
Abstaining from lying from divisive speech from abusive speech and from idle chatter This is called right speech
And what is right action
Abstaining from taking life from stealing and from unchastity
This is called right action
And what is right livelihood
There is the case where a noble disciple having abandoned dishonest livelihood keeps his life going with right livelihood This is called right livelihood
And what is right effort
There is the case where a monk generates desire endeavors arouses persistence upholds and exerts his intent for the sake of the nonarising of evil unskillful qualities that have not yet arisen for the sake of the abandoning of evil unskillful qualities that have arisen for the sake of the arising of skillful qualities that have not yet arisen for the maintenance nonconfusion increase plenitude development and culmination of skillful qualities that have arisen This is called right effort
And what is right mindfulness
There is the case where a monk remains focused on the body in and of itself  ardent alert and mindful  putting aside greed and distress with reference to the world
He remains focused on feelings in and of themselves the mind in and of itself mental qualities in and of themselves  ardent alert and mindful  putting aside greed and distress with reference to the world
This is called right mindfulness
And what is right concentration
There is the case where a monk enters and remains in the first jhana the second jhana the third jhana the fourth jhana purity of equanimity and mindfulness neither pleasure nor pain
This is called right concentration
Then Anathapindika the householder went to where the wanderers of other persuasions were staying
On arrival he greeted them courteously
After an exchange of friendly greetings and courtesies he sat to one side
As he was sitting there the wanderers said to him 'Tell us householder what views Gotama the contemplative has'
'Venerable sirs I don't know entirely what views the Blessed One has'
'Well well
So you don't know entirely what views Gotama the contemplative has
Then tell us what views the monks have'
'I don't even know entirely what views the monks have'
'So you don't know entirely what views Gotama the contemplative has or even that the monks have
Then tell us what views you have'
'It wouldn't be difficult for me to expound to you what views I have
But please let the venerable ones expound each in line with his position and then it won't be difficult for me to expound to you what views I have'
When this had been said one of the wanderers said to Anathapindika the householder 'The cosmos is eternal
Only this is true anything otherwise is worthless
This is the sort of view I have'
Another wanderer said to Anathapindika 'The cosmos is not eternal
Only this is true anything otherwise is worthless
This is the sort of view I have'
Another wanderer said 'The cosmos is finite''The cosmos is infinite''The soul and the body are the same''The soul is one thing and the body another''After death a Tathagata exists''After death a Tathagata does not exist''After death a Tathagata both does and does not exist''After death a Tathagata neither does nor does not exist
Only this is true anything otherwise is worthless
This is the sort of view I have'
When this had been said Anathapindika the householder said to the wanderers 'As for the venerable one who says The cosmos is eternal
Only this is true anything otherwise is worthless
This is the sort of view I have his view arises from his own inappropriate attention or in dependence on the words of another
Now this view has been brought into being is fabricated willed dependently originated
Whatever has been brought into being is fabricated willed dependently originated that is inconstant
Whatever is inconstant is stress
This venerable one thus adheres to that very stress submits himself to that very stress' 
When this had been said the wanderers said to Anathapindika the householder 'We have each and every one expounded to you in line with our own positions
Now tell us what views you have'
'Whatever has been brought into being is fabricated willed dependently originated that is inconstant
Whatever is inconstant is stress
Whatever is stress is not me is not what I am is not my self
This is the sort of view I have'
'So householder whatever has been brought into being is fabricated willed dependently originated that is inconstant
Whatever is inconstant is stress
You thus adhere to that very stress submit yourself to that very stress'
'Venerable sirs whatever has been brought into being is fabricated willed dependently originated that is inconstant
Whatever is inconstant is stress
Whatever is stress is not me is not what I am is not my self
Having seen this well with right discernment as it actually is present I also discern the higher escape from it as it actually is present'
When this had been said the wanderers fell silent abashed sitting with their shoulders drooping their heads down brooding at a loss for words
Anathapindika the householder perceiving that the wanderers were silent abashed at a loss for words got up and left
There is the case where an uninstructed runofthemill person does not discern what ideas are fit for attention or what ideas are unfit for attention
This being so he does not attend to ideas fit for attention and attends instead to ideas unfit for attention This is how he attends inappropriately 'Was I in the past
Was I not in the past
What was I in the past
How was I in the past
Having been what what was I in the past
Shall I be in the future
Shall I not be in the future
What shall I be in the future
How shall I be in the future
Having been what what shall I be in the future' Or else he is inwardly perplexed about the immediate present 'Am I
Am I not
What am I
How am I
Where has this being come from
Where is it bound'
As this person attends inappropriately in this way one of six kinds of view arises in him The view I have a self arises in him as true and established or the view I have no self or the view It is by means of self that I perceive self or the view It is by means of self that I perceive notself or the view It is by means of notself that I perceive self arises in him as true and established or else he has a view like this This very self of mine  the knower that is sensitive here and there to the ripening of good and bad actions  is the self of mine that is constant everlasting eternal not subject to change and will endure as long as eternity
This is called a thicket of views a wilderness of views a contortion of views a writhing of views a fetter of views
Bound by a fetter of views the uninstructed runofthemill person is not freed from birth aging and death from sorrow lamentation pain distress and despair
He is not freed from stress I say
The welltaught noble disciple discerns what ideas are fit for attention and what ideas are unfit for attention
This being so he does not attend to ideas unfit for attention and attends instead to ideas fit for attention He attends appropriately This is stress This is the origin of stress This is the cessation of stress This is the way leading to the cessation of stress
As he attends appropriately in this way three fetters are abandoned in him identityview doubt and grasping at precepts and practices
Kaccayana 'Lord Right view right view it is said
To what extent is there right view'
The Buddha 'By and large Kaccayana this cosmos is supported by a polarity that of existence and nonexistence
But when one sees the origination of the cosmos as it actually is with right discernment nonexistence with reference to the cosmos does not occur to one
When one sees the cessation of the cosmos as it actually is with right discernment existence with reference to the cosmos does not occur to one
'By and large Kaccayana this cosmos is in bondage to attachments clingings and biases
But one such as this does not get involved with or cling to these attachments clingings fixations of awareness biases and latent tendencies nor is he resolved on my self He has no uncertainty or doubt that when there is arising only stress is arising and that when there is passing away stress is passing away
In this one's knowledge is independent of others
It is to this extent Kaccayana that there is right view'
Visakha Now what is concentration what qualities are its themes what qualities are its requisites and what is its development
Sister Dhammadinna Singleness of mind is concentration the four frames of reference are its themes the four right exertions are its requisites and any cultivation development and pursuit of these qualities is its development
Mindfulness of inandout breathing when developed and pursued brings the four frames of reference to their culmination
The four frames of reference when developed and pursued bring the seven factors for Awakening to their culmination
The seven factors for Awakening when developed and pursued bring clear knowing and release to their culmination
Now how is mindfulness of inandout breathing developed and pursuedso as to bring the four frames of reference to their culmination
There is the case where a monk having gone to the wilderness to the shade of a tree or to an empty building sits down folding his legs crosswise holding his body erect and setting mindfulness to the fore
Always mindful he breathes in mindful he breathes out
 Breathing in long he discerns 'I am breathing in long' or breathing out long he discerns 'I am breathing out long' Or breathing in short he discerns 'I am breathing in short' or breathing out short he discerns 'I am breathing out short' He trains himself 'I will breathe in sensitive to the entire body' He trains himself 'I will breathe out sensitive to the entire body' He trains himself 'I will breathe in calming bodily fabrication' He trains himself 'I will breathe out calming bodily fabrication'
He trains himself to breathe in sensitive to rapture and to breathe out sensitive to rapture
He trains himself to breathe in sensitive to pleasure and to breathe out sensitive to pleasure
He trains himself to breathe in sensitive to mental fabrication and to breathe out sensitive to mental fabrication
He trains himself to breathe in calming mental fabrication and to breathe out calming mental fabrication
He trains himself to breathe in sensitive to the mind and to breathe out sensitive to the mind
He trains himself to breathe in satisfying the mind and to breathe out satisfying the mind
He trains himself to breathe in steadying the mind and to breathe out steadying the mind
He trains himself to breathe in releasing the mind and to breathe out releasing the mind
He trains himself to breathe in focusing on inconstancy and to breathe out focusing on inconstancy
He trains himself to breathe in focusing on dispassion and to breathe out focusing on dispassion
He trains himself to breathe in focusing on cessation and to breathe out focusing on cessation
He trains himself to breathe in focusing on relinquishment and to breathe out focusing on relinquishment
Now on whatever occasion a monk breathing in long discerns that he is breathing in long or breathing out long discerns that he is breathing out long or breathing in short discerns that he is breathing in short or breathing out short discerns that he is breathing out short trains himself to breathe in and out sensitive to the entire body trains himself to breathe in and out calming bodily fabrication On that occasion the monk remains focused on the body in and of itself  ardent alert and mindful  putting aside greed and distress with reference to the world
I tell you monks that this  the inandout breath  is classed as a body among bodies which is why the monk on that occasion remains focused on the body in and of itself  ardent alert and mindful  putting aside greed and distress with reference to the world
On whatever occasion a monk trains himself to breathe in and out sensitive to rapture trains himself to breathe in and out sensitive to pleasure trains himself to breathe in and out sensitive to mental fabrication trains himself to breathe in and out calming mental fabrication On that occasion the monk remains focused on feelings in and of themselves  ardent alert and mindful  putting aside greed and distress with reference to the world
I tell you monks that this  close attention to inandout breaths  is classed as a feeling among feelings which is why the monk on that occasion remains focused on feelings in and of themselves  ardent alert and mindful  putting aside greed and distress with reference to the world
On whatever occasion a monk trains himself to breathe in and out sensitive to the mind trains himself to breathe in and out satisfying the mind trains himself to breathe in and out steadying the mind trains himself to breathe in and out releasing the mind On that occasion the monk remains focused on the mind in and of itself  ardent alert and mindful  putting aside greed and distress with reference to the world
I don't say that there is mindfulness of inandout breathing in one of confused mindfulness and no alertness which is why the monk on that occasion remains focused on the mind in and of itself  ardent alert and mindful  putting aside greed and distress with reference to the world
On whatever occasion a monk trains himself to breathe in and out focusing on inconstancy trains himself to breathe in and out focusing on dispassion trains himself to breathe in and out focusing on cessation trains himself to breathe in and out focusing on relinquishment On that occasion the monk remains focused on mental qualities in and of themselves  ardent alert and mindful  putting aside greed and distress with reference to the world
He who sees clearly with discernment the abandoning of greed and distress is one who oversees with equanimity which is why the monk on that occasion remains focused on mental qualities in and of themselves  ardent alert and mindful  putting aside greed and distress with reference to the world
This is how mindfulness of inandout breathing is developed and pursued so as to bring the four frames of reference to their culmination
And how are the four frames of reference developed and pursued so as to bring the seven factors for Awakening to their culmination
On whatever occasion the monk remains focused on the body in and of itself  ardent alert and mindful  putting aside greed and distress with reference to the world on that occasion his mindfulness is steady and without lapse
When his mindfulness is steady and without lapse then mindfulness as a factor for Awakening becomes aroused
He develops it and for him it goes to the culmination of its development
Remaining mindful in this way he examines analyzes and comes to a comprehension of that quality with discernment
When he remains mindful in this way examining analyzing and coming to a comprehension of that quality with discernment then analysis of qualities as a factor for Awakening becomes aroused
He develops it and for him it goes to the culmination of its development
In one who examines analyzes and comes to a comprehension of that quality with discernment unflagging persistence is aroused
When unflagging persistence is aroused in one who examines analyzes and comes to a comprehension of that quality with discernment then persistence as a factor for Awakening becomes aroused
He develops it and for him it goes to the culmination of its development
In one whose persistence is aroused a rapture notoftheflesh arises
When a rapture notoftheflesh arises in one whose persistence is aroused then rapture as a factor for Awakening becomes aroused
He develops it and for him it goes to the culmination of its development
For one who is enraptured the body grows calm and the mind grows calm
When the body and mind of an enraptured monk grow calm then serenity as a factor for Awakening becomes aroused
He develops it and for him it goes to the culmination of its development
For one who is at ease  his body calmed  the mind becomes concentrated
When the mind of one who is at ease  his body calmed  becomes concentrated then concentration as a factor for Awakening becomes aroused
He develops it and for him it goes to the culmination of its development
He oversees the mind thus concentrated with equanimity
When he oversees the mind thus concentrated with equanimity equanimity as a factor for Awakening becomes aroused
He develops it and for him it goes to the culmination of its development
This is how the four frames of reference are developed and pursued so as to bring the seven factors for Awakening to their culmination
And how are the seven factors for Awakening developed and pursued so as to bring clear knowing and release to their culmination
There is the case where a monk develops mindfulness as a factor for Awakening dependent on seclusion dispassion cessation resulting in relinquishment
He develops analysis of qualities as a factor for Awakeningpersistence as a factor for Awakeningrapture as a factor for Awakeningserenity as a factor for Awakening concentration as a factor for Awakening equanimity as a factor for Awakening dependent on seclusion dispassion cessation resulting in relinquishment
This is how the seven factors for Awakening are developed and pursued so as to bring clear knowing and release to their culmination
there remains only equanimity pure and bright pliant malleable and luminous
Just as if a skilled goldsmith or goldsmith's apprentice were to prepare a furnace heat up a crucible and taking gold with a pair of tongs place it in the crucible
He would blow on it periodically sprinkle water on it periodically examine it periodically so that the gold would become refined wellrefined thoroughly refined flawless free from dross pliant malleable and luminous
Then whatever sort of ornament he had in mind  whether a belt an earring a necklace or a gold chain  it would serve his purpose
In the same way there remains only equanimity pure and bright pliant malleable and luminous
He discerns that 'If I were to direct equanimity as pure and bright as this toward the dimension of the infinitude of space I would develop the mind along those lines and thus this equanimity of mine  thus supported thus sustained  would last for a long time
'
He discerns that 'If I were to direct equanimity as pure and bright as this toward the dimension of the infinitude of space and to develop the mind along those lines that would be fabricated
' He neither fabricates nor wills for the sake of becoming or unbecoming
This being the case he is not sustained by anything in the world
Unsustained he is not agitated
Unagitated he is totally unbound right within
He discerns that 'Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task done
There is nothing further for this world'
There is that dimension where there is neither earth nor water nor fire nor wind neither dimension of the infinitude of space nor dimension of the infinitude of consciousness nor dimension of nothingness nor dimension of neither perception nor nonperception neither this world nor the next world nor sun nor moon
And there I say there is neither coming nor going nor stasis neither passing away nor arising without stance without foundation without support
This just this is the end of stress
Aggivessana Vacchagotta 'But Venerable Gotama the monk whose mind is thus released Where does he reappear'
Buddha ' Reappear Vaccha doesn't apply'
'In that case Venerable Gotama he does not reappear'
' Does not reappear Vaccha doesn't apply'
'both does and does not reappear'
'doesn't apply'
'Neither does nor does not reappear'
'doesn't apply'
'At this point Venerable Gotama I am befuddled at this point confused
The modicum of clarity coming to me from your earlier conversation is now obscured'
'Of course you're befuddled Vaccha
Of course you're confused
Deep Vaccha is this phenomenon hard to see hard to realize tranquil refined beyond the scope of conjecture subtle tobeexperienced by the wise
For those with other views other satisfactions other aims other teachers it is difficult to know
That being the case I will now put some questions to you
Answer as you see fit
What do you think Vaccha If a fire were burning in front of you would you know that This fire is burning in front of me'
'yes'
'And suppose someone were to ask you Vaccha This fire burning in front of you dependent on what is it burning Thus asked how would you reply'
'I would reply This fire burning in front of me is burning dependent on grass and timber as its sustenance'
'If the fire burning in front of you were to go out would you know that This fire burning in front of me has gone out'
'yes'
'And suppose someone were to ask you This fire that has gone out in front of you in which direction from here has it gone
East
West
North
Or south Thus asked how would you reply'
'That doesn't apply Venerable Gotama
Any fire burning dependent on a sustenance of grass and timber being unnourished  from having consumed that sustenance and not being offered any other  is classified simply as out'
'Even so Vaccha any physical form by which one describing the Tathagata would describe him That the Tathagata has abandoned its root destroyed made like a palmyra stump deprived of the conditions of development not destined for future arising
Freed from the classification of form Vaccha the Tathagata is deep boundless hardtofathom like the sea
Reappears does not apply
Does not reappear does not apply
Both does and does not reappear does not apply
Neither reappears nor does not reappear does not apply
'Any feeling Any perception Any mental fabrication
'Any consciousness by which one describing the Tathagata would describe him That the Tathagata has abandoned Freed from the classification of consciousness Vaccha the Tathagata is deep boundless hardtofathom like the sea'
There is the case where a Tathagata appears in the world worthy and rightly selfawakened
He teaches the Dhamma admirable in its beginning admirable in its middle admirable in its end
He proclaims the holy life both in its particulars and in its essence entirely perfect surpassingly pure
A householder or householder's son hearing the Dhamma gains conviction in the Tathagata and reflects 'Household life is confining a dusty path
The life gone forth is like the open air
It is not easy living at home to practice the holy life totally perfect totally pure like a polished shell
Suppose I were to go forth'
So after some time he abandons his mass of wealth large or small leaves his circle of relatives large or small shaves off his hair and beard puts on the saffron robes and goes forth from the household life into homelessness
When he has thus gone forth he lives restrained by the rules of the monastic code seeing danger in the slightest faults
Consummate in his virtue he guards the doors of his senses is possessed of mindfulness and presence of mind and is content
Now how does a monk guard the doors of his senses
On seeing a form with the eye he does not grasp at any theme or variations by which  if he were to dwell without restraint over the faculty of the eye  evil unskillful qualities such as greed or distress might assail him

And how is a monk possessed of mindfulness and alertness
When going forward and returning he acts with alertness
When looking toward and looking away when bending and extending his limbs when carrying his outer cloak his upper robe and his bowl when eating drinking chewing and tasting when urinating and defecating when walking standing sitting falling asleep waking up talking and remaining silent he acts with alertness
And how is a monk content
Just as a bird wherever it goes flies with its wings as its only burden so too is he content with a set of robes to provide for his body and alms food to provide for his hunger
Wherever he goes he takes only his barest necessities along
He seeks out a secluded dwelling a forest the shade of a tree a mountain a glen a hillside cave a charnel ground a jungle grove the open air a heap of straw
After his meal returning from his alms round he sits down crosses his legs holds his body erect and brings mindfulness to the fore
He purifies his mind from greed ill will sloth and torpor restlessness and anxiety and uncertainty
As long as these five hindrances are not abandoned within him he regards it as a debt a sickness a prison slavery a road through desolate country
But when these five hindrances are abandoned within him he regards it as unindebtedness good health release from prison freedom a place of security
Seeing that they have been abandoned within him he becomes glad enraptured tranquil sensitive to pleasure
Feeling pleasure his mind becomes concentrated
Quite withdrawn from sensuality withdrawn from unskillful mental qualities he enters and remains in the first jhana rapture and pleasure born from withdrawal accompanied by directed thought and evaluation
He permeates and pervades suffuses and fills this very body with the rapture and pleasure born from withdrawal
Just as if a skilled bathman or bathman's apprentice would pour bath powder into a brass basin and knead it together sprinkling it again and again with water so that his ball of bath powder  saturated moistureladen permeated within and without  would nevertheless not drip even so the monk permeates this very body with the rapture and pleasure born of withdrawal
There is nothing of his entire body unpervaded by rapture and pleasure born from withdrawal
This is a reward of the contemplative life visible here and now more excellent than the previous ones and more sublime
Furthermore with the stilling of directed thoughts  evaluations he enters and remains in the second jhana rapture and pleasure born of composure unification of awareness free from directed thought and evaluation  internal assurance
He permeates and pervades suffuses and fills this very body with the rapture and pleasure born of composure
Just like a lake with springwater welling up from within having no inflow from the east west north or south and with the skies supplying abundant showers time and again so that the cool fount of water welling up from within the lake would permeate and pervade suffuse and fill it with cool waters there being no part of the lake unpervaded by the cool waters even so the monk permeates this very body with the rapture and pleasure born of composure
There is nothing of his entire body unpervaded by rapture and pleasure born of composure
This too is a reward of the contemplative life visible here and now more excellent than the previous ones and more sublime
And furthermore with the fading of rapture he remains equanimous mindful  alert and senses pleasure with the body
He enters  remains in the third jhana of which the Noble Ones declare 'Equanimous  mindful he has a pleasant abiding' He permeates and pervades suffuses and fills this very body with the pleasure divested of rapture
Just as in a lotus pond some of the lotuses born and growing in the water stay immersed in the water and flourish without standing up out of the water so that they are permeated and pervaded suffused and filled with cool water from their roots to their tips and nothing of those lotuses would be unpervaded with cool water even so the monk permeates this very body with the pleasure divested of rapture
There is nothing of his entire body unpervaded with pleasure divested of rapture
This too is a reward of the contemplative life visible here and now more excellent than the previous ones and more sublime
And furthermore with the abandoning of pleasure and stress  as with the earlier disappearance of elation and distress  he enters and remains in the fourth jhana purity of equanimity and mindfulness neitherpleasure nor stress
He sits permeating the body with a pure bright awareness
Just as if a man were sitting covered from head to foot with a white cloth so that there would be no part of his body to which the white cloth did not extend even so the monk sits permeating the body with a pure bright awareness
There is nothing of his entire body unpervaded by pure bright awareness
This too is a reward of the contemplative life visible here and now more excellent than the previous ones and more sublime
With his mind thus concentrated purified and bright he directs it to the knowledge of the ending of the mental fermentations
Just as if there were a pool of water in a mountain glen  clear limpid and unsullied  where a man with good eyesight standing on the bank could see shells gravel and pebbles and also shoals of fish swimming about and resting and it would occur to him 'This pool of water is clear limpid and unsullied
Here are these shells gravel and pebbles and also these shoals of fish swimming about and resting' In the same way the monk discerns as it has come to be that 'This is stress This is the origination of stress This is the cessation of stress This is the way leading to the cessation of stress These are mental fermentations This is the origination of fermentations This is the cessation of fermentations This is the way leading to the cessation of fermentations' His heart thus knowing thus seeing is released from the fermentations of sensuality becoming and ignorance
With release there is the knowledge 'Released' He discerns that 'Birth is ended the holy life fulfilled the task done
There is nothing further for this world' This too is a reward of the contemplative life visible here and now more excellent than the previous ones and more sublime
And as for another visible fruit of the contemplative life higher and more sublime than this there is none
Then Ven
Assaji arising early in the morning taking his robe and bowl entered Rajagaha for alms gracious in the way he approached and departed looked forward and behind drew in and stretched out his arm his eyes downcast his every movement consummate
Sariputta the wanderer saw Ven
Assaji going for alms in Rajagaha gracious his eyes downcast his every movement consummate
On seeing him the thought occurred to him Surely of those in this world who are arahants or have entered the path to arahantship this is one
What if I were to approach him and question him 'On whose account have you gone forth
Who is your teacher
Of whose Dhamma do you approve' But then the thought occurred to Sariputta the wanderer This is the wrong time to question him
He is going for alms in the town
What if I were to follow behind this monk who has found the path for those who seek it
Then Ven
Assaji having gone for alms in Rajagaha left taking the alms he had received
Sariputta the wanderer approached him and on arrival having exchanged friendly greetings and courtesies stood to one side
As he stood there he said Your faculties are bright my friend your complexion pure and clear
On whose account have you gone forth
Who is your teacher
Of whose Dhamma do you approve
There is my friend the Great Contemplative a son of the Sakyans gone forth from a Sakyan family
I have gone forth on account of that Blessed One
That Blessed One is my teacher
It is of that Blessed One's Dhamma that I approve
But what is your teacher's teaching
What does he proclaim
I am new my friend not long gone forth only recently come to this doctrine and discipline
I cannot explain the doctrine in detail but I can give you the gist in brief
Then Sariputta the wanderer spoke thus to the Ven
Assaji
Then Ven
Assaji gave this Dhamma exposition to Sariputta the Wanderer
Then to Sariputta the Wanderer as he heard this Dhamma exposition there arose the dustless stainless Dhamma eye Whatever is subject to origination is all subject to cessation
Then Mahapajapati Gotami approached the Blessed One and on arrival having bowed down stood to one side
As she was standing there she said It would be good if the Blessed One would teach me the Dhamma in brief so that I having heard the Dhamma might dwell alone secluded heedful ardent and resolute
Gotami the qualities of which you may know 'These qualities lead to dispassion not to passion to being unfettered and not to being fettered to selfeffacement and not to selfaggrandizement to modesty and not to ambition to contentment and not to discontent to seclusion and not to entanglement to the arousing of persistence and not to laziness to being unburdensome and not to being burdensome' You may definitely hold 'This is the Dhamma this is the Vinaya this is the Teacher's instruction'
Punna Lord I am going to live in the Sunaparanta country
The Buddha Punna the Sunaparanta people are fierce
They are rough
If they insult and ridicule you what will you think
I will think 'These Sunaparanta people are civilized very civilized in that they don't hit me with their hands' That is what I will think But if they hit you with their hands
I will think 'These Sunaparanta people are civilized very civilized in that they don't hit me with a clod' But if they hit you with a clod
I will think 'These Sunaparanta people are civilized very civilized in that they don't hit me with a stick' But if they hit you with a stick
I will think 'These Sunaparanta people are civilized very civilized in that they don't hit me with a knife' But if they hit you with a knife
I will think 'These Sunaparanta people are civilized very civilized in that they don't take my life with a sharp knife' But if they take your life with a sharp knife
I will think 'There are disciples of the Blessed One who  horrified humiliated and disgusted by the body and by life  have sought for an assassin but here I have met my assassin without searching for him' That is what I will think Good Punna very good
Possessing such calm and selfcontrol you are fit to dwell among the Sunaparantans
Now it is time to do as you see fit
Then Ven
Punna delighting and rejoicing in the Blessed One's words rising from his seat bowed down to the Blessed One and left keeping him on his right side
Setting his dwelling in order and taking his robe and bowl he set out for the Sunaparanta country and after wandering stage by stage he arrived there
There he lived
During that Rains retreat he established male and female lay followers in the practice while he realized the three knowledges
Eventually he attained total Unbinding
The two crucial aspects of the Buddha's Awakening are the what and the how what he awakened to and how he did it
His Awakening is special in that the two aspects come together
He awakened to the fact that there is an undying happiness and that it can be attained through human effort
The human effort involved in this process ultimately focuses on the question of understanding the nature of human effort itself  in terms of skillful kamma and dependent coarising  what its powers and limitations are and what kind of right effort can take one beyond its limitations and bring one to the threshold of the Deathless
As the Buddha described the Awakening experience in one of his discourses first there is the knowledge of the regularity of the Dhamma  which in this context means dependent coarising  then there is the knowledge of nibbana
In other passages he describes the three stages that led to insight into dependent coarising knowledge of his own previous lifetimes knowledge of the passing away and rebirth of all living beings and finally insight into the four Noble Truths
The first two forms of knowledge were not new with the Buddha
They have been reported by other seers throughout history although the Buddha's insight into the second knowledge had a special twist He saw that beings are reborn according to the ethical quality of their thoughts words and deeds and that this quality is essentially a factor of the mind
The quality of one's views and intentions determines the experienced result of one's actions
This insight had a double impact on his mind
On the one hand it made him realize the futility of the round of rebirth  that even the best efforts aimed at winning pleasure and fulfillment within the round could have only temporary effects
On the other hand his realization of the importance of the mind in determining the round is what led him to focus directly on his own mind in the present to see how the processes in the mind that kept the round going could be disbanded
This was how he gained insight into the four noble truths and dependent coarising  seeing how the aggregates that made up his person were also the impelling factors in the experience of the world at large and how the whole show could be brought to cessation
With its cessation there remained the experience of the unconditioned which he also termed nibbana consciousness without surface or feature the Deathless
When we address the question of how other enlightenment experiences recorded in world history relate to the Buddha's we have to keep in mind the Buddha's own dictum First there is the knowledge of dependent coarising then there is the knowledge of nibbana
Without the first  which includes not only an understanding of kamma but also of how kamma leads to the understanding itself  no realization no matter how calm or boundless that doesn't result from these sorts of understanding can count as an Awakening in the Buddhist sense
True Awakening necessarily involves both ethics and insight into causality
As for what the Buddha's Awakening means for us now four points stand out
 The role that kamma plays in the Awakening is empowering
It means that what each of us does says and thinks does matter  this in opposition to the sense of futility that can come from reading say world history geology or astronomy and realizing the fleeting nature of the entire human enterprise
The Awakening lets us see that the choices we make in each moment of our lives have consequences
The fact that we are empowered also means that we are responsible for our experiences
We are not strangers in a strange land
We have formed and are continuing to form the world we experienceThis helps us to face the events we encounter in life with greater equanimity for we know that we had a hand in creating them and yet at the same time we can avoid any debilitating sense of guilt because with each new choice we can always make a fresh start
 The Awakening also tells us that good and bad are not mere social conventions but are built into the mechanics of how the world is constructed
We may be free to design our lives but we are not free to change the underlying rules that determine what good and bad actions are and how the process of kamma works itself out
Thus cultural relativism  even though it may have paved the way for many of us to leave our earlier religious orientations and enter the Buddhist fold  has no place once we are within that fold
There are certain ways of acting that are inherently unskillful and we are fools if we insist on our right to behave in those ways
 As the Buddha says at one point in describing his Awakening Ignorance was destroyed knowledge arose darkness was destroyed light arose  as happens in one who is heedful ardent and resolute In other words he gained liberating knowledge through qualities that we can all develop heedfulness ardency resolution
If we are willing to face the implications of this fact we realize that the Buddha's Awakening is a challenge to our entire set of values
The fact that the Unconditioned can be attained forces us to reevaluate any other goals we may set for ourselves any worlds we may want to create in our lives
On an obvious level it points out the spiritual poverty of a life devoted to wealth status or sensual pursuits but it also forces us to take a hard look at other more worthwhile goals that our culture and its subcultures tend to exalt such as social acceptance meaningful relationships stewardship of the planet etc
These too will inevitably lead to suffering
The interdependence of all things cannot be for any truly sensitive mind a source of security or comfort
If the Unconditioned is available and it's the only trustworthy happiness around the most sensible course is to invest our efforts and whatever mental and spiritual resources we have in its direction
 Even for those who are not ready to make that kind of investment the Awakening assures us that happiness comes from developing qualities within ourselves that we can be proud of such as kindness sensitivity equanimity mindfulness conviction determination and discernment
Again this is a very different message from the one we pick up from the world telling us that in order to gain happiness we have to develop qualities we can't take any genuine pride in aggressiveness selfaggrandizement dishonesty etc
Just this much can give an entirely new orientation to our lives and our ideas of what is worthwhile investment of our time and efforts
The news of the Buddha's Awakening sets the standards for judging the culture we were brought up in and not the other way around
This is not a question of choosing Asian culture over American
The Buddha's Awakening challenged many of the presuppositions of Indian culture in his day and even in socalled Buddhist countries the true practice of the Buddha's teachings is always countercultural
It's a question of evaluating our normal concerns  conditioned by time space and the limitations of aging illness and death  against the possibility of a timeless spaceless limitless happiness
All cultures are tied up in the limited conditioned side of things while the Buddha's Awakening points beyond all cultures
It offers the challenge of the Deathless that his contemporaries found liberating and that we if we are willing to accept the challenge may find liberating ourselves
You've probably heard the rumor that Buddhism is pessimistic that Life is suffering is the Buddha's first noble truth
It's a rumor with good credentials spread by wellrespected academics and meditation teachers alike but a rumor nonetheless
The real truth about the noble truths is far more interesting
The Buddha taught four truths  not one  about life There is suffering there is a cause for suffering there is an end of suffering and there is a path of practice that puts an end to suffering
These truths taken as a whole are far from pessimistic
They're a practical problemsolving approach  the way a doctor approaches an illness or a mechanic a faulty engine
You identify a problem and look for its cause
You then put an end to the problem by eliminating the cause
What's special about the Buddha's approach is that the problem he attacks is the whole of human suffering and the solution he offers is something human beings can do for themselves
Just as a doctor with a surefire cure for measles isn't afraid of measles the Buddha isn't afraid of any aspect of human suffering
And having experienced a happiness that's totally unconditional he's not afraid to point out the suffering and stress inherent in places where most of us would rather not see it  in the conditioned pleasures we cling to
He teaches us not to deny that suffering and stress or to run away from it but to stand still and face up to it
To examine it carefully
That way  by understanding it  we can ferret out its cause and put an end to it
Totally
How confident can you get
A fair number of writers have pointed out the basic confidence inherent in the four noble truths and yet the rumor of Buddhism's pessimism persists
I wonder why
One possible explanation is that in coming to Buddhism we subconsciously expect it to address issues that have a long history in our own culture
By starting out with suffering as his first truth the Buddha seems to be offering his position on a question with a long history in the West is the world basically good or bad
According to Genesis this was the first question that occurred to God after he had finished his creation had he done a good job
So he looked at the world and saw that it was good
Ever since then people in the West have sided with or against God on his answer but in doing so they have affirmed that the question was worth asking to begin with
When Theravada  the only form of Buddhism to take on Christianity when Europe colonized Asia  was looking for ways to head off what it saw as the missionary menace Buddhists who had received their education from the missionaries assumed that the question was valid and pressed the first noble truth into service as a refutation of the Christian God look at how miserable life is they said and it's hard to accept God's verdict on his handiwork
This debating strategy may have scored a few points at the time and it's easy to find Buddhist apologists who  still living in the colonial past  keep trying to score the same points
The real issue though is whether the Buddha intended for his first noble truth to be an answer to God's question in the first place and  more importantly  whether we're getting the most out of the first noble truth if we see it in that light
It's hard to imagine what you could accomplish by saying that life is suffering
You'd have to spend your time arguing with people who see more than just suffering in life
The Buddha himself says as much in one of his discourses
A brahman named Longnails comes to him and announces that he doesn't approve of anything
This would have been a perfect time for the Buddha if he had wanted to chime in with the truth that life is suffering
Instead he attacks the whole notion of taking a stand on whether life is worthy of approval
There are three possible answers to this question nothing is worthy of approval everything is and some things are and some things aren't
If you take any of these three positions you end up arguing with the people who take either of the other two positions
And where does that get you
The Buddha then teaches Longnails to look at his body and feelings as instances of the first noble truth they're stressful inconstant and don't deserve to be clung to as self
Longnails follows the Buddha's instructions and in letting go of his attachment to body and feelings gains his first glimpse of the Deathless of what it's like to be totally free from suffering
The point of this story is that trying to answer God's question passing judgment on the world is a waste of time
And it offers a better use for the first noble truth looking at things not in terms of world or life but simply identifying suffering so that you can comprehend it let it go and attain release
Rather than asking us to make a blanket judgment  which in effect would be asking us to be blind partisans  the first noble truth asks us to look and see precisely where the problem of suffering lies
Other discourses make the point that the problem isn't with body and feelings in and of themselves
They themselves aren't suffering
The suffering lies in clinging to them
In his definition of the first noble truth the Buddha summarizes all types of suffering under the phrase the five aggregates of clinging clinging to physical form feelings perceptions thought constructs and consciousness
However when the five aggregates are free from clinging he tells us they lead to longterm benefit and happiness
Of course by happiness he isn't here referring to the arts food travel sports family life or any of the other sections of the Sunday newspaper
He's talking about the solid wellbeing that comes when we treat the aggregates as factors in the path to the Deathless
The aggregates in themselves are neutral
The role they play in leading to true happiness or suffering lies in whether or not we cling
So the first noble truth simply put is that clinging is suffering
It's because of clinging that physical pain becomes mental pain
It's because of clinging that aging illness and death cause mental distress
How do we cling
The texts list four ways the clinging of sensual passion the clinging of views the clinging of precepts and practices and the clinging of doctrines of the self
It's rare that a moment passes in the ordinary mind without some form of clinging
Even when we abandon a particular form of clinging it's usually because it gets in the way of another form
We may abandon a puritanical view because it interferes with sensual pleasure or a sensual pleasure because it conflicts with a view about what we should do to stay healthy
Our views of who we are may expand and contract depending on which of our many senses of I is feeling the most pain expanding into a sense of cosmic oneness when we feel confined by the limitations of our small mindbody complex shrinking into a small shell when we feel wounded from identifying with a cosmos so filled with cruelty thoughtlessness and waste
When the insignificance of our finite self becomes oppressive again we may jump at the idea that we have no self but then that becomes oppressive
So our minds jump from clinging to clinging like a bird trapped in a cage
And when we realize we're captive we naturally search for a way out
This is where it's so important that the first noble truth not say that Life is suffering for if life were suffering where would we look for an end to suffering
We'd be left with nothing but death and annihilation
But when the actual truth is that clinging is suffering we simply have to look to see precisely where clinging is and learn not to cling
This is where we encounter the Buddha's great skill as a strategist He tells us to take the clingings we'll have to abandon and transform them into the path to their abandoning
We'll need a certain amount of sensory pleasure  in terms of adequate food clothing and shelter  to find the strength to go beyond sensual passion
We'll need right view  seeing all things including views in terms of the four noble truths  to undermine our clinging to views
And we'll need a regimen of the five ethical precepts and the practice of meditation to put the mind in a solid position where it can drop its clinging to precepts and practices
Underlying all this we'll need a strong sense of selfresponsibility and selfdiscipline to master the practices leading to the insight that cuts through our clinging to doctrines of the self
So we start the path to the end of suffering not by trying to drop our clingings immediately but by learning to cling more strategically
In other words we start where we are and make the best use of the habits we've already got
We progress along the path by finding better and better things to cling to and more skillful ways to cling in the same way you climb a ladder to the top of a roof grab hold of a higher rung so that you can let go of a lower rung and then grab onto a rung still higher
As the rungs get further off the ground you find that the mind grows clearer and can see precisely where its clingings are
It gets a sharper sense of which parts of experience belong to which noble truth and what should be done with them the parts that are suffering should be comprehended the parts that cause of suffering  craving and ignorance  should be abandoned the parts that form the path to the end of suffering should be developed and the parts that belong to the end of suffering should be verified
This helps you get higher and higher on the ladder until you find yourself securely on the roof
That's when you can finally let go of the ladder and be totally free
So the real question we face isn't God's question passing judgment on how skillfully he created life or the world
It's our question how skillfully are we handling the raw stuff of life
Are we clinging in ways that serve only to continue the round of suffering or are we learning to cling in ways that will reduce suffering so that ultimately we can grow up and won't have to cling
If we negotiate life armed with all four noble truths realizing that life contains both suffering and an end to suffering there's hope hope that we'll be able to sort out which parts of life belong to which truth hope that someday in this life we'll come to the point where we agree with the Buddha Oh
Yes
This is the end of suffering and stress
One of the first stumbling blocks that Westerners often encounter when they learn about Buddhism is the teaching on anatta often translated as noself
This teaching is a stumbling block for two reasons
First the idea of there being no self doesn't fit well with other Buddhist teachings such as the doctrine of kamma and rebirth If there's no self what experiences the results of kamma and takes rebirth
Second it doesn't fit well with our own JudeoChristian background which assumes the existence of an eternal soul or self as a basic presupposition If there's no self what's the purpose of a spiritual life
Many books try to answer these questions but if you look at the Pali canon  the earliest extant record of the Buddha's teachings  you won't find them addressed at all
In fact the one place where the Buddha was asked pointblank whether or not there was a self he refused to answer
When later asked why he said that to hold either that there is a self or that there is no self is to fall into extreme forms of wrong view that make the path of Buddhist practice impossible
Thus the question should be put aside
To understand what his silence on this question says about the meaning of anatta we first have to look at his teachings on how questions should be asked and answered and how to interpret his answers
The Buddha divided all questions into four classes those that deserve a categorical answer those that deserve an analytical answer defining and qualifying the terms of the question those that deserve a counterquestion putting the ball back in the questioner's court and those that deserve to be put aside
The last class of question consists of those that don't lead to the end of suffering and stress
The first duty of a teacher when asked a question is to figure out which class the question belongs to and then to respond in the appropriate way
You don't for example say yes or no to a question that should be put aside
If you are the person asking the question and you get an answer you should then determine how far the answer should be interpreted
The Buddha said that there are two types of people who misrepresent him those who draw inferences from statements that shouldn't have inferences drawn from them and those who don't draw inferences from those that should
These are the basic ground rules for interpreting the Buddha's teachings but if we look at the way most writers treat the anatta doctrine we find these ground rules ignored
Some writers try to qualify the noself interpretation by saying that the Buddha denied the existence of an eternal self or a separate self but this is to give an analytical answer to a question that the Buddha showed should be put aside
Others try to draw inferences from the few statements in the discourse that seem to imply that there is no self but it seems safe to assume that if one forces those statements to give an answer to a question that should be put aside one is drawing inferences where they shouldn't be drawn
So instead of answering no to the question of whether or not there is a self  interconnected or separate eternal or not  the Buddha felt that the question was misguided to begin with
Why
No matter how you define the line between self and other the notion of self involves an element of selfidentification and clinging and thus suffering and stress
This holds as much for an interconnected self which recognizes no other as it does for a separate self
If one identifies with all of nature one is pained by every felled tree
It also holds for an entirely other universe in which the sense of alienation and futility would become so debilitating as to make the quest for happiness  one's own or that of others  impossible
For these reasons the Buddha advised paying no attention to such questions as Do I exist or Don't I exist for however you answer them they lead to suffering and stress
To avoid the suffering implicit in questions of self and other he offered an alternative way of dividing up experience the four Noble Truths of stress its cause its cessation and the path to its cessation
Rather than viewing these truths as pertaining to self or other he said one should recognize them simply for what they are in and of themselves as they are directly experienced and then perform the duty appropriate to each
Stress should be comprehended its cause abandoned its cessation realized and the path to its cessation developed
These duties form the context in which the anatta doctrine is best understood
If you develop the path of virtue concentration and discernment to a state of calm wellbeing and use that calm state to look at experience in terms of the Noble Truths the questions that occur to the mind are not Is there a self
What is my self but rather Am I suffering stress because I'm holding onto this particular phenomenon
Is it really me myself or mine
If it's stressful but not really me or mine why hold on These last questions merit straightforward answers as they then help you to comprehend stress and to chip away at the attachment and clinging  the residual sense of selfidentification  that cause it until ultimately all traces of selfidentification are gone and all that's left is limitless freedom
In this sense the anatta teaching is not a doctrine of noself but a notself strategy for shedding suffering by letting go of its cause leading to the highest undying happiness
At that point questions of self noself and notself fall aside
Once there's the experience of such total freedom where would there be any concern about what's experiencing it or whether or not it's a self
We all know what happens when a fire goes out
The flames die down and the fire is gone for good
So when we first learn that the name for the goal of Buddhist practice nibbana literally means the extinguishing of a fire it's hard to imagine a deadlier image for a spiritual goal utter annihilation
It turns out though that this reading of the concept is a mistake in translation not so much of a word as of an image
What did an extinguished fire represent to the Indians of the Buddha's day
Anything but annihilation
According to the ancient Brahmins when a fire was extinguished it went into a state of latency
Rather than ceasing to exist it became dormant and in that state  unbound from any particular fuel  it became diffused throughout the cosmos
When the Buddha used the image to explain nibbana to the Indian Brahmins of his day he bypassed the question of whether an extinguished fire continues to exist or not and focused instead on the impossibility of defining a fire that doesn't burn thus his statement that the person who has gone totally out can't be described
However when teaching his own disciples the Buddha used nibbana more as an image of freedom
Apparently all Indians at the time saw burning fire as agitated dependent and trapped both clinging and being stuck to its fuel as it burned
To ignite a fire one had to seize it
When fire let go of its fuel it was freed released from its agitation dependence and entrapment  calm and unconfined
This is why Pali poetry repeatedly uses the image of extinguished fire as a metaphor for freedom
In fact this metaphor is part of a pattern of fire imagery that involves two other related terms as well
Upadana or clinging also refers to the sustenance a fire takes from its fuel
Khandha means not only one of the five heaps that define all conditioned experience but also the trunk of a tree
Just as fire goes out when it stops clinging and taking sustenance from wood so the mind is freed when it stops clinging to the khandhas
Thus the image underlying nibbana is one of freedom
The Pali commentaries support this point by tracing the word nibbana to its verbal root which means unbinding What kind of unbinding
The texts describe two levels
One is the unbinding in this lifetime symbolized by a fire that has gone out but whose embers are still warm
This stands for the enlightened arahant who is conscious of sights and sounds sensitive to pleasure and pain but freed from passion aversion and delusion
The second level of unbinding symbolized by a fire so totally out that its embers have grown cold is what the arahant experiences after this life
All input from the senses cools away and heshe is totally freed from even the subtlest stresses and limitations of existence in space and time
The Buddha insists that this level is indescribable even in terms of existence or nonexistence because words work only for things that have limits
All he really says about it  apart from images and metaphors  is that one can have foretastes of the experience in this lifetime and that it's the ultimate happiness something truly worth knowing
So the next time you watch a fire going out see it not as a case of annihilation but as a lesson in how freedom is to be found in letting go
According to the Buddhist monastic code monks and nuns are not allowed to accept money or even to engage in barter or trade with lay people
They live entirely in an economy of gifts
Lay supporters provide gifts of material requisites for the monastics while the monastics provide their supporters with the gift of the teaching
Ideally  and to a great extent in actual practice  this is an exchange that comes from the heart something totally voluntary
There are many stories in the texts that emphasize the point that returns in this economy  it might also be called an economy of merit  depend not on the material value of the object given but on the purity of heart of the donor and recipient
You give what is appropriate to the occasion and to your means when and wherever your heart feels inspired
For the monastics this means that you teach out of compassion what should be taught regardless of whether it will sell
For the laity this means that you give what you have to spare and feel inclined to share
There is no price for the teachings nor even a suggested donation Anyone who regards the act of teaching or the act of giving requisites as a repayment for a particular favor is ridiculed as mercenary
Instead you give because giving is good for the heart and because the survival of the Dhamma as a living principle depends on daily acts of generosity
The primary symbol of this economy is the alms bowl
If you are a monastic it represents your dependence on others your need to accept generosity no matter what form it takes
You may not get what you want in the bowl but you realize that you always get what you need even if it's a hardearned lesson in doing without
One of my students in Thailand once went to the mountains in the northern part of the country to practice in solitude
His hillside shack was an ideal place to meditate but he had to depend on a nearby hilltribe village for alms and the diet was mostly plain rice with some occasional boiled vegetables
After two months on this diet his meditation theme became the conflict in his mind over whether he should go or stay
One rainy morning as he was on his alms round he came to a shack just as the morning rice was ready
The wife of the house called out asking him to wait while she got some rice from the pot
As he was waiting there in the pouring rain he couldn't help grumbling inwardly about the fact that there would be nothing to go with the rice
It so happened that the woman had an infant son who was sitting near the kitchen fire crying from hunger
So as she scooped some rice out of the pot she stuck a small lump of rice in his mouth
Immediately the boy stopped crying and began to grin
My student saw this and it was like a light bulb turning on in his head
Here you are complaining about what people are giving you for free he told himself
You're no match for a little kid
If he can be happy with just a lump of rice why can't you As a result the lesson that came with his scoop of rice that day gave my student the strength he needed to stay on in the mountains for another three years
For a monastic the bowl also represents the opportunity you give others to practice the Dhamma in accordance with their means
In Thailand this is reflected in one of the idioms used to describe going for alms proad sat doing a favor for living beings
There were times on my alms round in rural Thailand when as I walked past a tiny grass shack someone would come running out to put rice in my bowl
Years earlier as lay person my reaction on seeing such a bare tiny shack would have been to want to give monetary help to them
But now I was on the receiving end of their generosity
In my new position I may have been doing less for them in material terms than I could have done as a lay person but at least I was giving them the opportunity to have the dignity that comes with being a donor
For the donors the monk's alms bowl becomes a symbol of the good they have done
On several occasions in Thailand people would tell me that they had dreamed of a monk standing before them opening the lid to his bowl
The details would differ as to what the dreamer saw in the bowl but in each case the interpretation of the dream was the same the dreamer's merit was about to bear fruit in an especially positive way
The alms round itself is also a gift that goes both ways
On the one hand daily contact with lay donors reminds the monastics that their practice is not just an individual matter but a concern of the entire community
They are indebted to others for the right and opportunity to practice and should do their best to practice diligently as a way of repaying that debt
At the same time the opportunity to walk through a village early in the morning passing by the houses of the rich and poor the happy and unhappy gives plenty of opportunities to reflect on the human condition and the need to find a way out of the grinding cycle of death and rebirth
For the donors the alms round is a reminder that the monetary economy is not the only way to happiness
It helps to keep a society sane when there are monastics infiltrating the towns every morning embodying an ethos very different from the dominant monetary economy
The gently subversive quality of this custom helps people to keep their values straight
Above all the economy of gifts symbolized by the alms bowl and the alms round allows for specialization a division of labor from which both sides benefit
Those who are willing can give up many of the privileges of home life and in return receive the free time the basic support and the communal training needed to devote themselves fully to Dhamma practice
Those who stay at home can benefit from having fulltime Dhamma practitioners around on a daily basis
I have always found it ironic that the modern world honors specialization in almost every area  even in things like running jumping and throwing a ball  but not in the Dhamma where it is denounced as dualism elitism or worse
The Buddha began the monastic order on the first day of his teaching career because he saw the benefits that come with specialization
Without it the practice tends to become limited and diluted negotiated into the demands of the monetary economy
The Dhamma becomes limited to what will sell and what will fit into a schedule dictated by the demands of family and job
In this sort of situation everyone ends up poorer in things of the heart
The fact that tangible goods run only one way in the economy of gifts means that the exchange is open to all sorts of abuses
This is why there are so many rules in the monastic code to keep the monastics from taking unfair advantage of the generosity of lay donors
There are rules against asking for donations in inappropriate circumstances from making claims as to one's spiritual attainments and even from covering up the good foods in one's bowl with rice in hopes that donors will then feel inclined to provide something more substantial
Most of the rules in fact were instituted at the request of lay supporters or in response to their complaints
They had made their investment in the merit economy and were interested in protecting their investment
This observation applies not only to ancient India but also to the modernday West
On their first contact with the Sangha most people tend to see little reason for the disciplinary rules and regard them as quaint holdovers from ancient Indian prejudices
When however they come to see the rules in the context of the economy of gifts and begin to participate in that economy themselves they also tend to become avid advocates of the rules and active protectors of their monastics
The arrangement may limit the freedom of the monastics in certain ways but it means that the lay supporters take an active interest not only in what the monastic teaches but also in how the monastic lives  a useful safeguard to make sure that teachers walk their talk
This again insures that the practice remains a communal concern
As the Buddha said
Monks householders are very helpful to you as they provide you with the requisites of robes alms food lodgings and medicine
And you monks are very helpful to householders as you teach them the Dhamma admirable in the beginning admirable in the middle and admirable in the end as you expound the holy life both in its particulars and in its essence entirely complete surpassingly pure
In this way the holy life is lived in mutual dependence for the purpose of crossing over the flood for making a right end to suffering and stress
Periodically throughout the history of Buddhism the economy of gifts has broken down usually when one side or the other gets fixated on the tangible side of the exchange and forgets the qualities of the heart that are its reason for being
And periodically it has been revived when people are sensitive to its rewards in terms of the living Dhamma
By its very nature the economy of gifts is something of a hothouse creation that requires careful nurture and a sensitive discernment of its benefits
I find it amazing that such an economy has lasted for more than years
It will never be more than an alternative to the dominant monetary economy largely because its rewards are so intangible and require so much patience trust and discipline in order to be appreciated
Those who demand immediate return for specific services and goods will always require a monetary system
Sincere Buddhist lay people however have the chance to play an amphibious role engaging in the monetary economy in order to maintain their livelihood and contributing to the economy of gifts whenever they feel so inclined
In this way they can maintain direct contact with teachers insuring the best possible instruction for their own practice in an atmosphere where mutual compassion and concern are the medium of exchange and purity of heart the bottom line
Is human action real or illusory
If real is it effective
If it is effective does one have a choice in what one does
If one has a choice can one choose to act in a way that will lead to genuine happiness
If so what is that way
These are questions that lie at the heart of the way we conduct our lives
The way we answer them will determine whether we look for happiness through our own abilities seek happiness through outside help or abandon the quest for a higherthanordinary happiness altogether
These questions were precisely the ones that led Siddhattha Gotama  the Bodhisatta or Buddhatobe  to undertake his quest for Awakening
He felt that there was no honor no value in life if true happiness could not be found through one's own efforts
Thus he put his life on the line to see how far human effort could go
Eventually he found that effort skillfully applied could lead to an Awakening to the Deathless
The lessons he learned about action and effort in the course of developing that skill and which were confirmed by the experience of his Awakening formed the basis of his doctrine of kamma
This doctrine lies at the heart of his teaching and forms the essence of the Triple Refuge
Put briefly it states that action is real effective and the result of one's own choice
If one chooses to act skillfully and works to develop that skill one's actions can lead to happiness not only on the ordinary sensory level but also on a level that transcends all the dimensions of time and the present
To understand this doctrine and get a sense of its full implications we must first have some background on how the Buddha arrived at it
This will help us to see how kamma can act as a refuge and what kind of refuge it provides
People often believe that the Buddha simply picked up the doctrine of kamma from his environment but nothing could be further from the truth
Northern India at his time was a place of great intellectual activity and  as science made new advances and called many of the old established beliefs into question  all of the great philosophical and religious issues of human life were up for grabs
The foremost science at that time was astronomy
New precise observations of planetary movements combined with new advances in mathematics had led astronomers to conclude that time was measured in eons incomprehensibly long cycles that repeat themselves endlessly
Philosophers of the time tried to work out the implications of this vast temporal frame for the drama of human life and the quest for ultimate happiness
These philosophers fell into two broad camps those who conducted their speculations within the traditions of the Vedas orthodox religious and ritual texts and other unorthodox groups called the Samanas who questioned the authority of the Vedas
By the time of Siddhattha Gotama philosophers of the Vedic and Samana schools had developed widely differing views of the laws of nature and how they affected the pursuit of true happiness
Their main points of disagreement were two
 Personal identity
Most Vedic and Samana philosophers assumed that a person's identity extended beyond this lifetime eons before birth back into the past and after death on into the future
There was some disagreement however as to whether one's identity from life to life would change or remain the same
The Vedas had viewed rebirth in a positive light but by the time of Prince Siddhattha the influence of the newly discovered astronomical cycles had led those who believed in rebirth to regard the cycles as pointless and confining and release as the only possibility for true happiness
There was however a Samana school of hedonist materialists called Lokayatans who denied the existence of any identity beyond death and insisted that happiness could be found only by indulging in sensual pleasures here and now
 Action and causality
The ancient Vedas had formulated a doctrine of kamma or action which stated that correctly performed actions played a causal role in providing for one's happiness in the life after death
The primary actions recognized by these texts though were ritualistic ritually performed sacrifices often involving the slaughter of animals and gifts to brahmans
To be effective the ritual actions had to be correctly performed
This concern for correct performance led the Vedists to compose ritual manuals prescribing in minute detail the proper things to do and say in the course of their rituals
They even included special chants and spells to compensate for any inadvertent mistakes in the course of a particular ritual so great was their conviction that the quality of an act depends on its physical expression
The Samana schools rejected the Vedic teachings on kamma but for a variety of different reasons
One set of Samana schools called the Ajivakas asserted that an individual's actions were not in the least bit responsible for the course of hisher life
One branch of the Ajivakas taught that all action in the cosmos is illusory as the only truly existing things are the unchanging substances of which the cosmos is made
Thus there is no such thing as right or wrong good or evil for in the ultimate sense there is no such thing as action
Another branch of the Ajivakas taught that action was real but totally subject to fate deterministic causal laws that left no room for free will
Thus they insisted that release from the round of rebirth came only when the round worked itself out
Peace of mind could be found by accepting one's fate and patiently waiting for the cycle like a ball of string unwinding to come to its end
Although these two positions derived from two very different pictures of the cosmos they both led to the same conclusion good and evil were illusory social conventions human beings were not responsible for their acts and human action had no role in shaping one's experience of the cosmos
The Lokayatans came to a similar conclusion but for different reasons
They agreed with the Vedists that physical action was real but they maintained that it bore no results
There was no way to observe any invariable causeeffect relationship between events they said as a result all events were spontaneous and selfcaused
This meant that human actions had no consequences and thus there were no such things as good and evil because no action could have a good or evil effect on anything else
They concluded that one could safely ignore moral rules in one's pursuit of sensual pleasure and would be a fool to deny oneself immediate gratification of one's desires whenever the opportunity appeared
Another school the Jains accepted the Vedic premise that one's actions shaped one's experience of the cosmos but they differed from the Vedas in the way they conceived of action
All action according to them was a form of violence
The more violent the act the more it produced effluents conceived as sticky substances that bound the soul to the round of rebirth
Thus they rejected the Vedic assertion that ritual sacrifice produced good kamma for the violence involved in killing the sacrificial animals was actually a form of very sticky bad kamma
In their eyes the only way to true happiness was to try to escape the round of kamma entirely
This was to be done by violence against themselves various forms of selftorture that were supposed to burn away the effluents the heat of pain being a sign that the effluents were burning
At the same time they tried to create as little new kamma as possible
This practice would culminate in total abstinence from physical action resulting in suicide by starvation the theory being that if old kamma were completely burned away and no new kamma created there would be no more effluents to bind the soul to the cosmos
Thus the soul would be released
Despite the differences between the Vedic and Jain views of action they shared some important similarities Both believed that the physical performance of an action rather than the mental attitude behind it determined its kammic result
And both saw kamma as acting under deterministic linear laws
Kamma performed in the present would not bear fruit until the future and the relationship between a particular action and its result was predictable and fixed
These divergent viewpoints on the nature of action formed the backdrop for the Bodhisatta's quest for ultimate happiness
On the one side stood the Ajivakas and Lokayatans who insisted for various reasons that human action was ineffective either nonexistent chaotic or totally predetermined
On the other side stood the Vedic and Jain thinkers who taught that physical action was effective but that it was subject to deterministic and linear laws and could not lead to true happiness beyond the round of rebirth
The Buddha's position on kamma broke from both sides of the issue largely because he approached the question from a radically new direction
Instead of arguing from abstract science the Bodhisatta focused directly on the level of immediate experience and explored the implications of truths that both sides overlooked
Instead of fixing on the content of the views expressed he considered the actions of those who were expressing the views
If views of determinism and total chaos were followed to their logical end there would be no point in purposeful action and yet the proponents of both theories continued to act in purposeful ways
If only physical acts bore consequences there would be no point in teaching a proper understanding of the nature of action  for the mental act of understanding right or wrong would have no consequences  and yet all sides agreed that it was important to understand reality in the right way
The fact that each side insisted that the other used unskillful forms of observation and argumentation to advance its views implied that mental skills were crucial in determining the truth
Thus the Bodhisatta looked directly at skillful mental action in and of itself followed its implications in developing knowledge itself as a skill  rather than as a body of facts  and found that those implications carried him all the way to release
The most basic lesson he learned was that mental skills can be developed
As one of the Pali discourses notes he found that thoughts imbued with passion aversion and delusion were harmful thoughts devoid of these qualities were not harmful and he could shepherd his thoughts in such a way to avoid harm
The fact that he could develop this skill meant that mental action is not illusory that it actually gives results
Otherwise there would be no such thing as skill for no actions would be more effective than others
The fact of skillfulness also implies that some results are preferable to others for otherwise there would be no point in trying to develop skills
In addition the fact that it is possible to learn from mistakes in the course of developing a skill  so that one's future actions may be more skillful  implies that the cycle of action result and reaction is not entirely deterministic
Acts of perception attention and intention can actually provide new input as the cycle goes through successive turns
The important element in this input is attention
Anyone who has mastered a skill will realize that the process of attaining mastery requires attention to three things to preexisting conditions to what one is doing in relation to those conditions and to the results that come from one's actions
This threefold focus enables one to monitor one's actions and adjust them accordingly
In this way attention to conditions actions and effects allows the results of an action to feed back into future action thus allowing for refinement in one's skill
In the first stage of his practice the Bodhisatta refined the skillfulness of his mind until it reached a state of jhana or concentrated mental absorption marked by perfect equanimity and mindfulness
The question that occurred at that point was how much further the principle of skillful action could be applied
Did intentional action directly or indirectly explain all experience in the world or only some of it
If all of it could the same principle be used to gain escape from the suffering inherent in the world or were the Jains right in saying that action could only keep one bound to the cycle of suffering
As the texts tell us the Bodhisatta's first attempt to answer these questions was to direct his mind  now stable bright clear and malleable  to knowledge of previous lifetimes
If it were true that he had been born before his actions from past lives might explain experiences in this life  such as the circumstances into which he was born  for which no actions in this life could account
He found that he could indeed remember previous lives many thousands of them what he had been born as where what his experience of pleasure and pain how he had died and then experienced rebirth as something else
This first insight however did not fully answer his question
He needed to know if kamma was indeed the principle that shaped life not only in terms of the narrative of his own lives but also as a cosmic principle effecting the lives of all beings
So he directed his mind to knowledge of the passing away and arising of beings throughout the cosmos and found that he could indeed see beings dying and gaining rebirth that the pleasure and pain of their new lives was shaped by the quality of their kamma and the kamma in turn was dependent on the views that gave rise to it
Right views  believing that good kamma based on skillful intentions gave rise to happiness  lay behind good kamma while wrong views  not believing these principles  lay behind bad
Even this second insight however didn't fully answer his question
To begin with there was no guarantee that the visions providing this knowledge were true or complete
And even if they were they did not tell whether there was a form of right view that would underlie a level of skillful kamma that would lead not simply to a pleasant rebirth within the cycle of rebirth but to release from the cycle altogether
Here was where the Bodhisatta turned to look again at the events in the mind in and of themselves in the present and in particular at the process of developing of skillfulness to see if it offered any clues as to what a right view leading out of the cycle of rebirth might be
As we noted above the process of skillfulness implies two things a nonlinear principle of cause and effect involving feedback loops to allow for greater skillfulness and the fact that some results are preferable to others
The Bodhisatta used these principles in their most basic form to divide experience into four categories based on two sets of variables cause and effect on one hand and stress and its cessation on the other
He then dropped the categories in which the first two knowledges had been expressed
In other words he dropped the sense of self and others in which the narrative of the first knowledge had been expressed and the sense of beings inhabiting a world in which the cosmology of the second knowledge had been expressed
In his place he analyzed experience in categories empty of those concepts simply in terms of the direct experience of stress its cause its cessation and the path of mental factors leading to its cessation
In the first round of this new insight he was able to identify each of these categories stress in ultimate terms was attachment to anything that might be identified as a self The cause of stress was craving which in turn was based on ignorance about the true nature of stress
The cessation of stress was the total abandoning of craving while the path to the cessation of stress was a cluster of eight factors right view right resolve right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness and right concentration
In the second round of this insight he realized the duties that had to be performed with regard to each of these categories
Stress was to be comprehended its cause abandoned its cessation realized and the path developed
He then pursued those duties until the mental powers of the path were so fully developed that stress was totally comprehended
This meant that there were no more objects on which craving could land and so it was naturally abandoned
Thus in the third round of this insight he realized that the duties with regard to all four truths had been fulfilled
At that point there was nothing further for the mind to do  there was nothing more it could do in these terms
Right view and concentration  the mental qualities lying at the heart of the path  had done such a thorough job of ferreting out stress and craving that as their final act they detected the subtle stress and craving inherent in the act of right view and right concentration themselves
Thus as its final act the mind let go even of these path factors just as a carpenter would let go of his tools when they had finished their job
As a result all present mental input into the processes of experience naturally came to a halt in a state of nonfashioning
This state opened onto an experience of total liberation called Unbinding
Realizing that this Unbinding was the total cessation of suffering and of the processes of death and rebirth as generated in the mind the Bodhisatta now the Buddha knew that his questions had been answered
Skillful action based on right view in the form of the four categories based around stress  which he termed the four noble truths  could indeed bring about a total happiness free from the limitations of birth aging illness and death
The texts tell us that the Buddha spent the first seven weeks after his Awakening experiencing that happiness and freedom
Then he decided to teach the way to that happiness to others
His teachings were based on the three insights that had led to his own experience of Awakening
Because right view lay at the heart of his analysis of kamma and the way out of kamma his teachings focused in particular on the two forms of right view that he learned in the course of those insights the form he learned in the second insight which led to a favorable rebirth and the form he learned in the third insight which led out from the cycle of death and rebirth once and for all
The first level of right view the Buddha termed mundane right view
He expressed it in these terms
There is what is given what is offered what is sacrificed
There are fruits and results of good and bad actions
There is this world and the next world
There is mother and father
There are spontaneously reborn beings there are brahmans and contemplatives who faring rightly and practicing rightly proclaim this world and the next after having directly known and realized it for themselves
The second level of right view which the Buddha termed transcendent right view he expressed simply as
Knowledge in terms of stress knowledge in terms of the origination of stress knowledge in terms of the cessation of stress knowledge in terms of the way of practice leading to the cessation of stress
Just as the third insight grew out of the first two insights the second level of right view grows out of the first
Its purpose is impossible to fathom if taken outside of the context of mundane good and bad kamma and their good and bad results
Together the two levels of right view provide a complete and complementary picture of the nature of kamma as viewed from two different perspectives
The first level views kamma as a cosmic principle at work in the narrative of each individual's many lives
The second form views kamma as a principle at work in the present moment approached from a frame of mind empty of the categories of self and other being and nonbeing which lie at the essence of narratives and cosmologies
To see how these two levels of right view complement one another in shaping the form and content of the Buddha's teachings we can look at his most common mode of presenting his teachings the graduated discourse beginning with the principle of good and bad kamma and gradually building up through the topics of generosity virtue heaven drawbacks and renunciation ending with the topic of the four noble truths
There were several reasons for this gradual approach but primarily they came down to the fact that the four truths were too abstract to appear immediately relevant and the goal of escape from rebirth made no sense unless viewed in the proper context
The role of the graduated discourse was to provide that sense of relevance and context
Starting with the first level of right view the Buddha would describe good actions under two main categories generosity and virtue
Together the two categories could be stretched to cover almost any type of good physical verbal or mental deeds
For example generosity covers not only the giving of material gifts but also generosity with one's time knowledge gratitude and forgiveness
Virtue begins with the five precepts  against killing stealing illicit sex lying and taking intoxicants  includes prohibitions against five forms of wrong livelihood  selling slaves intoxicants poisons weapons and animals to be killed for food  and goes on to cover abstention from all forms of harmful behavior
Thus good behavior taken under the categories of generosity and virtue means both refraining from harmful behavior and performing actions that are beneficial
Having described good actions the Buddha would describe their rewards as results of the cosmic principle of kamma
The rewards here include both those visible in this world and those to be anticipated in the next
The Buddhist texts contain glowing descriptions both of the sense of wellbeing in the immediate present that results from good actions and of the exquisite pleasures that rebirth in heaven entails
Implicit in these descriptions is the dark side of the principle of kamma the inherent punishments that come from bad behavior again both in this world and in the next in the various levels of hell and other lower births  such as a common animal  and again in this world on one's return to the human state
However  because finite actions can't produce infinite results  the rewards of kamma good or bad are not eternal
This point led naturally to the next topic in the discourse the drawbacks of the cycle of rebirth as a whole
No happiness within the cycle is permanent even the most refined heavenly pleasures must end when the force of one's good kamma ends and one is forced to return to the rough and tumble of lower realms of being
The changeability of the mind lying behind the creation of kamma means that the course of an individual's life through the realms of rebirth is not necessarily ever upward
In fact as the Buddha saw from his remembrance of his own lives the course leading from one rebirth to another is filled with aimless ups and downs like a stick thrown into the air sometimes landing on this end sometimes on the other end sometimes in the middle
The amount of suffering and stress suffered in the course of these many throws is more than can be measured
These considerations led naturally to the next topic of the discourse renunciation
Having realized the fleeting nature of even the most refined pleasures in the round of rebirth the sensitive listener would be prepared to look favorably on the idea of renouncing any aspiration for happiness within the round and cultivating the path to release
The texts compare this mental preparation to the act of washing a cloth so that it would be ready to take dye
This was when the Buddha would take the listener beyond the level of mundane right view and broach the transcendent level
The texts describing the steps of the graduated discourse describe this step simply as the teaching special to the Buddhas stress its origination its cessation and the path ie the four noble truths
However the four noble truths are simply one out of three interrelated versions of transcendent right view taught in the texts thisthat conditionality dependent coarising and the four noble truths
In order to gain a full picture of the Buddha's teachings on the nature of kamma we should look at all three
The most basic version of right view is simply the causal principle of feedback loops that the Buddha found in the process of developing skillful action
He called this principle thisthat conditionality because it explains experience in terms that are immediately present to awareness  events that can be pointed to in the mind as this or that  rather than principles hidden from awareness
He expressed this principle in a simplelooking formula
Of the many possible ways of interpreting this formula only one does justice both to the way the formula is worded and to the complex fluid manner in which specific examples of causal relationships are described in the texts
That way is to view the formula as the interplay of two causal principles one diachronic acting over time and the other synchronic acting in a single instant of time
The two principles combine to form a nonlinear pattern
The diachronic principle  taking and as a pair  connects events over time the synchronic principle  and  connects objects and events in the present moment
The two principles intersect so that any given event is influenced by two sets of conditions input from the past and input from the present
Although each principle seems simple their interaction makes their consequences very complex
To begin with every act has repercussions in the present moment together with reverberations extending into the future
Depending on the intensity of the act these reverberations can last for a very short or a very long time
Thus every event takes place in a context determined by the combined effects of past events coming from a wide range in time together with the effects of present acts
These effects can intensify one another can coexist with little interaction or can cancel one another out
Thus even though it is possible to predict that a certain type of act will tend to give a certain type of result  for example acting on anger will lead to pain  there is no way to predict when or where that result will make itself felt
The complexity of the system is further enhanced by the fact that both causal principles meet at the mind
Through its views and intentions the mind keeps both principles active
Through its sensory powers it is affected by the results of the causes it has set in motion
This allows for the causal principles to feed back into themselves as the mind reacts to the results of its own actions
These reactions can form positive feedback loops intensifying the original input and its results much like the howl in a speaker placed next to the microphone feeding into it
They can also create negative feedback loops counteracting the original input in the same way that a thermostat turns off a heater when the temperature in a room is too high and turns it on again when it gets too low
Because the results of actions can be immediate and the mind can react to them immediately these feedback loops can sometimes quickly spin out of control at other times they may provide skillful checks on one's behavior
For example a man may act out of anger which gives him an immediate sense of disease to which he may react with further anger thus creating a snowballing effect
On the other hand he may come to understand that the anger is causing his disease and so immediately attempt to stop it
However there can also be times when the results of his past actions may obscure his present disease so that he doesn't immediately react to it at all
This means that although there are general patterns relating habitual acts to their results there is no set oneforone titfortat relationship between a particular action and its results
Instead the results are determined by the entire context of the act shaped by the actions that preceded or followed it and by one's state of mind at the time of acting or experiencing the result
In this way the combination of two causal principles  influences from the past interacting with those in the immediate present  accounts for the complexity of causal relationships on the level of immediate experience
However the combination of the two principles also opens the possibility for finding a systematic way to break the causal web
If causes and effects were entirely linear the cosmos would be totally deterministic and nothing could be done to escape from the machinations of the causal process
If they were entirely synchronic there would be no relationship from one moment to the next and all events would be arbitrary
The web could break down totally or reform spontaneously for no reason at all
However with the two modes working together one can learn from causal patterns observed from the past and apply one's insights to disentangling the same causal patterns acting in the present
If one's insights are true one can then gain freedom from those patterns
This allows for escape from the cycle of kamma altogether by developing kamma at a heightened level of skill by pursuing the noble eightfold path
In addition the nonlinearity of thisthat conditionality explains why heightened skillfulness when focused on the present moment can succeed in leading to the end of the kamma that has formed the experience of the entire cosmos
All nonlinear processes exhibit what is called scale invariance meaning that the behavior of the process on any one scale is similar to its behavior on smaller or larger scales
To understand say the largescale pattern of a particular nonlinear process one need only focus on its behavior on a smaller scale that is easier to observe and one will see the same pattern at work
In the case of kamma one need only focus on the process of kamma in the immediate present in the course of developing heightened skillfulness and the largescale issues over the expanses of space and time will become clear as one gains release from them
The teaching on dependent coarising helps to provide more detailed instructions on this point showing precisely where the cycle of kamma provides openings for more skillful present input
In doing so it both explains the importance of the act of attention in developing heightened skillfulness and acts as a guide for focusing attention on present experience in appropriate ways
Dependent coarising shows how the cosmos when viewed in the context of how it is directly experienced by a person developing skillfulness is subsumed entirely under factors immediately present to awareness the five aggregates of form feeling perception mental fabrication and consciousness and the six sense media  ie the five senses plus the mind
The standard list of causal factors runs as follows the suffering and stress of aging illness and death depend on birth birth in turn depends on becoming and so on down through clinging craving feeling sensory contact the six senses name and form sensory consciousness mental fabrications and ignorance
Although the list reads like a linear pattern the precise definitions of the terms show that it is filled with many feedback loops
Because it is nonlinear it thus functions on several scales birth for instance refers both to the birth of a physical organism and to the birth of a sense of being in the mind
Included in this list is the Buddha's ultimate analysis of kamma and rebirth
For instance the nexus of kamma clinging becoming and birth accounts for the realm in which birth takes place
Kamma gives rise to the five aggregates which form the objects for craving and clinging
Once there is clinging there is a comingintobeing in any of three realms the sensual realm the realm of form and the formless realm
These realms refer not only to levels of being on the cosmic scale but also to levels of mental states
Some mental states are concerned with sensual images others with forms and still others with formless abstractions
The relationship between birth and becoming can be compared to the process of falling asleep and dreaming
As drowsiness leads the mind to lose contact with waking reality a dream image of another place and time will appear in it
The appearance of this image is called becoming
The act of entering into this image and taking on a role or identity within it  and thus entering the world of the dream and falling asleep  is birth
The commentaries to the Pali texts maintain that precisely the same process is what enables rebirth to follow the death of the body
At the same time the analogy between falling asleep and taking birth explains why release from the cycle of becoming is called Awakening
Once there is birth in a particular realm the nexus of nameandform with consciousness accounts for the arising and survival of the active organism within that realm
Without consciousness the mental and physical organism would die
Without the mental and physical organism consciousness would have no place to land and develop
This nexus also explains the feedback loops that can lead to skillful action
Name includes the subfactors of attention intention feeling perception and contact which are precisely the factors at work in the process of kamma and its result
The first lesson of skillfulness is that the essence of an action lies in the intention motivating it an act motivated by the intention for greater skillfulness will give results different from those of an act motivated by greed aversion or delusion
Intention in turn is influenced by the appropriateness or inappropriateness of the act of attention to one's circumstances
The less an act of attention is clouded by delusion the more clearly it will see things in appropriate terms
The combination of attention and intention in turn determines the quality of the feeling and the physical events that result from the act
The more skilled the action the more refined these results will be
Perceptions arise with regard to those results some more appropriate than others
The act of attention selects which ones to focus on thus feeding back into another round in the cycle of action
Underlying the entire cycle is the fact that all its factors are in contact with consciousness
This interplay of name form and consciousness provides an answer to the quandary of how the stress and suffering inherent in the cycle of action can be ended
If one tried simply to stop the cycle through a direct intention the intention itself would count as kamma and thus as a factor to keep the cycle going
This double bind can be dissolved however if one can watch as the contact between consciousness and the cycle naturally falls away
This requires not inaction but more and more appropriate attention to the process of kamma itself
When one's attention to and mastery of the process becomes fully complete there occurs a point of equipoise called nonfashioning in which the contact between the processes of kamma and consciousness  still fully conscious  naturally becomes disengaged
One modern teacher has compared this disengagement to that of a fruit naturally falling when fully ripened from the tree
This is how the cycle of action comes to an end in the moment of Awakening
As this analysis shows the most important obstacle to release is the ignorance that keeps attention from being fully perceptive
As the Buddha traced the element of ignorance that underlay the processes of mental fabrication he found that it came down to ignorance of the four noble truths the identity of the truths the duties appropriate to each and the mastery of those duties
When this ignorance is fully overcome the craving that keeps the cycle going will have nothing to fasten on for all its possible objects are seen for what they are suffering and stress
With no place to land craving disappears and the cycle can come to an end
Because knowledge in terms of the four noble truths is what ends ignorance and craving the Buddha most often expressed transcendent right view in their terms
These truths focus the analysis of kamma directly on the question of stress and suffering issues at the heart of the narratives that people make of their own life experiences
As the Buddha noted in his second insight his memory of previous lives included his experience of pleasure and pain in each life and most people  when recounting their own lives  tend to focus on these issues as well
The four truths however do not stop simply with tales about stress they approach it from the problemsolving perspective of a person engaged in developing a skill
What this means for the meditator trying to master heightened skillfulness is that these truths cannot be fully comprehended by passive observation
Only by participating sensitively in the process of developing skillful powers of mindfulness concentration and discernment  and gaining a practical feel for the relationship of cause and effect among the mental factors that shape that process  can one eradicate the ignorance that obstructs the ending of kamma
Thus only through developing skillfulness to the ultimate degree can the cycle be brought to equilibrium and as a result disband
The truth of the Buddha's understanding of the processes of kamma  as informed by thisthat conditionality dependent coarising and the four noble truths  was confirmed by the knowledge of Unbinding that followed immediately on his mastery of heightened skillfulness
He found that when skillfulness is intentionally brought to a point of full consummation as expressed in the direct awareness of thisthat conditionality it leads to a state of nonfashioning that opens to a level of consciousness in which all experience of the cosmos has fallen away
When one's experience of the cosmos resumes after the experience of Awakening one sees clearly that it is composed entirely of the results of old kamma with no new kamma added to the process all experience of the cosmos will eventually run out  or in the words of the texts will grow cold right here This discovery confirmed the basic premise that kamma not only plays a role in shaping experience of the cosmos it plays the primary role
If this were not so then even when kamma was ended there would still remain the types of experience that came from other sources
But because none of the limitations of the cosmos  time space etc
 remain when all present kamma disbands and none resume after all old kamma runs out kamma must be the factor accounting for all experience of those limitations
This fact implies that even the limiting factors that one encounters in terms of sights sounds etc are actually the fruit of past kamma in thought word and deed  committed not only in this but also in many preceding lifetimes
Thus even though the Buddha's development of heightened skillfulness focused on the present moment the resulting Awakening gave insights that encompassed all of time
From this discussion it should become clear why kamma as an article of faith is a necessary factor in the path of Buddhist practice
The teaching on kamma in its narrative and cosmological forms provides the context for the practice giving it direction and urgency
Because the cosmos is governed by the laws of kamma those laws provide the only mechanism by which happiness can be found
But because good and bad kamma consisting of good and bad intentions simply perpetuate the ups and downs of experience in the cosmos a way must be found out of the mechanism of kamma by mastering it in a way that allows it to disband in an attentive state of nonintention
And because there is no telling what sudden surprises the results of one's past kamma may still hold in store one should try to develop that mastery as quickly as possible
In its empty mode  ie focusing on the process of action without referring to questions of whether or not there is a self or a being behind the processes  the teaching on kamma accounts for the focus and the terms of analysis used in the practice
It also accounts for the mental qualities needed to attain and maintain that level of focus and analysis
In terms of focus the principle of scale invariance means that the complexities of kamma can be mastered by giving total attention to phenomena in and of themselves in the immediate present
These phenomena are then analyzed in terms of the four noble truths the terms used in observing and directing the experience of developing the qualities of skillful action
The most immediate skillful kamma that can be observed on this level is the mastery of the very same mental qualities that are supporting this refined level of focus and analysis mindfulness concentration and discernment together with the more basic qualities on which they are based
Thus these mental qualities act not only as supports to the focus and analysis but also as their object
Ultimately discernment becomes so refined that the focus and analysis take as their object the act of focusing and analyzing in and of themselves
The cycle of action then shortcircuits as it reaches culmination and Unbinding occurs
It is entirely possible that a person with no firm conviction in the principle of kamma can follow parts of the Buddhist path including mindfulness and concentration practices and gain positive results from them
For instance one can pursue mindfulness practice for the sense of balance equanimity and peace it gives to one's daily life or for the sake of bringing the mind to the present for the purpose of spontaneity and going with the flow The full practice of the path however is a skillful diverting of the flow of the mind from its habitual kammic streams to the stream of Unbinding
As the Buddha said this practice requires a willingness to develop and abandon to an extreme degree
The developing requires a supreme effort aimed at full and conscious mastery of mindfulness concentration and discernment to the point of nonfashioning and on to release
A lack of conviction in the principle of kamma would undercut the patience and commitment the desire persistence intent and refined powers of discrimination needed to pursue concentration and discernment to the most heightened levels beyond what is needed for a general sense of peace or spontaneity
The abandoning involves uprooting the most deeply buried forms of clinging and attachment that maintain bondage to the cycle of rebirth
Some of these forms of clinging  such as views and theories about selfidentity  are so entrenched in the narrative and cosmological modes in which most people function that only firm conviction in the benefits to be had by abandoning them will be able to pry them loose
This is why the Buddha insisted repeatedly that conviction in the fact of his Awakening necessarily involves conviction in the principle of kamma and that both forms of conviction are needed for the full mastery of the kamma of heightened skillfulness leading to release
There are many wellknown passages in the Canon where the Buddha asks his listeners not to accept his teachings simply on faith but these remarks were directed to people just beginning the practice
Beginners need only accept the general principles of skillful action on a trial basis focusing on the input that their intentions are putting into the causal system at the present moment and exploring the connection between skillful intentions and favorable results
The more complex issues of kamma come into play at this level only in forcing one to be patient with the practice
Many times skillful intentions do not produce their favorable results immediately aside from the sense of wellbeing  sometimes clearly perceptible sometimes barely  that comes with acting skillfully
Were it not for this delay the principle of kamma would be selfevident no one would dare act on unskillful intentions and there would be no need to take the principle on faith
The complexity of thisthat conditionality is the major cause of the confusion and lack of skill with which most people live their lives
The ability to master this process takes time
As one progresses on the path however  and as the process of developing skillfulness in and of itself gradually comes to take center stage in one's awareness  the actual results of developing skillfulness should give greater and greater reason for conviction in the principle of kamma
Except in cases where people fall into the trap of heedlessness or complacency these results can spur and inspire one to hold to the principle of kamma with the increasing levels of firmness focus and refinement needed for Awakening
This then is the sense in which kamma or intentional action forms the basic refuge for the person on the path
On the one hand as a doctrine it provides guidance to the proper path of action and encouragement to muster the energy needed to follow the path
On the other hand as the actual principle by which skillful action is brought to a pitch of nonfashioning on the threshold of the Deathless it provides the mechanism by which human effort and action can bring about the ultimate in genuine happiness

Although our calculation of time's passage in years and centuries carries no more weight against the vastness of the cosmic process than a feather before a storm still being human it is natural for us to nurture hope on reaching the threshold of a new millennium
Adherents of different religions also turn their thoughts toward the new millennium and as Buddhists we might briefly ponder the question what the Dhamma can offer the world in the years ahead
From one angle it could be said that what Buddhism can offer humankind today is exactly what it has been holding out for the past twentyfive centuries an acute diagnosis of the human condition and a clear path to final liberation from suffering
But while this statement is correct as far as it goes it is not yet sufficient for it does not take account of the fact that in any age the aspects of the Dhamma to be emphasized and the way they are to be expressed must address the particular problems faced by the people living in that age
The Buddha's teaching acquires its incisive relevance not merely by the cogency of its broad generalities but by attuning its formulations to the precise problems that loom so large in the consciousness of the particular period in which it has taken root
Thus for the Dhamma to preserve its vitality and strength it is not enough merely to repeat hallowed formulas inherited from the past however true they might be in their own right
Rather we must focus the lens of the Buddha's teaching on the deep problems faced by human beings today and determine how the teachings can help to resolve those problems as effectively as possible
If what the Buddha taught is only suffering and the cessation of suffering then the starting point for any convincing presentation of the way to suffering's end must be the specific forms of suffering characteristic of our time
In the decades of the twentieth century two manifestations of suffering have become so prevalent that they seem almost the defining characteristics of the modern era
One is an invidious sense of meaninglessness a feeling of alienation from life now becoming almost as common in the more modernized quarters of Asia as in the West
The other most marked in the Third World is collective violence
The first problem has its locus in the individual consciousness the second in the relationships among communities at different levels of social order
If the Dhamma is to benefit humanity in the coming years and decades it must show us a way out of the abyss of meaninglessness and offer guidelines for reducing the frequency and severity of collective violence
The sense of meaninglessness as a widespread social phenomenon set in with the rise of modern industrial civilization
As each new breakthrough in natural science dealt a fresh blow to the organic Christian world view that had prevailed during the medieval period human beings could no longer regard themselves as the pinnacle of creation the beloved children of an allloving Father who had created the universe expressly as the stage for our unfolding march toward salvation
Instead under the influence of the mechanistic sciences we came to see ourselves as chance products of purely natural causes born and dying in a universe cold and indifferent to our hopes
Our existence was inexplicable in terms of any objective source of meaning
It did not embody any higher purpose than the brute struggle to survive and propagate our genes before death draws the curtain closed on all our restless strivings
The loss of meaning was further aggravated by the breakup of traditional forms of social order under the impact of industrial capitalism
The rise of the city and the compulsive work routine of office and factory cut the bonds of social solidarity so that each individual came to see himself or herself as an isolated entity pitted against others in stark competition for dominance
The individual ego thus became the ultimate center of experience and the sole determinant of value
But it was an isolated ego on whom the otherregarding virtues inculcated by religious ethics such as generosity and selfsacrifice no longer had any claims
Altruism and restraint were eclipsed by the new creed of selfindulgence which gave precedence to wealth power and conspicuous consumption as the supreme goals of life
As Western technology and its offshoot the consumerist culture spread to the far corners of the world the breakdown of meaning and the sense of selfalienation became endemic to many lands and today this sense of meaninglessness has reached a truly global scale
The culture of narcissism which exalts the reckless quest for selfaggrandizement has spread its tentacles everywhere leaving behind the same debris agitated minds and hollow lives
Bent on quick and easy gratification we pass our lives perpetually shadowed by a fear that all our achievements are worthless unable to deliver any deep and stable satisfaction
And when this fear reveals itself the abyss opens up the realization that we have wasted our lives in the pursuit of empty dreams
Thus the high incidence of mental illness drug dependence alcoholism and suicide particularly in the more affluent parts of the world
It is a telling sign that despite the impressive achievements of science and technology a culture built on mere mastery over external nature is far from successful in meeting the deep demands of the human spirit
For those adrift in the sea of meaninglessness the Buddha's teaching offers a sense of meaning stemming from a profound spiritual tradition that combines metaphysical depth with psychological astuteness and the highest ethical standards
Without calling for blind faith in dogmatic creeds or speculative postulates the Buddha points directly to the invariable universal laws that underlie happiness and suffering
He insists that we can discover these laws for ourselves simply by clear reflection on our own immediate experience and he offers us methods of practice by which we can gradually dig up the buried roots of suffering and cultivate the causes culminating in the highest happiness
His appeal is to immediate experience
We can see for ourselves that suffering prevails in a mind driven by greed hatred and delusion and that happiness grows when the mind is suffused by the virtues of generosity kindness and understanding
On the basis of this experimental test which lies within the scope of any thinking person we can extrapolate and see that for a mind fully liberated from all selfcentered defilements and adorned with perfect detachment love and wisdom happiness and peace will become boundless and irreversible
Thus by showing us the way to inner peace and happiness the Dhamma offers us an outlet from the abyss of meaninglessness a way to confer on our lives an exalted meaning and purpose
The second type of suffering that has become so pervasive in our time is social violence which still wreaks so much misery across the globe
To be sure communal violence is by no means peculiar to our era nor a product of modern civilization but has infected human relations from time immemorial
But what has become so disturbing in the presentday world is the eruption of violence between different ethnic communities that in the past had managed to coexist in a relatively stable degree of mutual acceptance
We have witnessed these outbreaks of enmity recently in the Balkans Russia Indonesia Central Africa northern India and sadly in our own Sri Lanka
Violence manifests itself moreover not only in the conflicts that rage between groups of different ethnic stocks and communal loyalties but also in economic oppression in the widening gap between rich and the poor in the gargantuan arms industries that thrive on violent conflict in the sexual exploitation of women and children in the drug trade and also in the reckless devastation of the environment by which we risk ripping away the life support systems that sustain our life on earth
While Buddhism cannot pretend to offer a detailed solution to all the countless forms that violence takes in the presentday world the values emphasized by the Dhamma show what is required to arrive at any lasting solution
What is necessary for true peace and harmony to prevail among human beings is not the hammering out of a comprehensive treaty by which the various parties to a conflict compromise their hard and volatile demands
What is truly required is a new mode of perception the ascent to a universal consciousness that transcends the narrow standpoint of egocentric or ethnocentric selfinterest
This is a consciousness that regards others as not essentially different from oneself which detaches itself from the insistent voice of selfinterest and rises up to a universal perspective from which the welfare of all appears as important as one's own good
We can see the germ of this universal perspective in a principle that stands at the base of Buddhist ethics even more fundamental to its ethical ideals than the Five Precepts or any other formal code of conduct
This is the principle of taking oneself as the criterion for determining how to treat others
When we apply this principle we can understand that just as we each wish to live happily and to be free from suffering so all other beings wish to live happily and to be free from suffering just as we are each averse to pain and hardship and want to live in peace so all others are averse to pain and hardship and want to live in peace
When we have understood this common core of feeling that we share with all other beings not as a mere idea but as a visceral experience born of deep reflection we will treat others with the same kindness and care that we would wish them to treat us
And this must apply at a communal level just as much as in our personal relations
We must learn to see other communities as essentially similar to our own and entitled to the same benefits as we wish for the group to which we belong
Even if we cannot reach any expansive feelings of love and compassion for others we will at least realize that the moral imperative requires that we treat them with justice and kindness
Thus the message of the Dhamma to human beings in the next millennium might be briefly summed up in these twin gifts
In the personal domain it gives us a precisely defined path that confers on life a deep sense of purpose a purpose grounded in the cosmic order but which can be actualized in one's own immediate experience
In the communal dimension of human existence it holds out an ethical guideline to right action which if diligently applied can arouse a conscientious commitment to a life of nonviolence
Though it is far too much to expect that these two blessings will become the common heritage of all humanity we can at least hope that enough people will accept them to make the twentyfirst century a brighter and happier century than the one we are about to leave behind
The Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creeds
Founded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topics
Its publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddha's discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practice
These works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first arose
Nibbana is the culmination of the Buddhist quest for perfection and happiness
In order to understand the meaning of this term it is useful to refer to the verse attributed to Kisa Gotami when she saw Prince Siddhattha returning to the palace from the park on the eve of his great renunciation
She declared
Happycontentedpeaceful indeed is the mother happy indeed is the father happy indeed is the woman who has such a one as her husband
Nibbuta is often treated as the past participle of the verb nibbaayati and nibbaana is the nominal form of that verb
It means happiness contentment and peace
Nibbaayati also means to extinguish to blow out as in the blowing out of a lamp
Nibbana is so called because it is the blowing out of the fires of greed hatred and delusion
When these fires are blown out peace is attained and one becomes completely cooled  siitibhuuta
It is sometimes conjectured that Nibbana is called cool because the Buddha preached in a warm country where the cool was appreciated as comfortable
Had he taught in a cold climate he might have described Nibbana in terms of warmth
But it is certain that the term cool was chosen to convey a literal psychological reality
Anger makes us hot and restless
We use expressions such as boiling with anger and they clearly express the intensity of the aggressive emotion
When such negative emotions are completely eradicated never to arise again the temperament has to be described as cool
Nibbana is a state to be attained here and now in this very life and not a state to be attained only after death
In terms of living experience Nibbana can be characterized by four special attributes happiness moral perfection realization and freedom
We shall take these up for discussion one by one
Nibbana is described as the highest happiness the supreme state of bliss
Those who have attained Nibbana live in utter bliss free from hatred and mental illness amongst those who are hateful and mentally ill
Sukha in Paali denotes both happiness and pleasure
In English happiness denotes more a sense of mental ease while pleasure denotes physical well being
The Paali word sukha extends to both these aspects and it is certain that mental and physical bliss is experienced by one who has attained Nibbana
The experience of nonsensuous physical bliss for limited periods is possible even before the attainment of Nibbana through the practice of jhaana or meditative absorption
The Saamaññaphala Sutta describes these physical experiences with the help of eloquent similes
When bath powder is kneaded with water into a neat wet ball the moisture touches every part of the ball but does not ooze out similarly the body of the adept in the first jhaana is drenched and suffused with joy and pleasure born of detachment from sense pleasures
The experience in the second jhaana is elucidated with a different simile
A deep pool filled to the brim with clear cool water is fed by underground springs yet the waters do not overflow and no part of the pool remains untouched by the cool waters
Similarly joy and pleasure born of concentration pervade the body of the meditator in the second jhaana
The simile for the third jhaana is a lotus born in water grown in water fully submerged in water and drawing nourishment from water with no part of the lotus remaining untouched by the cool water
Thus happinesspleasure suffuses drenches and permeates the entire body of the adept in the third jhaana
These are the experiences of nonsensuous pleasure before the attainment of Nibbana
On the attainment of Nibbana more refined nonsensuous pleasure is permanently established
The Cankii Sutta specifically states that when a monk realizes the ultimate truth he experiences that truth with the body
Regarding the experience of the arahant the Suttanipaata states that by the destruction of all feelingssensations a monk lives desireless and at peace
Once Saariputta was asked what happiness there can be when there is no feelingsensation
He explained that the absence of feelingsensation itself is happiness
It is relevant to note here that the Buddha says that he does not speak of happiness only with reference to pleasant feelingssensations
Wherever there is happiness or pleasure that he recognizes as happiness or pleasure
Here we are reminded of the statement that all mental states converge on feelings
What is meant by this statement seems to be that all mental states are translated into sensations in the body
It is possible to understand the import of this statement if we pay attention to a gross emotion such as anger
When we are angry we experience a variety of bodily sensations feeling hot being restless breaking out in a sweat trepidation etc
When we are sad tears come into our eyes
These are brought about by changes in body chemistry through the discharge of various glandular secretions
If intense emotions bring about such gross sensations we might conjecture that all thoughts cause subtle sensations in the body resulting from changes in body chemistry
We are hardly aware of these sensations which however become noticeable with the development of vedanaanupassanaa contemplation of sensations
Thoughts are endless and continuous therefore if this interpretation that thoughts are translated into sensations is correct sensations too should be endless and continuous
The Vedanaasamyutta states that just as diverse winds constantly blow in different directions numerous sensations pass through the body
An arahant has full control over his thoughts therefore he must have full control over his feelingssensations too
What is meant by the statement that a monk lives desireless and at peace by the destruction of all feelingssensations seems to be that he has destroyed all psychogenic feelingssensations
This leads us to another statement that all feelingssensations partake of the nature of suffering
In order to understand the significance of this statement we must pay attention to our postures
If we have to remain seated for some time say for an hour we are not even aware of how many times we shift and adjust our limbs to more comfortable positions
This happens almost mechanically as all the time we unconsciously seek to avoid discomfort
This is because monotony of sensations even pleasant sensations brings about discomfort and a change brings about a temporary sensation of comfort
If there were no sensations produced from within perhaps we would not need to change positions so often and we would have a running sense of ease even if we continue to remain in the same position for a long time
Here it might be asked whether an arahant has lost the ability to feel pain which is also an essential part of the touch sensation
It has to be pointed out that this is not so for in that case an arahant would not even know if a part of his body is seriously injured or burnt
There is plenty of evidence to show that an arahant does feel sensations caused by physical changes
For instance the Buddha felt acute pain when he was wounded by a stone splinter and when he suffered from indigestion
But he was able to withstand the painful sensations with mindfulness and clear comprehension without being fatigued by them
Again an experience of Saariputta throws light on the subject
His experience refers to events which modern psychology designates as nonordinary reality of altered states of consciousness A yakkha a malevolent spirit once gave Saariputta a blow on the head
The blow it is said was so powerful that it was capable of splitting a mountain peak or making a seven and a half cubit high elephant go down on its knees
Moggallaana who saw the incident with his divine eye inquired from Saariputta how he was feeling
He replied that he was all right but there was slight pain in the head
This shows us that a blow which could have deprived an ordinary person of life had only minimal impact on an arahant
Perhaps because the psychological factors which predispose a person to the experience of sensations are perfectly well under control in an arahant he experiences only those sensations that are felt purely physically by an animate organism
It seems as if the body is under some sort of mentally regulated anesthesia which allows a narrow margin of sensation to protect the body from external danger
There are two kinds of pain physical and mental and arahants are said to experience only physical pain without the anxious mental agony when experiencing physical pain
It is also possible to look at this issue from another angle
Though the texts state that vedanaa is destroyed in the arahant they never say that the sense faculties are destroyed
When describing the superconscious state of sannaavedayitanirodha the sense faculties are said to be refined  vippasannaani indriyaani
So in the case of the arahant too the sense faculties must certainly be refined and not rendered deficient in any way
In that case it is possible to surmise that though vedanaa is extinct bodysensitivity continues to be active and is thoroughly refined
The Vedanaasamyutta differentiates between three types of joy and pleasure
An arahant experiences both physical and mental bliss as all tensions torments and fevers have been completely eliminated for good
Bhaddiya was a monk who often exclaimed What happiness what happiness
This expression of joy was misunderstood by his less developed fellow monks and they reported the matter to the Buddha suspecting that Bhaddiya was often reminiscing about his lay comforts
On being questioned by the Buddha Bhaddiya explained that he was a prince in his lay life and that he had armed guards stationed in all strategic points within and without his palace yet still he suffered from insomnia and insecurity fearing that rivals might usurp his position and even deprive him of his life
But now though living all alone in the open air he is completely free from fear and anxiety
Therefore to express his happiness he frequently exclaimed What happiness what happiness
So great was the experience of joy on the attainment of release from all mental intoxicants that sometimes arahants have stayed in that same position continuously without moving for seven days enjoying the bliss of emancipation
It is said that the whole body was permeated with this joy and bliss
Thus there are various passages in the Paali Canon which record the experience of bliss in the attainment of Nibbana
But it appears that this bliss is not confined to or dependent on the five aggregates which constitute the individual
For the Dvayataanupassanaa Sutta maintains that suffering ceases to arise with the cessation of the five aggregates
Further it is said in the Alagadduupama Sutta that the perfected being cannot be identified with any of the five personality factors even while he is still alive
Nibbana is a state of moral perfection
For one who has attained Nibbana all unwholesome motivational roots such as greed hatred and delusion have been fully eradicated with no possibility of their ever becoming active again
Therefore Nibbana is called the destruction of greed hatred and delusion
All inflowing moral depravities are destroyed hence the epithet aasavakkhaya for Nibbana
Craving has been uprooted for good therefore tanhakkhaya is another synonym
All types of conceit the superiority and the inferiority complex plus the complex of equality are eliminated
This necessarily has to be so as an arahant has no egoistic delusions such as I and mine
Just as much as an arahant has transcended egoism he has transcended sexuality too
When Somaa a female arahant was rebuked by Maara the Evil One saying that womankind with very little intelligence cannot attain that state which is to be attained with great effort by seers and sages Somaa replied that womanhood is no impediment for the realization of truth to one who is endowed with intelligence and concentration
Further she adds that Maara must address these words to one who thinks I am a man or I am a woman and not to one like herself
This reply seems to imply that one loses even sexual identity on the attainment of arahantship
There is evidence that an arahant has undergone such transformation in body chemistry that he has gone beyond the dichotomy of masculinity and femininity
All normal physiological sexual functions seem to be atrophied in an arahant as it is said that seminal emission is impossible for an arahant even in sleep
We may also note the tradition maintaining that arahants never dream maybe because they have attained such perfect mental health that there is no necessity to release tension through dreams
The sublime modes of conduct such as lovingkindness compassion sympathetic joy and equanimity are fully developed without any limitations
An arahant is such a perfect being that it is simply impossible for him to commit an immoral act
He is incapable of wilfully destroying the life of a living creature
It is impossible for him to stoop so low as to steal something to indulge in sex to utter a deliberate lie or to enjoy accumulated goods as in the household life
One may wonder why household life is an impossibility for an arahant
The reason may be that the household is recognized as a fortress of greed where we deposit all our belongings it is in other words the external repository of our ego
An arahant who has fully transcended the ego is incapable of partaking of such an institution
Several expressions are used in the Paali Canon to denote the cognitive aspect of the experience of Nibbana
The mass of darkness has been torn asunder is a frequent expression
In his First Sermon the Buddha describes the realization of the Four Noble Truths as the arising of the eye wisdom insight knowledge and light
The three knowledges have been attained is another expression
The triple knowledge consists of retrocognition clairvoyance and the knowledge of the destruction of defilements
With the first two knowledges one obtains personal verification of the doctrines of rebirth and kamma respectively
With the destruction of intoxicants one realizes the causal origination of all phenomena and egolessness
Sometimes three other cognitive faculties are mentioned as extra qualifications of arahants namely miraculous powers the divine ear and telepathy
With the attainment of Nibbana one also realizes that birth is destroyed the higher life has been successfully lived one's duty has been done and there is no more of this existence
The Uddesavibhanga Sutta explains the nature of consciousness and the general cognitive attitude of an arahant
The Mahaasalaayatanika Sutta explains more fully the cognitive experience of an arahant from the angle of sense experience
The arahant realistically understands the nature of sense faculties sense objects sense consciousness sense contact established by the convergence of these three factors and the resulting sensations of pleasure pain and hedonic neutrality
He does not get attached to any of these factors
When he lives without deriving pleasure and without getting attached to perceived sense objects and without being deluded by the process of sense perception recognizing the evil consequences of sense perception the five aggregates of grasping or the personality factors do not get built up
They fall apart as craving which leads to rebirth is totally eliminated
All physical and mental tensions torments and fevers are destroyed
The arahant experiences perfect physical and mental bliss
We are not quite sure exactly what is meant by the realistic understanding of the nature of sense faculties but we might suppose that an arahant intuitively understands through the framework of his own personality how the sense stimuli pass through sense receptors and nerve fibers and are interpreted at brain centers
Modern science explains to a certain extent the physiological processes involved in the activity of sense perception but this understanding is confined at best to the intellectual level and is dependent on technological devices in medical laboratories
Such knowledge cannot bring about the attitudinal and emotional changes which are necessary for liberation
An arahant's understanding springs from a deeper experiential level with direct vision into the whole perceptual process as explained for instance in the Madhupindika Sutta
What is meant by the realistic understanding of sense objects
Most likely it is the realization of the impermanent unsatisfactory and nonsubstantial nature of all that is around us
This too is a direct profound experience of acute sensitivity a direct personal vision into the dynamism of atomic and subatomic particles that go to form the material world around us as well as our bodies
The Dhammapada records that when a monk sees in his contemplations the dynamic working of the physical and mental phenomena composing his own personality great joy arises in him and that can only be described as superhuman joy
One has direct insight into the inner workings of one's body the arising and passing away of body cells sensations perceptions activities and consciousness
Great is the joy and delight of this realization and it is the realization of deathlessness
This is what is called the bliss of enlightenment
All bonds which tie us down to suffering are torn asunder thus Nibbana is called samyojanakkhaya
As the arahant has complete mastery over his thoughts no recurring unhealthy thoughts obsess him
Negative emotions restrict an individual's psychological freedom therefore greed hatred and ignorance are described as pamaanakarana ie
they circumscribe an individual's freedom
Greed hatred and ignorance are roots of unwholesome mental states which fetter the individual within samsaara
There is an interesting simile which illustrates the nature of a fetter
If there is a white bull and a black bull tied together by a rope the question is asked whether the white bull is a fetter to the black bull or the black bull is a fetter to the white bull
In fact neither is a fetter to the other the fetter is the rope by which they are tied together
Similarly the desire we have for external objects is the fetter that binds us
The arahant has cut this off and attained freedom
Unhealthy negative emotions are always selforiented and selfcentered
The Dhammapada says that the fool laments He abused me he beat me he defeated me he robbed me and generates anger
As he is firmly tied to the idea of the self or the ego and he cannot wean himself away from the experience which inflicted a wound on his ego he is like a dog tied to a post
This situation is quite in contrast to an experience the Buddha had once
A brahman came and abused him in very harsh language
The Buddha remained silent
When at last the brahman stopped the Buddha asked If you were to visit a friend and you took a gift to him but the friend declined to accept the gift what would you do The brahman replied that he would take it back
The Buddha said You brought me a gift of much abuse I do not accept you can take it back The Buddha also states that even if one is cut into pieces with a doublehandled saw one should train oneself not to generate anger towards the tormentor
Moggallaana was an arahant who was mercilessly beaten by robbers but he was able to maintain his composure without a trace of anger
Such is the freedom one gains from negative emotions on the attainment of Nibbana
An arahant has fully developed the brahmavihaaras the sublime modes of conduct  universal love compassion sympathetic joy and equanimity
These positive qualities are generated by transcending the self and are described as allembracing and immeasurable
Thus they do not limit the scope of psychological freedom as do the mental states rooted in greed hatred and ignorance
The freedom won by an arahant is called cetovimutti and pannaavimutti release of mind and release through wisdom
Knowledge also arises in the meditator that freedom has been gained
This is called the bliss of emancipation the highest bliss that any human being could enjoy
Creativity is another aspect under which the achievement of an arahant can be fruitfully discussed
The virtues of the arahant can be succinctly summarized as karunaa and pannaa compassion and wisdom
These are the two qualities through which the creativity of the arahant finds expression
When arahants look at humanity they are moved by great compassion as they fully realize the gravity of the precarious condition of the worldlings
Therefore they willingly plunge into a life of selfless activity preaching to the people trying to show them the path leading out of misery to eternal peace
It is especially noteworthy that the Buddha's role as teacher was so demanding that he barely slept two hours a day
The body of discourses he gave during the course of his long ministry of fortyfive years is as profound as it is extensive
It stands preeminent in world literary history for originality of ideas profundity of thought and clarity of expression
These observations hold good for the discourses delivered by the arahants as well
The entire Paali Canon can be considered as testimony to the creative genius of the liberated beings
It is but natural that creativity finds spontaneous expression when a person attains liberation as all negative emotions which hinder creativity and distort spontaneity are totally eliminated in the arahant
Some arahants are endowed with the special accomplishment of the fourfold analytical knowledge which qualifies them even more thoroughly for creative work
These are spelt out as analytical knowledge of the meaning or goal profound truth language or the medium of communication and originality of expression
These four special qualifications make arahants experts in communicating to their audience the exact meanings and goals of the profound truths they have discovered through the medium of refined language using their own original modes of expression such as eloquent similes metaphors etc
Several arahants both male and female are recorded as eloquent speakers and erudite exponents of the Dhamma
Special mention must be made of the Theragaathaa and Theriigaathaa which comprise poems of exquisite beauty
They are utterances of monks and nuns embodying their varied experiences
Literary critics rank them among the best lyrics in Indian literature
They remain unrivalled in the literary history of the world as creative writing issuing forth from the undefiled purity of the human heart and the nobility of human wisdom
They are everfresh fountains of inspiration to the truthseeker and lasting monuments to the creative genius of the liberated beings
Having considered this traditional material from the Paali Canon let us now turn to modern studies on psychophysiology and meditation to see whether we can draw some inferences from them on the experience of Nibbana
Studies done by investigators such as Walter B
Canon show beyond doubt that there is a definite correlation between physiology and strong emotions
When a sensory trunk is strongly excited the adrenal glands are reflexly stimulated and they pour into the blood stream an increased amount of adrenalin This gives rise to the overt manifestation of bodily changes such as dilation of the pupils sweating rapid respiration etc
There are other physiological changes such as those in heart beat blood pressure blood volume electrodermal responses etc
But they are not quite useful for us as they cannot be related to material found in the Paali Canon
The logical inference is that if strong negative emotions can give rise to certain physiological changes in the body changes which may be described as unhealthy the cultivation of positive emotions too should give rise to physiological changes which are quite different from those stimulated by negative emotions
As opposed to the dilation of the pupils and a consequent look of ferocity in the instance of a strong emotion such as anger we find in the Paali texts mention made of the monks' eyes as being very pleasant
The monks it is said look at one another with amiable eyes and they mix with one another as milk and water blend
This feature was conspicuous enough to draw the attention of the intelligent public for example King Pasenadi Kosala cited the pleasing expression in the eyes of the monks as one of the special characteristics which convinced him that they possess purity of heart and spiritual maturity
The complexion or facial expression of the monks is also mentioned as an impressive feature indicating the height of spirituality attained
The bright clear complexion or serene facial expression attracted the attention of many observers and inspired their confidence in the Dhamma
For instance Saariputta was impressed by the bright countenance and the serene appearance of the monk Assaji and that was the starting point of his conversion
King Asoka's conversion to Buddhism was prompted by the outward appearance of the novice Nigrodha
The spotlessly pure bright complexion of the Buddha was counted as one of the thirtytwo marks of a great man and these marks are considered the outward manifestations of profound spiritual maturity
As sweating is one of the physiological manifestations of emotional excitement there is an interesting incident from the life of the Buddha relevant for our present study
Once Saccaka a redoubtable debater came for a debate with the Buddha
He boasted that he would harass the Buddha in debate as a strong man would shake a goat to and fro while holding it by its long beard
Arrogantly he bragged that he could see no man who would not break out in a sweat when challenged by him in debate
But when the debate with the Buddha was actually held before a large audience it was Saccaka who sweated profusely in defeat
The Buddha bared his chest and showed that he did not sweat at all
This episode may be taken as evidence that an arahant does not perspire due to emotional excitement
Rapid respiration is another physiological accompaniment of negative emotions
Changes in breathing rhythm or amplitude are considered excellent indicators of deception
It is a commonplace experience that respiration remains calm and placid when we are quiet and resting
It becomes even calmer in meditation
The Paali Canon maintains that respiration ceases altogether during the fourth jhaana which is a subtle highly refined state of superconsciousness
It is possible that metabolism comes to a standstill or a minimum level during this state
Though arahants do not always abide in this jhaana they must constantly maintain a calm regular rhythm in their respiration for they never become emotionally disturbed or excited
Their calm is so profound that it is said that they also maintain an inner silence even when they speak as the subvocal chatter which is characteristic of others has been quelled altogether in their case
Modern scientific studies on the physiology of meditation shed light on some other aspects relevant to the present study
It has been found that the concentration of bloodlactate level declines precipitously in meditation
Its concentration normally falls in a subject at rest but the rate of decline during meditation has proved to be more than three times faster than the normal rate
This offers a good contrast to the rise of bloodlactate levels when patients with anxiety neurosis are placed under stress
It is also reported from experiments that the infusion of lactate brings about attacks of anxiety in such patients
Furthermore it is significant that patients with hypertension show higher bloodlactate levels in a resting state than patients without hypertension whereas in contrast the low lactate level in meditators is associated with low blood pressure
Thus it is clear that the fall in the bloodlactate level has a beneficial psychophysiological effect
All this medical evidence goes to show that a calm healthy mind finds expression in a positively transformed body chemistry
Therefore it is reasonable to maintain that one who has reached the culmination of meditative practice and realized Nibbana is healthy in both mind and body
The body has certain electrical properties that are clearly associated with psychological processes such as attention and emotion
One of these is shown in the rapid rise in the electrical resistance of the skin accompanying meditation
Wallace and Benson report that fifteen subjects tested showed a rise of about ohms in minutes
In sleep skin resistance normally rises but not so much or at such a rate
The same test is used in lie detection and most laboratory studies have found that the skin resistance response is the best indicator of deception
This evidence shows beyond doubt that involuntary physiological changes accompany emotional states both positive and negative
Again it is said that the brain is constantly emitting small electrical potentials measured in cycles per second called Hertz
These waves of varying frequencies and shapes are labelled with Greek letters such as delta waves theta waves alpha waves and beta waves
Electroencephalographic recordings of subjects in meditation have disclosed a marked intensification of alpha waves
Wallace and Benson report that they recorded the waves from seven main areas of the brain on magnetic tape and analyzed the patterns with a computer
They say that typically there was an increase in intensity of slow alpha waves at eight or nine cycles per second in the frontal and central regions of the brain during meditation
In several subjects this change was also accompanied by prominent theta waves in the frontal areas
On the other hand emotional disturbance such as anger is always accompanied by alpha blocking whereas sleep the antithesis of emotion is characterized by slow highamplitude activity
Light and sound stimuli also block the alpha rhythm
It is reduced or suppressed during periods of apprehension
Alpha waves are absent in records of patients in an anxiety state
On the strength of these findings it is possible to conjecture that the harmony of the mind determines to a very large extent the health of the body
When related to the experience of Nibbana it seems reasonable to conjecture that an arahant has put an end to all psychosomatic diseases
His body would be susceptible only to physical ailments and injury caused by external agents
There are reports in the Paali Canon of arahants falling ill and experiencing acute pain
It is also noteworthy that they are said to have recovered by meditating on the Dhamma
On the strength of the evidence furnished so far one is inclined to regard their illnesses as being caused by physiological factors
There is also an incident of a monk who is not an arahant dying of snakebite
The Buddha says that if the monk had practiced mettaa fully he would not have met with such an unfortunate death
It may be that the snake would not have bitten him in the first place had mettaa been fully cultivated
On the other hand there is another commentarial episode where a nonarahant monk was bitten by a poisonous snake while he was listening to the Dhamma
The poison started spreading in the body and the pain became acute
The monk then reflected on the immaculate purity of his virtues from the time he received higher ordination
It is said that as a result of this reflection great joy arose in his mind suffusing his entire body
The joy acted as an antivenom and he was cured
Meditation is described in psychophysiological terminology as a wakeful hypometabolic state characterized by reductions in oxygen consumption carbon dioxide elimination and the rate and volume of respiration a slight increase in the acidity of arterial blood a marked decrease in the bloodlactate level a slowing of the heart beat a considerable increase in skin resistance and an electroencephalogram pattern of intensification of slow alpha waves with occasional thetawave activity It may be surmised that the metabolism during normal waking hours is probably maintained at the lowest possible healthy level in the case of the arahant as his body is not subject to undue wear and tear brought about by emotional excitement
The positive refined sublime emotions or the divine modes of conduct such as mettaa karunaa muditaa and upekkhaa not to speak of the higher cognitive states must necessarily find expression in body chemistry to produce a healthy constitution and a calm unruffled serene personality filled with peace contentment and the joy of enlightenment
We are reminded here of a statement the Buddha once made
He said that even if there is a portion as small as a pinch of dust that defies change in the psychophysical personality of the human being leading the higher life would be useless
What is meant is that there is no such permanent part and the higher life can successfully bring about a total transformation of the individual in both mind and body
Modern scientific studies on the physiology of meditation prove that basic biochemical and bioelectrical changes do take place in the body as a result of mental culture
It is therefore possible to surmise that mental culture culminates in a total psychophysical transformation
Studies done on the biofeedback technique suggest that a radical transformation of the nervous system must take place with the development of higher mental potentialities
It is common knowledge that the autonomous nervous system is divided into two parts the sympathetic nervous system and the parasympathetic nervous system
Johann Stoyva in an article on biofeedback techniques states that probably in deep relaxation there is a shift in the autonomous nervous system towards parasympathetic dominance
Parasympathetic functioning is associated with subtler emotions  wonder religious and aesthetic experiences contemplation  emotions characterized by a broader range of awareness
On the other hand sympathetic predominance is linked to emotions in which the range of awareness is restricted  anger and fear for example
On the strength of this evidence it may be conjectured that parasympathetic functioning develops to greater efficiency with spiritual advancement
Very little is known about the functions of the pineal gland which Ren Descartes regarded as the chosen residence of the human soul
It is described as the builtin biological clock of the human being on which depends the regularity of sleeping and waking
This gland synthesizes a hormone called melatonin which affects behavior sleep brain activity and sexual activity such as puberty ovulation and sexual maturation
While melatonin stimulates brain activity it inhibits sexual activity
Again it has been recognized that lightdark olfaction cold stress and other neural inputs affect the pineal function
Exposure to light reduces the synthesis of melatonin and depresses pineal weight
On the other hand light accelerates sexual maturation and activity
In the context of Buddhist thought the function of the pineal gland seems to be the biological basis of sense control
Buddhism maintains that unrestrained sense stimulation disturbs mental activity
If the sense doors are well guarded ie
if visual auditory olfactory gustatory and tactile inputs are controlled a corresponding degree of happiness and concentrated mental activity become possible
Cittass'ekaggataa the ability to fix the mind on one point is greatly determined by the control of the sense faculties
In terms of physiology it seems that such sense control helps the synthesis of melatonin in the pineal gland which stimulates brain activity and retards sexual activity
Thus in terms of pineal function brain activity and sexual activity seem to be antithetical
Buddhism too emphasizes that sexual desire prevents clear thinking distorts vision clouds issues inhibits wisdom and destroys peace of mind
The entire scheme of spiritual development comprising the Noble Eightfold Path is an efficient methodical plan of action designed to bring a gradual psychophysical transformation culminating in the attainment of Nibbana
Cultivation of moral habits is the frame for wholesome behavior by means of which healthy body chemistry gets gradually established
Neural circuits related to harmonious physical and vocal activity are strengthened and those related to violence become proportionately weak
The second phase in the development of the Noble Eightfold Path comprises meditation
A steady rapid psychophysical development takes place during this phase
It is our conjecture that the adrenalin secretion which accompanied negative emotions of rage and fear is reduced to a healthy workable level
Perhaps adrenalin is secreted in small quantities into the blood stream to maintain an unflagging enthusiasm to continue in the difficult practice of meditation with undaunted courage and perseverance
Or it may be as the endocrine glands stimulate or inhibit one another a balanced combination of these glandular secretions affects the cognitive and emotional behavior of the meditator
When sublime modes of conduct such as mettaa karunaa muditaa and upekkhaa are practiced over and over again they must become ingrained in the nervous system perhaps increasing parasympathetic dominance
With the practice of vipassanaa or insightmeditation the pineal gland seems to develop its full bodily potential for unlocking all possible spiritual knowledges in the meditator's mind and when the process is complete Nibbana is attained
This interpretation finds further support in the Buddhist conception of the reciprocal relationship between vinnaana and naamaruupa
This relationship is illustrated in the Canon with the simile of two bundles of reeds placed together supporting each other
A change of position in one is bound to make a corresponding change in the other
Thus psychological development affects physiological function apparently through the activity of the nervous system and the endocrine glands
Healthy physiological changes reinforce healthy psychological activity
Thus the process of mutual psychophysical interaction works for the happiness or misery of the individual depending on the moral quality of the actions performed through body speech and mind
As the mind is involved in all activity it is the mind that is responsible for the quality of body chemistry and neural function
When the mind ultimately attains to a state of absolute purity beyond corruptibility body chemistry and neural function undergo a radical transformation which will not be reversed again
It can be conjectured that when the pineal gland and its auxiliaries develop to the fullest possible capacity the hitherto inactive brain regions unlock their secrets and reveal them when attention is directed accordingly
Thus memory becomes so efficient as to revive prenatal knowledge running into numerous previous existences
Similarly the divine eye or clairvoyance is clarified disclosing the kammic antecedents of human experience
When one gains direct vision and knowledge of the bodily and mental processes involved in the human personality one attains supreme enlightenment
The state of Nibbana after the death of the arahant is nowhere discussed in the Paali Canon
The four alternatives put forward regarding this state namely Does the Perfect One exist after death does he not does he and does he not does he neither exist nor not exist after death are all left aside unanswered
These questions are put aside because they are not useful to human happiness and understanding not concerned with the Dhamma not helpful for the higher life not conducive to disenchantment and detachment not conducive to cessation of misery to tranquillity of the mind to higher knowledge to insight and to peace
The Aggivacchagotta Sutta cites a simile in this connection which illustrates that the questions themselves are meaningless
If there is a fire burning and if the fire goes out without fuel can one ask the question In which direction did the fire go east south west or north The question itself is inappropriate as it assumes that fire can have existence independent of fuel
The nun Khemaa points out that the state of the Tathaagata after death is immeasurable
Just as it is impossible to calculate the drops of water in the ocean and the grains of sand in the earth so is it impossible to conceptualize the state of Nibbana after the demise of the arahant
The Anuraadha Sutta states that the five aggregates of grasping or the personality factors are impermanent unsatisfactory and nonself
Therefore the noble disciple is detached from them
He wins freedom and after death becomes completely untraceable
The Alagadduupama Sutta maintains that the Tathaagata cannot be identified with the personality factors even during his lifetime so how can he be identified after death
A plausible explanation is necessary for the traditional silence regarding the state of the arahant after death
Existence in the world implies time and space
One exists within a particular period in a particular space or locality
If one passes beyond time and beyond space it is not possible to speak of existence with reference to such a one
To speak of both time and space one needs a point of reference eg
A is years old
This means years have passed since the event of A's birth
If A is not born it is impossible to speak of time or existence with reference to him
Similarly with space
Without points of reference it is not possible to grasp space
There is a definite distance between any two specific points
Nor can one speak of direction without a point of reference
When the notion of I which is the point of personal reference is eradicated one goes beyond time beyond space and beyond causality
Therefore it is not possible to speak of the liberated being as existing or not existing
Here we are reminded of a statement made by Fritjof Capra in his Tao of Physics relevant to our present context
He states Physicists can 'experience' the four dimensional spacetime world through the abstract mathematical formalism of their theories but their visual imagination like everybody else's is limited to the threedimensional world of the senses
Our language and thought patterns have evolved in this threedimensional world and therefore we find it extremely hard to deal with the fourdimensional reality of relativistic physics Thus when the fourdimensional reality too eludes the perceptual experience of the average man how can Nibbana which transcends all these four dimensions come within mere verbal experience
Therefore it is impossible to speak of the arahant's state in terms of existence or nonexistence
At this point an observation can be made from another point of view
Buddhism describes the characteristics of all things in three statements Sabbe sankhaaraa aniccaa sabbe sankhaaraa dukkhaa sabbe dhammaa anattaa meaning all conditioned things are impermanent all conditioned things are unsatisfactory all phenomena are nonself
Here the change of terminology in the last statement seems important
The Samyutta Commentary explains the last statement as Sabbe dhammaa anattaa ti sabbe catubhuumakaa dhammaa
The Visuddhimagga explains the four bhuumis or planes as kaamaavacara ruupaavacara aruupaavacara and lokuttara meaning the sensual sphere the finematerial sphere the immaterial sphere and the supramundane
Therefore dhammaa in our statement can be interpreted as including the supramundane state of Nibbana as well
Commenting on this statement Ven
Narada Thera observes Dhammaa can be applied to both conditioned and unconditioned things and states
It embraces both conditioned and unconditioned things including Nibbana
In order to show that even Nibbana is free from a permanent soul the Buddha used the term dhammaa in the third verse
Nibbana is a positive supramundane state and is without a soul It is significant that dhammaa was not used in the first two statements
The purpose seems to be to exclude Nibbana which is permanent and blissful
Therefore we can surmise a condition that is permanent and blissful but it is not a self
That state is Nibbana
It has to be a dimension completely different from all that is worldly
The permanence that is conjectured here has no reference to time and space and the bliss that is spoken of has no reference to feelings vedanaa
Further there is a great difference between the death of an ordinary worldling and that of an arahant
To indicate this a different terminology is used maranamiyyati is used for the death of a worldling while parinibbaanaparinibbaayati is used in the case of an arahant
In fact the Dhammapada specifically states that the vigilant ones meaning arahants never die
Let us first see what happens when a worldling dies
It is an accepted fact that everybody fears death
We also fear the unknown therefore death is doubly fearful because we know least about it
It seems reasonable to assume that at the root of all fear there lurks the fear of death
In other words we fear everything which directly or indirectly threatens our life
So long as our bodies are strong enough we can either fight or run away from the source of fear with the intention of preserving life
But when ultimately we are on the deathbed face to face with death and our body is no longer strong enough to flee from death it is highly unlikely that we will mentally accept death with resignation
We will struggle hard long for and crave for life and reach out and grasp a viable base somewhere as the dying body can no longer sustain life
Once such a viable base for instance a fertilized ovum in a mother's womb has been grasped the process of becoming or growth starts there which in due course gives rise to birth
This is what is referred to in the twelvelinked paticcasamuppaada as craving conditions grasping grasping conditions becoming becoming conditions birth Thus a worldling dies and is reborn
Now let us consider the last moments of an arahant
As an arahant has no fear whatsoever from any source he would not be agitated as he has no craving for life
He will watch the process of death with perfect equanimity and crystalclear mindfulness
Further the Mahaaparinibbaana Sutta which explains the final moments of the Buddha states that the Buddha passed away immediately after rising from the fourth jhaana
The fourth jhaana is characterized by purity of equanimity and mindfulness
It is not known whether all arahants attain parinibbaana after the fourth jhaana but certainly they cannot have a deluded death
As they do not grasp another birth the state they attain after final passing away has to be described as unborn
Similarly it is uncaused
As it is no ordinary death it is called the deathless state
It is beyond elemental existence beyond brahmalokas neither in this world nor the next beyond the radiance of the sun and moon
It is beyond what we know of in the three worlds of kaama ruupa and aruupa
Therefore as it is beyond the ken of ordinary human understanding any attempt to define the state is bound to end in failure
The course of liberated ones cannot be traced like that of birds in the air
In the Gopakamoggallaana Sutta a brahman asks the Venerable AAnanda whether there is a single monk who is completely endowed with all the qualities with which the Buddha is endowed
AAnanda replies that there is not a single monk who is so endowed
In this paper an attempt is made to compare the attainments of the Buddha with those of the arahant with a view to ascertain wherein the two differ
Both the Buddha and the arahants are recognized as equal as far as the attainment of the final goal of Nibbana is concerned
The principal difference is that the Buddha is the pioneer the discoverer of the undiscovered path while the arahants are followers who tread the path mapped out by the pioneering Buddha
The Cuulagopaalaka Sutta uses a slightly different allegory it compares the Buddha to a clever cowherd who gets his herd to cross a deep river from a safe ford
Later Buddhist texts elucidate the pioneership of the Buddha with lucid descriptions of how he spent incalculable periods of time practising and perfecting the virtues called paaramitaa which gave him the intellectual and emotional maturity to discover the long forgotten path to Nibbana
But it is specifically stated that the Buddha did not preach all that he understood during the process of preparation
What he preached is compared to a handful of leaves whereas what he understood but refrained from teaching is like the leaves in the forest
The Buddha also maintains that he preached the Dhamma in its entirety without any reservations
What is meant by these superficially contradictory statements seems to be that the Buddha taught everything useful and relevant for emancipation but kept strictly aside everything that was useless and irrelevant for that purpose
This position is reiterated in the Canon in a number of suttas
The Buddha clearly defined the scope of his teaching and strictly confined himself to the problem of suffering and its elimination
The Buddha's standpoint can be illustrated with the help of a simile
He was like a lonely man who was lost in the fearful wilderness of samsaara and earnestly sought a way out
As he had to spend a long time in this vast terrible forest he had to learn a great deal about the forest itself
To survive he had to learn about edible and poisonous plants and fruits he had to learn the habits and habitats of wild animals he had to climb trees in order to discover in which direction there were signs of a human settlement etc
But at long last when he did discover a straight path leading out of the wilderness he thought quite rightly that it was a waste of time to teach about the ways of the forest to others who are also lost in the wilderness
It is most useful and urgent if he devoted his time and energy to point out the path to other suffering beings
This is exactly the function of a Buddha
Therefore he refrained from teaching what was irrelevant to emancipation
This clearly shows that the Buddha is far superior to other arahants regarding knowledge about matters not directly related to Nibbana
Among arahants too there are differences in attainment
In one place the Buddha states that in a group of monks sixty are arahants with the six higher knowledges sixty are arahants with the three clear knowledges another sixty are arahants liberated from both parts while the rest are arahants liberated by wisdom
The highest qualifications among arahants are the six higher knowledges and the four analytical knowledges
The former comprise psychic powers the divine ear thought reading retrocognition clairvoyance and the knowledge of the destruction of defilements
The four analytical knowledges comprise insight into the meaning of words truth use of language and originality of ideas
They seem to pivot round the ability to teach the Dhamma through the medium of verbal communication with appealing and meaningful ways of presentation
Arahants of lesser attainments have only three higher knowledges retrocognition clairvoyance and the knowledge of the destruction of defilements
Still other arahants attain emancipation from both parts
They have gained emancipation from the body by the physical experience and complete mastery of eight deliverances or supernormal states of consciousness and emancipation from the mind through the destruction of defilements
Arahants who are released through wisdom have only the knowledge of the destruction of defilements
As a common denominator all arahants have pannaavimutti also called akuppaa cetovimutti imperturbable mental freedom
While the highest qualities attainable by an arahant are certainly found in the Buddha the Suttas assign additional qualifications to the Buddha which are not shared by other arahants
The Mahaasiihanaada Sutta describes ten special powers of the Buddha called tathaagatabala
They are tabulated below and will be taken up for discussion in comparison with the attainments of arahants
Endowed with these ten powers the Buddha claims a position of supreme eminence
He is fearless in facing any audience or critic the text metaphorically states that he roars like a lion in assemblies
He exercises supreme authority among human beings
The ten powers are as follows
He knows realistically a possibility as a possibility and an impossibility as an impossibility
He knows realistically the causally connected results of all actions whether they belong to the past present or future
He knows realistically the course of action leading to all states of existence
He knows realistically all worlds composed of various and diverse elements
He knows realistically the various spiritual propensities or dispositions of human beings
He knows realistically the maturity levels of the spiritual faculties of various human beings
He knows realistically the attainment of superconscious meditational levels such as jhaana vimokkha samaadhi and samaapatti together with the defilements and purities associated with them and the means of rising from these states
He has retrocognitive powers extending up to several aeons with ability to recall details regarding past existences
He has clairvoyant powers with the ability to see beings dying and being reborn in high or low states according to their own kamma
He has attained knowledge of the complete destruction of all defilements in this very life
These will be taken up for discussion in comparison with the attainments of arahants in reverse order as it seems to be clearer and more convenient to do so
 The Buddha shares the last of the tathaagatabalas with all other arahants and there seems to be no difference between the Buddha and the arahants in regard to emancipation
and Arahants with the triple and sixfold higher knowledge share with the Buddha the retrocognitive and clairvoyant abilities
But there seems to be a difference in proficiency and extent of vision the Buddha seems to have unlimited retrocognitive and clairvoyant abilities as he says that he can see as far as he wishes to see
 The Buddha shares his mastery over superconscious meditational levels with the ubhatobhaagavimutta arahant who can attain the eight deliverances in progressive order regressive order and in both progressive and regressive orders he can attain whatever he wishes whenever he wishes for any length of time he wishes and can also rise from them at will
and These are special aspects of thoughtreading
Though arahants with chalabhinnaa are said to have the ability of thoughtreading nowhere is it stated in the Paali Canon that arahants can discern the spiritual propensities and maturity levels of the spiritual faculties of other individuals
This seems to be a special province of the Buddha alone
Much evidence could be gathered from the Paali Canon in support of this special ability of the Buddha
Seeing the spiritual maturity of Angulimaala Suniita and AAlavaka the Buddha approached them on his own initiative
He preached to them and they gained lasting spiritual distinction
There is not a single instance of an arahant approaching a prospective saint with prior knowledge of his spiritual potentialities
According to the Udaana the Buddha saw the spiritual potential of a poor leper named Suppabuddha and preached a sermon which was particularly appealing to him
At the end of the discourse he became a sotaapanna a streamenterer
According to the Cuularaahulovaada Sutta the Buddha saw that Raahula was mature and ready for further instruction
He preached to Raahula about the nature of sense faculties sense data and their interaction
At the end of this discourse it is reported that Raahula attained arahantship
Countless other examples could be cited
 and These seem to be specialities connected with clairvoyance
They show that the Buddha possesses a world view far superior to that of the arahants
With clairvoyance arahants realize only one aspect the truth of kamma which is so helpful for the understanding of man's samsaaric condition
The Buddha's clairvoyance encompasses knowledge regarding the external world as well
Therefore he knows realistically the worlds with various and diverse elements
Perhaps this means that he has understood the universe comprising gross physical realms such as the human world finematerial realms such as the Brahmaworlds and nonmaterial realms such as the aruupa world
He also knows the type of action which leads to rebirth in these various worlds and he has understood the perennial laws pertaining to these worlds
His clairvoyant vision reaches so far back that he has recorded in the Mahaapadaana Sutta details regarding the lives of six previous Buddhas much to the admiration of his followers
In fact as mentioned earlier in this essay the Buddha's clairvoyant powers seem limitless
 This special power of knowing a possibility as a possibility and an impossibility as an impossibility is never mentioned as a knowledge of the arahant
The Buddha may have left the undetermined problems unanswered because he was utterly convinced by this special form of insight that it is not only useless but impossible for unenlightened beings to know the solutions to those problems
Besides the ten tathaagatabalas the Mahaasiihanaada Sutta enumerates four confidences enjoyed by the Buddha alone
He has the absolute confidence that no human or superhuman being can reasonably accuse him of not being fully enlightened of not being free of all mental defilements of wrongly declaring as dangers things that are not really dangerous of preaching a doctrine which does not lead to the goal it professes to lead to
Endowed with this absolute confidence the Buddha claims supreme eminence and authority among gods and men that no arahant could ever claim
The Anguttara Nikaaya enumerates ten powers of the arahant and they all seem to pivot round the practice and realization of the Dhamma
An arahant sees all component things as impermanent
He sees all sense pleasures as a pit of burning embers
His mind is inclined towards seclusion and renunciation
He has developed the four stations of mindfulness
He has developed the fourfold right exertion
He has developed the four bases of psychic powers
He has developed the five spiritual faculties
He has developed the five spiritual powers
He has developed the seven factors of enlightenment
He has developed the Noble Eightfold Path
Endowed with these powers a monk can claim to have destroyed all mental defilements
When compared with the powers and confidences of the Buddha these center round the theme of one's own individual emancipation
The Buddha on the other hand wields far greater powers which can even be called universal with insight into the spiritual potential of other individuals and a world view far superior to that of arahants
It is appropriate to compare the epithets which normally describe an arahant with those applied to the Buddha
Suttas describe an arahant as khiinaasavo one whose mental defilements are destroyed vusitavaa one who has successfully lived the higher life katakaraniiyo one whose duty is done ohitabhaaro one who has laid the burden aside anuppattasadattho one who has attained the noble goal parikkhiinabhavasamyojano one who has destroyed all bonds leading to further existences and sammadannaavimutto one who has attained emancipation with right knowledge All these epithets describe aspects of the personal emancipation of the arahant
Though all these epithets can rightly be applied to the Buddha they are hardly used with reference to him as it is not just his personal emancipation that makes him unique
The Buddha's fame spread in terms of nine other epithets
He is called araham as he is the worthy one who does no evil even in secret sammaasambuddho because he is fully enlightened and selfenlightened vijjaacaranasampanno because he is endowed with knowledge and conduct sugato because he successfully reached the goal as a pioneer lokaviduu because he has understood the universe with its world systems purisadammasaarathii because he is the champion tamer of human beings satthaa devamanussaanam because he is the teacher of gods and men buddho because he has awakened to reality bhagavaa because he is the fortunate one the Blessed One the lord
Though a few of these epithets could be attributed to the arahant as well this group of nine epithets collectively expresses the praiseworthy qualities of the Buddha alone
In their totality they can never be applied to an arahant
To emphasize his superiority the Buddha himself declares that even those monks who are liberated in mind and who have achieved unsurpassed vision unsurpassed practice and unsurpassed liberation still honor respect esteem and worship the Buddha
The reason is The Blessed One is enlightened and teaches the Dhamma for enlightenment he is tamed and teaches the Dhamma for taming he is at peace and teaches the Dhamma for peace he has attained Nibbana and teaches the Dhamma for attaining Nibbana
The Buddha has sometimes referred to himself as sabbaabhibhuu because he has conquered everything all passions
Though the Buddha acknowledges himself to be sabbaviduu allknowing he has rejected the epithet sabbannuu which also has the same meaning
At the time of the Buddha sabbannuu had a special connotation as Nigantha Naataputta the founder of Jainism also claimed to be sabbannuu
Naataputta claimed to have everpresent continuous knowledge of everything all the time whether he was awake or asleep
The Buddha disclaims such everpresent continuous knowledge of everything
In fact he maintains that no one can ever have knowledge of everything at one and the same time
It is an impossibility
It is possible to interpret the allknowing aspect of the Buddha's knowledge in terms of the definition of sabba all everything as given in the Sabba Sutta
According to this definition everything means the five sense faculties and their corresponding objects plus the mind and the corresponding mental phenomena
In this sutta the Buddha challenges anybody to give a more comprehensive definition of everything The Buddha's ability to know something was such that he had to direct his attention to the desired object in order to know it as it really is
The Buddha clearly says that he can recollect as far back as he wishes through his retrocognitive knowledge and his clairvoyant abilities are similarly wishbound
He does not have a mirrorlike knowledge or vision where everything is automatically reflected
Here we are reminded of the incident when the Buddha decided to preach the Dhamma
He thought of AAlaara Kaalaama first to preach the Dhamma to but he did not know that AAlaara had died a week ago
Then he thought of Uddaka Raamaputta only to realize that he too had passed away the previous night
These episodes clearly show that the Buddha had to direct his attention if he wished to know something
These episodes bring us to the interesting question whether it is possible for others to read the mind of the Buddha
When the Buddha was disinclined to preach the doctrine Sahampati the great Brahmaa immediately knew this and he came and requested the Buddha to preach
According to the Brahmasamyutta when the Buddha decided to honor the Dhamma as his teacher because he saw none capable of being his teacher in the whole world of gods and men Brahmaa Sahampati appeared once again and informed him that this was the custom of previous Buddhas too and Buddhas in the future also will do the same
When the Buddha thought of choosing AAlaara Kaalaama and Uddaka Raamaputta to be his first disciples gods informed him of their death
The Khandhasamyutta records another incident when Mahaabrahmaa read the thoughts of the Buddha and appeared before him to plead on behalf of some errant monks
According to the Mahaaparinibbaana Sutta when the Buddha was going through the jhaanic process in ascending and descending orders just before attaining parinibbaana Anuruddha knew the jhaanic process he was going through
All these episodes point to the fact that at least certain aspects of the Buddha's mind were accessible to other arahants with thoughtreading ability and certain superhuman beings
Another episode recorded in the Mahaaparinibbaana Sutta shows that all aspects of the Buddha's mind are not known even to the most eminent arahants
Saariputta once told the Buddha that he was convinced that there has never been there will never be and there is not at present any other recluse or brahman who is more distinguished in enlightenment than the Buddha
The Buddha then asked Saariputta whether he had read the minds of all past present and future Buddhas and known their virtue to be such and such their concentration to be such and such their wisdom to be such and such their mode of living to be such and such and their emancipation to be such and such
Saariputta replied that he has no such knowledge and that he was only making a reasonable inference
All this evidence clearly points to the fact that there is no human or superhuman being not even an arahant who can fully read the mind of the Buddha but of course the Buddha has the ability to read the minds of all others including arahants
The Paali Canon mentions five types of vision that the Buddha has
The first is mamsacakkhu the normal human vision consisting of the physical faculty of sight
According to the Lakkhana Sutta the Buddha possesses a perfect pair of deep blue eyes with long eye lashes because as a human being fulfilling the perfections requisite for Buddhahood he looked at others with pleasant kind eyes honest and uncritical eyes
The second type of vision is dibbacakkhu the divine vision or clairvoyance the most important function of which is the ability to see the passing away and rebirth of beings according to their respective kamma
The third is pannaacakkhu the vision of insight which enabled the Buddha to see things as they really are the impermanent unsatisfactory and nonsubstantial nature of everything
The fourth is buddhacakkhu the Buddha vision when the Buddha surveyed the world with this vision he saw people with a lesser and a greater degree of defilements people with refined and dull spiritual faculties
The fifth is samantacakkhu which we venture to translate as panvision
It is possible to infer that this vision refers to the ability to see a problem or an issue in its entirety as samanta means entire or allround
Moreover Mahaabrahmaa addresses the Buddha as samantacakkhu when he entreats him in allegorical terms to ascend to the top of the Dhamma mansion and behold the suffering mass of humanity
The last two visions are never attributed to arahants and remain the sole province of the Buddha
The Paali Canon contains interesting material to draw a distinction between the enlightenment experience of the Buddha and that of the arahant
The Chabbisodhana Sutta enumerates several criteria of arahantship which give a clear idea of what the Buddha expected of his disciples who have reached the ultimate goal of realization
These criteria comprise the unshakeable freedom of the mind from the influence of the senses from hankering after the constituents of personality from craving for elements constituting the world from the yearning for the internal and external sense spheres and from the bias of the notion of I and mine One of the most comprehensive accounts of the enlightenment experience of an arahant is given in the Mahaa Assapura Sutta
According to this the adept who has attained to the fourth jhaana gains first retrocognition and then clairvoyance
Then he directs his mind to the knowledge of the destruction of defilements
In this process he gains firsthand knowledge of suffering its cause its elimination and the path leading to its elimination
He understands what mental defilements are their origin cessation and the path leading to their cessation
When knowing thus the mind is freed from the defilements of sense pleasures desire for continued existence and ignorance
In him who is released thus there arises the knowledge of freedom birth is destroyed the higher life has been successfully lived one's duty has been done there is no more of this continued existence
Just as a man standing beside a pool of clear unsullied water would see the shells pebbles and fish in the water the adept would see clearly and directly suffering its cause its cessation and the path leading to its cessation
This could very well be a description of the Buddha's enlightenment experience too
But scattered in the Paali Canon there are various biographical descriptions of his enlightenment which suggest that the above was only one of its aspects
It appears that the Buddha's enlightenment was a full multifaceted rich experience that could be explained from various angles
In the Mahaasaccaka Sutta the Buddha relates that he realized retrocognition during the first watch of the night clairvoyance during the second watch and the knowledge of the destruction of defilements during the third watch
Therefore it is clear that enlightenment is not a sudden flash but a gradual unfolding of human potentialities when conditions for it are ripe
It can be compared to the gradual unfolding of petals in the blossoming of a flower
In the Khandhasamyutta the Buddha says So long as I did not understand the satisfaction the evil consequences and the escape from the five aggregates of grasping so long I did not claim supreme enlightenment The Mahaapadaana Sutta states that the mind attained emancipation from defilements when contemplating the rise and fall of the five aggregates of grasping
Thus knowledge and vision into the five aggregates is another aspect of the enlightenment experience
According to the Vedanaasamyutta the Buddha did not claim enlightenment until he gained full vision into all aspects of feelings what is feeling what is its origin its cessation the path leading to its cessation its satisfaction its evil consequences and escape therefrom
As all beings are bound to samsaara because of their attachment to pleasures and pleasures are but pleasurable sensations it is only too logical that one has to have a thorough knowledge of all sensations if one wants to make an end of samsaara
Therefore the Buddha's enlightenment experience comprised a thoroughgoing realization of all aspects of feeling too
The Salaayatanasamyutta records another aspect
According to this the Buddha did not claim enlightenment in the world of gods and men so long as he did not realistically understand the six sense faculties and their respective objects according to the satisfaction they yield the evil consequences they entail and the escape therefrom
As we are attached to pleasures through the instrumentality of our sense organs in order to gain release we have to understand the nature of the sense faculties sense objects and their interrelationship
In the Nidaanasamyutta the Buddha says that vision and knowledge arose in him regarding matters not heard of before as he contemplated the paticcasamuppaada paying attention to the causal process giving rise to suffering and the causal process bringing about the cessation of suffering
The Anguttara Nikaaya explains the gradual deepening of dibbacakkhu clairvoyance as an aspect of the enlightenment experience
There are eight stages in this process of gradual development extending from preenlightenment days up to the enlightenment
The Buddha says that so long as he did not understand these eight stages he did not claim enlightenment in the world of gods and men
The most important and the most famous account of the enlightenment experience of the Buddha is recorded in the Vinaya Mahaavagga and this comprises the full comprehension of the Four Noble Truths
As this statement is of great significance it is recorded below in detail
The Buddha says that
Wisdom and knowledge arose in him regarding truths never heard of before and he was able to isolate the problem of the noble truth of suffering he understood that the truth of suffering must be fully comprehended and that the truth of suffering has been fully comprehended
Wisdom and knowledge arose in him regarding the cause of suffering he understood that this cause of suffering must be eliminated and that this cause of suffering has been eliminated
Wisdom and knowledge arose in him that the cessation of suffering is a possibility he understood that the cessation of suffering must be realized and that the cessation of suffering has been realized
Wisdom and knowledge arose in him regarding the path leading to the cessation of suffering he understood that this path must be developed and that this path has been developed
The Buddha says that he did not claim to have attained supreme enlightenment until he realized the Four Noble Truths each according to the threefold ramifications thus the four truths run into twelve details
This was such a novel realization that he uses the phrase truths never heard of before with each of the above twelve statements
The wisdom that arose was so profound that he uses five terms to describe different aspects of this deep spiritual awakening vision arose wisdom arose insight arose knowledge arose and illumination arose
We are now in a position to compare the enlightenment experience of the arahant with that of the Buddha
The Mahaa Assapura account cited earlier in this essay which can be regarded as one of the best descriptions of an arahant's enlightenment experience seems to fade into insignificance when compared with the rich multifaceted enlightenment experience of the Buddha
Nowhere has the Paali Canon attributed insight into the sense faculties sense objects sensations etc as an enlightenment experience of an arahant
As stated in the Chabbisodhana Sutta it is very probable that they realistically understand the nature of sense faculties sense objects elements etc that these phenomena are impermanent unsatisfactory and nonsubstantial but they may not gain insight into the inner workings of these phenomena
The arahant's enlightenment experience is introduced by the phrase yathaabhuutam pajaanaati realistically understands whereas the Buddha's enlightenment experience is expressed as vision arose wisdom arose insight arose knowledge arose illumination arose The Paali Canon never uses this phraseology to refer to the realization of an arahant
The realization of the Four Noble Truths by an arahant is also expressed in terms of realistic understanding
But the Buddha's vision into the Four Truths is described in twelve details consisting of the threefold ramifications with respect to each of the Four Truths
The simile used in the Mahaa Assapura Sutta to describe the enlightenment experience of the arahant is that of a pond of crystalclear water where a man standing on its bank sees the pebbles shells etc in its bed and shoals of fish swimming in the water
But the Buddha's enlightenment experience is like the panoramic view one gets from the summit of a mountain and this is exactly the imagery Mahaabrahmaa uses to describe the Buddha's enlightenment experience
We are not in a position to conjecture whether the various facets of the enlightenment experience of the Buddha had a chronological and a hierarchical order and if so what that order was
It could also have been an experience like circular vision as when one is at the top of a mountain where the scenery on the east is different from the scenery in the west and the scenery in the north different from that of the south
However different the sceneries may be from the different directions all the scenes constitute one integrated experience of a person standing on a vantage point
The scanty evidence gleaned from the Paali Canon seems to favor a combination of both these patterns for the Buddha's enlightenment experience
The experience has started with a chronological hierarchy as according to the Mahaasaccaka Sutta the higher knowledges of retrocognition clairvoyance and the destruction of defilements were realized during the first second and third watches of the night respectively
The other facets of the enlightenment experience may be parts of the spiritual panorama seen in different directions from the vantage point of reality
Whatever the pattern may be an arahant's enlightenment is a much less significant much less dramatic experience than that of the Buddha which is so profound multifaceted rich and unique
In conclusion it can be stated that the Buddha would have realized a far more profound world view than he chose to preach to humanity
As that knowledge was far too complicated for ordinary comprehension and as it was irrelevant for the solution of the human problem of suffering keeping that profound knowledge as the framework within which to work the Buddha would have preached to humanity how best we could order our life in order to achieve harmony and peace in such a world
This harmony at the highest level is Nibbana
Those who followed him lacked the profound world view but learned the practice for the attainment of lasting peace and emancipation
The Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creeds
Founded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topics
Its publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddha's discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practice
These works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first arose
Buddha told this story while journeying through Kosala
When he came to the village of Nalakapana he stayed near the Nalakapana Lake
One day after bathing in the pool the monks asked the novices to fetch them some canes for needlecases
After getting the canes however the monks discovered that rather than having joints like common canes the canes were completely hollow
Surprised they went to Buddha and said Venerable Sir we wanted to make needlecases out of these canes but from top to bottom they are quite hollow
How can that be
Monks said Buddha this was my doing in days gone by Then he told this story of the past
Long long ago on this spot there was a lake surrounded by a thick forest
In those days the Bodhisatta was born as the king of the monkeys
As large as the fawn of a red deer he was the wise leader of eighty thousand monkeys that lived in that forest
He carefully counseled his followers My friends in this forest there are trees that are poisonous and lakes that are haunted by ogres
Remember always to ask me first before eating any fruit you have not eaten before or drinking any water from a source you have not drunk from before
Certainly the monkeys agreed
One day while roaming the jungle the monkey troop came to an area they had never before visited
Thirsty after their day's wanderings they searched for water and found this beautiful lake
Remembering their master's warning the monkeys refrained from drinking
They sat and waited for their leader
When he joined them he asked  Well my friends why don't you drink
We waited for you to come
Well done said the monkey king
Then he walked a full circuit around the lake
He noticed that all the footprints led down into the water but none came back
My friends he announced you were right not to drink from this lake
It is undoubtedly haunted by a demon
Suddenly the ogre in a hideous guise rose up out of the lake and appeared before them
He had a blue belly a white face and brightred hands and feet
Why are you sitting here he asked the monkeys
Go down to the lake and drink
The monkey king asked him Aren't you the ogre of this lake
Yes I am
How did you know I was here
I saw the footprints leading down to the water but none returning
Do you prey on all those who go down to the water
Yes I do
From small birds to the largest animals I catch everything which has come into my water
I will eat all of you too
Oh no ogre said the monkey king we are not going to let you eat us
You must be parched
Just drink the water taunted the monster
All right ogre we will drink some water but we are not going to fall into your power
How can you drink water without entering the lake
Ogre the monkey king cried
We need not enter your lake at all
All eighty thousand of us can drink through these canes as easily as through a hollow lotus stalk
We will drink and you will not be able to harm us
The monkey king requested that a cane be brought to him
Then recollecting the Ten Paramitas he was perfecting he recited them in a solemn asseveration of truth and blew into the cane
Instantly the joints disappeared and the whole length of the cane became hollow
After hollowing several more in the same way the monkey king toured the lake
Let all canes growing here become perfectly hollow throughout he commanded
Because of the great virtues of Bodhisattas their commands are always fulfilled
Therefore every single cane that grew around that lake instantly became hollow and has always remained so
At last the monkey king seated himself with a cane in his hands
The other eighty thousand monkeys likewise arranged themselves around the lake each with a cane
They all dipped their canes into the water and drank
They satisfied their thirst but the ogre could not touch a single one of them
Frustrated and furious he returned to his home in defeat
When all had finished the monkey king led his followers back into the forest
When Buddha had ended his lesson he showed the connection and identified the Birth by saying Devadatta was the waterogre of those days my disciples were the eighty thousand monkeys and I was the monkeyking so fertile in resourcefulness
While he was on tour through Magadha Buddha told this story about the extinguishing of a forest fire
One day Buddha went on his morning round for alms through a hamlet in Magadha
After finishing his meal he went out again accompanied by a large group of bhikkhus
Some monks walked ahead of Buddha and some walked behind him
While they were on their way a great forest fire broke out raging fiercely and spreading rapidly until the jungle was a roaring wall of flames and smoke
Those monks who had not yet made attainments were terrified with the fear of death
Let us set a counter fire so the jungle fire cannot reach us over the ground we have burned they cried and immediately started to kindle a fire
What are you doing asked the other monks
You are blind to the sun rising in front of your eyes
Here you are journeying along with Buddha who is without equal but still you cry 'Let us make a counter fire' You do not know the might of a Buddha
Come with us to the Teacher
All the monks gathered around Buddha who had halted as soon as he had seen the flames
The blaze whirled and roared as if to devour them
Suddenly however when the fire was exactly sixteen lengths from the spot where Buddha stood the flames went out like a torch plunged into water extinguished and completely harmless
The monks burst into praises of Buddha Oh how great are the virtues of the Teacher
Even fire can not singe the spot where Buddha stands
It is no present power of mine Buddha told them that makes the fire go out as soon as it reaches this spot
It is the power of a former Act of Truth of mine
No fire will ever burn this spot during the whole of this world age
This is one of the miracles which will last until the end of this era
The Elder Ananda then folded a robe in fourths and laid it down for Buddha to sit on
After he had taken his seat the monks bowed to him and seated themselves respectfully around him
Only the present is known to us Sir
The past is hidden they said
Please make it clear to us At their request the Buddha told this story of the past
Long long ago in this very spot the Bodhisatta was reborn as a quail
Every day his parents fed him with food which they brought in their beaks since he was still was confined to the nest and unable to forage on his own
The baby quail did not even have the strength yet to stand on his feet to walk about much less to spread his wings and fly
One day a great jungle fire broke out
As the flames swept through the grass and the forest birds and animals fled for their lives
The air was filled with the shrieking of adult birds flying away from their nests
The parents of this young bird were as frightened as the others and abandoned their helpless offspring to his fate
Lying there in the nest the little quail stretched his neck to see what was happening
When he saw the flames coming toward him he thought to himself My parents fearing death have fled to save themselves leaving me here completely alone
I am without protector or helper
Had I the power to take to my wings I too would fly to safety
If I could use my legs I would run away
What can I do
In this world he thought further there exists the Power of Goodness and the Power of Truth
There are beings who having realized all the Perfections in previous lives have attained enlightenment beneath the Bodhi tree
They have become Buddhas filled with truth compassion mercy and patience
There is power in the attributes they have won
Although I am very young and very weak I can grasp one truth that is the single principle in Nature
As I call to mind the Buddhas of the past and the power of their attributes let me perform an Act of Truth
The little quail concentrated his mind by recalling the power of the Buddhas long since passed away and declared With wings that cannot fly and legs that cannot yet walk forsaken by my parents here I lie
By this truth and by the faith that is in me I call on you O dreadful Fire to turn back harming neither me nor any of the other birds
At that instant the fire retreated sixteen lengths and went out like a torch plunged in water leaving a circle thirtytwo lengths in diameter around the baby quail perfectly unscathed
From that time on that very spot has escaped being touched by fire and so it will continue to be throughout this entire era
When his life ended the quail who had performed this Act of Truth passed away to fare according to his deserts
Thus monks said the Master it is not my present power but the efficacy of that Act of Truth performed by me as a young quail that has made the flames spare this spot in the jungle
At the end of his lesson Buddha preached the Truths
Some of the monks who heard attained the First path some the Second some the Third and some became Arahats
Then Buddha showed the connection and identified the Birth by saying My present parents were the parents of those days and I myself the little quail who became king of the quails
Buddha told this story while at Jetavana monastery about a monk who had stopped making effort
Asked if it was true that he was a backslider the monk immediately admitted it was so
In bygone days bhikkhu Buddha told him the wise and good won a throne by sheer perseverance in the hour of need
Then he told this story of the past
Long long ago when Brahmadatta was reigning in Baranasi the Bodhisatta was reborn to his queen
On the day he was to be named his royal parents gave a feast for eight hundred brahmans
After the meal they asked the brahmans what their son's destiny would be
Noting that the child showed promise of a glorious destiny the soothsayers predicted that the child would become a mighty king endowed with every virtue
Winning fame through exploits with his five weapons he would be without equal in all Jambudipa
Because of the brahmans' prophecy the king and queen named their son Prince FiveWeapons
When the prince was sixteen years old the king gave him a thousand pieces of silver and sent him to study with a famous teacher in Takkasila a city in Gandhara
The prince studied there for several years
When he had mastered all his subjects the teacher presented him with a set of five weapons
The prince paid his respects to his master and left Takkasila to return to Baranasi
On his way the prince came to a dense jungle
Some men who were camped at the edge of the jungle tried to stop him from going on
Young man they warned do not try to go through that forest
It is the haunt of a formidable ogre named Shaggygrip who kills everyone who enters his territory
Confident of his own strength the prince was undaunted but sure enough in the middle of the jungle the hairy ogre confronted him
The monster made himself as tall as a palmtree with a head as big as a gazebo eyes like mixing bowls two sharp tusks and a hawklike beak
His distended belly was purple and the palms of his hands were blueblack
Where do you think you're going cried the monster
Stop
You are mine
Ogre answered the prince calmly You do not scare me
Do not come near me or I will kill you with a poisoned arrow
Bravely the prince fitted an arrow dipped in deadly poison to his bow
He shot it at the monster but it only stuck to the creature's scruffy coat
The youth shot all fifty of his arrows one after another but they all stuck to the ogre's unkempt fur
Shaking himself so that the arrows fell harmlessly at his feet the ogre gave a roar and charged the prince
The young prince shouted defiance drew his sword and struck at the ogre but like the arrows the sword merely got caught in the demon's shaggy hair
Next the prince hurled his spear but that too lodged in the demon's thick pelt
He struck the ogre with his club but the club joined the other weapons in sticking to the creature's fur
The prince maintained his stance Ogre you have never before heard of me
I am Prince FiveWeapons
When I entered this forest however I put my trust not in these weapons  bow arrows sword spear and club  but in myself
Now will I give you a blow which will crush you to smithereens The prince hit the demon with his right fist but his hand stuck fast to the hair
Next he aimed a blow with his left hand
He kicked the ogre with his right foot and with his left
All he accomplished however was to get himself stuck to the monster with both hands and both feet
I will crush you to atoms he shouted as he butted the ogre with his head but that too stuck fast
Though completely ensnared by all four limbs and his head hanging helplessly like a doll from the ogre's coat the prince remained fearless and undaunted
The monster reflected This is a hero without equal a lion among men
He cannot be an ordinary human being
Although he has been captured by an ogre like me he shows no sign of fear
In all the time I've been killing travelers in this jungle I have never seen anyone like him
Why isn't he afraid of me
Reluctant to devour the prince the ogre asked How can it be young prince that you have no fear of death
Why should I be afraid
Each life must surely end in death
I know that inside my body there is a diamond sword which not even you can digest
If you eat me this sword will chop your innards into mincemeat
My death will bring about yours Of course the prince was referring to the adamantine Sword of Knowledge
The ogre pondered on this
This young prince speaks only the truth
Surely I would not be able digest a morsel of such a hero
I had better release him Fearful for his own life the demon let the prince go free saying Brave youth I will not eat you
Go free to gladden the hearts of your kinsfolk your friends and your country
I am free to go and I will go ogre answered the prince but the sins you committed in a past life have caused you to be reborn as a murderous fiend
If you continue your evil ways you will go from darkness to darkness
Having met me however you have the chance to stop killing
To destroy life is to ensure rebirth in hell as a brute or as a hungry spirit
Even if a killer's rebirth is as a human it will be miserable and short
The prince taught the ogre the evil consequences of violating the moral precepts and explained the blessings that follow from observing them
Having converted the monster the prince imbued him with selfdiscipline and established him in the Five Precepts
Before continuing on his way the prince made the ogre the guardian of that forest with a right to levy dues and charged him to remain steadfast
As he passed through the villages at the forest's edge he announced to everyone that the ogre was completely reformed
Finally armed with his five weapons the prince returned to the city of Baranasi and was reunited with his parents
When he at last became king he was a righteous ruler
After a life spent in charity and other good works he passed away to fare according to his deserts
His lesson ended Buddha said Without attachments to hamper one's heart victory will be achieved by walking righteously
Buddha taught the Dhamma progressively until that monk won Arahatship
Then he showed the connection and identified the Birth by saying Angulimala was the ogre of those days and I myself was Prince FiveWeapons
One day while Buddha was staying at Jetavana a bhikkhu came to him and confessed that he was weakhearted
Buddha encouraged him saying Monk in bygone days you won the entire kingdom of Baranasi and presented it to a tiny baby boy
You did it by sheer determination
Now that you have embraced this great discipline leading to liberation how could you possibly lose heart Then he told this story of the past
Long long ago when Brahmadatta was king of Baranasi there was a village of carpenters who earned their livelihood by building houses
Every day they took a boat upriver and went into the forest
There they cut trees and shaped beams and timbers for houses
Then they numbered all the pieces to be put together into a frame
Taking all the lumber back to the river they loaded it on the boat and returned to town
They were very skillful at their work and earned substantial wages
One day near their jungle workplace an elephant stepped on a splinter of acacia wood
The splinter pierced the elephant's foot which began to swell and fester causing him terrible agony
When the elephant heard the carpenters cutting wood he thought Perhaps those carpenters can cure my foot Limping with pain he approached them and lay down
At first the carpenters were very surprised at this but noticing his swollen foot they looked closely and discovered the splinter
With a sharp tool they made an incision around the splinter fastened a string to it and pulled it out
Then they lanced the wound cleaned it thoroughly with warm water and wrapped it in clean bandages
In a short time the elephant's foot had healed completely
Grateful to the carpenters for having saved his life the elephant decided to repay them by helping them with their work
From that time on he pulled up trees and rolled logs for them
Whenever the carpenters needed tools he picked them up with his trunk and took them to where they were working
At lunchtime the carpenters brought food to the elephant so that he didn't have to forage
After some time the elephant realized that he was getting old and would not be able to continue serving the carpenters much longer
One day he brought his son a magnificent wellbred white elephant
He said to the carpenters This young elephant is my son
Since you saved my life I give him to you
From now on he will work for you After he had explained all his duties to his son the old elephant returned alone to the forest
The young elephant worked faithfully and obediently the same as his father had done
The carpenters fed him as they had fed his father and he thrived
At the end of each work day the elephant bathed in the river before returning to the forest
The carpenters' children enjoyed pulling him by the trunk and playing all sorts of games with him both in the water and on the riverbank
Of course noble creatures be they elephants horses or men never urinate or defecate in water
This elephant being noble and pure white was always careful never to do anything of the kind while he was in the river
He always waited until he came out
One day when it rained very heavily flood waters caught a halfdry cake of the white elephant's dung and carried it down river
This piece of dung floated to Baranasi where it lodged in a bush right at the spot where the king's elephant keepers brought the king's five hundred elephants to bathe
When these beasts caught the scent of the dung of the noble young elephant they refused to enter the water
Instead they extended their tails fanned their ears and ran from the river
When the keepers explained what had happened to the elephant trainers the trainers realized that there was something in the water
Orders were given to search the river and the lump of dung was found in the bush
The trainers powdered the dung and mixed it with a little water
Then they sprinkled it over the backs of the other elephants
This caused the animals to smell very sweet and they immediately went into the water to bathe
The trainers were sure the dung had come from a very noble elephant
They reported all this to the king and advised him to capture the elephant for himself
The king ordered a raft prepared and set off upstream
When he reached the place where the carpenters had settled he found the young elephant playing in the water
As soon as the elephant heard the sound of the king's drums he came out of the water and drew near to the carpenters
They all went together to pay their respects to the king
Sire the carpenters said if you wish us to do any work for you you didn't need to come yourself
You could have sent for it and we would have brought it to you
No my friends the king answered
I've come not for wood but for this elephant
He is yours Sire they replied immediately but the elephant refused to budge
Addressing the elephant directly the king asked What do you want me to do
Order the carpenters paid for what they have spent on me Sire the elephant answered
Willingly friend The king ordered a hundred thousand coins to be piled by the elephant's trunk by his tail and beside each foot but this was not enough for the elephant he still refused to go
Each of the carpenters was given clothes for himself and his wife
Then the king provided money for all the children
Satisfied that his friends would be able to manage without his help the elephant bade farewell to the carpenters their wives and the children and departed with the king
The king took the elephant to his capital which was beautifully decorated to mark the occasion
He led the elephant around the city in a solemn procession and gave him a beautifully furnished stable
The elephant served as the king's comrade and no one else was ever permitted to ride him
With the help of this elephant the king won supremacy over all India
After some time the Queen Consort became pregnant
When it was almost time for her to give birth the king died
Everyone realized that if the elephant were to learn of the death of the king his heart would break so he was cared for as usual but not a word was said
As soon the king of Kosala heard rumors of the king's death however he thought Surely Baranasi is at my mercy and he decided to attack the kingdom
Marching at the head of a great army he laid siege to the capital
The people of Baranasi closed the city gates and sent a message to the king of Kosala The Queen of Baranasi is near the time of her delivery and the astrologers have predicted that she will bear a son in seven days
If indeed she bears a son we will fight to protect the kingdom
Please grant us seven days The king of Kosala agreed to their terms
Just as predicted on the seventh day the baby boy was born
Since he was born to win the hearts of his people the Queen named him Alinacitta which means Inspirer
On that day the army emerged to begin fighting the king of Kosala
Without a leader however the soldiers were driven back and began to waver
Shortly after the battle began messengers went to see the queen
Our army is losing ground they reported and we are afraid of defeat
The state elephant our late king's loyal friend has not been told that the king is dead that a prince has just been born and that we are besieged by the king of Kosala
Shall we tell him
Yes the time has come answered the Queen
She quickly dressed her baby boy and wrapped him in a fine cloth
Then she went with all the court to the elephant's stable
There she laid the infant at the elephant's feet saying Master your comrade the king is dead but we were afraid to tell it to you for fear your heart would break
This is your king's son
Now the king of Kosala is besieging our city and is making war upon us
Our army is losing ground
Either kill your son yourself or win back his kingdom for him
The elephant stroked the child with his trunk and gently lifted him up to his own head
Then with lamentation for his dead master he took the baby and laid him in his mother's arms
The elephant told the officers to dress him in his armor and to prepare for battle
They unlocked the city gate and escorted him out
The great beast emerged trumpeting
His aweinspiring demeanor so surprised and frightened the invaders that they panicked and fled in retreat
During the rout the elephant managed to seize the king of Kosala by his topknot
He carried his prisoner to the young prince and dropped him at the baby's feet
Soldiers sprang to kill the invader but the elephant stopped them
Be careful in the future the noble elephant advised the captive king
Never presume to take advantage of us because our Prince is young Then he allowed the king to go
Alinacitta was consecrated King at the age of seven
Like his father he ruled all of India and no foe dared rise up against him again
His reign was just and when he came to the end of his life he went to swell the hosts of heaven
To conclude his discourse Buddha observed that any monk strong in will and seeking a refuge in the Triple Gem would prevail as did the determined elephant of yore
After Buddha had declared the Truths the weakhearted monk was established in Arahatship
Identifying the birth Buddha said Queen Mahamaya was then the mother this monk was the elephant who won the kingdom and handed it over to the child Sariputta was the father elephant and I myself was the young prince
The Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creeds
Founded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topics
Its publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddha's discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practice
These works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first arose
One morning when the ministers and brahmans went to the palace to pay their respects to King Pasenadi the King of Kosala and to inquire whether His Majesty had slept well they found him lying in terror unable to move from his bed
How could I sleep well exclaimed the king
Just before daybreak I dreamed sixteen incredible dreams and I have been lying here terrified ever since
Since you are my advisors tell me what these dreams mean
What were your dreams sire the brahmans asked
Surely we will be able to judge their importance
As the king was telling them his dreams the brahmans looked very worried and began wringing their hands
Why are you wringing your hands brahmans asked the king
Is it because of my dreams
Yes sire
These are evil dreams
They are full of peril
What will come of them asked the king
They portend one of three calamities sire  great harm to your kingdom to your wealth or to your life
Is there any remedy
These dreams are powerful and extremely threatening
Still we will find a remedy otherwise what is the use of our vast study and learning
How do you propose to avert the evil asked the king
Wherever four roads meet we will offer appropriate sacrifices sire
My advisors cried the king
My life is in your hands
Hurry and do your best to save me
Each of the exultant brahmans had the same thought We are going to make a fortune from these dreams
Soon we will feast on the choicest foods
As soon as they had left the king's presence they began scurrying about happily giving orders in every direction
They ordered laborers to dig huge sacrificial pits
They demanded herds of various fourfooted creatures all without blemish
They called for baskets of pure white birds of many kinds
Again and again they discovered something or other lacking
Messengers raced back and forth to inform the king of each new request
Noticing all the commotion Queen Mallika went to the king and asked why the brahmans and their servants kept coming to him
I envy you said the king sarcastically
A snake in your ear and you don't even know it
What does your majesty mean asked the queen
I have dreamed such unlucky dreams
The brahmans tell me they point to disaster
They keep coming here because they are anxious to protect me from the evil by offering sacrifices
Has your majesty consulted the Chief Brahman of all the worlds about this asked the queen
Who do you mean my dear asked the king
Of course I mean Lord Buddha
He will surely understand your dreams
Go to Jetavana and ask him
A good idea my queen answered the king
I will go at once
When the king reached the monastery he paid his respects to the Buddha and sat down
What brings your majesty here so early in the morning asked the Buddha
Just before daybreak venerable sir I dreamed sixteen terrifying dreams
My brahmans have warned me that my dreams foretell calamity
To avert the evil they are preparing to sacrifice many animals wherever four roads meet
Queen Mallika suggested that I ask you to tell me what these dreams really mean and what will come of them
It is true sire that I alone can explain the significance of your dreams and tell you what will come of them
Tell me your dreams as they appeared to you
I will Blessed One answered the king and he began relating his dreams
In the first dream I saw four jetblack bulls the king began
They came together from the four cardinal directions to the royal courtyard with every intention to fight
A great crowd of people gathered to see the bullfight
The bulls however only made a show of fighting pawing and bellowing
Finally they went off without fighting at all
This was my first dream
What will come of it
Sire that dream will have no result in your lifetime or mine
But in the distant future when kings are stingy when citizens are unrighteous when the world is perverted and when good is waning and evil waxing in those days of the world's decline no rain will fall from the heavens the monsoons will forget their season the crops will wither and famine will stalk the land
At that time immense clouds will gather from the four quarters of the heavens as if for rain
Farmers will rush to bring in the rice they had spread to dry in the sun
Men will take their spades and hurry to repair the dikes
The thunder will roar and the lightning will flash from the clouds
However just as the bulls in your dream didn't fight these clouds will retreat without giving any rain
This is what shall come of this dream
But no harm shall come to you from this dream because it applies only to the remote future
The brahmans only said what they said to get some profit for themselves
Now tell me your second dream sire
My second dream was about tiny trees and shrubs which burst through the soil
When they were scarcely more than a few inches high they flowered and bore fruit
This was my second dream
What will come of it
Sire said the Buddha this dream will be realized in future days when the world has fallen into decay and when human lives are short
Passions then will be so strong that even very young girls will cohabitate with men
Despite their immaturity they will get pregnant and have children
The flowers and fruit symbolize their babies
However you have nothing to fear from this
Tell me your third dream
I saw cows sucking milk from their very own newborn calves
This was my third dream
What can it possibly mean
This dream will come about only when age is no longer respected
In that future time young people will have no regard for their parents or parentsinlaw
Children will handle the family estate themselves
If it pleases them they will give food and clothing to the old folks but if it doesn't suit them they will withhold their gifts
Thus the old people destitute and dependent will survive only by the favor and whim of their own children like big cows suckled by dayold calves
However you have nothing to fear from this
Tell me your fourth dream
Men unyoked a team of strong sturdy oxen and replaced them with young steers too weak to draw the load
Those young steers refused to pull
They stood stockstill so that the wagons didn't move at all
This was my fourth dream
What will come of it
Here again the dream will not come to pass until the future in the days of wicked kings
In days to come unjust and parsimonious kings will show no honor to wise leaders skilled in diplomacy
They will not appoint experienced learned judges to the courts
On the contrary they will honor the very young and foolish and will appoint the most inexperienced and unprincipled to the courts
Naturally these appointees because of their ignorance of statecraft and the law will not be able to bear the burden of their responsibilities
Because of their incompetence they will have to throw off the yoke of public office
When that happens the aged and wise lords will remember being passed over and even though they are able to cope with all difficulties they will refuse to help saying 'It is no business of ours since we have become outsiders' They will remain aloof and the government will fall to ruins
It is just like when the young steers not strong enough for the burden were yoked instead of the team of sturdy oxen
However you have nothing to fear from this
Tell me your fifth dream
I saw an incredible horse with a mouth on each side of its head being fed fodder on both sides
That dreadful horse ate voraciously with both its mouths
This was my fifth dream
What will come of it
This dream will also come true only in the future in the days of unrighteous and irresponsible kings who will appoint covetous men to be judges
These despicable magistrates blind to virtue and honesty will take bribes from both sides as they sit in the seat of judgment
They will be doubly corrupt just like the horse that ate fodder with two mouths at once
However you have nothing to fear from this
Tell me your sixth dream
I saw people holding out a brightly burnished golden bowl which must have been worth a fortune
They were actually begging an old jackal to urinate in it
Then I saw the repulsive beast do just that
This was my sixth dream
What can it mean
This dream too will come to be only in the remote future when immoral kings although from a royal line themselves will mistrust the sons of their old nobility preferring instead the lowestborn of the country
Because of the kings' blindness nobles will decline and the lowborn will rise in rank
Naturally the great families will give their daughters to them in marriage
The union of the noble maidens with the ignoble nouveauriche will be like the pissing of the old jackal into the golden bowl
However you have nothing to fear from this
Tell me your seventh dream
I saw a man braiding rope
As he worked he dropped the finished rope at his feet
Under his bench unknown to him lay a hungry jackal bitch which kept eating the rope as fast as he braided it
This was my seventh dream
What shall come of it
This dream also will happen only in far off days
At that time women will crave men strong drink extravagant clothes jewelry and entertainment
In their profligacy these women will get drunk with their lovers and carry on shamelessly
They will neglect their homes and families
They will pawn household valuables selling everything for drink and amusements even the seed needed for the next crop
Just as the hungry jackal under the bench ate the rope of the ropemaker so these women will squander the savings earned by their husbands' labor
However you have nothing to fear from this
Tell me your eighth dream
At a palace gate there stood a big pitcher full to the brim
Around it stood many empty pitchers
From all directions there came a steady stream of people carrying pots of water which they poured into the already full pitcher
The water from that full pitcher kept overflowing and wastefully soaking into the sand
Still the people came and poured more and more water into the overflowing vessel
Not a single person even glanced at the empty pitchers
This was my eighth dream
What shall come of it
This dream too will not come to pass until the future when the world is in decline
The kingdom will grow weak and its kings will be poorer and more demanding
These kings in their poverty and selfishness will make the whole country work exclusively for them
They will force citizens to neglect their own work and to labor only for the throne
For the kings' sake they will plant sugar cane make sugarmills and boil down molasses
For the kings' sake they will plant flower gardens and orchards and gather fruits
They will harvest all the crops and fill the royal storerooms and warehouses to overflowing but they will be unable even to glance at their own empty barns at home
It will be like filling and overfilling the full pitcher heedless of the needy empty ones
However you have nothing to fear from this
Tell me your ninth dream
I saw a deep pool with sloping banks overgrown with lotuses
From all directions a wide variety of animals came to drink water from that pool
Strangely the deep water in the middle was terribly muddy but the water at the edges where all those thirsty creatures had descended into the pool was unaccountably clear and sparkling
This was my ninth dream
What does it mean
This dream too will not come to pass until the future when kings grow increasingly corrupt
Ruling according to their own whim and pleasure they will never make judgments according to what is right
Being greedy they will grow fat on lucrative bribes
Never showing mercy or compassion to their subjects they will be fierce and cruel
These kings will amass wealth by crushing their subjects like stalks of sugar cane in a mill and by taxing them to the last penny
Unable to pay the oppressive taxes the citizens will abandon their villages towns and cities and will flee like refugees to the borders
The heart of the country will be a wilderness while the remote areas along the borders will teem with people
The country will be just like the pool muddy in the middle and clear at the edges
However you have nothing to fear from this
Tell me your tenth dream
I saw rice boiling in a pot without getting done
By 'not getting done' I mean that it looked as though the cooking was going on in three distinct stages which were sharply delineated and separate from each other
One part of the rice was sodden another part was hard and raw and the third part looked like it was perfectly cooked
This was my tenth dream
What will come of it
This dream too will not be fulfilled until the future
In days to come kings will become unrighteous the nobles will follow the king's example and so will the brahmans
The townsmen the merchants and at last even the farmers will be corrupted
Eventually everyone in the country the sages and even the gods of the land will become immoral
Even the winds that blow over the realm of such an unrighteous king will grow cruel and lawless
Because even the skies and the spirits of the skies over that land will be disturbed they will cause a drought
Rain will never fall on the whole kingdom at once
It may rain in the upper districts but in the lower it will not
In one place a heavy downpour will damage the crops while in another area the crops will wither from drought
The crops sown within a single kingdom  like the rice in the one pot  shall have no uniform character
However you have nothing to fear from this
Tell me your eleventh dream
I saw rancid buttermilk being bartered for precious sandalwood worth a fortune in gold
This was my eleventh dream
What shall come of it
This will happen only in the distant future when my teaching is waning
In those days there will be many greedy shameless bhikkhus who for the sake of their bellies dare to preach the very words in which I have warned against greed
Because they desert the Truth to gratify their stomachs and because they sided with sectarians their preaching will not lead to Nibbana
Their only thought as they preach will be to use fine words and sweet voices to induce lay believers to give them costly robes delicate food and every comfort
Others will seat themselves beside the highways at busy street corners or at the doors of kings' palaces where they will stoop to preach for money even for a pittance
Thus these monks will barter away for food for robes or for coins my teaching which leads to liberation from suffering
They will be like those who exchanged precious sandalwood worth a fortune in pure gold for rancid buttermilk
However you have nothing to fear from this
Tell me your twelfth dream
I saw dried gourds sinking in the water
What shall come of it
This dream also will not have its fulfillment until the future in the days of unjust kings when the world is perverted
In those days kings will favor the lowborn not the sons of nobility
The lowborn will become great lords while the nobles will sink into poverty
In the king's court and in the courts of justice the words of the lowborn alone will be recognized so that they like the dried gourds will be firmly established
In the assemblies of monks it will be the same
Whenever there are enquiries about proper behavior rules of conduct or discipline only the counsel of wicked corrupt monks will be considered
The advice of modest monks will be ignored
It will be as when the empty pumpkins sank
However you have nothing to fear from this
Tell me your thirteenth dream
Then the king said I saw huge blocks of solid rock as big as houses floating like dried gourds upon the waters
What shall come of it
This dream also will not come to pass until those times of which I have spoken
At that time unrighteous kings will show honor to the lowborn who will become great lords while the true nobles will fade into obscurity
The nobles will receive no respect while the ignorant upstarts will be granted all honors
In the king's court and in the law courts the words of the nobles learned in the law will drift idly by like those solid rocks
They will not penetrate deep into the hearts of men
When the wise speak the ignorant will merely laugh them to scorn saying 'What is it these fellows are saying' In the assemblies of monks as well people will not respect the excellent monks
Their words will not sink deep but will drift idly by the same as the rocks floating on the water
However you have nothing to fear from this
Tell me your fourteenth dream
I saw tiny frogs no bigger than miniature flowerets swiftly pursuing huge black snakes and devouring them
What can this mean
This dream too will not have its fulfillment until those future days of which I have already spoken when the world is declining
At that time men's passions will be so strong that husbands will be thoroughly infatuated with their childish wives
Men will lose all judgment and selfrespect
Being completely smitten they will place their infantile wives in charge of everything  servants livestock granaries gold and silver everything in the house
Should the overfond husband presume to ask for some money or for a favorite robe he will be told to mind his own business and not to be so inquisitive about property in her house
These abusive young wives will exercise their power over their husbands as if the men were slaves
It will be like the tiny frogs which gobbled up the big black snakes
However you have nothing to fear from this
Tell me your fifteenth dream
I saw a village crow a vile creature with all the ten vices attended by an entourage of Mandarin ducks beautiful birds with feathers of golden sheen
What shall come of it
This dream too will not come to pass until the far distant future in the reign of weakling kings
Then there will be kings who know nothing about ruling
They will be cowards and fools
Fearing revolt and revolution they will elevate their footmen bathattendants and barbers to nobility
These kings will ignore the real nobility
Cut off from royal favor and unable to support themselves bona fide nobles will be reduced to dancing attendance on the upstarts as when the crow had regal Mandarin ducks for his retinue
However you have nothing to fear from this
Tell me your sixteenth dream
I saw goats chasing wolves and eating them
At the sight of goats in the distance the wolves fled terrorstricken quaking with fear to hide in thickets
Such was my dream
What will come of it
This dream too will not have its fulfillment until the reign of immoral kings
The lowborn will be raised to important posts and will become royal favorites
True nobles will sink into obscurity and distress
Gaining power in the law courts because of the king's favors the parvenu will claim the ancestral estates of the impoverished old nobility demanding their titles and all their property
When the real nobles plead their rights in court the king's minions will have them beaten and tortured then taken by the throat and thrown out with words of scorn
'That will teach you to know your place fools' they will shout
'How dare you dispute with us
The king shall hear of your insolence and we will have your hands and feet chopped off' At this the terrified nobles will agree that black is white and that their own estates belong to the lowly upstarts
They will then hurry home and cower in an agony of fear
Likewise at that time evil monks will harass good worthy monks until the worthy ones flee from the monasteries to the jungle
This oppression of true nobles by the lowborn and of good monks by the evil monks will be like the intimidation of wolves by goats
However you have nothing to fear from this
This dream refers to the future only
When he had thus reassured the king the Buddha added It was neither truth nor love for you that prompted the brahmans to prophesy as they did
It was pure greed and selfishness that led them to prescribe sacrifices
Thus the Buddha explained the meaning of the sixteen dreams
Then he said Nor are you the first to have had these dreams
They were dreamed by kings of bygone days as well
Then as now brahmans found in them a pretext for sacrifices
At the king's request the Buddha told this story of the past
Long long ago when Brahmadatta was reigning in Baranasi the Bodhisatta was born into a brahman family in the North country
When he grew up he renounced the world and became a hermit
Having attained a high level of meditation he acquired supernatural powers
One day King Brahmadatta dreamed sixteen mysterious dreams and asked his advisors about them
The brahmans explained that the dreams foretold evil and began preparing great sacrifices
Seeing this one of the pupils of the chief brahman a young man of considerable learning and wisdom approached his teacher and said Master you have taught me the Three Vedas
Don't the texts say that it is never a good thing to take life
My dear boy answered the teacher this means money to us  a great deal of money
Why are you anxious to spare the king's treasury
Do as you will Master replied the young man
I will no longer stay here with you With those words he left the palace and went to the royal gardens
That same morning the Bodhisatta had thought to himself If I visit the king's garden today I will save a great number of creatures from death
The young brahman found the ascetic radiant as a golden image sitting on the king's ceremonial stone seat in the garden
He sat down in an appropriate place paid respect to the hermit and entered into pleasant conversation with him
The hermit asked the young man if he thought the king ruled righteously
Sir he answered the king himself is righteous but the brahmans are leading him astray
The king consulted with them about sixteen dreams he had and the brahmans jumped at the opportunity for sacrifices
Venerable sir how good it would be for you to explain to the king the real meaning of his dreams
Your explanation will save many animals from cruel death
I do not know the king nor does he know me
If he comes here and asks me however I will tell him
Please wait here sir
I will bring the king said the young brahman
He hurried to the king and told him there was a wondrous ascetic who would interpret the dreams
He asked the king to visit the ascetic and talk with him
The king immediately agreed and went to the garden with his retinue
Paying his respects to the ascetic he sat down and asked if the ascetic could tell him what would come of his dreams
Certainly sire he answered
Let me hear the dreams as you dreamed them
The king proceeded to tell the dreams exactly as King Pasenadi told them to the Buddha
Enough said the Bodhisatta
You have nothing to fear from any of these dreams
Having reassured the king and having freed a great number of creatures from death the hermit poised in midair taught the king how to observe the Five Precepts and concluded by saying From this time on sire do not join the brahmans in slaughtering animals for sacrifice
Remaining firm in the teaching he had heard and spending the rest of his days in almsgiving and other good works the king passed away to fare according to his deserts
His lesson ended the Buddha said Sire you too have nothing to fear from these dreams
Stop the sacrifice Then the Buddha identified the Birth by saying Ananda was the king of those days Sariputta was the young brahman and I was the ascetic
During a stay in Veluvana the Buddha heard that Devadatta intended to kill him
Monks this is not the first time that Devadatta has tried to kill me he tried before and failed Then he told them this story of the past
Long long ago when Brahmadatta was reigning in Baranasi in a village not far from the capital the Bodhisatta was born as the son of a householder
When he became a young man he married a wellbred young lady from Baranasi
She was a fair and graceful maiden named Sujata
She became a virtuous wife faithfully serving her husband and his parents
The young man loved his wife very much and the two of them lived together in joy harmony and oneness of mind
One day Sujata said to her husband I would like to see my mother and father again after such a long time
Very well my dear he replied Please prepare food for us for the journey
They loaded a cart with provisions and gifts
He sat in front to drive and she sat behind
As soon as they reached the outskirts of Baranasi they stopped to rest and he unyoked the oxen
After they had washed and eaten their meal Sujata changed her clothes and adorned herself
Quite refreshed her husband yoked the oxen again and climbed up into the driver's seat
Sujata sat down again in the back and they resumed their journey
As they entered the city Sujata stepped down from the cart and walked behind it
The king of Baranasi happened to be passing in procession on the back of his splendid royal elephant and saw her
He was so attracted by her beauty that he ordered one of his men to go and find out whether or not she had a husband
I am told she has a husband sire the servant reported
Do you see that man driving the cart
That is her husband
The king could not control his passion
I will get rid of that fellow he thought and take the wife for myself A vicious plan began forming in his mind and he called his servant again
Take this ornament he said to the servant handing him a beautiful jeweled crest and walk past that man's wagon
As you pass by casually drop the jewel into the wagon without letting anyone see what you are doing
As soon as you have done it report back to me The servant did exactly as he was told
I have lost a jeweled crest cried the king
Shut all the gates
Catch the thief The news spread rapidly and the city was soon in an uproar
The servant immediately set out with soldiers and accosted Sujata's husband
Hey you he shouted
Stop that cart
The king has lost a jewel and we must search your wagon Of course he quickly found the jeweled crest which he himself had put there a few minutes before
Thief he cried grabbing hold of the young man
The soldiers immediately seized him and beat him
They tied his arms behind his back and dragged him before the king
Here's the thief who stole your jewel they cried
Off with his head the king commanded excitedly
The soldiers led the young man away striking him with whips at every corner until they reached the south gate
Sujata ran after him stretching out her arms and wailing Dearest husband it is I who got you into this wretched predicament
Just outside the city the king's servants threw him down and prepared to cut off his head
When she saw her beloved husband about to be executed Sujata reflected on her own virtue and cried No gods are here
They must be far away
There can be no gods here or they would stop these cruel men from slaying my innocent husband
While the virtuous Sujata reproached the heavens in this way Sakka king of the gods noticed that his throne was growing hot
Who is trying to make me fall from my position he wondered
He immediately became aware of what was happening
Ah he thought The king of Baranasi is doing a very evil deed
He is making the worthy Sujata suffer
I must go there at once
Swiftly descending from his heaven Sakka plucked the wicked king from the royal elephant and laid him down on the execution ground
In the same instant he snatched Sujata's husband from the execution place dressed him in the king's robes and set him on the back of the king's elephant
The executioner lifted his axe and cut off a head  but it was the king's head and as soon as the blow was struck everyone realized it was the king's
Then Sakka appeared to the crowd stood in front of the young man and consecrated him as king with Sujata his queen
All the courtiers brahmans householders and other citizens rejoiced
The unjust king is dead they cried
Sakka himself has given us a righteous king
Sakka stood poised in the air and declared This upright king shall rule you virtuously
Because he was unrighteous the evil king was slain
If a king is immoral the gods send rain out of season and in season there is no rain
If the king is evil three great fears torment men  fear of famine fear of pestilence and fear of the sword
This righteous king has been sent to you from heaven Having thus admonished the people Sakka returned to his divine abode
The just king reigned wisely and in due time went to swell the hosts of heaven
At the end of this discourse the Buddha identified the Birth At that time Devadatta was the wicked king Anuruddha was Sakka Rahula's mother was Sujata and I myself was the king proclaimed by Sakka
While staying in Jetavana the Buddha told this story about the bhikkhu Upananda the Sakyan
Upananda had forsaken the virtues of contentment and had become extremely greedy
At the beginning of the rains retreat he tried two or three monasteries leaving an umbrella or a shoe at one and a water pot or a walking stick at another but actually staying at yet another
As he began the retreat in a rural monastery he exhorted his fellow bhikkhus as if he were making the moon rise in the sky saying Bhikkhus must live contentedly He praised contentment with bare necessities and expounded on the nobility of having few wants
Swayed by his eloquence the other bhikkhus threw away their fine robes and vessels and began wearing robes of rags and using rough clay pots
Upananda collected all the choice items and kept them in his own lodging
When the rains retreat was over he filled a cart and set out for Jetavana
On the way he came to a forest monastery
He stopped behind the monastery and wrapped his feet with creepers
Saying to himself Surely there's something to be gotten here he entered the monastery
He found two old bhikkhus who had spent the retreat there and had received two coarse cloaks and one fine blanket
The two were pleased to see Upananda
Sir they said we cannot divide these things
We are having an argument about them and would be very grateful if you would divide them between us
Upananda quickly agreed
He gave a coarse robe to each of them and took the blanket for himself
This falls to me for knowing the rules of discipline he said and went away
Those elders who loved the blanket went with him to Jetavana and explained the matter to the senior monks who knew the rules
Is it right they asked for those who know the rules to take so much away from us in this way
When the bhikkhus saw the pile of robes and bowls which Upananda had brought they said Sir you must have great merit to have gained so much food and so many robes
Sirs he protested where is my merit Then he proceeded to tell them exactly how he had gained everything
In the Hall of Truth the bhikkhus said to each other Upananda the Sakyan is very covetous and greedy
When the Buddha heard about it he said Bhikkhus Upananda's deeds are not suited for progress
A bhikkhu should act suitably himself before he preaches to others about progress
As for Upananda he added this is not the first time that he has been covetous
In the past too he plundered others' property in the same way Then he told this story
Long long ago when Brahmadatta was reigning in Baranasi there was a jackal named Mayavi who had taken a mate and lived near a riverbank
One day his wife said to him Husband I suddenly feel a very strong craving for fresh redfish
All right my dear he said
Just wait and I'll bring you some Then he went to the river wrapped his feet in creepers and crept along the bank
Not far from that place two otters named Gambhiracari and Anutiracari were standing on the bank looking for fish
At that moment Gambhiracari saw a great redfish
He jumped into the water and grabbed it by the tail
The fish was strong and swam away dragging the otter with him
Gambhiracari called to his friend Quick
Come and help me Anutiracari
This enormous fish will be enough for both of us
Rushing to help him Anutiracari shouted How lucky you are Gambhiracari
And strong too
Hold the fish as tight as you can and like a garuda lifting a snake I'll snatch him from the water
Then the two together hauled and pushed the redfish onto the riverbank laid him down and killed him
You have caught a great fish Anutiracari said
Please divide it
No protested Gambhiracari
I could not have caught it without your help
You must divide it
In this way the two of them quarreled both refusing to divide the fish
At last they sat down with the fish lying in front of them
As soon as they had sat down the jackal emerged from his hiding place and approached them
The otters saluted him and said Welcome friend
Please help us
Together we have caught this redfish but we cannot decide how to divide it between us
Please cut it fairly and give us each an equal part
Certainly the jackal answered
I have settled many cases such as this and I have always acted fairly maintaining peace and friendship between the parties
Then as cleanly as if he had a butcher's knife he bit the fish into three pieces
Anutiracari take the tail he said
And you Gambhiracari keep the head
Eat your shares without quarreling
The middle part will be my payment for settling your dispute In a flash he grabbed the plump middle portion of the fish and ran off
The two otters sat stunned as though they had lost a purse of a thousand pieces of silver
What fools we are they cried
If we had not argued over this fish it would have been enough for a delicious feast for us both
But now the jackal has taken the fish and left us with no more than the bony head and tail
The jackal was very proud of himself as he carried the redfish to his wife
When she saw him coming she saluted him and cried My lord how happy I am to see you with such a prize
You are like a king who has just conquered a neighboring kingdom
How did you manage to catch this fish
You can't swim
Mayavi placed the fish before his wife and explained Strife causes weakness and decay
Because of strife the otters lost their prize and I Mayavi brought it home to you
A treespirit dwelling nearby who had observed all this added So it is among men as well
When strife arises and men seek an arbiter the arbiter gains the upper hand
They lose their wealth but the king grows richer still
After the lesson the Buddha explained At that time the jackal was Upananda the otters were the two old monks and I myself was the treespirit who witnessed the scene
The Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creeds
Founded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topics
Its publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddha's discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practice
These works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first arose
The Bhaddekaratta Sutta of the Majjhima Nikaaya consists of a summary in four verses and an exposition dealing with some doctrinal points of considerable psychological and ethical import
The theme set out by the Buddha in this discourse recurs in three others  AAnandabhaddekaratta Sutta Mahaakaccaanabhaddekaratta Sutta and Lomasakangiyabhaddekaratta Sutta  in which the disciples of these names figure prominently
These four consecutive suttas are thus made conspicuous among the discourses of the Majjhima Nikaaya and one can well infer that this bespeaks of the importance attached to their theme
That the theme was highly esteemed is clearly revealed by the framework of the two suttas Mahaakaccaanabhaddekaratta and Lomasakangiyabhaddekaratta
In both one finds a deity appearing before a monk and recommending to him the learning of the summary and exposition of the Bhaddekaratta as follows
Monk you learn the summary and exposition of the Bhaddekaratta
Monk you master the summary and exposition of the Bhaddekaratta
Monk you bear in mind the summary and exposition of the Bhaddekaratta
Monk the summary and exposition of the Bhaddekaratta is beneficial it pertains to the elements of the Holy Life
Although the theme of these four discourses was thus held in high esteem there is unfortunately a formidable obstacle to a proper appreciation of its significance
The title Bhaddekaratta which is also the main keyword remains more or less a puzzle
In none of the four suttas is the word commented upon despite the fact that the venerables AAnanda and Mahaakaccaana also contribute to the exposition of the theme
This is probably because the early disciples were already familiar with the expression as such
Even the two monks Samiddhi and Lomasakangiya who confessed their ignorance of the summary and exposition of the Bhaddekaratta when questioned by the deities have not thought it fit to get this puzzling word clarified for us when they later went to the Buddha for instruction on the subject
In the commentaries there is an attempt to explain the meaning of bhaddekaratta but some scholars have questioned the validity of the interpretation given in them
What these interpretations are and on what grounds they are found to be inadequate can be gleaned from the following comments by IB
Horner and the venerable aanamoli
Suttas  all have the term bhaddekaratta as part of their title and this presents something of a puzzle
MA v
attempts an explanation of this word by saying vipassanaanuyogasamannaagatattaa bhaddakassa ekarattasa of one who is happy for one night because he is possessed of intentness of insight Neumann renders the term by Glcksaligeinsam lonely blissfulness
But ekatta is loneliness ekaratta usually means for one night But the Bhaddekaratta suttas do not appear to envisage withdrawal from thoughts of the past future and present for so little as one night
On the contrary the verses that form the maatikaa say that the person to be called bhaddekaratta is he who abides ardently and unweariedly day and night that is surely for some consecutive time lasting longer than one night I thought it best to translate only the first part of the baffling compound and have rendered bhadda by auspicious not in its sense of betokening success but in that of prosperous prospering
For the sage who comes to be at peace has prospered by not following after the past by not desiring the future to be such or so and by cultivating a right attitude to present things
His position is not due to luck a happy chance or fortune's favors it is due to his own successful efforts determined resolution and shunning of indolence
 IB
Horner Middle Length Sayings III Introduction ppxxvixxvii
There are four consecutive suttas in the Majjhima Nikaaya with the name Bhaddekaratta each based on the same verse
This term has elsewhere been translated by true saint and like phrases which however quite miss the point
The commentary says only this Bhaddekarattassa means 'of one who is fortunate in having one attachment ' this is because of his possessing application to insight The subcommentary resolves the compound ekaratta into ekaa ratti and says only that bhaddekaratta means one who has a fortunate single attachment it is a term for a person who is cultivating insight The Mahaa Niddesa alludes to these suttas without throwing any light on them
There appears to be no other mention of the term elsewhere in the Canon and its commentaries
The Paali word ratta or ratti in this instance is from the root raj
So the bhaddekaratta appears as one who is applying himself invincibly unshakably to know and to study the present state as it occurs
This application or attachment is auspicious or fortunate because it leads to liberation
The much more common meaning of the Paali word ratti is night
But if we attempt to interpret the term bhaddekaratta as one who has a single auspicious night and the commentarial passages accordingly it is hard to make satisfactory sense of the context
It might be supposed that the expression bhaddekaratta was a popular phrase taken over by the Buddha and given a special sense by him as was not infrequently done but there seems no reason to do so and there is no evidence for it in this case
It is more likely to be a term coined by the Buddha himself to describe a certain aspect of development
Such terms are ukkhittapaligha ditthippatta and many more
 Venerable aanamoli Translation of the Majjhima Nikaaya 
It is not clear precisely what bhaddekaratta means
NettiA says Evam patipannaattaa bhaddo ekaratto assaati bhaddekaratta
MAA adds Ekaaratti ekaratto bhaddo ekaratto etassaati bhaddekarattam vipassanam paribruuhento puggalo etenaaha 'vipassanaanuyogasamannaagatattaa' tam uddissa pavattiyaa pana bhaddekarattasahacaranato bhaddekaratto ten'aaha bhagavaa 'Bhaddekarattassa vo bhikkhave uddesanca vibhanganca desissaami ti'
NettiTiikaa offers nothing
The only other mention referring to these four suttas is at Nd namely bhaddekarattavihaaram in an explanation of jaagariyaanuyogapariyanto The NdA has nothing enlightening
All these comments seem to take the ratt element as representing ratti and so the literal translation would then be one who has an auspicious one night and the Burmese transcript of the Majjhima Nikaaya gives the same sense to bhaddekaratta as to ahorattam two lines higher
But these explanations are all grammatical and avoid the meaning
The term might  it has been suggested but this is entirely speculative  have been a popular one for say the Hindu Sivoraatri which was purposely given a new sense here by the Buddha as he did with many other current terms

An alternative derivation might be that ratt stands for ratto or ratti from Vranj to desire to lust cf
dhammaraaga or tathaagatoranjita of the profitable craving and profitable conceit though there is apparently no example of raatti from this root in Paali
This interpretation has been adopted in the translation here as more trenchant though neither seems quite safe and the meaning remains unsettled
 Venerable aanamoli The Guide pp fn

The Theranaamo Sutta of the Samyutta Nikaaya gives the case of a monk who was a lonedweller and who also recommended the same mode of living to others
As the title of the sutta suggests he was known to his fellow monks simply as the Elder Whether this was in deference to his love of anonymity or whether it had any pejorative associations for the more sociable of his fellow monks we do not know
Nevertheless we seem to get a caricature of his character in the following sentences of the sutta
Tena kho pana samayena annataro bhikkhu Theranaamako ekavihaarii ceva hoti ekavihaarassa ca vannavaadii
So eko gaamapindaaya pavisati eko patikkamati eko raho nisiidati eko cankamam adhitthaati
At that time a certain monk called The Elder was a lonedweller and he also spoke in praise of lonedwelling
Alone he enters the village for alms alone he returns alone he sits in seclusion alone he paces up and down
Some of his fellow monks who might have thought his behavior to be rather peculiar report about him to the Buddha
The Buddha summons the Thera who thereupon confirms that report about his partiality for lonedwelling
When questioned as to how exactly he upholds the precept and practice of lonedwelling he explains to the Buddha his daily routine after the manner given above
Here Lord alone I enter the village for alms alone I return alone I sit in seclusion and alone I pace up and down
It is thus Lord that I am a lonedweller and an exponent of lonedwelling
The Buddha's remarks in this instance were neither those of condemnation nor of unqualified praise
He says There is Thera this type of lonedwelling I do not deny it
But Thera I shall tell you the manner in which lonedwelling is fulfilled in all its details
Listen attentively to it And then he goes on to explain it in the following words
Idha Thera yam atitam tam pahiinam yam anaagatam patinissattinam
Paccuppannesu ca attabhaavapatilaabhesu chandaraago suppativiniito
Evam kho Thera ekavihaaro vitthaarena paripunno hoti
Herein Elder whatever is past that is abandoned
Whatever is yettocome that is relinquished
And the desireandlust for the present modes of personality is well under control
It is thus Elder that lonedwelling becomes fulfilled in all its details
In order to make it clear that the ideal lonedweller who fully conforms to the above requirements is the arahant himself the Buddha sums up his discourse with this verse
Now this ideal of lonedwelling as set out in the Theranaama Sutta seems to find an echo in the verses which make up the summary of the Bhaddekaratta Sutta
One can compare the Buddha's definition of the perfect lonedweller in the former sutta with the following lines occurring in the latter
We saw above how the Theranaamo Sutta expounds the true ideal of solitude as against the popular and commonplace concept of solitude
The true ideal is depicted as a solitude of mind gained by giving up everything belonging to the past and the future and by disciplining well the desireandlust for one's present modes of personality
The concluding verse makes it clear that the ideal lonedweller is unsoiled as to all phenomena and is well released renouncing all This reminds us of the term upadhiviveka denoting Nibbaana which is the highest mental solitude to which all attempts at physical solitude should be properly harnessed
As for this latter the popular conception is always one of dwelling alone all by oneself
It conjures up in the ascetic mind the prospect of peace in being away from the maddingcrowd No doubt this physical solitude is often upheld by the Buddha as an essential prerequisite for detachment
Thus at the end of one of the most forceful perorations in favor of this type of solitude he confesses to his attendant the venerable Naagita with remarkable candor that he is quite at ease even in answering calls of nature when he sees none in front of or behind him while journeying all alone
Yasmaaham Naagita samaye addhaanamagga patipanno na kanci passaami purato vaa pacchato vaa phaasu me Naagita tasmim samaye hoti antamaso uccaarapassaavakammaayaati and we find in the Theragaathaa a similar expression of the ease of solitude in the words of Ekavihaariya Thera
When there is none to be seen in front or behind one is greatly at ease as one dwells in the forest all alone
Just as much as the physical solitude is associated with the satisfaction of not seeing anyone before or behind oneself the mental solitude too is characterized by the absence of anxious glances forward or backward
Having abandoned everything past one does not trace back or relive the past
Having given up what pertains to the future one is no longer anxious about the future
This concept of the past and future brings spatial and temporal modes of thinking much closer to each other  the before and the behind of physical solitude and the past and the future of mental solitude
However the freedom from these two distracting elements in itself does not constitute the perfect ease that is the ideal of solitude
There is also a third element of distraction to be eliminated
One has to be carefree whether the solitude aimed at is physical or mental
Hence any deep attachment to one's belongings  be they material or mental  is the third element of distraction
Having brought under complete control the desireandlust regarding one's present modes of personality one discerns what is present with penetrative insight as impermanent sorrowfraught and not one's own
The two suttas Theranaamo and Bhaddekaratta thus concur with each other in pointing to a concept of solitude far transcending its popular connotations
Nor are they without parallel in other portions of the Paali canon the following being a few of them
A comparative study of the two suttas in question would make it abundantly clear that both deal with the same theme
But how are we to bring into proper alignment the baffling compound  bhaddekaratta
In the context of our discussion of the subject of solitude the most outstanding element of this compound appears to be the middle word eka
Owing to the rather generic character of the word its significance has often been underestimated  hence the tendency to treat bhaddekaratta as an elliptical expression
The word eka was more or less regarded as a blank check by some scholars and resort was had to companion words like night or attachmenttosolitude in order to give it its full value
But it may be pointed out that the word eka enjoyed a privileged position in the terminology of the Paali canon as a symbol of great significance for those of an ascetic temperament
It bore little ambiguity for them as it had all the connotations that go with the ascetic idealization of solitude
For them apparently there was no monotony in the word eka and hence we find it ringing through the Khaggavisaana Sutta in the refrain eko care khaggavisaanakappo
The Muni Sutta too uses the word in connection with this faringalone ekam carantam munim appamattam
It also occurs as many as six times in the verses of the venerable Ekavihaariya
To be alone without a second in the depth of the forest was the longing of his heart and for this he had won the approbation of the Buddha in the following verse
The semantic difficulties in connection with the word eka having been surmounted we may now pass on to a discussion of its relation to the following word ratta
The expression ekaratta was traditionally interpreted to mean one night due to a rather superficial connection with the compound ahorattam as has been pointed out by the Venerable aanamoli
Enough has been said by him and by IB
Horner to show that there is little justification for such an interpretation
Venerable aanamoli rightly suggests as an alternative that ratta might be a derivation from Vranj  to desire to lust to get attached
His hesitation to follow up the full implications of his hypothesis might have been due to the difficulties he encountered in regard to the word eka
Now that this word has revealed its significance we can proceed to appreciate the clues he had given at their full value
The loveofsolitude was reckoned a type of profitable craving  if one may use that expression prudently
For instance we get an express sanction for such an attachment or delight in the Naalaka Sutta
Ekaasanassa sikkhetha  samanupaasanassa ca ekattam monamakkhaatam  eko ce abhiramissati atha bhaasiti dasa disaa
Let one train oneself in sitting alone and in the resort proper to a recluse
Oneness is called sageship and if you will delight in being alone then you will illuminate the ten quarters
Or again we find in the Saariputta Sutta the word rati used in the qualified sense referred to above in connection with the Buddha's love of solitude and renunciation
All this evidence would go to show that ekaratto in bhaddekaratto meant the one attached to solitude in other words the lover of solitude We are now left with the adjective bhadda
As already mentioned in the discussion of the Theranaamo Sutta mere being alone physically is not the beall of the concept of solitude advocated by the Buddha
It may be recalled that he was reserved in his remarks on the Thera's description of his daily routine and that he proceeded to teach him the manner in which lonedwelling is perfected in all its detail
One can also compare in this respect the Migajaala Sutta where he defines the two terms ekavihaari and sadutiyavihaarii
There are Migajaala forms cognizable by the eye desirable pleasant agreeable delightful connected with sensepleasures and alluring
Supposing a monk delights in them asserts them clings to them then even as he delights in asserts and clings to them there arises delight
When there is delight he is lustful and when he is lustful there is bondage
A monk who is fettered by the fetter of delight Migajaala is called Onewhodwellswithasecond
Having made a similar pronouncement in respect of the objects of the other senses he sums up in the following words
A monk thus dwelling Migajaala even though he may resort to remote lodgings in the forest where there is little sound little noise which are deserted of people and where one can remain undisturbed by men  lodgings fit for meditative seclusion  still he is called onewhodwellswithasecond And why so
Because craving is his second and that is not abandoned by him
Hence he is called onewhodwellswithasecond
The lonedweller is then defined as the monk who does not delight in assert or cling to the objects of the six senses and is thus free from bondage to the fetter of delight
The Buddha's summingup in this case is no less forceful than his concluding remark in the Naagita Sutta  the contradiction between them being only apparent when examined within context
A monk thus dwelling Migajaala even though he may be dwelling in the village in the midst of monks nuns male and female lay followers kings royal ministers teachers and disciples of other sects  still he is called a lonedweller And why so
Because craving is his second and that is abandoned by him
Hence is he called lonedweller
The ideal type of solitude advocated by the two suttas is also the theme of the Bhaddekaratta suttas
There the summary and the exposition concern the Bhaddekaratto whom we may now identify as the ideal lover of solitude The distinction made by the Buddha between mere physical solitude and the ideal type of spiritual solitude would amply justify the use of the epithet bhadda in fact the concluding verse of the summary attributes the compliment to the Buddha himself
The significance of the title however is not the sole point of interest in the Bhaddekaratta Sutta
Both the summary and the exposition despite their brevity can well afford to represent the essence of the Dhamma in all its depth and significance
There is for instance in the summary the pair of difficult terms asamhiramasamkuppam with a significance of its own
But these points will be dealt with in the Notes since they could best be appreciated in the light of the sutta itself
Thus have I heard At one time the Exalted one was living at Saavatthi in the Jeta Grove Anaathapindika's monastery
There he addressed the monks thus Monks Revered one the monks answered the Exalted One in assent
The Exalted one spoke thus Monks I shall preach to you the summary and the exposition of the Ideal Lover of Solitude
Listen and give attention
I shall speak Even so revered sir the monks answered the Exalted One in assent
The Exalted One said this
And how monks does one trace back the past
He thinks 'I was of such form in the past' and brings delight to bear on it
He thinks 'I was of such feeling in the past' and brings delight to bear on it
He thinks 'I was of such perception in the past' and brings delight to bear on it
He thinks 'I was of such formations in the past' and brings delight to bear on them
He thinks 'I was of such consciousness in the past' and brings delight to bear on it
That is how monks one traces back the past
And how monks does one not trace back the past
He thinks 'I was of such form in the past' but brings no delight to bear on it
He thinks 'I was of such feeling of such perception of such formations' He thinks 'I was of such consciousness in the past' but brings no delight to bear on it
That is how monks one does not trace back the past
And how monks does one yearn for the future
He thinks 'I may have such form in the future' and brings delight to bear on it
He thinks 'I may have such feeling such perception such formations' He thinks 'I may have such consciousness in the future' and brings delight to bear on it
That is how monks one yearns for the future
And how monks does one not yearn for the future
He thinks 'I may have such form in the future' but brings no delight to bear on it
He thinks 'I may have such feeling such perception such formations' He thinks 'I may have such consciousness in the future' but brings no delight to bear on it
That is how monks one does not yearn for the future
And how is one drawn into present things
Herein monks an uninstructed ordinary man who takes no account of the Noble Ones is unskilled in the Dhamma of the Noble Ones untrained in the Dhamma of the Noble Ones taking no account of the good men unskilled in the Dhamma of the good men untrained in the Dhamma of the good men looks upon form as self or self as possessed of form or form as in self or self as in form
He looks upon feeling as self or self as possessed of feeling or feeling as in self or self as in feeling
He looks upon perception as self or self as possessed of perception or perception as in self or self as in perception
He looks upon formations as self or self as possessed of formations or formations as in self or self as in formations
He looks upon consciousness as self or self as possessed of consciousness or consciousness as in self or self as in consciousness
That is how monks one is drawn into present things
And how monks is one not drawn into present things
Herein monks an instructed Noble disciple who takes into account the Noble Ones skilled in the Dhamma of the Noble Ones trained in the Dhamma of the Noble Ones taking into account the good men skilled in the Dhamma of the good men trained in the Dhamma of the good men does not look upon form as self or self as possessed of form or form as in self or self as in form
He does not look upon feeling as self He does not look upon perception as self He does not look upon formations as self He does not look upon consciousness as self or self as possessed of consciousness or consciousness as in self or self as in consciousness
That is how monks one is not drawn into present things
So it was with reference to this that it was said Monks I shall preach to you the summary and the exposition of the Ideal Lover of Solitude
Thus spoke the Exalted One Delighted those monks rejoiced in what the Exalted One had said
In regard to that summary friends that the Exalted One recited in brief but the meaning of which he had not expounded in detail when he rose from his seat and went into his dwelling
Of this summary that was recited by the Exalted One in brief but the meaning of which he did not expound in detail I friends understand the detailed meaning thus
And how friends does one trace back the past
He thinks 'Such was my eye in the past such were forms' and his consciousness is bound fast there by desireandlust
Because his consciousness is bound fast with desireandlust he delights in it delighting in it he traces back the past
He thinks 'Such was my ear in the past such were sounds such was my nose in the past such were smells such was my tongue in the past such were flavors such was my body in the past such were tangibles such was my mind in the past such were ideas' and his consciousness is bound fast there by desireandlust
Because his consciousness is bound fast by desireandlust he delights in it delighting in it he traces back the past
That is how friends one traces back the past
And how friends does one not trace back the past
He thinks 'Such was my eye in the past such were forms' but without his consciousness being bound fast there by desireandlust
Because his consciousness is not bound fast by desireandlust he does not delight in it not delighting in it he does not trace back the past
He thinks 'Such was my ear in the past such were sounds' 'nose smells' ' tongue flavors' 'body tangibles' 'Such was my mind in the past such were ideas' but without his consciousness being bound fast there by desireandlust
Because his consciousness is not bound fast by desireandlust he does not delight in it not delighting in it he does not trace back the past
That is how friends one does not trace back the past
And how friends does one yearn for the future
He thinks 'My eye may be such in the future forms such' and sets his heart on obtaining what is not yet obtained because he so sets his heart he delights in that delighting in that he yearns for the future
He thinks 'My ear may be such in the future sounds such' 'My nose' 'My tongue' 'My body' He thinks 'My mind may be such in the future ideas such' and sets his heart on obtaining what is not yet obtained because he so sets his heart he delights in that delighting in that he yearns for the future
That is how friends one yearns for the future
And how friends does one not yearn for the future
He thinks 'My eye may be such in the future forms such' but does not set his heart on obtaining what is not yet obtained because he does not so set his heart he does not delight in that not delighting in that he does not yearn for the future
He thinks 'My ear My nose My tongue My body My mind may be such in the future ideas such' but does not set his heart on obtaining what is not yet obtained because he does not so set his heart he does not delight in that not delighting in that he does not yearn for the future
That is how friends one does not yearn for the future
And how friends is one drawn into present things
Whatever eye and forms there are friends both these are present and to that which is present his consciousness is bound fast by desireandlust because his consciousness is bound fast by desireandlust he delights in that delighting in that he is drawn into present things
Whatever ear and sounds nose and smells tongue and flavors body and tangibles Whatever mind and ideas there are friends both these are present and to that which is present his consciousness is bound fast by desireandlust because his consciousness is bound fast by desireandlust he delights in that delighting in that he is drawn into present things
That is how friends one is drawn into present things
And how friends is one not drawn into present things
Whatever eye and forms there are friends both these are present and to that which is present his consciousness is not bound fast by desireandlust because his consciousness is not bound fast by desireandlust he does not delight in that not delighting in that he is not drawn into present things
Whatever ear and sounds nose and smells tongue and flavors body and tangibles whatever mind and ideas there are friends both these are present and to that which is present his consciousness is not bound fast by desireandlust because his consciousness is not bound fast by desireandlust he does not delight in that not delighting in that he is not drawn into present things
That is how friends one is not drawn into present things
In regard to that summary friends that the Exalted One recited in brief but the meaning of which he had not expounded in detail when he rose from his seat and went in to his dwelling
Of this summary that was recited by the Exalted One in brief but the meaning of which he did not expound in detail I friends understand the detailed meaning thus
This phrase helps us to understand the significance of the Buddha's constant advice to letgo the past
The exposition clearly reveals that it is not so much the mere recollection of the past that is the bondage as the element of delight or desireandlust one finds therein
It is the tendency to retrace revive relive and relish the past that has to be eliminated and hence there comes in the necessity of detachment even with regard to thought processes
There is however a notion in some philosophers  notably in Krishnamurthy  that it is the faculty of memory as such that is to be blamed for man's psychological bondage
In an attempt to die to the past he seems to regard memory as the villainofthepiece and advocate its obliteration while stressing the necessity of awareness
This contrasts with the Buddhist approach inasmuch as sati which is a term for awareness or mindfulness is also the usual term for memory Thus one comes across the following standard definition of satindriya in the Paali canon
And what monks is the faculty of mindfulness
Herein monks a noble disciple is mindful and is endowed with the highest prudence in mindfulness he is one who remembers and recollects even what is done or said long ago
This monks is called the faculty of mindfulness
This recognition of the essential relationship between mindfulness and memory is understandable since the keenness of the one naturally leads to the clarity of the other
The denial of its rightful place to the faculty of memory in the complex scheme of mental functions might even give rise to a schizophrenic condition
The noble disciple therefore would not unscrupulously contradict himself or claim to have forgotten what he has said and done earlier on the flimsy ground of his devotion to the practice of momenttomoment awareness On the contrary he might without inhibition even develop his faculty of memory to such a degree that he could recollect his past lives and experiences in all their major and minor details
What he aims at by his diligent practice of mindfulness is mastery over the pathways of thought currents as the concluding lines of Vitakkasanthaana Sutta of the Majjhima Nikaaya make it clear
This monk is called monks a master of the pathways of thought modes and whatever thought he wishes to think that he thinks whatever thought he does not wish to think that he does not think
He has cut off craving turned back the fetter and by fully understanding conceit put an end to Ill
The most distinctive feature of the Buddha's solution to the intricate problem of mindfulness and memory is the emphasis on detachment
The elimination of the element of delight was the essential condition to be fulfilled and to this end he oriented his exhortations to the monks so that often the finale turns out to be Impermanent O monks are formations
Unstable O Monks are formations
Unsatisfying O monks are formations so much so monks that this is enough for one to turn away from all formations enough to get detached from them enough to seek release from them The theme of impermanence runs even through his contemplation of mountains and rivers which for the average man offer beautiful landscapes and lasting landmarks
Indeed this emphasis on utter detachment based on the contemplation of universal impermanence is not so marked in other systems of thought purporting to solve the above problem even in Krishnamurthy too much stress is laid for instance on the beauty of marvelous mountains trees rivers and sunsets
It is also significant that the Buddhist scheme of mindtraining while recognizing the role of mindfulness or awareness in the field of senserestraint assigns the function of transcendence to the faculty of wisdom
As such it does not find itself in the awkward position of being antimemory and proawareness Though sati is helpful in temporarily stemming the swift currents of craving flowing in through the six sensedoors the ultimate deliverance of the mind is a matter for the penetrative faculty of pannaa  whetted as it were on the three signata
Pannaa is the dam wherefrom all currents turn back
As in case of the past so with regard to future too it is the delight or desireandlust that gives rise to yearning or anxiety
The aspiration for acquisition is the condition for delight in this case and in being delighted one is yearning for the future
A simple expression of choice and wish in regard to future courses of action in the everyday life of the arahant is not altogether denied
But it is the attitude which makes all the difference between such expressions and the hankerings and forebodings of a worldling relating to an uncertain future
The arahant as his epithet taadi suggests is endowed with the highest adaptability and resilience due to his penetration into suchness
For him anxiety and yearning with their corollaries vexation and disappointment simply do not exist
If he does get anything he thinks It is well and if he does not get anything then also he thinks It is good In both circumstances he is such and he turns back like one who went up to a tree
The stable and steady nature of the emancipated mind is indicated by these two terms
Together they form an epithet of Nibbaana that might be of interest to the student of psychology and ethics in particular
Though it does not occur in the canonical list of epithets of Nibbaana it is represented there by the term dhuvam
Its significance however lies mainly in the nuances it conveys through the twin terms
Asamhiira is a word often used in the Paali canon to enhance the sense of stability conveyed by a positive term such as thito or cheko
The immovability the irremovability the ability to stand one's ground are some of the shades of meaning associated with the word
Hence samhiirati when used in the positive sense as in the prose section of the sutta would suggest the tendency to get attracted enticed or drawn into
In this specific context the twenty types of personalityview are interpreted as so many ways of being drawn into involvement in regard to present phenomena
By contrast therefore asamhiram in its reference to Nibbaana seems to emphasize the total absence of lust or attachment in that state of supreme mental repose
Asamkuppam too basically carries with it overtones of stability since the gerundive kuppa has such meanings as movable shakable excitable irritable Not infrequently the verb kuppati is used with little or no emotional coloring mostly with reference to the behavior of inanimate things and then it is simply disturbance or shaking But in the context of mental states it is often associated with the impulses of irritation or anger particularly when prefixed with sam
And here too the same nuances are evident
The stability of Nibbaana as a psychological state is as much due to the absence of repulsion as to that of attraction
Out of the three roots of evil  greed hate and delusion  the first two indicate the polarization of those psychological forces known as formations
Formations themselves spring from delusion or ignorance which manifests itself primarily as personalityviews
Herein monks the uninstructed ordinary man looks upon form as self
That very 'looking upon' monks is a formation 
In normal perception it obtains as attention which as a rule is impelled by desire or interest
The world of discrete objects over which the range of perception extends is the result of this beam of attention switched on as it were by interest
All phenomena friends are rooted in desire all phenomena are born of attention all phenomena arise from contact
The keener the interest the keener the attention and both these factors introduce a certain degree of tension into the perceptual situation whereby all other relative distractions are forcibly ignored This tension force stress or strain involved in the process renders all perception more or less artificial and synthetic
Even in the most elementary form of perception ignorance and craving are already implicit
But what is the cause the arising the origin and the source of that formation
To the uninstructed ordinary man touched by a feeling born of 'ignorancecontact' monks there arises craving born thereof is that formation
Thus monks even that formation is impermanent compounded dependently arisen
That feeling tooThat contact too That ignorance too is impermanent compounded dependently arisen
In the very act of attending perception becomes blighted with an artificiality which estranges one from reality
Since it is the formations themselves that are revealed in senseperception as attitudes of greed and hatred delusion as the seedbed of formations may rightly be regarded as the apex which sustains both types of attitudes
This shows that in order to transcend the above polarization delusion too must be eliminated together with the formations springing therefrom
The two terms in our epithet apparently do not say anything about this tertiumquid but it is already implicit in them as we have shown above
As such the epithet may be said to refer to that paradoxical samaadhi peculiar to Buddhas and Arahants which is known as aanantarika or arahattaphala samaadhi
Some salient features of this concentration find mention in the following canonical passages
Monks in such a manner should a monk examine that his consciousness will  while thus examining  neither be distracted or dissipated outwardly nor be established inwardly and not grasping he would not be vexed
When monks one's consciousness is neither distracted nor dissipated outwardly nor established inwardly and when he grasping naught is not vexed there will be no arising or origination again of birth decay death and suffering
Sister that particular concentration which is neither turnedtoward nor turnedoutward which is not a form of restraint forcibly held in place by formations  a concentration which is stable owing to the fact of emancipation and is one of contentment owing to its stability wherein owing to contentment one is not vexed  that concentration sister has been made known by the Lord as that which has knowledge as its fruit
One can form an idea of the range of meaning covered by the terms asamhiram and asamkuppam in the context of these two passages
The reference to a nonestablishment of consciousness inwardly would readily call to mind the definition of samhiirati in the Bhaddekaratta Sutta in terms of the twenty types of personalityviews while the expression neither turned toward suggests the absence of an introvert attitude which is not totally unrelated to the nuances of the term in question
Similarly the phrase  his consciousness will neither be distracted or dissipated outwardly and the expression nor turned outward have much in common with asamkuppam though they stress in particular the absence of an extreme extrovert attitude
The negation of the aforementioned tertiumquid finds expression in these two passages in the words not grasping he would not be vexed and perhaps more clearly in the rather unwieldy compound which we sought to render by  which is not a form of restraint forcibly held in place by formations
This latter expression seems to suggest by contrast that any makeshift compromise between the two extremes of attraction and repulsion of sympathy and antipathy of settling and distraction  such as obtain in any worldly type of concentration  is necessarily accompanied by mental synergies or formations
These formations exercise such a rigorous control over the concentration so much so that it might be called a state of pentup tension or stress however subtle it may appear
Hence like all other phenomena which partake of a concocted and compound character worldly concentration even at its best can yield only a peacedependentonirritability
That extraordinary concentration of the arahant however has eliminated even this tertiumquid by the utter appeasement of all formations and is therefore known as the unexcitable deliverance of the mind
The appeasement of mental formations is accompanied by the relinquishment of all assets or substrata which arrest and sustain attention
Yet this paradoxical concentration does not lapse into a dull lethargy since it has as its quasiobject of attention the very Nibbaanic peace of the cessation of formations
For instance at A V one finds the Buddha giving the following explanation in response to Venerable AAnanda's query concerning the possibility and nature of such a concentration
Herein AAnanda a monk attends thus This is peace this is excellent that is to say the appeasement of all formations the relinquishment of all assets the destruction of craving dispassion cessation Nibbaana Thus is it AAnanda that there could be such an attainment of concentration for a monk in which he would not attend to the eye nor to a form nor to the ear nor to a sound nor to the nose nor to a smell nor to the tongue nor to a flavor nor to the body nor to a tangible nor to earth nor to water nor to fire nor to air nor to the sphere of infinity of space nor to the sphere of infinity of consciousness nor to the sphere of nothingness nor to the sphere of neitherperceptionnornonperception nor to this world nor to a world beyond
And whatever is seen heard sensed cognized attained sought after and traversed by the mind even to that he does not attend
But nevertheless he does attend
Transcending all polarities characteristic of the phenomenal consciousness the emancipated one thus attains to the highest possible state of mental equilibrium which is immovable and nonirritable and in which he meditates as it were thoughtless
That pure concentration which the Supremely Awakened One extolled and which they call Immediacy  a concentration comparable to that there does not exist
The significance of the term anantarika as applied to this unique samaadhi could best be illustrated by the following utterance of Venerable AAnanda
While seeing in whatever manner friend there comes to be the immediate destruction of influxes  that is the highest seeing
While hearing in whatever manner there comes to be the immediate destruction of influxes  that is the highest hearing
While being happy in whatever way there comes to be the immediate destruction of influxes  that is the highest happiness
While perceiving in whatever manner there comes to be the immediate destruction of influxes  that is the highest perception
Being in whatever state there comes to be the immediate destruction of influxes  that is the highest existence

One day into the temple premises where Kapuri the sheelephant the wise tortoise and the peacock lived there arrived a workworn bull
Kapuri saw him seated in the middle of the temple grounds behind the monks' quarters looking as though he were weighed down by a world of sorrow
When Kapuri's mahout tied her to the accustomed jak tree after her day's work and went away leaving a heap of kitul palms for her to munch on Kapuri cast several thoughtful glances in the direction of the bull
He was seated close by looking like a dejected sack of bones that had been carelessly deposited on the ground
Friend from what part of the country have you come
Are you staying here long Kapuri asked him
The bull lifted his head and shook it to get rid of the flies and fleas swarming about him
I came from a place not far from here
My owner brought me and wanted the chief monk to keep me here for a while
I suppose my owner wants me to get fattened up on the temple grass so he can get more work out of me
Your owner sounds rather unkind
The bull let out a long low moan that vibrated with deep emotion
Friend if you knew how I have suffered he said bitterly
Tell me Kapuri urged him kindly
To begin with my owner a carter was very kind to me
But after he got married and the children came one after the other he started to neglect me
Like how
Well for instance he used to give me less and less food
I didn't mind that because he made up for it by being extra kind
When I had to drag a load of metal or sand or brick to a distant place from early dawn until the late afternoon he used to sing sad carters' songs more to alleviate my suffering than to entertain himself
However he expected me to do the same amount of work as I did before
As you know dragging a cartload of metal or brick up hilly roads under a scorching sun is no joke
Once I remember how I began to foam at the mouth and pant furiously
Then my head began to turn round and round and everything became dark and very silent
For a moment I had no idea what had happened until I felt a stinging cut on my hide
When I came to my owner was beating me with a stick and I found that I had fallen on my knees
I hastily got to my feet but even then my owner went on giving me beatings and earbashing tirades as though he had lost all control of himself until we reached our destination
I was extremely shaken by his treatment of me
That was how your owner's concern for you his anxiety for his livelihood and his guilt at exploiting you were expressing themselves
The bull paused and considered this statement
Maybe so he said and began to ward off flies and fleas again by shaking his head twitching his hide and flicking his tail
The bells round his neck jangled
He got up and slowly walked up to a coconut tree close by and began to rub himself against the coarse bark
So what happened after that incident
Whatever my owner's anger was due to he became more and more unfeeling and unsympathetic toward me
But on my part I continued to look upon him with the same dumb affection and loyalty that I had before
That is not a virtue Kapuri said quietly
You were merely clinging to your idea of security
To you the carter represented your security
The bull shrugged
Maybe so
Anyway gradually my owner began to brazenly disregard my basic needs
One day he brought a bucket not even a third filled with poonac and setting it down before me said aggressively as if giving a bone from his body 'Here take this
That is all there is
Be thankful you are getting even that much
You are far better off than most others' It was his haughty callous manner which hurt me more than anything else
You cannot imagine what a burning started up inside me
As a result I was in such a turmoil within that I hardly knew what I was doing
As this ill treatment went on I began to react The bull ambled away from the coconut tree and settled down again to chew the cud
How did you react if I am not too inquisitive
One day I nearly attacked his wife the bull said
But why his wife
Because I am quite sure she is the cause of his callousness
She was the one who was stiffening his spine to mistreat me
Otherwise my young master would never have become so hardhearted toward me
How can you be so sure
Time and time again I have overheard her bending his ear with complaints against me
She was forever grumbling and complaining about me
Complaining about what
I drop dung all over the compound it seems and as a result the place swarms with flies
Or else she says I am a great expense and a nuisance
She used to urge him to get rid of me and do another job that does not require a bull
Why did she have a knife into you
I don't know
I thought perhaps she was jealous of me
You see in the past I was the carter's trusted friend and constant companion
I suppose she resented that
It could be Kapuri agreed
Some wives are notoriously jealous and possessive of their husbands
I also had heard that
That is why I was very patient with her at the start
I thought if I was very goodtempered and understanding and kind toward her she would get over her dislike and distrust of me but far from that she went on carrying on against me through the years until she had built a solid wall of aversion between herself and me
It used to manifest itself even when I played with the children
Like how
Well you know sometimes I used to chase the children for fun
They knew it was a game
They would run away gleefully from me and return to give me a playful whack on my back
I would then turn around and lowering my head as if to butt them with my horns chase them round and round the garden
Sometimes they would climb on to my back
Once when I was trotting around with a little one on my back led by a bigger one the little one slipped and fell to the ground and began to bawl and cry
His mother came running out picked up the child and scolded me 'You wretched old bull you did that on purpose
I saw what you did you wicked devil' And she ranted on for hours about that accident
On another occasion I remember one child gave me a plantain through the kitchen window and I ate it with great relish and to show my appreciation I held the middle of her small arm in my mouth
Then too the mother saw this and shouted at me and drove me away from the window
I had held the child's arm in my mouth very gently with affection but the carter's wife behaved as if I was trying to eat her child's arm like a plantain
On another occasion one of the children brought me a piece of milkrice on New Year's day
I enjoyed it so much that having eaten it in one gulp I bent my head and placed my horns against the child's belly for fun
I did not use any pressure at all but you should have heard how his mother shouted and carried on
Anyone would have thought I was trying to kill the child
All these incidents were exaggerated and misrepresented to the carter so much so that he also started becoming suspicious and wary of me
It then slowly dawned on me that she would never be happy until she had got rid of me
She simply did not want to break down that wall she had put up between us
So what did you do
I suppose that the best thing would have been to leave them but how could I leave and where could I go
I just had to wait and put up with it and my head was so full of her hurtful barbs and remarks that one day when she brought me a pail of water to drink I kicked it with my hind leg
The rim struck her chin when she was bending down and blood sprang from the cut
You can imagine how she swore at me and how she complained about me to the carter
You shouldn't have done that Kapuri reprimanded the bull gently
That was a mistake
I know but I am only a bull not a saint
When people go to all kinds of lengths to hurt me and mistreat me how can I not react
All the same you shouldn't
Is that possible
Yes
Not reacting is the only way to protect yourself and others
Protect others
Protect them from doing more harm to you and worsening the situation
I suppose you went on reacting
Well yes because you see it came to a point when even the children became suspicious and wary of me as if I was some kind of an ogre or spiteful poisonous snake in their midst
Their behavior used to hurt me very deeply
Then she set them up to taunt me  to pull my tail or pelt stones at me
Once I chased a little fellow in real anger because he aimed a stone at my back with a catapult
I became livid with uncontrolled anger because by that time I had become very jumpy and irritable
Scarcely had I felt the impact of the stone on my rear than I chased the little rascal round and round the garden with all the pentup hurt and anger that had been welling up inside me until he escaped inside the house
That was another mistake you made Kapuri said shaking her head dolefully
You were only giving the carter's wife more ammunition
She would have made capital of it
Next time you do such a thing the carter will surely heed his wife and send you away
I know the bull murmured
You see that was the turning point between the carter and myself
Thereafter he became just as hard as she  abusing me and even beating me
How foolish you have been
And I suppose you reacted to him also
Yes I became stubborn and resentful and he couldn't make me budge for all the beatings in the world
I would bend down my head dig in my heels grit my teeth and wait and wait until he beat me and beat me and beat me till the tears poured down his face and he began to sob
Kapuri shook her head sorrowfully
I am so sad to hear all this she said
I can see the whole cause of it very clearly and you have only added fuel to the fire
Me the bull roared rolling his eyes skyward
All this is done to me and I am the culprit
Why do you say so
Don't you see bull she was your karma from a past birth
Instead of not reacting to her malice you have gone and made more bad karma for yourself and her and your owner
If you had ignored her and overlooked all her venom and wickedness things would not have come to this stage
You should have steeled yourself against her hatred and drawn strength from your virtue
It is in such a situation that virtue comes to our aid like a shield
What do you mean by virtue
Do you mean the Five Precepts
Yes but in the deepest sense
I mean selfrestraint in all things beginning with thoughts
By being grateful for whatever little food you received and the shelter and kindness you got you would have stored up good karma and thereby slowly worked out the effects of your past bad karma
You are expecting an impossible standard of behavior from a mere bovine creature like me
I can only think of food sleep and respite from fleas and flies and of course kindness from those around me
You have to raise yourself from that bovine level with much effort if you are to free yourself from the bonds of suffering
The bull looked down at the ground somewhat shamefacedly
If only my owner continued to be kind to me I would not have reacted he said softly
I was so patient forever so long
What wounded me was my kind master becoming hard and callous and turning against me
Your carter is no different from many young family men Kapuri went on wisely
When a young man takes a wife and brings into the world other mouths to feed he sometimes feels an overriding sense of responsibility for them which blinds him to the needs and sensibilities of others  even those near to him like his employees and his parents
Tell me how to prevent myself from reacting again the bull pleaded abjectly
First tell me how you came to be here Kapuri queried
Well one day without a word my master gave me a lot of fodder to eat and when I became docile and amenable he brought me here
He probably thought the temple atmosphere would have a salutary effect on me not to mention the ample grazing ground
Kapuri considered the statement objectively
Would you go back with him happily if he returns to take you back
'If' the bull slowly turned and looked at Kapuri with a lifted eyebrow
What do you mean 'if'
My dear bull has it not occurred to you that he might not return for you
The bull stood still as if he had been thunderstruck
Well if he doesn't return to take me back he mumbled shakily to tell you the truth I really don't know what I should do
You yourself told me that the carter's wife cannot be changed and that she would never be satisfied until she had got rid of you
Also you have told me how unpleasant conditions are for you
If that is so you should examine very carefully the nature of your attachment to your master  the clinging you have for the socalled security you feel by being with him
You see attachment is capable of giving one an unnecessary amount of anguish
I know the bull agreed
I am realizing it
When the carter used to talk affectionately to me I used to become so happy all my troubles seemed to vanish into thin air
But when he became callous and reduced my meals and spoke to me harshly I would be dashed to the ground into the depths of despair
If he gave me only a little to eat but was kind it would have been enough
I would have been only too ready to accept his poverty and not chafe against it if he only showed a little kindness and concern for my welfare
But he became just as aggressive and overbearing as his wife
I hate them all
I hate everyone and everything the bull suddenly bellowed
Now now my friend restrain yourself
You're letting your frustration overwhelm you
Do you know what is happening to you
You have become a hapless victim of your sense of grievance
It is chasing you round and round in an endless merrygoround
Tell me how to get rid of it  this feeling of violence and hatred in me
It is burning inside like a live coal burning my heart and there is nothing but a milling confusion in my brain
I too felt like that at one time Kapuri said
Friend it will take a long long time for your hurt to heal
But I don't want time to heal me the bull roared rebelliously
I want to heal myself
Good
Then listen carefully to this stanza from the Dhammapada
From affection springs grief
From affection springs fear
For one who is wholly free from affection
There is no grief much less fear
The bull flicked his ears and tail looking perplexed
I would advise you to go and ask the tortoise for more advice Kapuri said gently
He is a sage
He will give you the most efficacious medicine of all with which to heal yourself  also prescribed by the Buddha himself
It is not for nothing that our Buddha was called the Supreme Healer
Where can I find the tortoise
He forages around the hedge once a day for his food
Then you can speak to him
So the following day the bull rummaged through the hedge that bordered the temple ground and finally located the tortoise
Sir I have something to ask you
Am I disturbing you the bull ventured somewhat timidly
No not at all
Do go on and ask me any question you want
Sir my head is on fire
There is a live coal blazing within me
There is so much anguish inside of me poisoning my whole system
I even feel it shooting into the marrow of my bones
I feel miserable
Give me a cure
There is no instant cure the tortoise said slowly looking deep into the bull's red eyes as if to penetrate into the very core of his misery
There is much striving you must do to rid yourself of aversion and attachment and clinging to false security
Begin the practice by purging the mind of all angry thoughts
Cultivate feelings of kindness to all
How
Think of the little acts of kindness done to you during your lifetime for which you are grateful for instance and let that feeling of gratitude grow and expand inside you
Then radiate those thoughts of kindness to all around you
Each time the thoughts of anger and resentment arise be aware of them
Stamp out those living glowing coals till they are ash
Cultivate thoughts of kindness
Be always mindful
Watch your thoughts
As it is said 'Do no evil cultivate good and purify one's mind this is the Teaching of the Buddhas' Is that all
Is that the medicine
That is all
But friend it is not such a simple matter to take the medicine in the prescribed manner
It might require a whole lifetime to learn how to take the medicine but it is worthwhile
Once you free yourself of anger and resentment and hurt  you will feel so free and content
You will experience supreme bliss in this very life itself
Is that truly so
You are not leading me up a garden path
Of course I am not leading you up a garden path
The freedom of mind that is experienced when one has got rid of lust ill will sloth and torpor flurry and worry and doubt is described in the suttas
It is likened to what a man experiences when he has borrowed a loan done business with that capital made a profit and repaid the loan
Then again it is likened to what a man experiences when having been ill he gets well
Also to what a man experiences when having been in prison he is set free or to the feeling of a slave released from slavery
Finally it is likened to what a man experiences when having got lost on a desert road and having been exposed to hunger and much danger he comes to the border of a village and so to safety
Is there no short cut to this safety  to this peace
When you give up clinging to objects of attachment you will experience great freedom
How the bull asked
How do you experience freedom when you give up clinging
You see sense objects are transient and whatever is transient is inherently subject to suffering
So where is the lasting security the lasting pleasure
When you can't obtain those things which you find pleasant there is anguish
When you encounter those things which you find unpleasant there is anguish but when you let go of wanting and not wanting then you experience a sense of great freedom and peace
When one's happiness is not dependent on transient sense objects feelings and emotions but on the peace that comes by letting go that is a happiness worth experiencing
It is beyond all the pleasures known to the mundane world
So I am to give up my attachment to my master  to food and all that
Don't cling to them as if they are the beall and endall of your life
Be satisfied with little
Be at peace with yourself and everyone and everything around you
Be at peace with my master's wife and her contemptuous remarks
How do I do that the bull asked with a skeptical laugh
How do I achieve that
Bull for heaven's sake give up your clinging to aversion the tortoise said with mild severity
You are hugging your hurts to yourself and nursing grudges as if they were your most precious treasures
The carter's wife hurts you with her remarks  so what
Forget them
Give them up
See how free and liberated you will feel when you give up hurt and grudge without hanging on to them for dear life
But how do I do that
Tell me the secret  the technique
All I know is that when a hurtful barb is let off at me with not a little venom it hurts
It really hurts like an arrow shot through my heart and I feel my whole frame shaking visibly from the impact
Now how do I pretend it didn't happen
How do I pretend nothing hit me
Don't pretend
Strive to master your emotions
Bull listen to me well
You cannot achieve that state of peace and calm automatically  you have to strive hard with a technique of meditation
There has to be deep searching within you to know the nature of these hurts to find out why they hurt
You must have pure awareness of the remark without any fancying in your imagination  rushing to probe your memory for similar remarks associating and linking them with past events jumping to conclusions  all that clumsy murky play of thought must be swept aside
Nor should you rush into the future with fears of what the remark implies with regard to your socalled security
You must clearly comprehend not only the nature of the remark but why you react to it the way you do
With this kind of selfexamination you begin to realize little by little that remarks hurt because of your socalled 'ego' notion  the image you have of yourself the image you would like people to have of yourself
In actual fact there is no ego or 'you' only a conglomeration of mental and physical phenomena arising and passing away from moment to moment without a subject to which they are attached
That kind of clear comprehension is possible only when our minds are purified by cultivating mindfulness and concentration
When the mind is purified of defilements then you can focus on these problems and those areas you want to probe
You will then discover with great clarity that there is no self  only transient thoughts feelings emotions  physical and mental phenomena
Seeing and experiencing this truth is the greatest discovery the key to letting go
When your meditation is really advanced you will be able to see this for yourself
You will see that all these phenomena originate not from a single cause but from several related causes and conditions
This is why the suttas say 'Contemplate that the body is not I feelings are not I perceptions are not I mental volitions are not I consciousness is not They are all impermanent
What is impermanent is suffering
What is suffering is not I' There is no 'I' in all this
Once you begin to see this for yourself you learn to let go
You learn not to react
Then you begin to reduce the anguish within you and thereby attain peace
So if my master takes me back and mistreats me again what you are telling me to do is to bear it up without anger or resentment because in actual fact there is no 'I'
My dear friend the tortoise said smiling gently
You asked me for the medicine and I am giving it to you
Take it or leave it
I am only telling you to purify yourself so that you can see things clearly and thereby attain inner calm
Inwardly if you are calm and firm as a post unshakeable by the wind made calm and firm by really seeing and experiencing the insubstantiality of the socalled 'ego'  then giving up clinging is no great problem
And this medicine is guaranteed to give one complete freedom from suffering
It is indeed a lasting cure
It is no patchup job no temporary cure
I give you no mystical medicine that involves the performance of all kinds of elaborate rites and rituals the hocuspocus of magic
The 'magic' of inner transformation is what the Buddha's medicine aims at
And that goal is the complete giving up of clinging  clinging to existence to nonexistence to sense pleasures to aversion to views that giving up of clinging alone brings lasting emancipation from misery
Remember it is better to die happy without anger and ill will than to die unhappy and full of resentment which will take you to rebirth in a place far worse than your present condition
The bull considered this reply frowning flicking his tail and ears and twitching his hide
Presently his forehead uncreased and clear steady light began to shine in his eyes
He nodded his head slowly while chewing the cud
Sir I think I am beginning to understand what you are driving at
Good but to achieve the pure awareness and clear comprehension that are imperative for liberation you must meditate
Live in the present moment all the time
Be aware of your thoughts feelings and emotions
Be truly friendly and gentle toward yourself and by doing that you will be able to project that gentleness and kindness and understanding to others
By this you will be freed from the 'I' notion and experience a common empathy with all that exists
Know your thoughts and emotions for what they are
You will then gradually begin to understand the nature of this complex process which we label 'I' and 'me' and 'mine' Then you will see for yourself that freedom comes when you give up not only the objects of the senses but this grasping of the notion of an ego  the entire grasping of the aggregates which are really empty unsubstantial transitory
Yes I think I am beginning to understand a little now
Certainly I shall do my best to take the medicine  first to purify my mind and cultivate good thoughts and thereby rid myself of attachment and aversion
Thus I will give up clinging to a false sense of security
Very good bull
Very good indeed
It is not easy but if you take the medicine in the prescribed manner you will soon reap the desired results of contentment and total freedom from the vise grip of suffering
Suvimalee Karunaratna was born in Sri Lanka in and received her early education in Washington Dand in Colombo
While living in Rangoon where her father was posted as the Sri Lankan ambassador to Burma from  she received meditation instructions from the Ven
Mahasi Sayadaw and the Ven
Webu Sayadaw
Her first volume of short stories was published in and several of her short stories have appeared in anthologies of modern writing from Sri Lanka as well as in literary journals
She is the author of The Walking Meditation and Prisoners of Karma
The Buddhist Publication Society is an approved charity dedicated to making known the Teaching of the Buddha which has a vital message for people of all creeds
Founded in the BPS has published a wide variety of books and booklets covering a great range of topics
Its publications include accurate annotated translations of the Buddha's discourses standard reference works as well as original contemporary expositions of Buddhist thought and practice
These works present Buddhism as it truly is  a dynamic force which has influenced receptive minds for the past years and is still as relevant today as it was when it first arose
This is a how to book
It teaches the liberation of the mind not as a mindboggling theory but as a very basic skill that starts with keeping the breath in mind
The teachings here are drawn from the works of Ajaan Lee Dhammadharo one of Thailand's most renowned teachers of Buddhist meditation
Ajaan Lee was a forest monk  one who prefers to live in the seclusion of the forest and makes meditation the central theme of his practice  so his teachings grow out of personal practical experience although he also makes a point of relating them to standard Buddhist doctrine
The book is in two parts The first is a basic guide to the techniques of breath meditation  Ajaan Lee's specialty  and gives two methods that he developed at separate points in his career
The second part consists of excerpts from five of his talks dealing with issues that tend to arise in the course of meditation
If you want to begin your practice of meditation immediately and fill in the details later turn to Method
Read over the seven basic steps until you have them firmly in mind and then start meditating
Take care especially at the beginning not to clutter your mind with extraneous ideas or information
Otherwise you might spend too much time looking for things in your meditation and not see what is actually there
The rest of the book can wait until later when you want help with a particular problem or  what is often the same thing  when you want an overall perspective on what you are doing
The purpose of this book is to suggest possibilities to direct your attention to areas you may have overlooked to suggest approaches that otherwise might not have occurred to you
What you actually see is purely an individual matter
Don't try to force things
Don't be worried if you have experiences that aren't covered in the book
Don't be disappointed if you don't have experiences that are
Signs and visions for example Some people experience them others don't
They are an individual matter and not really essential to the meditation
If you experience them learn how to use them wisely
If you don't learn how to use what you do experience
The important point is to keep the basics in mind and to stay observant
Meditation like carpentry sailing or any other skill has its own vocabulary that to the beginner is bound to seem like a code
One of the challenges in using this book will be in breaking its code
Part of the difficulty is that some of the terms are literally foreign They're in Pali the language of the oldest extant Buddhist texts colored by shades of meaning they've picked up from Thai
This problem though is relatively minor
Most of these terms are explained in the text the glossary at the back of the book gives definitions for any that aren't plus additional information on many that are
A greater challenge lies in getting a feel for the author's point of view
In meditation we are dealing with the body and mind as experienced from the inside
Ajaan Lee practiced meditation most of his adult life
He had long experience in viewing the body and mind from that perspective and so it is only natural that his choice of terms should reflect it
For example when he refers to the breath or breath sensations he is speaking not only of the air going in and out of the lungs but also of the way breathing feels from the inside throughout the entire body
Similarly the elements of the body are not the chemical elements
Instead they are elementary feelings  energy warmth liquidity solidity emptiness and consciousness  the way the body presents itself directly to inner awareness
The only way to get past the strangeness of this sort of terminology is to start exploring your own body and mind from the inside and to gain a sense of which terms apply to which of your own personal experiences
Only then will these terms fulfill their intended purpose  as tools for refining your inner sensitivities  for the truth of meditation lies not in understanding the words but in mastering the skill that leads to a direct understanding of awareness itself
You might compare this book to a recipe
If you simply read the recipe you can't  even if you understand all the terms  get any flavor or nourishment from it
If you follow the first few steps and then give up when it starts getting difficult you've wasted your time
But if you follow it all the way you can then set it aside and simply enjoy the results of your own cooking
My hope is that this book will be helpful in your personal exploration into the benefits that come from keeping the breath in mind
This book is a guide to the practice of centering the mind
There are two sections The first deals almost exclusively with the mind
But because the wellbeing of the mind depends to some extent on the body I have included a second section that shows how to use the body to benefit the mind
From what I've observed in my own practice there is only one path that is short easy effective and pleasant and at the same time has hardly anything to lead you astray the path of keeping the breath in mind the same path the Lord Buddha himself used with such good results
I hope that you won't make things difficult for yourself by being hesitant or uncertain by taking this or that teaching from here or there and that instead you'll earnestly set your mind on getting in touch with your own breath and following it as far as it can take you
From there you will enter the stage of liberating insight leading to the mind itself
Ultimately pure knowing  buddha  will stand out on its own
That's when you'll reach an attainment trustworthy and sure
In other words if you let the breath follow its own nature and the mind its own nature the results of your practice will without a doubt be all that you hope for
Ordinarily the nature of the heart if it isn't trained and put into order is to fall in with preoccupations that are stressful and bad
This is why we have to search for a principle  a Dhamma  with which to train ourselves if we hope for happiness that's stable and secure
If our hearts have no inner principle no center in which to dwell we're like a person without a home
Homeless people have nothing but hardship
The sun wind rain and dirt are bound to leave them constantly soiled because they have nothing to act as shelter
To practice centering the mind is to build a home for yourself Momentary concentration is like a house roofed with thatch threshold concentration a house roofed with tile and fixed penetration a house built out of brick
Once you have a home you'll have a safe place to keep your valuables
You won't have to put up with the hardships of watching over them the way a person who has no place to keep his valuables has to go sleeping in the open exposed to the sun and rain to guard those valuables  and even then his valuables aren't really safe
So it is with the uncentered mind It goes searching for good from other areas letting its thoughts wander around in all kinds of concepts and preoccupations
Even if those thoughts are good we still can't say that we're safe
We're like a woman with plenty of jewelry If she dresses up in her jewels and goes wandering around she's not safe at all
Her wealth might even lead to her own death
In the same way if our hearts aren't trained through meditation to gain inner stillness even the virtues we've been able to develop will deteriorate easily because they aren't yet securely stashed away in the heart
To train the mind to attain stillness and peace though is like keeping your valuables in a strongbox
This is why most of us don't get any good from the good we do
We let the mind fall under the sway of its various preoccupations
These preoccupations are our enemies because there are times when they can cause the virtues we've already developed to wither away
The mind is like a blooming flower If wind and insects disturb the flower it may never have a chance to give fruit
The flower here stands for the stillness of the mind on the path the fruit for the happiness of the path's fruition
If our stillness of mind and happiness are constant we have a chance to attain the ultimate good we all hope for
The ultimate good is like the heartwood of a tree
Other goods are like the buds branches and leaves
If we haven't trained our hearts and minds we'll meet with things that are good only on the external level
But if our hearts are pure and good within everything external will follow in becoming good as a result
Just as our hand if it's clean won't soil what it touches but if it's dirty will spoil even the cleanest cloth in the same way if the heart is defiled everything is defiled
Even the good we do will be defiled for the highest power in the world  the sole power giving rise to all good and evil pleasure and pain  is the heart
The heart is like a god
Good evil pleasure and pain come entirely from the heart
We could even call the heart a creator of the world because the peace and continued wellbeing of the world depend on the heart
If the world is to be destroyed it will be because of the heart
So we should train this most important part of the world to be centered as a foundation for its wealth and wellbeing
Centering the mind is a way of gathering together all its skillful potentials
When these potentials are gathered in the right proportions they'll give you the strength you need to destroy your enemies all your defilements and unwise mental states
You have discernment that you've trained and made wise in the ways of good and evil of the world and the Dhamma
Your discernment is like gunpowder
But if you keep your gunpowder for long without putting it into bullets  a centered mind  it'll go damp and moldy
Or if you're careless and let the fires of greed anger or delusion overcome you your gunpowder may flame up in your hands
So don't delay
Put your gunpowder into bullets so that whenever your enemies  your defilements  make an attack you'll be able to shoot them right down
Whoever trains the mind to be centered gains a refuge
A centered mind is like a fortress
Discernment is like a weapon
To practice centering the mind is to secure yourself in a fortress and so is something very worthwhile and important
Virtue the first part of the Path and discernment the last aren't especially difficult
But keeping the mind centered which is the middle part takes some effort because it's a matter of forcing the mind into shape
Admittedly centering the mind like placing bridge pilings in the middle of a river is something difficult to do
But once the mind is firmly in place it can be very useful in developing virtue and discernment
Virtue is like placing pilings on the near shore of the river discernment like placing them on the far shore
But if the middle pilings  a centered mind  aren't firmly in place how will you ever be able to bridge the flood of suffering
There is only one way we can properly reach the qualities of the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha and that's through the practice of mental development
When we develop the mind to be centered and still discernment can arise
Discernment here refers not to ordinary discernment but to the insight that comes solely from dealing directly with the mind
For example the ability to remember past lives to know where living beings are reborn after death and to cleanse the heart of the fermentations of defilement These three forms of intuition  termed ñanacakkhu the eye of the mind  can arise for people who train themselves in the area of the heart and mind
But if we go around searching for knowledge from sights sounds smells tastes and tactile sensations mixed together with concepts it's as if we were studying with the Six Masters and so we can't clearly see the truth  just as the Buddha while he was studying with the Six Masters wasn't able to gain Awakening
He then turned his attention to his own heart and mind and went off to practice on his own keeping track of his breath as his first step and going all the way to the ultimate goal
As long as you're still searching for knowledge from your six senses you're studying with the Six Masters
But when you focus your attention on the breath  which exists in each of us  to the point where the mind settles down and is centered you'll have the chance to meet with the real thing buddha pure knowing
Some people believe that they don't have to practice centering the mind that they can attain release through discernment by working at discernment alone
This simply isn't true
Both release through discernment and release through stillness of mind are based on centering the mind
They differ only in degree
Like walking Ordinarily a person doesn't walk on one leg alone
Whichever leg is heavier is simply a matter of personal habits and traits
Release through discernment begins by pondering various events and aspects of the world until the mind slowly comes to rest and once it's still gives rise intuitively to liberating insight clear and true understanding in terms of the four Noble Truths
In release through stillness of mind though there's not much pondering involved
The mind is simply forced to be quiet until it attains the stage of fixed penetration
That's where intuitive insight will arise enabling it to see things for what they are
This is release through stillness of mind Concentration comes first discernment later
A person with a wideranging knowledge of the texts  wellversed in their letter and meaning capable of clearly and correctly explaining various points of doctrine  but with no inner center for the mind is like a pilot flying about in an airplane with a clear view of the clouds and stars but no sense of where the landing strip is
He's headed for trouble
If he flies higher he'll run out of air
All he can do is keep flying around until he runs out of fuel and comes crashing down in the savage wilds
Some people even though they are highly educated are no better than savages in their behavior
This is because they've gotten carried away up in the clouds
Some people  taken with what they feel to be the high level of their own learning ideas and opinions  won't practice centering the mind because they feel it beneath them
They think they deserve to go straight to release through discernment instead
Actually they're heading straight to disaster like the airplane pilot who has lost sight of the landing strip
To practice centering the mind is to build a landing strip for yourself
Then when discernment comes you'll be able to attain release safely
This is why we have to develop all three parts of the path  virtue concentration and discernment  if we want to be complete in our practice of the religion
Otherwise how can we say that we know the four Noble Truths
 because the path to qualify as the Noble Path has to be composed of virtue concentration and discernment
If we don't develop it within ourselves we can't know it
And if we don't know how can we let go
Most of us by and large like getting results but don't like laying the groundwork
We may want nothing but goodness and purity but if we haven't completed the groundwork we'll have to keep on being poor
Like people who are fond of money but not of work How can they be good solid citizens
When they feel the pinch of poverty they'll turn to corruption and crime
In the same way if we aim at results in the field of the religion but don't like doing the work we'll have to continue being poor
And as long as our hearts are poor we're bound to go searching for goodness in other areas  greed gain status pleasure and praise the baits of the world  even though we know better
This is because we don't truly know which means simply that we aren't true in what we do
The truth of the path is always true Virtue is something true concentration is true discernment is true release is true
But if we aren't true we won't meet with anything true
If we aren't true in practicing virtue concentration and discernment we'll end up only with things that are fake and imitation
And when we make use of things fake and imitation we're headed for trouble
So we have to be true in our hearts
When our hearts are true we'll come to savor the taste of the Dhamma a taste surpassing all the tastes of the world
This is why I have put together the following two guides for keeping the breath in mind
Now I will explain how to go about the practice of centering the mind
Before starting out kneel down with your hands palmtopalm in front of your heart and sincerely pay respect to the Triple Gem saying as follows
Then showing respect with your thoughts words and deeds pay homage to the Buddha
And take refuge in the Triple Gem
Then make the following resolution I take refuge in the Buddha  the Pure One completely free from defilement and in his Dhamma  doctrine practice and attainment and in the Sangha  the four levels of his Noble Disciples  from now to the end of my life
Then formulate the intention to observe the five eight ten or precepts according to how many you are normally able to observe expressing them in a single vow
Now that you have professed the purity of your thoughts words and deeds toward the qualities of the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha bow down three times
Sit down place your hands palmtopalm in front of your heart steady your thoughts and develop the four Sublime Attitudes good will compassion appreciation and equanimity
To spread these thoughts to all living beings without exception is called the immeasurable Sublime Attitude
A short Pali formula for those who have trouble memorizing is
Sit in a halflotus position right leg on top of the left leg your hands placed palmup on your lap right hand on top of the left
Keep your body straight and your mind on the task before you
Raise your hands in respect palmtopalm in front of the heart and think of the qualities of the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha Buddho me natho  The Buddha is my mainstay
Dhammo me natho  The Dhamma is my mainstay
Sangho me natho  The Sangha is my mainstay
Then repeat in your mind buddho buddho dhammo dhammo sangho sangho
Return your hands to your lap and repeat one word buddho three times in your mind
Then think of the inandout breath counting the breaths in pairs
First think bud with the inbreath dho with the out ten times
Then begin again thinking buddho with the inbreath buddho with the out seven times
Then begin again As the breath goes in and out once think buddho once five times
Then begin again As the breath goes in and out once think buddho three times
Do this for three inandout breaths
Now you can stop counting the breaths and simply think bud with the inbreath and dho with the out
Let the breath be relaxed and natural
Keep your mind perfectly still focused on the breath as it comes in and out of the nostrils
When the breath goes out don't send the mind out after it
When the breath comes in don't let the mind follow it in
Let your awareness be broad cheerful and open
Don't force the mind too much
Relax
Pretend that you're breathing out in the wide open air
Keep the mind still like a post at the edge of the sea
When the water rises the post doesn't rise with it when the water ebbs the post doesn't sink
When you've reached this level of stillness you can stop thinking buddho
Simply be aware of the feeling of the breath
Then slowly bring your attention inward focusing it on the various aspects of the breath  the important aspects that can give rise to intuitive powers of various kinds clairvoyance clairaudience the ability to know the minds of others the ability to remember previous lives the ability to know where different people and animals are reborn after death and knowledge of the various elements or potentials that are connected with and can be of use to the body
These elements come from the bases of the breath
The First Base Center the mind on the tip of the nose and then slowly move it to the middle of the forehead The Second Base
Keep your awareness broad
Let the mind rest for a moment at the forehead and then bring it back to the nose
Keep moving it back and forth between the nose and the forehead  like a person climbing up and down a mountain  seven times
Then let it settle at the forehead
Don't let it go back to the nose
From here let it move to The Third Base the middle of the top of the head and let it settle there for a moment
Keep your awareness broad
Inhale the breath at that spot let it spread throughout the head for a moment and then return the mind to the middle of the forehead
Move the mind back and forth between the forehead and the top of the head seven times finally letting it rest on the top of the head
Then bring it into The Fourth Base the middle of the brain
Let it be still for a moment and then bring it back out to the top of the head
Keep moving it back and forth between these two spots finally letting it settle in the middle of the brain
Keep your awareness broad
Let the refined breath in the brain spread to the lower parts of the body
When you reach this point you may find that the breath starts giving rise to various signs such as seeing or feeling hot cold or tingling sensations in the head
You may see a pale murky vapor or your own skull
Even so don't let yourself be affected by whatever appears
If you don't want the nimitta to appear breathe deep and long down into the heart and it will immediately go away
When you see that a nimitta has appeared mindfully focus your awareness on it  but be sure to focus on only one at a time choosing whichever one is most comfortable
Once you've got hold of it expand it so that it's as large as your head
The bright white nimitta is useful to the body and mind It's a pure breath that can cleanse the blood in the body reducing or eliminating feelings of physical pain
When you have this white light as large as the head bring it down to The Fifth Base the center of the chest
Once it's firmly settled let it spread out to fill the chest
Make this breath as white and as bright as possible and then let both the breath and the light spread throughout the body out to every pore until different parts of the body appear on their own as pictures
If you don't want the pictures take two or three long breaths and they'll disappear
Keep your awareness still and expansive
Don't let it latch onto or be affected by any nimitta that may happen to pass into the brightness of the breath
Keep careful watch over the mind
Keep it one
Keep it intent on a single preoccupation the refined breath letting this refined breath suffuse the entire body
When you've reached this point knowledge will gradually begin to unfold
The body will be light like fluff
The mind will be rested and refreshed  supple solitary and selfcontained
There will be an extreme sense of physical pleasure and mental ease
If you want to acquire knowledge and skill practice these steps until you're adept at entering leaving and staying in place
When you've mastered them you'll be able to give rise to the nimitta of the breath  the brilliantly white ball or lump of light  whenever you want
When you want knowledge simply make the mind still and let go of all preoccupations leaving just the brightness and emptiness
Think one or two times of whatever you want to know  of things inside or outside concerning yourself or others  and the knowledge will arise or a mental picture will appear
To become thoroughly expert you should if possible study directly with someone who has practiced and is skilled in these matters because knowledge of this sort can come only from the practice of centering the mind
The knowledge that comes from centering the mind falls into two classes mundane and transcendent
With mundane knowledge you're attached to your knowledge and views on the one hand and to the things that appear and give rise to your knowledge on the other
Your knowledge and the things that give you knowledge through the power of your skill are composed of true and false mixed together  but the true here is true simply on the level of mental fabrication and anything fabricated is by nature changeable unstable and inconstant
So when you want to go on to the transcendent level gather all the things you know and see into a single preoccupation  ekaggatarammana the singleness of mental absorption  and see that they are all of the same nature
Take all your knowledge and awareness and gather it into the same point until you can clearly see the truth that all of these things by their nature simply arise and pass away
Don't try to latch onto the things you know  your preoccupations  as yours
Don't try to latch onto the knowledge that has come from within you as your own
Let these things be in line with their own inherent nature
If you latch onto your preoccupations you're latching onto stress and pain
If you hold onto your knowledge it will turn into the cause of stress
So A mind centered and still gives rise to knowledge
This knowledge is the path
All of the things that come passing by for you to know are stress
Don't let the mind fasten onto its knowledge
Don't let it fasten onto the preoccupations that appear for you to know
Let them be in line with their nature
Put your mind at ease
Don't fasten onto the mind or suppose it to be this or that
As long as you suppose yourself you're suffering from obscured awareness
When you can truly know this the transcendent will arise within you  the noblest good the most exalted happiness a human being can know
To summarize the basic steps to practice are as follows
Make the mind dwell on good preoccupations
Gather all good preoccupations into one  the singleness of meditative absorption
Consider this one preoccupation until you see how it is aniccam inconstant dukkham stressful and anatta not yourself or anyone else  empty and void
Let all good and bad preoccupations follow their own nature  because good and bad dwell together and are equal by nature
Let the mind follow its own nature
Let knowing follow its own nature
Knowing doesn't arise and it doesn't fall away
This is santidhamma  the reality of peace
It knows goodness but the knowing isn't goodness and goodness isn't the knowing
It knows evil but the knowing isn't evil and evil isn't the knowing
In other words knowing isn't attached to knowledge or to the things known
Its nature is truly elemental  flawless and pure like a drop of water on a lotus leaf
This is why it's called asankhatadhatu the unfabricated property a true element
When you can follow these five steps you'll find marvels appearing in your heart the skills and perfections that come from having practiced tranquillity and insight meditation
You'll obtain the two types of results already mentioned
transcendent providing for the wellbeing of your heart bringing happiness that is calm cool and blooming leading all the way to Liberation  free from birth aging illness and death
This has been a brief explanation of the main principles of breath meditation
If you have any questions or encounter any difficulties in putting these principles into practice and you wish to study directly with someone who teaches along these lines I will be happy to help you to the best of my ability so that we can all attain the peace and wellbeing taught by the religion
Most people will find that Method which follows is easier and more relaxing than Method outlined above
There are seven basic steps
Be clearly aware of each inandout breath
Observe the breath as it goes in and out noticing whether it's comfortable or uncomfortable broad or narrow obstructed or freeflowing fast or slow short or long warm or cool
If the breath doesn't feel comfortable adjust it until it does
For instance if breathing in long and out long is uncomfortable try breathing in short and out short
As soon as you find that your breathing feels comfortable let this comfortable breath sensation spread to the different parts of the body
To begin with inhale the breath sensation at the base of the skull and let it flow all the way down the spine
Then if you are male let it spread down your right leg to the sole of your foot to the ends of your toes and out into the air
Inhale the breath sensation at the base of the skull again and let it spread down your spine down your left leg to the ends of your toes and out into the air

Then let the breath from the base of the skull spread down over both shoulders past your elbows and wrists to the tips of your fingers and out into the air
Let the breath at the base of the throat spread down the central nerve at the front of the body past the lungs and liver all the way down to the bladder and colon
Inhale the breath right at the middle of the chest and let it go all the way down to your intestines
Let all these breath sensations spread so that they connect and flow together and you'll feel a greatly improved sense of wellbeing
Learn four ways of adjusting the breath
Breathe whichever way is most comfortable for you
Or better yet learn to breathe comfortably all four ways because your physical condition and your breath are always changing
Become acquainted with the bases or focal points for the mind  the resting spots of the breath  and center your awareness on whichever one seems most comfortable
A few of these bases are
If you suffer from frequent headaches or nervous problems don't focus on any spot above the base of the throat
And don't try to force the breath or put yourself into a trance
Breathe freely and naturally
Let the mind be at ease with the breath  but not to the point where it slips away
Spread your awareness  your sense of conscious feeling  throughout the entire body
Unite the breath sensations throughout the body letting them flow together comfortably keeping your awareness as broad as possible
Once you're fully aware of the aspects of the breath you already know in your body you'll come to know all sorts of other aspects as well
The breath by its nature has many facets breath sensations flowing in the nerves those flowing around and about the nerves those spreading from the nerves to every pore
Beneficial breath sensations and harmful ones are mixed together by their very nature
To summarize for the sake of improving the energy already existing in every part of your body so that you can contend with such things as disease and pain and for the sake of clarifying the knowledge already within you so that it can become a basis for the skills leading to release and purity of heart  you should always bear these seven steps in mind because they are absolutely basic to every aspect of breath meditation
When you've mastered them you will have cut a main road
As for the side roads  the incidentals of breath meditation  there are plenty of them but they aren't really important
You'll be perfectly safe if you stick to these seven steps and practice them as much as possible
Once you've learned to put your breath in order it's as if you have everyone in your home in order
The incidentals of breath meditation are like people outside your home  in other words guests
Once the people in your home are wellbehaved your guests will have to fall in line
The guests here are the signs and vagrant breaths that will tend to pass within the range of the breath you are dealing with the various signs that arise from the breath and may appear as images  bright lights people animals yourself others or as sounds  the voices of people some you recognize and others you don't
In some cases the signs appear as smells  either fragrant or else foul like a corpse
Sometimes the inbreath can make you feel so full throughout the body that you have no sense of hunger or thirst
Sometimes the breath can send warm hot cold or tingling sensations through the body
Sometimes it can cause things that never occurred to you before to spring suddenly to mind
All of these things are classed as guests
Before you go receiving guests you should put your breath and mind into good order making them stable and secure
In receiving these guests you first have to bring them under your control
If you can't control them don't have anything to do with them
They might lead you astray
But if you can put them through their paces they can be of use to you later on
To put them through their paces means to change them at will through the power of thought  making them small large sending them far away bringing them up close making them appear and disappear sending them outside bringing them in
Only then will you be able to use them in training the mind
Once you've mastered these signs they'll give rise to heightened sensory powers the ability to see without opening your eyes the ability to hear fardistant sounds or smell fardistant aromas the ability to taste the various elements that exist in the air and can be of use to the body in overcoming feelings of hunger and desire the ability to give rise to certain feelings at will  to feel cool when you want to feel cool hot when you want to feel hot warm when you want to feel warm strong when you need strength  because the various elements in the world that can be physically useful to you will come and appear in your body
The mind too will be heightened and will have the power to develop the eye of intuition the ability to remember previous lives the ability to know where living beings are reborn after they die and the ability to cleanse the heart of the fermentations of defilement
If you have your wits about you you can receive these guests and put them to work in your home
These are a few of the incidentals of breath meditation
If you come across them in your practice examine them thoroughly
Don't be pleased by what appears
Don't get upset or try to deny what appears
Keep your mind on an even keel
Stay neutral
Be circumspect
Consider carefully whatever appears to see whether it's trustworthy or not
Otherwise it might lead you to mistaken assumptions
Good and evil right and wrong high and low All depend on whether your heart is shrewd or dull and on how resourceful you are
If you're dullwitted even high things can become low and good things evil
Once you know the various aspects of the breath and its incidentals you can gain knowledge of the four Noble Truths
In addition you can relieve physical pains as they arise in your body
Mindfulness is the active ingredient in the medicine the inandout breath is the solvent
Mindfulness can cleanse and purify the breath
A pure breath can cleanse the blood throughout the body and when the blood is cleansed it can relieve many of the body's diseases and pains
If you suffer from nervous disorders for instance they'll completely disappear
What's more you'll be able to strengthen the body so that you feel a greater sense of health and wellbeing
When the body feels well the mind can settle down and rest
And once the mind is rested you gain strength the ability to relieve all feelings of pain while sitting in meditation so that you can go on sitting for hours
When the body is free from pain the mind is free from Hindrances
Body and mind are both strong
This is called samadhibalam  the strength of concentration
When your concentration is strong like this it can give rise to discernment the ability to see stress its cause its disbanding and the path to its disbanding all clearly within the breath
This can be explained as follows
The inandout breath is stress  the inbreath the stress of arising the outbreath the stress of passing away
Not being aware of the breath as it goes in and out not knowing the characteristics of the breath is the cause of stress
Knowing when the breath is coming in knowing when it's going out knowing its characteristics clearly  ie keeping your views in line with the truth of the breath  is Right View part of the Noble Path
Knowing which ways of breathing are uncomfortable knowing how to vary the breath knowing That way of breathing is uncomfortable I'll have to breathe like this in order to feel at ease This is Right Resolve
The mental factors that think about and correctly evaluate all aspects of the breath are Right Speech
Knowing various ways of improving the breath breathing for example in long and out long in short and out short in short and out long in long and out short until you come across the breath most comfortable for you This is Right Action
Knowing how to use the breath to purify the blood how to let this purified blood nourish the heart muscles how to adjust the breath so that it eases the body and soothes the mind how to breathe so that you feel full and refreshed in body and mind This is Right Livelihood
Trying to adjust the breath until it soothes the body and mind and to keep trying as long as you aren't fully at ease is Right Effort
Being mindful and alert to the inandout breath at all times knowing the various aspects of the breath  the upflowing breath the downflowing breath the breath in the stomach the breath in the intestines the breath flowing along the muscles and out to every pore  keeping track of these things with every inandout breath This is Right Mindfulness
A mind intent only on issues related to the breath not pulling any other objects in to interfere until the breath is refined giving rise to fixed absorption and then liberating insight right there This is Right Concentration
To think of the breath is termed vitakka directed thought
To adjust the breath and let it spread is called vicara evaluation
When all aspects of the breath flow freely throughout the body you feel full and refreshed in body and mind This is piti rapture
When body and mind are both at rest you feel serene and at ease This is sukha pleasure
And once you feel pleasure the mind is bound to stay snug with a single preoccupation and not go straying after any others This is ekaggatarammana singleness of preoccupation
These five factors form the beginning stage of Right Concentration
When all these parts of the Noble Path  virtue concentration and discernment  are brought together fully mature in the heart you gain insight into all aspects of the breath knowing that Breathing this way gives rise to skillful mental states
Breathing that way gives rise to unskillful mental states You aren't caught up with the factors  the breath in all its aspects  that fabricate the body the factors that fabricate speech the factors that fabricate the mind whether for good or for ill
You let them be in line with their inherent nature This is the disbanding of stress
Another even briefer way to express the four Noble Truths is this The inandout breath is the truth of stress
Not being aware of the inbreath not being aware of the outbreath This is the cause of stress  obscured deluded awareness
Seeing into all aspects of the breath so clearly that you can let them go with no sense of attachment is the disbanding of stress
Being constantly mindful and alert to all aspects of the breath is the path to the disbanding of stress
When you can do this you can say that you're correctly following the path of breath meditation
You have cognitive skill able to know all four Truths clearly
You can attain release
Release is a mind that doesn't cling to low causes and low effects  ie stress and its cause or to high causes and high effects  the disbanding of stress and the path to its disbanding
It's a mind unattached to the things that cause it to know unattached to knowledge unattached to knowing
When you can separate these things you've mastered the skill of release  in other words when you know what forms the beginning what forms the end and what lies in between letting them be as they are on their own in line with the phrase
To be attached to the things that cause us to know  the elements khandhas the senses and their objects  is termed clinging to sensuality
To be attached to knowledge is termed clinging to views
To be unacquainted with pure knowing in and of itself is termed clinging to precepts and procedures
And when we cling in this way we are bound to be deluded by the factors that fabricate the body speech and the mind all of which arise from obscured awareness
The Buddha was a complete master of both cause and effect without being attached either to low causes and low effects or to high causes and high effects
He was above cause and beyond effect
Stress and ease were both at his disposal but he was attached to neither of them
He fully knew both good and evil was fully equipped with both self and notself but wasn't attached to any of these things
He had at his disposal the objects that can act as the basis for the cause of stress but wasn't attached to them
The Path  discernment  was also at his disposal He knew how to appear either ignorant or shrewd and how to use both ignorance and shrewdness in his work of spreading the religion
And as for the disbanding of stress he had it at his disposal but didn't cling to it wasn't attached to it which is why we can truly say that his mastery was complete
Before the Buddha was able to let go of these things in this way he first had to work at giving rise to them in full measure
Only then could he put them aside
He let go from abundance unlike ordinary people who let go out of poverty
Even though he let these things go they were still at his disposal
He never dismissed the virtue concentration and discernment he had worked at perfecting up to the day of his Awakening
He continued using every aspect of virtue concentration and discernment to the day he entered total Liberation
Even the moment he was about to nibbana he was practicing his full command of concentration  in other words his total Liberation occurred when he was between the jhanas of form and formlessness
So we shouldn't dismiss virtue concentration and discernment
Some people won't observe the precepts because they're afraid of getting tied to them
Some people won't practice concentration because they're afraid of becoming ignorant or going insane
The truth of the matter is that normally we're already ignorant already insane and that to practice centering the mind is what will end our ignorance and cure our insanity
Once we've trained ourselves properly we'll give rise to pure discernment like a cut jewel that gives off light by its very nature
This is what qualifies as true discernment
It arises for us individually and is termed paccattam We can give rise to it and know it only for ourselves
Most of us though tend to misunderstand the nature of discernment
We take imitation discernment adulterated with concepts and use it to smother the real thing like a man who coats a piece of glass with mercury so that he can see his reflection and that of others thinking he's found an ingenious way of looking at the truth
Actually he's nothing more than a monkey looking in a mirror One monkey becomes two and will keep playing with its reflection until the mercury wears off at which point it becomes crestfallen not knowing what the reflection came from in the first place
So it is when we gain imitation discernment unwittingly by thinking and conjecturing in line with concepts and preoccupations We're headed for sorrow when death meets us facetoface
The crucial factor in natural discernment comes solely from training the mind to be like a diamond that gives off its own light  surrounded by radiance whether in dark places or bright
A mirror is useful only in places already welllit
If you take it into the dark you can't use it to see your reflection at all
But a cut jewel that gives off its own light is brilliant everywhere
This is what the Buddha meant when he taught that there are no closed or secret places in the world where discernment can't penetrate
This jewel of discernment is what will enable us to destroy craving clinging and obscured awareness and to attain the highest excellence Liberation  free from pain death annihilation and extinction  existing naturally through the reality of deathlessness
By and large we tend to be interested only in discernment and release
At the drop of a hat we want to start right in with the teachings on stress inconstancy and notself  and when this is the case we'll never get anywhere
Before the Buddha taught that things are inconstant he had worked at knowing them until they revealed their constancy
Before teaching that things are stressful he had turned that stress into pleasure and ease
And before teaching that things are notself he had turned what is notself into a self and so was able to see what is constant and true lying hidden in what is inconstant stressful and notself
He then gathered all of these qualities into one
He gathered all that is inconstant stressful and notself into one and the same thing fabrications viewed in terms of the world  a single class equal everywhere throughout the world
As for what's constant pleasant and self this was another class fabrications viewed in terms of the Dhamma
And then he let go of both classes without getting caught up on constant or inconstant stress or ease self or notself This is why we can say he attained release purity and Liberation for he had no need to latch onto fabrications  whether of the world or of the Dhamma  in any way at all
This was the nature of the Lord Buddha's practice
But as for our own practice most of us act as if we have everything figured out beforehand and have succeeded even before we start
In other words we want simply to let go and attain peace and release
But if we haven't laid the full groundwork our lettinggo is bound to be lacking Our peace is bound to be piecemeal our release is bound to be wrong
Those of us who sincerely mean well and want only the highest good should ask ourselves Have we laid the proper foundation
If we don't lay the proper foundation for release and letting go how will we ever be free
The Buddha taught that virtue can overcome common defilements the gross faults in our words and deeds that concentration can overcome such intermediate defilements as sensual desires ill will torpor restlessness and uncertainty and that discernment can overcome such subtle defilements as craving clinging and obscured awareness
Yet some people whose discernment is sharp who can clearly explain subtle points of doctrine can't seem to shake off the more common defilements that even virtue can overcome
This shows that something must be lacking in their virtue concentration and discernment
Their virtues are probably all on the surface their concentration splotchy and stained their discernment a smearedon gloss  like the glass coated with mercury  which is why they can't attain the goal
Their actions fall under the old saying Keeping a sword outside the scabbard  having a way with words and theories but no center for the mind laying an egg outside the nest  looking for goodness only outside without training the mind to be centered resting a foundation on the sand  trying to find security in things of no substance
All of this is bound to bring disappointment
Such people have yet to find a worthwhile refuge
So we should lay the groundwork and put the causes into good working order because all the attainments we hope for come springing from causes
Now we will summarize the methods of breath meditation under the headings of jhana
Jhana means to be absorbed or focused in a single object or preoccupation as when we deal with the breath
The first jhana has five factors
Directed thought Think of the breath until you can keep it in mind without getting distracted
Singleness of preoccupation Keep the mind with the breath
Don't let it stray after other concepts or preoccupations
Watch over your thoughts so that they deal only with the breath to the point where the breath becomes comfortable
Evaluation Gain a sense of how to let this comfortable breath sensation spread and connect with the other breath sensations in the body
Let these breath sensations spread until they're interconnected all over the body
Once the body has been soothed by the breath feelings of pain will grow calm
The body will be filled with good breath energy

These three qualities must be brought together to bear on the same stream of breathing for the first jhana to arise
This stream of breathing can then take you all the way to the fourth jhana
Directed thought singleness of preoccupation and evaluation act as the causes
When the causes are fully ripe results will appear  rapture a compelling sense of fullness and refreshment for body and mind going straight to the heart independent of all else pleasure physical ease arising from the body's being still and unperturbed mental contentment arising from the mind's being at ease on its own undistracted unperturbed serene and exultant
Rapture and pleasure are the results
The factors of the first jhana thus come down simply to two sorts causes and results
As rapture and pleasure grow stronger the breath becomes more subtle
The longer you stay focused and absorbed the more powerful the results become
This enables you to set directed thought and evaluation aside and  relying completely on a single factor singleness of preoccupation  you enter the second jhana
The second jhana has three factors rapture pleasure and singleness of preoccupation
This refers to the state of mind that has tasted the results coming from the first jhana
Once you have entered the second level rapture and pleasure become stronger because they rely on a single cause singleness of preoccupation which looks after the work from here on in focusing on the breath so that it becomes more and more refined keeping steady and still with a sense of refreshment and ease for both body and mind
The mind is even more stable and intent than before
As you continue focusing rapture and pleasure grow stronger and begin to expand and contract
Continue focusing on the breath moving the mind deeper to a more subtle level to escape the motions of rapture and pleasure and you enter the third jhana
The third jhana has two factors pleasure and singleness of preoccupation
The body is quiet motionless and solitary
No feelings of pain arise to disturb it
The mind is solitary and still
The breath is refined freeflowing and broad
A radiance  white like cotton wool  pervades the entire body stilling all feelings of physical and mental discomfort
Keep focused on looking after nothing but the broad refined breath
The mind is free No thoughts of past or future disturb it
The mind stands out on its own
The four properties  earth water fire and wind  are in harmony throughout the body
You could almost say that they're pure throughout the entire body because the breath has the strength to control and take good care of the other properties keeping them harmonious and coordinated
Mindfulness is coupled with singleness of preoccupation which acts as the cause
The breath fills the body
Mindfulness fills the body
Focus on in The mind is bright and powerful the body is light
Feelings of pleasure are still
Your sense of the body feels steady and even with no slips or gaps in your awareness so you can let go of your sense of pleasure
The manifestations of pleasure grow still because the four properties are balanced and free from motion
Singleness of preoccupation the cause has the strength to focus more heavily down taking you to the fourth jhana
The fourth jhana has two factors equanimity and singleness of preoccupation or mindfulness
Equanimity and singleness of preoccupation on the fourth jhana are powerfully focused  solid stable and sure
The breath property is absolutely quiet free from ripples crosscurrents and gaps
The mind neutral and still is free of all preoccupations with past and future
The breath which forms the present is still like the ocean or air when they are free from currents or waves
You can know distant sights and sounds because the breath is even and unwavering acting like a movie screen that gives a clear reflection of whatever is projected onto it
Knowledge arises in the mind You know but stay neutral and still
The mind is neutral and still the breath neutral and still past present and future are all neutral and still
This is true singleness of preoccupation focused on the unperturbed stillness of the breath
All parts of the breath in the body connect so that you can breathe through every pore
You don't have to breathe through the nostrils because the inandout breath and the other aspects of the breath in the body form a single unified whole
All aspects of the breath energy are even and full
The four properties all have the same characteristics
The mind is completely still
The mind sheds light in all directions
The breath is radiant the mind fully radiant due to the focusing of mindfulness
The focus is strong the light aglow The mind has power and authority
All four of the frames of reference are gathered into one
There is no sense that That's the body That's a feeling That's the mind That's a mental quality There's no sense that they're four
This is thus called the great frame of reference because none of the four are in any way separate
Mindfulness and alertness converge into one This is what is meant by the one path  the concord among the properties and frames of reference four in one giving rise to great energy and wakefulness the purifying inner fire that can thoroughly dispel all obscuring darkness
As you focus more strongly on the radiance of the mind power comes from letting go of all preoccupations
The mind stands alone like a person who has climbed to the top of a mountain and so has the right to see in all directions
The mind's dwelling  the breath which supports the mind's prominence and freedom  is in a heightened state so the mind is able to see clearly the locations of all Dhamma fabrications  ie elements khandhas and sense media
Just as a person who has taken a camera up in an airplane can take pictures of practically everything below so a person who has reached this stage can see the world and the Dhamma as they truly are
In addition awareness of another sort in the area of the mind  called liberating insight or the skill of release  also appears
The elements or properties of the body acquire potency the mind resilient power
When you want knowledge of the world or the Dhamma focus the mind heavily and forcefully on the breath
As the concentrated power of the mind strikes the pure element intuitive knowledge will spring up in that element just as the needle of a record player as it strikes a record will give rise to sounds
Once your mindfulness is focused on a pure object then if you want images images will appear if sounds sounds will arise whether near or far matters of the world or the Dhamma concerning yourself or others past present or future  whatever you want to know
As you focus down think of what you want to know and it will appear
This is ñana  intuitive sensitivity capable of knowing past present and future  an important level of awareness that you can know only for yourself
The elements are like radio waves going through the air
If your mind and mindfulness are strong and your skills highly developed you can use those elements to put yourself in touch with the entire world so that knowledge can arise within you
When you have mastered the fourth jhana it can act as the basis for eight skills
Manomayiddhi psychic powers  the ability to use thoughts to influence events
Iddhividhi the ability to display supranormal powers eg creating images in certain instances that certain groups of people will be able to see
Dibbasota the ability to hear distant sounds
Cetopariyañana the ability to know the level  good or evil high or low  of other people's minds
Pubbenivasanussatiñana the ability to remember previous lifetimes

Dibbacakkhu the ability to see gross and subtle images both near and far
Asavakkhayañana the ability to reduce and eliminate the effluents of defilement in the heart
These eight skills come exclusively from the centering the mind which is why I have written this condensed guide to concentration and jhana based on the technique of keeping the breath in mind
If you aspire to the good that can come from these things you should turn your attention to training your own heart and mind
If when you're sitting you aren't yet able to observe the breath tell yourself Now I'm going to breathe in
Now I'm going to breathe out In other words at this stage you're the one doing the breathing
You're not letting the breath come in and out as it naturally would
If you can keep this in mind each time you breathe you'll soon be able to catch hold of the breath
In keeping your awareness inside your body don't try to imprison it there
In other words don't try to force the mind into a trance don't try to force the breath or hold it to the point where you feel uncomfortable or confined
You have to let the mind have its freedom
Simply keep watch over it to make sure that it stays separate from its thoughts
If you try to force the breath and pin the mind down your body is going to feel restricted and you won't feel at ease in your work
You'll start hurting here and aching there and your legs may fall asleep
So just let the mind be its natural self keeping watch to make sure that it doesn't slip out after external thoughts
When we keep the mind from slipping out after its concepts and concepts from slipping into the mind it's like closing our windows and doors to keep dogs cats and thieves from slipping into our house
What this means is that we close off our sense doors and don't pay any attention to the sights that come in by way of the eyes the sounds that come in by way of the ears the smells that come in by way of the nose the tastes that come in by way of the tongue the tactile sensations that come in by way of the body and the preoccupations that come in by way of the mind
We have to cut off all the perceptions and concepts  good or bad old or new  that come in by way of these doors
Cutting off concepts like this doesn't mean that we stop thinking
It simply means that we bring our thinking inside to put it to good use by observing and evaluating the theme of our meditation
If we put our mind to work in this way we won't be doing any harm to ourself or to our mind
Actually our mind tends to be working all the time but the work it gets involved in is usually a lot of nonsense a lot of fuss and bother without any real substance
So we have to find work of real value for it to do  something that won't harm it something really worth doing
This is why we're doing breath meditation focusing on our breathing focusing on our mind
Put aside all your other work and be intent on doing just this and nothing else
This is the sort of attitude you need when you meditate
The Hindrances that come from our concepts of past and future are like weeds growing in our field
They steal all the nutrients from the soil so that our crops won't have anything to feed on and they make the place look like a mess
They're of no use at all except as food for the cows and other animals that come wandering through
If you let your field get filled with weeds this way your crops won't be able to grow
In the same way if you don't clear your mind of its preoccupation with concepts you won't be able to make your heart pure
Concepts are food only for the ignorant people who think they're delicious but sages don't eat them at all
The five Hindrances  sensual desire ill will torpor  lethargy restlessness  anxiety and uncertainty  are like different kinds of weeds
Restlessness  anxiety is probably the most poisonous of the lot because it makes us distracted unsettled and anxious all at the same time
It's the kind of weed with thorns and sharpedged leaves
If you run into it you're going to end up with a stinging rash all over your body
So if you come across it destroy it
Don't let it grow in your field at all
Breath meditation  keeping the breath steadily in mind  is the best method the Buddha taught for wiping out these Hindrances
We use directed thought to focus on the breath and evaluation to adjust it
Directed thought is like a plow evaluation like a harrow
If we keep plowing and harrowing our field weeds won't have a chance to grow and our crops are sure to prosper and bear abundant fruit
The field here is our body
If we put a lot of thought and evaluation into our breathing the four properties of the body will be balanced and at peace
The body will be healthy and strong the mind relaxed and wide open free from Hindrances
When you've got your field cleared and leveled like this the crops of your mind  the qualities of the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha  are sure to prosper
As soon as you bring the mind to the breath you'll feel a sense of rapture and refreshment
The four bases of attainment  the desire to practice persistence in the practice intentness and circumspection in your practice  will develop step by step
These four qualities are like the four legs of a table that keep it stable and upright
They're a form of power that supports our strength and our progress to higher levels
To make another comparison these four qualities are like the ingredients in a health tonic
Whoever takes this tonic will have a long life
If you want to die you don't have to take it but if you don't want to die you have to take a lot
The more you take it the faster the diseases in your mind will disappear
In other words your defilements will die
So if you know that your mind has a lot of diseases this is the tonic for you
When you sit and meditate even if you don't gain any intuitive insights make sure at least that you know this much When the breath comes in you know
When it goes out you know
When it's long you know
When it's short you know
Whether it's comfortable or uncomfortable you know
If you can know this much you're doing fine
As for the various thoughts and concepts that come into the mind brush them away  whether they're good or bad whether they deal with the past or the future
Don't let them interfere with what you're doing  and don't go chasing after them to straighten them out
When a thought of this sort comes passing in simply let it go passing on
Keep your awareness unperturbed in the present
When we say that the mind goes here or there it's not really the mind that goes
Only concepts go
Concepts are like shadows of the mind
If the body is still how will its shadow move
The movement of the body is what causes the shadow to move and when the shadow moves how will you catch hold of it
Shadows are hard to catch hard to shake off hard to set still
The awareness that forms the present That's the true mind
The awareness that goes chasing after concepts is just a shadow
Real awareness  knowing  stays in place
It doesn't stand walk come or go
As for the mind  the awareness that doesn't act in any way coming or going forward or back  it's quiet and unperturbed
And when the mind is thus its normal even undistracted self  ie when it doesn't have any shadows  we can rest peacefully
But if the mind is unstable uncertain and wavering concepts arise and go flashing out  and we go chasing after them hoping to drag them back in
The chasing after them is where we go wrong
This is what we have to correct
Tell yourself Nothing is wrong with your mind
Just watch out for the shadows
You can't improve your shadow
Say your shadow is black
You can scrub it with soap till your dying day and it'll still be black  because there's no substance to it
So it is with your concepts
You can't straighten them out because they're just images deceiving you
The Buddha thus taught that whoever isn't acquainted with the self the body the mind and its shadows is suffering from avijja  darkness deluded knowledge
Whoever thinks the mind is the self the self is the mind the mind is its concepts  whoever has things all mixed up like this  is deluded and lost like a person lost in the jungle
To be lost in the jungle brings countless hardships
There are wild beasts to worry about problems in finding food to eat and a place to sleep
No matter which way you look there's no way out
But if we're lost in the world it's many times worse than being lost in the jungle because we can't tell night from day
We have no chance to find any brightness because our minds are dark with avijja
The purpose of training the mind to be still is to simplify things
When things are simplified the mind can settle down and rest
And when the mind has rested it'll gradually become bright in and of itself and give rise to knowledge
But if we let things get complicated  if we let the mind get mixed up with sights sounds smells tastes tactile sensations and ideas  that's darkness
Knowledge won't have a chance to arise
When intuitive knowledge does arise it can  if you know how to use it  lead to liberating insight
But if you let yourself get carried away by knowledge of the past or future you won't get beyond the mundane level
In other words if you dabble too much in knowledge of physical things without gaining wisdom with regard to the workings of the mind it can leave you spiritually immature
Say for example that a vision arises and you get hooked You gain knowledge of your past lives and get all excited
Things you never knew before now you can know
Things you never saw before now you see  and they can make you overly pleased or upset
Why
Because you take them all too seriously
You may see a vision of yourself prospering as a lord or master a great emperor or king wealthy and influential
If you let yourself feel pleased that's indulgence in pleasure
You've strayed from the Middle Path
Or you may see yourself as something you wouldn't care to be a pig or a dog a bird or a rat crippled or deformed
If you let yourself get upset that's indulgence in selfaffliction  and again you've strayed from the path
Some people really let themselves get carried away As soon as they start seeing things they begin to think that they're special somehow better than other people
They let themselves become proud and conceited  and the right path has disappeared without their even knowing it
If you're not careful this is where mundane knowledge can lead you
But if you keep one principle firmly in mind you can stay right on the path Whatever appears good or bad true or false don't let yourself feel pleased don't let yourself get upset
Keep the mind balanced and neutral and discernment will arise
You'll see that the vision or sign displays the truth of stress it arises fades and disappears
If you get hooked on your intuitions you're asking for trouble
Knowledge that proves false can hurt you
Knowledge that proves true can really hurt you
If what you know is true and you go telling other people you're bragging
If it turns out to be false it can backfire on you
This is why those who truly know say that knowledge is the essence of stress It can hurt you
Knowledge is part of the flood of views and opinions over which we have to cross
If you hang onto knowledge you've gone wrong
If you know simply know and let it go at that
You don't have to be excited or pleased
You don't have to go telling other people
People who've studied abroad when they come back to the rice fields don't tell what they've learned to the folks at home
They talk about ordinary things in an ordinary way
The reason they don't talk about the things they've studied is because no one would understand them it wouldn't serve any purpose
Even with people who would understand them they don't display their learning
So it should be when you practice meditation
No matter how much you know you have to act as if you know nothing because this is the way people with good manners normally act
If you go bragging to other people it's bad enough
If they don't believe you it can get even worse
So whatever you know simply be aware of it and let it go
Don't let there be the assumption that I know When you can do this your mind can attain the transcendent free from attachment
Everything in the world has its truth
Even things that aren't true are true  ie their truth is that they're false
This is why we have to let go of both what's true and what's false
Once we know the truth and can let it go we can be at our ease
We won't be poor because the truth  the Dhamma  will still be there with us
We won't be left emptyhanded
It's like having a lot of money Instead of lugging it around with us we keep it piled up at home
We may not have anything in our pockets but we're still not poor
The same is true with people who really know
Even when they let go of their knowledge it's still there
This is why the minds of the Noble Ones aren't left adrift
They let things go but not in a wasteful or irresponsible way
They let go like rich people Even though they let go they've still got piles of wealth
As for people who let things go like paupers they don't know what's worthwhile and what's not
When they throw away the things that are worthwhile they're simply heading for disaster
For instance they may see that there's no truth to anything  no truth to the khandhas no truth to the body no truth to stress its cause its disbanding or the path to its disbanding no truth to Liberation
They don't use their brains at all
They're too lazy to do anything so they let go of everything throw it all away
This is called letting go like a pauper
Like a lot of modernday sages When they come back after they die they're going to be poor all over again
As for the Buddha he let go only of the true and false things that appeared in his body and mind  but he didn't abandon his body and mind which is why he ended up rich with plenty of wealth to hand down to his descendants
This is why his descendants never have to worry about being poor
So we should look to the Buddha as our model
If we see that the khandhas are worthless  inconstant stressful notself and all that  and simply let go of them by neglecting them we're sure to end up poor
Like a stupid person who feels so repulsed by a festering sore on his body that he won't touch it and so lets it go without taking care of it There's no way the sore is going to heal
As for intelligent people they know how to wash their sores put medicine and bandages on them so that eventually they're sure to recover
In the same way when people see only the drawbacks to the khandhas without seeing their good side and so let them go without putting them to any worthwhile or skillful use nothing good will come of it
But if we're intelligent enough to see that the khandhas have their good side as well as their bad and then put them to good use by meditating to gain discernment into physical and mental phenomena we're going to be rich
Once we have the truth  the Dhamma  as our wealth we won't suffer if we have money and won't suffer if we don't for our minds will be transcendent
The various forms of rust  greed anger and delusion  that have been obscuring our senses will all fall away
Our eyes ears nose tongue and body will be entirely clean clear and bright for as the Buddha said the Dhamma  discernment  is like a lamp
Our mind far distant from all forms of trouble and suffering will stay in the current flowing on to Liberation
When feelings of pain or discomfort arise while you're sitting in meditation examine them to see what they come from
Don't let yourself be pained or upset by them
If there are parts of the body that won't go as you'd like them to don't worry about them
Let them be  because your body is the same as every other body human or animal throughout the world It's inconstant stressful and can't be forced
So stay with whatever part does go as you'd like it to and keep it comfortable
This is called dhammavicaya being selective in what's good
The body is like a tree No tree is entirely perfect
At any one time it'll have new leaves and old leaves green leaves and yellow fresh leaves and dry
The dry leaves will fall away first while those that are fresh will slowly dry out and fall away later
Some of the branches are long some thick and some small
The fruits aren't evenly distributed
The human body isn't really much different from this
Pleasure and pain aren't evenly distributed
The parts that ache and those that are comfortable are randomly mixed
You can't rely on it
So do your best to keep the comfortable parts comfortable
Don't worry about the parts that you can't make comfortable
It's like going into a house where the floorboards are beginning to rot If you want to sit down don't choose a rotten spot
Choose a spot where the boards are still sound
In other words the heart needn't concern itself with things that can't be controlled
Or you can compare the body to a mango If a mango has a rotten or a wormy spot take a knife and cut it out
Eat just the good part remaining
If you're foolish enough to eat the wormy part you're in for trouble
Your body is the same and not just the body  the mind too doesn't always go as you'd like it to
Sometimes it's in a good mood sometimes it's not
This is where you have to use as much thought and evaluation as possible
Directed thought and evaluation are like doing a job
The job here is concentration centering the mind in stillness
Focus the mind on a single object and then use your mindfulness and alertness to examine and reflect on it
If you use a meager amount of thought and evaluation your concentration will give meager results
If you do a crude job you'll get crude results
If you do a fine job you'll get fine results
Crude results aren't worth much
Fine results are of high quality and are useful in all sorts of ways  like atomic radiation which is so fine that it can penetrate even mountains
Crude things are of low quality and hard to use
Sometimes you can soak them in water all day long and they still don't soften up
But as for fine things all they need is a little dampness in the air and they dissolve
So it is with the quality of your concentration
If your thinking and evaluation are subtle thorough and circumspect your concentration work will result in more and more stillness of mind
If your thinking and evaluation are slipshod and crude you won't get much stillness
Your body will ache and you'll feel restless and irritable
Once the mind can become very still though the body will be comfortable and at ease
Your heart will feel open and clear
Pains will disappear
The elements of the body will feel normal The warmth in your body will be just right neither too hot nor too cold
As soon as your work is finished it'll result in the highest form of happiness and ease nibbana  Liberation
But as long as you still have work to do your heart won't get its full measure of peace
Wherever you go there will always be something nagging at the back of your mind
Once your work is done though you can be carefree wherever you go
If you haven't finished your job it's because you haven't set your mind on it and you haven't actually done the work
You've shirked your duties and played truant
But if you really set your mind on doing the job there's no doubt but that you'll finish it
Once you've realized that the body is inconstant stressful and can't be forced you should keep your mind on an even keel with regard to it
Inconstant means that it changes
Stressful doesn't refer solely to aches and pains
It refers to pleasure as well  because pleasure is inconstant and undependable too
A little pleasure can turn into a lot of pleasure or into pain
Pain can turn back into pleasure and so on
So we shouldn't be all that concerned about pleasure and pain
Think of the body as having two parts like the mango
If you focus your attention on the comfortable part your mind can be at peace
Let the pains be in the other part
Once you have an object of meditation you have a comfortable place for your mind to stay
You don't have to dwell on your pains
You have a comfortable house to live in Why go sleep in the dirt
We all want nothing but goodness but if you can't tell what's good from what's defiled you can sit and meditate till your dying day and never find nibbana at all
But if you're knowledgeable and intent on what you're doing it's not all that hard
Nibbana is really a simple matter because it's always there
It never changes
The affairs of the world are what's hard because they're always changing and uncertain
Today they're one way tomorrow another
Once you've done something you have to keep looking after it
But you don't have to look after nibbana at all
Once you've realized it you can let it go
Keep on realizing keep on letting go  like a person eating rice who after he's put the rice in his mouth keeps spitting it out rather than letting it become feces in his intestines
What this means is that you keep on doing good but don't claim it as your own
Do good and then spit it out
This is viragadhamma disengagement
Most people in the world once they've done something latch onto it as theirs  and so they have to keep looking after it
If they're not careful it'll either get stolen or else wear out on its own
They're headed for disappointment
Like a person who swallows his rice After he's eaten he'll have to defecate
After he's defecated he'll be hungry again so he'll have to eat again and defecate again
The day will never come when he's had enough
But with nibbana you don't have to swallow
You can eat your rice and then spit it out
You can do good and let it go
It's like plowing a field The dirt falls off the plow on its own
You don't need to scoop it up and put it in a bag tied to your water buffalo's leg
Whoever is stupid enough to scoop up the dirt as it falls off the plow and stick it in a bag will never get anywhere
Either his buffalo will get bogged down or else he'll trip over the bag and fall flat on his face right there in the middle of the field
The field will never get plowed the rice will never get sown the crop will never get gathered
He'll have to go hungry
Buddho our meditation word is the name of the Buddha after his Awakening
It means someone who has blossomed who is awake who has suddenly come to his senses
For six long years before his Awakening the Buddha traveled about searching for the truth from various teachers all without success
So he went off on his own and on a fullmoon evening in May sat down under the Bodhi tree vowing not to get up until he had attained the truth
Finally toward dawn as he was meditating on his breath he gained Awakening
He found what he was looking for  right at the tip of his nose
Nibbana doesn't lie far away
It's right at our lips right at the tip of our nose
But we keep groping around and never find it
If you're really serious about finding purity set your mind on meditation and nothing else
As for whatever else may come your way you can say No thanks Pleasure
No thanks Pain
No thanks Goodness
No thanks Evil
No thanks Paths and fruitions
No thanks Nibbana
No thanks If it's no thanks to everything what will you have left
You won't need to have anything left
That's nibbana
Like a person without any money How will thieves be able to rob him
If you get money and try to hold onto it you're going to get killed
This you want to take
That you want to take
Carry what's yours around till you're completely weighed down
You'll never get away
In this world we have to live with both good and evil
People who have developed disengagement are filled with goodness and know evil fully but don't hold onto either don't claim either as their own
They put them aside let them go and so can travel light and easy
Nibbana isn't all that difficult a matter
In the Buddha's time some people became arahants while going on their almsround some while urinating some while watching farmers plowing a field
What's difficult about the highest good lies in the beginning in laying the groundwork  being constantly mindful and alert examining and evaluating your breath at all times
But if you can keep at it you're bound to succeed in the end
The breath is a mirror for the mind
If the mirror is abnormal it gives abnormal reflections
Say you look into a convex mirror Your reflection will be taller than you are
If you look in a concave mirror your reflection will be abnormally short
But if you look into a mirror that's flat smooth and normal it'll give you a true reflection of yourself
If you polish the mirror so that it's clean and bright  in other words if you use evaluation to adjust and expand the breath so that it's comfortable  your reflection will be sharp and clear
Knowing how to adjust the breath putting it in good order is tantamount to putting the mind in good order as well and can give all kinds of benefits  like a good cook who knows how to vary the foods she serves sometimes changing the color sometimes the flavor sometimes the shape so that her employer will never grow tired of her cooking
If she fixes the same thing all year around  porridge today porridge tomorrow porridge the next day  her employer is bound to go looking for a new cook
But if she knows how to vary her offerings so that her employer is always satisfied she's sure to get a raise in her salary or maybe a special bonus
So it is with the breath
If you know how to adjust and vary the breath  if you're always thinking about and evaluating the breath  you'll become thoroughly mindful and expert in all matters dealing with the breath and the other elements of the body
You'll always know how things are going with the body
Rapture ease and singleness of preoccupation will come on their own
The body will be refreshed the mind content
Both body and mind will be at peace
All the elements will be at peace free from unrest and disturbances
It's like knowing how to look after a small child
If the child starts crying you know when to give it milk or candy when to give it a bath when to take it out for some air when to put it in a playpen and give it a doll to play with
In no time at all the child will stop crying stop whining and leave you free to finish whatever work you have to do
The mind is like a small innocent child
If you're skilled at looking after it it'll be obedient happy and contented and will grow day by day
When the body and mind are full and content they won't feel hungry
They won't have to go opening up the pots and pans on the stove or pace around looking out the windows and doors
They can sleep in peace without any disturbances
Ghosts and demons  the pains of the khandhas  won't come and possess them
This way we can be at our ease because when we sit we sit with people
When we lie down we lie down with people
When we eat we eat with people
When people live with people there's no problem but when they live with ghosts and demons they're sure to squabble and never find any peace
If we don't know how to evaluate and adjust our breathing there's no way our meditation will give any results
Even if we sit till we die we won't gain any knowledge or understanding at all
There was once an old monk  years old years in the monkhood  who had heard good things about how I teach meditation and so came to study with me
The first thing he asked was What method do you teach
Breath meditation I told him
You know  buddho buddho
As soon as he heard that he said I've been practicing that method ever since the time of Ajaan Mun  buddho buddho ever since I was young  and I've never seen anything good come of it
All it does is buddho buddho without ever getting anywhere at all
And now you're going to teach me to buddho some more
What for
You want me to buddho till I die
This is what happens when people have no sense of how to adjust and evaluate their breathing They'll never find what they're looking for  which is why adjusting and spreading the breath is a very important part of doing breath meditation
Getting to know yourself  becoming acquainted with your body your mind the elements knowing what they come from how they arise how they disband how they're inconstant stressful and notself All of this you have to find out by exploring on your own
If your knowledge simply follows what's in books or what other people tell you it's knowledge that comes from labels and concepts not from your own discernment
It's not really knowledge
If you know only what other people tell you you're following them down a road  and what could be good about that
They might lead you down the wrong road
And if the road is dusty they might kick dust into your ears and eyes
So in your search for the truth don't simply believe what other people say
Don't believe labels
Practice centering the mind until you gain knowledge on your own
Only then will it be insight
Only then will it be trustworthy
When you meditate you have to think
If you don't think you can't meditate because thinking forms a necessary part of meditation
Take jhana for instance
Use your powers of directed thought to bring the mind to the object and your powers of evaluation to be discriminating in your choice of an object
Examine the object of your meditation until you see that it's just right for you
You can choose slow breathing fast breathing short breathing long breathing narrow breathing broad breathing hot cool or warm breathing a breath that goes only as far as the nose a breath that goes only as far as the base of the throat a breath that goes all the way down to the heart
When you've found an object that suits your taste catch hold of it and make the mind one focused on a single object
Once you've done this evaluate your object
Direct your thoughts to making it stand out
Don't let the mind leave the object
Don't let the object leave the mind
Tell yourself that it's like eating Put the food in line with your mouth put your mouth in line with the food
Don't miss
If you miss and go sticking the food in your ear under your chin in your eye or on your forehead you'll never get anywhere in your eating
So it is with your meditation
Sometimes the one object of your mind takes a sudden sharp turn into the past back hundreds of years
Sometimes it takes off into the future and comes back with all sorts of things to clutter your mind
This is like taking your food sticking it up over your head and letting it fall down behind you  the dogs are sure to get it or like bringing the food to your mouth and then tossing it out in front of you
When you find this happening it's a sign that your mind hasn't been made snug with its object
Your powers of directed thought aren't firm enough
You have to bring the mind to the object and then keep after it to make sure it stays put
Like eating Make sure the food is in line with the mouth and stick it right in
This is directed thought The food is in line with the mouth the mouth is in line with the food
You're sure it's food and you know what kind it is  main course or dessert coarse or refined
Once you know what's what and it's in your mouth chew it right up
This is evaluation examining reviewing your meditation
Sometimes this comes under threshold concentration  examining a coarse object to make it more and more refined
If you find that the breath is long examine long breathing
If it's short examine short breathing
If it's slow examine slow breathing  to see if the mind will stay with that kind of breathing to see if that kind of breathing will stay with the mind to see whether the breath is smooth and unhindered
This is evaluation
When the mind gives rise to directed thought and evaluation you have both concentration and discernment
Directed thought and singleness of preoccupation fall under the heading of concentration evaluation under the heading of discernment
When you have both concentration and discernment the mind is still and knowledge can arise
But if there's too much evaluation it can destroy your stillness of mind
If there's too much stillness it can snuff out thought
You have to watch over the stillness of your mind to make sure you have things in the right proportions
If you don't have a sense of just right you're in for trouble
If the mind is too still your progress will be slow
If you think too much it'll run away with your concentration
So observe things carefully
Again it's like eating
If you go shoveling food into your mouth you might end up choking to death
You have to ask yourself Is it good for me
Can I handle it
Are my teeth strong enough
Some people have nothing but empty gums and yet they want to eat sugar cane It's not normal
Some people even though their teeth are aching and falling out still want to eat crunchy foods
So it is with the mind As soon as it's just a little bit still we want to see this know that  we want to take on more than we can handle
You first have to make sure that your concentration is solidly based that your discernment and concentration are properly balanced
This point is very important
Your powers of evaluation have to be ripe your directed thought firm
Say you have a water buffalo tie it to a stake and pound the stake deep into the ground
If your buffalo is strong it just might walk or run away with the stake
You have to know your buffalo's strength
If it's really strong pound the stake so that it's firmly in the ground and keep watch over it
In other words if you find that the obsessiveness of your thinking is getting out of hand going beyond the bounds of mental stillness then fix the mind in place and make it extra still  but not so still that you lose track of things
If the mind is too quiet it's like being in a daze
You don't know what's going on at all
Everything is dark blotted out
Or else you have good and bad spells sinking out of sight and then popping up again
This is concentration without directed thought or evaluation with no sense of judgment Wrong Concentration
So you have to be observant
Use your judgment  but don't let the mind get carried away by its thoughts
Your thinking is something separate
The mind stays with the meditation object
Wherever your thoughts may go spinning your mind is still firmly based  like holding onto a post and spinning around and around
You can keep on spinning and yet it doesn't wear you out
But if you let go of the post and spin around three times you get dizzy and  Bang
 fall flat on your face
So it is with the mind If it stays with the singleness of its preoccupation it can keep thinking and not get tired not get harmed because your thinking and stillness are right there together
The more you think the more solid your mind gets
The more you sit and meditate the more you think
The mind becomes more and more firm until all the Hindrances fall away
The mind no longer goes looking for concepts
Now it can give rise to knowledge
The knowledge here isn't ordinary knowledge
It washes away your old knowledge
You don't want the knowledge that comes from ordinary thinking and reasoning Let go of it
You don't want the knowledge that comes from directed thought and evaluation Stop
Make the mind quiet
Still
When the mind is still and unhindered this is the essence of all that's skillful and good
When your mind is on this level it isn't attached to any concepts at all
All the concepts you've known  dealing with the world or the Dhamma however many or few  are washed away
Only when they're washed away can new knowledge arise
This is why you should let go of concepts  all the labels and names you have for things
You have to let yourself be poor
It's when people are poor that they become ingenious and resourceful
If you don't let yourself be poor you'll never gain discernment
In other words you don't have to be afraid of being stupid or of missing out on things
You don't have to be afraid that you've hit a dead end
You don't want any of the insights you've gained from listening to others or from reading books because they're concepts and therefore inconstant
You don't want any of the insights you've gained by reasoning and thinking because they're concepts and therefore notself
Let all these insights disappear leaving just the mind firmly intent leaning neither to the left toward being displeased nor to the right toward being pleased
Keep the mind still quiet neutral impassive  set tall
And there you are Right Concentration
When Right Concentration arises in the mind it has a shadow
When you can catch sight of the shadow appearing that's vipassana liberating insight
The knowledge you gain from Right Concentration doesn't come in the form of thoughts or ideas
It comes as Right Views
What looks wrong to you is really wrong
What looks right is really right
If what looks right is really wrong that's Wrong View
If what looks wrong is really right again  Wrong View
With Right View though right looks right and wrong looks wrong
To put it in terms of cause and effect you see the four Noble Truths
You see stress and it really is stressful
You see the cause of stress arising and that it's really causing stress
These are Noble Truths absolutely undeniably indisputably true
You see that stress has a cause
Once the cause arises there has to be stress
As for the way to the disbanding of stress you see that the path you're following will without a doubt lead to Liberation
Whether or not you go all the way what you see is correct
This is Right View
And as for the disbanding of stress you see that there really is such a thing
You see that as long as you're on the path stress does in fact fall away
When you come to realize the truth of these things in your heart that's vipassanañana
To put it even more simply You see that all things inside as well as out are undependable
The body is undependable aging is undependable death is undependable
They're slippery characters constantly changing on you
To see this is to see inconstancy
Don't let yourself be pleased by inconstancy
Don't let yourself be upset
Keep the mind neutral on an even keel
That's what's meant by vipassana
As for stress Say we hear that an enemy is suffering
Glad to hear it we think
Hope they hurry up and die The heart has tilted
Say we hear that a friend has become wealthy and we become happy or a son or daughter is ill and we become sad
Our mind has fallen in with suffering and stress
Why
Because we're unskilled
The mind isn't centered  ie it's not in Right Concentration
We have to look after the mind
Don't let it fall in with stress
Whatever suffers let it suffer but don't let the mind suffer with it
The body may be in pain but the mind isn't pained
Let the body go ahead and suffer but the mind doesn't suffer
Keep the mind neutral
Don't be pleased by pleasure  pleasure is a form of stress you know
How so
It can change
It can rise and fall
It can be high and low
It can't last
That's stress
Pain is also stress double stress
When you gain this sort of insight into stress  when you really see stress  vipassana has arisen in the mind
As for anatta notself Once we've examined things and seen them for what they really are we don't make claims we don't display influence we don't try to show that we have the right or the power to bring things that are notself under our control
No matter how hard we try we can't prevent birth aging illness and death
If the body is going to be old let it be old
If it's going to hurt let it hurt
If it has to die let it die
Don't be pleased by death either your own or that of others
Don't be upset by death your own or that of others
Keep the mind neutral
Unruffled
Unfazed
This is sankharupekkhañana letting sankharas  all things fashioned and fabricated  follow their own inherent nature
This briefly is vipassana You see that all fabrications are inconstant stressful and notself
You can disentangle them from your grasp
You can let go
This is where it gets good
How so
You don't have to wear yourself out lugging sankharas around
To be attached means to carry a load and there are five heaps we carry attachment to physical phenomena to feelings to concepts and labels to mental fabrications and to sensory consciousness
We grab hold and hang onto these things thinking that they're the self
Go ahead Carry them around
Hang one load from your left leg and one from your right
Put one on your left shoulder and one on your right
Put the last load on your head
And now Carry them wherever you go  clumsy encumbered and comical
The Buddha taught that whoever lacks discernment whoever is unskilled whoever doesn't practice concentration leading to liberating insight will have to be burdened with stress will always be loaded down
It's a pity
It's a shame
They'll never get away
Their legs are burdened their shoulders burdened  and where are they going
Three steps forward and two steps back
Soon they'll get discouraged and then after a while they'll pick themselves up and get going again
Now when we see inconstancy  that all fabrications whether within us or without are undependable when we see that they're stressful when we see that they're not our self that they simply whirl around in and of themselves When we gain these insights we can put down our burdens ie let go of our attachments
We can put down the past  ie stop dwelling in it
We can let go of the future  ie stop yearning for it
We can let go of the present  ie stop claiming it as the self
Once these three big baskets have fallen from our shoulders we can walk with a light step
We can even dance
We're beautiful
Wherever we go people will be glad to know us
Why
Because we're not encumbered
Whatever we do we can do with ease
We can walk run dance and sing  all with a light heart
We're Buddhism's beauty a sight for sore eyes graceful wherever we go
No longer burdened no longer encumbered we can be at our ease
This is vipassanañana
The earliest editions of Keeping the Breath in Mind contain a version of Step in Method that Ajaan Lee later shortened and revised to its present form
Some people though find the original version helpful so here it is
Observe the breath as it goes in and out noticing whether it's comfortable or uncomfortable broad or constricted obstructed or freeflowing fast or slow short or long warm or cool
If the breath doesn't feel comfortable adjust it until it does
For instance if breathing in long and out long is uncomfortable try breathing in short and out short
As soon as you find that your breath feels comfortable let this comfortable breath sensation spread to the different parts of your body
For example each time you breathe in and out once think of an important part of the body as follows
As you let the breath pass into the bronchial tubes think of it as going all the way down the right side of your abdomen to the bladder
As you take another inandout breath think of the breath as going from the main arteries to the liver and heart on down through your left side to the stomach and intestines
As you take another inandout breath think of the breath as going from the base of the throat all the way down the internal side of the spine
As you take another inandout breath think of letting the breath go from the base of the throat down the front of your chest through to the tip of the breastbone to the navel and out into the air
As you take another inandout breath inhale the breath into the palate down to the base of the throat on through the middle of the chest to the large intestine the rectum and out into the air
Once you've completed these five turns inside the body let the breath flow along the outside of the body
As you take an inandout breath think of inhaling the breath at the base of the skull and letting it go all the way down the external side of the spine
Now if you're male think first of your right side both with the legs and with the arms
As you take an inandout breath think of the right buttock and of letting the breath run all the way down the right leg to the tips of your toes
As you take another inandout breath think of the left buttock and of letting the breath run all the way down the left leg to the tips of your toes
As you take another inandout breath think of the base of the skull and of letting the breath run down your right shoulder along your right arm to the tips of your fingers
As you take another inandout breath inhale the breath into the base of the skull and let it run down your left shoulder along your arm to the tips of your fingers
As you take another inandout breath inhale the breath into the area inside your skull thinking of your ears  eyes  nose  mouth

Once you've finished keep careful watch over your breath
Make the breath refined light and freeflowing
Keep the mind steady and still in this breath
Make your mindfulness and alertness thorough and circumspect
Let the various breath sensations join and permeate throughout the body
Let the mind be neutral impassive and wellcomposed
If anything in this translation is inaccurate or misleading I ask forgiveness of the author and reader for having unwittingly stood in their way
As for whatever may be accurate I hope the reader will make the best use of it translating it a few steps further into the heart so as to attain the truth to which it points
 The translator
Ajaan Lee composed the following three short essays when he was hospitalized in late shortly over a year before his death
The style of presentation  outlines that are just barely fleshed out  is typical of his later writings
He seems to have intended that the essays be given to hospital patients as food for thought for them to ponder while undergoing treatment
Although the presentation is ecumenical the basic points are straight Buddhism
The explanation of the two types of disease in the first essay follows one of the central insights of the Buddha's Awakening the realization that events in the present are conditioned both by past kamma and by present kamma
The four principles of human values presented in the second essay correspond to the four agatis or types of prejudice that the Buddha warned against prejudice based on likes and desires dislikes and anger delusion and fear
The third essay The Buddhist Way is a brief outline of the Buddha's teachings based on the synopsis of the Ovada Patimokkha a discourse the Buddha gave at the beginning of his career to arahant disciples before sending them out to spread the teaching and on an analysis of one of the basic Buddhist concepts that of sankhara which means force fashioning or compounded thing
In its form the analysis of two types of sankharas  those on the level of the world and those on the level of the Dhamma  is original with Ajaan Lee and is based on a Thai reading of two Pali compounds sankharaloka and sankharadhamma
From the point of view of Pali grammar sankhara functions as the adjective in each of these compounds the first compound refers to the world of compounded things the second refers to compounded things as phenomena in and of themselves
The two compounds were taken over straight into Thai but because Thai places its adjectives after the nouns they modify Ajaan Lee has interpreted loka and dhamma as adjectives modifying sankhara and thus he arrives at his own novel interpretation of the terms
His understanding of the aggregate of consciousness the fifth aggregate is also interesting in that it differs from most scholarly interpretations
Otherwise the content of his analysis is standard and the points he makes form a convenient synopsis of Pali Buddhist teachings
There are two ways in which diseases can arise in our bodies
Physical causes Physically caused diseases are those that come about through disorders in the five physical properties  
b
Water the liquid parts such as saliva mucus blood etc
c
Fire the warmth in the body
d
Wind forces that move back and forth through the body such as the breath
e
Space the empty spaces that lie throughout the body through which the various elements of the body mingle and interact
These include such things as the ear canal the nasal passages the mouth the pores of the skin etc
When these properties become upset or unbalanced they provide one sort of opening for disease to arise called dhatusamutthana
Kammic causes Kammic diseases are those that arise from kammacitta or acts of the mind in which the mind becomes preoccupied with various upsetting or unwanted topics
As we think more and more of these things our mental energy weakens our mind gets upset or unbalanced and ultimately disease can arise
There are two ways of curing disease  but before treating our diseases we should first examine ourselves to see how they came about so that we'll be in a better position to cure them
The two ways of curing disease are through 
Dhamma medicine depending on ourselves to improve ourselves turning our minds to topics that are good worthwhile and wise
For example we may make a vow to do good in any number of ways such as donating food to monks in such and such a manner becoming ordained and observing precepts of such and such a sort sponsoring the making of a Buddha image of such and such a variety or saying our chants and meditating in such and such a way
In some cases when a good intention arises in the heart and we feel happy and expansive it gives energy to the heart and inner strength to the body through which we can alleviate any diseases that have arisen
Some additional food for thought for sick people and the doctors who treat them
Our duty when we are sick is to examine ourselves to find out the causes of our disease
If we aren't capable of knowing on our own we should search out those who are and who will give us advice
For example they may tell us that the kind of disease we have should be treated with pharmaceutical medicine
We should then contact a doctor so that he or she will have a chance to relieve our pain
Once we've received advice from the doctor we have two duties
We shouldn't concern ourselves with whether we'll recover or die
That's the doctor's responsibility
Our one responsibility is to look after our mind  to free our mind from the disease and to turn our thoughts to good and skillful topics so as to strengthen our morale as a way of helping the doctor who's looking after our disease
When doctor and patient help each other in this way neither will be a burden to the other
The doctor has freedom in treating our body we have freedom in the area of the mind and thus we'll have a chance to lessen our suffering
Even if we die both we and the doctor will have been working to the full extent of our abilities the doctor caring for our body while we care for the mind
Even if we die we don't lose we'll have our own inner goodness to take along with us
Thus when we treat our disease in this way we can be said to have two types of medicine working for us pharmaceutical medicines which are the affair of the doctor and dhamma medicine which is our own affair
In this way we and our doctor will be able to help each other in looking after the quality of our life
These are the duties of sick people
Now for the duties of the doctor As doctors we should inform ourselves of the causes of disease
If we know that a particular disease comes from physical causes we should prescribe the proper medicines
If we see that the disease comes from kammic causes we should use other methods to improve our patient's morale
For example we can use a pleasing bedside manner or get the patient to feel welldisposed toward making merit encouraging him or her to donate food to monks to meditate or chant to make a vow to ordain for a period of time etc all as a means of turning the patient's thoughts in the proper direction
This is called dhammamedicine
In some cases a disease that normally requires a great deal of medicine will disappear after using only a little medicine
Experienced doctors are sure to have met with cases like this
For example a patient is seriously ill but if we can find a way to console him and boost his morale the symptoms  instead of worsening as they normally might  grow less severe instead of dying today the patient may live on into next week or next month
Some people when they've stepped on a thorn think that they've been bitten by a snake and this can cause the pain to flare up immediately
Other people when they've been bitten by a poisonous centipede think that they've stepped on a thorn and this can keep the poison of the centipede from causing much pain
If they then go to an experienced doctor who tells them that they've been bitten by a centipede they can then become upset and the pain will flare up
Cases like this all offer proof for the role that kamma plays in causing disease
The word kamma refers to two things 
Sometimes diseases can arise from new acts of the mind
This is called kammacitta
For example when we feel extreme anger hatred love or restlessness the mind is agitated in full force and the defilements that enwrap it splash into the body where they mix with the various properties of the body  in the blood for instance which then flows to the various parts of the body causing weakness and fatigue
If blood of this sort stagnates in a particular part of the body disease will arise right there
The mind becomes murky the properties of the body are murky
At the very least we'll feel not up to par
If we don't hurry to find a way to correct the situation disease will arise
Here we can make an analogy The mind is like a fish in a pond
If a person stirs up the water with a stick the fish will have to swim around in circles and the mucus covering its body will slough off into the water
The water will become murky the mud at the bottom of the pond will get stirred up and the fish won't be able to see
After a while the mucus from the fish will adhere to particles in the water providing food for algae
As the algae multiply the water will grow stale and unfit for use
In the same way when mental defilements flare up in full strength the power of such mental acts can spread to cause diseases in the body
If the properties in the body flare up at the same time as the mind the disease will be hard to treat  or if it's easy to treat it will go away slowly
Thus kamma diseases in some cases arise first in the body and then spread to affect the mind
This is called kammavipaka
Sometimes they arise first in the mind and spread to affect the body
This is called kammacitta
When a kamma disease arises and we know clearly whether it arises from the body or the mind we should treat it with the two sorts of medicine mentioned above which will provide effective means for relieving our suffering
I myself have experienced the truth of these points but to record my experiences in full would be a long drawnout affair
So I leave it to people of discernment to consider these things on their own
Freedom from disease is the greatest good fortune
Chant this every day when you are sick in bed
Everyone in the world wants justice
To give the world justice we all  no matter what race or nationality we belong to  need to have human values in our hearts
Human values are not a creed or a religion
When people are born into the world they want justice by their very nature
Sometimes they receive it sometimes they don't
This is because there are times when they let inhuman values interfere with human values
When this is the case these inhuman values prevent them from receiving the justice they desire
For this reason I would like to point out a way that will help people throughout the world keep their minds in line with human values
Even if we may have lapses from time to time we'll still be doing well as long as we can maintain long intervals between the lapses
In your interaction with people and objects don't let yourself get carried away with anger
Even if people behave in ways that are disagreeable or if the objects that come your way aren't what you had hoped for you should still stop to consider whether those people have at least some good to them and whether those objects may be of at least some use to you
When you can keep your mind in check in this way you'll loosen yourself from the grip of anger and displeasure so that thoughts of good will can arise within you instead
The result will be that those people will become your friends and allies the objects you get will be able to serve you in other ways
For instance suppose you want a chisel but you get a nail
This means that your hopes aren't fulfilled but even so the nail can be of use to you in other ways in the future
In addition thoughts of good will can foster longlasting composure and peace of mind
This then is a human value that should underlie our dealings with one another throughout the world
Be upright and straightforward in all your dealings behaving toward people behind their backs the same way you would behave to their faces
Even when confronted with frightening intimidation you should make your heart audacious to the proper degree
Too much audacity can cause harm and the same holds true for being too timid
For example if you let yourself become intimidated in your business dealings your business will suffer
If you're too reckless or audacious that too can lead to missteps in your work
Thus you should have a sense of moderation and proportion so that your relationships with people and the various objects in the world will run properly
Only then will you count as having human values
Whatever you do in thought word or deed dealing with people or objects in the world you should first examine your motivations
Only if they're sound and reasonable should you listen to them and act in line with them
This will keep you from coming under the sway of delusion
You have to be endowed with the human values of circumspect mindfulness and reasonable discernment
Those who can behave in this way will have friends no matter what social grouping they join
They'll bring about the growth and development of the various objects they deal with and will bring progress to themselves and to society at large  which is something that each and every one of us desires
The world we live in has been here since long before any of us were born
Even our creeds and religions all gradually came into being long after the world did
The history of the human world is that sometimes the world is advanced in both material and spiritual terms leading to welfare for all sometimes humanity is so degenerate in both material and spiritual terms that it practically sinks into the belly of the sea
Sometimes the spiritual side is advanced with people living in peace and security while the material side is undeveloped
When human beings have human values in their hearts material progress can bring happiness and wellbeing to all
When people lack human values  when they trample human values underfoot by going overboard in exercising their power and influence  material progress can destroy the peace and wellbeing of human beings throughout the world
There is a basic truth that when people are bad even good material objects can cause harm to people at large if people are moral and just even harmful objects can become beneficial
When all the people in the world establish themselves firmly in human values then it's as if we were all friends and relatives
If people don't have human values in their hearts even families fall apart friends become enemies  and when relationships on the small scale are like this war on the large scale will be unavoidable
How will we be able to escape it
Thus everyone in the world should develop human values so that we can all view one another as friends expressing in our behavior an attitude of good will and kindness for the sake of justice and fairness in the world
The points I have made so far are principles of nature common to the entire world
Even people who adhere to different religions should assist one another
We should remember our common humanity and help one another on the human level
The Buddha praised those who help others on the basis of common humanity and as for other religions I myself have met with a number of Roman Catholics and Protestants who when they've come to our country seem to be wellmannered welleducated and possessed of strong human values
For example some of them have helped donate money to build temples and monasteries
This has made me curious as to what their religion was and when I asked them they said that they were Christian
It struck me then that their hearts had human values in full measure which is why they have progressed far in life
As for the teachings of Buddhism there is one point where the Buddha taught that when we deal with people outside of the religion we should give thought to our common humanity and not make religion an obstacle
Otherwise it will cause harm
When this is the case people who are wellversed in human values can fit perfectly into any society and can create strong bonds of friendship with one another
Thus I ask all who read this to consider the matter using their own discernment
What follows is a discussion of the Buddhist way a way discovered by a human being whom large numbers of people have respected and praised as being a worthy person who has shown us the way as well
When we study his teachings we are free to believe them or not as we see fit the man who discovered them never laid down any rules coercing us in any way
When a group of people sees that a doctrine can lead them to become good and they give that doctrine their respect and adherence it is said to be their religion
As for the religion or doctrine of the Buddha it can be summarized in three points
We should develop within ourselves all qualities that we know to be good and virtuous maintaining the virtues we already have  this is called arakkhasampada  and constantly aiming at developing the virtues we haven't yet been able to acquire
Whatever activities we may engage in we should do so with purity of heart
We should make our hearts pure and clean
If we can't keep them that way constantly we're still doing well if we can make them pure from time to time
All three of these points are the aims of the Buddha's teachings
The Buddha taught in line with the true nature of the world
He said Khayavayadhamma sankhara appamadena sampadetha which means All sankharas once they have arisen decay by their very nature
Don't be heedless or complacent
Be thoroughly mindful and completely alert and you will attain peace and security
What this means is this All things that appear in the world arising from actions are called sankharas  formations fashionings compounded things
Sankharas by their nature or of two sorts  sankharas on the level of the world and sankharas on the level of the Dhamma
Sankharas on the level of the world refers to the eight ways of the world status fortune praise and pleasure which are things to which we all aspire but  sankharas being what they are unstable and inconstant  results of another sort may interfere Having had status we may lose it
Having had fortune we may lose it
Having been praised we may be criticized
Having tasted the pleasure that come from material wealth we may become needy and destitute afflicted with suffering and pain
Therefore the Buddha taught us not to be so heedless as to be deluded by these things
If we can't keep this point in mind we're sure to suffer
Sankharas on the level of the Dhamma refers to the properties aggregates and sense media that lie within us and that result from unawareness and the sankharas concocted by the mind giving rise to dhammasankharas on the outer level
The liquid aspect such as the blood permeating throughout all parts of the body is called the water property
The forces such as the inandout breath that flow through the body are called the wind property
The aspect that gives warmth to all the parts of the body is called the fire property
The empty spaces in the body where the other properties can move enter and leave the passages that permit air to enter and leave and allow us to move  such as the ear canal the nasal passages and mouth all the way to the pores  are called the space property
These various aspects of the body if there's no consciousness overseeing them are like a dead flashlight battery that can no longer produce the power to give rise to brightness or movement
As long as consciousness is in charge it can cause the various qualities and parts of the body to be of use to living beings
Good and evil merit and demerit can arise only if consciousness is giving the orders
Thus good and evil come ultimately from awareness itself
This is called the property of consciousness
All six of these properties are one class of sankharas on the level of the Dhamma
b
Khandha The various categories of things that we experience are called the five aggregates 
Feeling the feelings of pleasure pain and neither pleasure nor pain that result when consciousness and sense data come into contact with one another are called the aggregate of feeling
Perception The act of labeling and identifying people and things both within and without is called the aggregate of perception
Formations The thoughts and mental constructs that arise from the mind  good bad right wrong in line with the common nature of all thinking  are called the aggregate of formations
Consciousness Distinct awareness in terms of conventional suppositions  for example when the eye sees a visual object the ear hears a sound a smell comes to the nose a taste comes to the tongue a tactile sensation comes to the body or an idea arises in the intellect  being clearly aware through any of the senses that This is good that's bad this is subtle that's fine To be able to know in this way is called the aggregate of consciousness
All five of these aggregates come down to body and mind
They are sankharas on the level of the Dhamma that arise from unawareness
c
Ayatana This term literally means the base or medium of all good and evil
Altogether there are six sense media the senses of vision hearing smell taste feeling and ideation
All of these things are sankharas on the level of the Dhamma
They arise as a result of unawareness ie knowledge that doesn't penetrate into the truth
Thus we have sankharas on the level of the world and sankharas on the level of the Dhamma
The Buddha taught that all of these sankharas are undependable fleeting and unstable
They appear remain for a moment and then disband
Then they appear again going around in circles
This is inconstancy and stress
Whether they're good or bad all sankharas have to behave in this way
We can't force them to obey our wishes
Thus the Buddha taught that they're notself
Once we've developed precise powers of discernment we'll be able gradually to loosen our attachments to these sankharas
And once we've stabilized our minds to the point of Right Concentration clear cognitive skill will arise within us
We'll clearly see the truth of sankharas on the level of the world and on the level of the Dhamma and will shed them from our hearts
Our hearts will then gain release from all sankharas and attain the noblest happiness as taught by the Buddha independent of all physical and mental objects
Although this discussion of these two topics has been brief it can comprehend all aspects of the Buddha's teachings
To summarize Heedfulness
Watchfulness
Noncomplacency
Don't place your trust in any of these sankharas
Try to develop within yourself whatever virtues should be acquired and attained
That's what it means not to be heedless
The Pali Canon recognizes four levels of Awakening the first of which is called stream entry
This gains its name from the fact that a person who has attained this level has entered the stream flowing inevitably to nibbana
Heshe is guaranteed to achieve full awakening within seven lifetimes at most and in the interim will not be reborn in any of the lower realms
This study guide on stream entry is divided into two parts
The first deals with the practices leading to stream entry the second with the experience of stream entry and its results
The practices leading to stream entry are encapsulated in four factors
These factors form the framework for the first part of this study guide
The Canon's treatment of these factors touches on questions of interest to all meditators regardless of whether their practice aims all the way to Awakening How can you recognize a trustworthy teacher
How can you tell the true Dhamma from counterfeit Dhamma
What are the rewards that come from listening to the Dhamma
Which questions should you ask yourself in the course of the practice
What kind of practice qualifies as being in accordance with the Dhamma
What kind of qualities do you need to develop to benefit most from your practice
For your practice to lead to Awakening you must develop reliable standards for answering these questions
The Buddha offers some preliminary guidance on developing these standards in his instructions to the brahman teenager Kapadika Bharadvaja
To what extent is there an awakening to the truth
To what extent does one awaken to the truth
We ask Master Gotama about awakening to the truth
There is the case Bharadvaja where a monk lives in dependence on a certain village or town
Then a householder or householder's son goes to him and observes him with regard to three mental qualities  qualities based on greed qualities based on aversion qualities based on delusion 'Are there in this venerable one any such qualities based on greed that with his mind overcome by these qualities he might say I know while not knowing or say I see while not seeing or that he might urge another to act in a way that was for hisher longterm harm  pain' As he observes him he comes to know 'There are in this venerable one no such qualities based on greed His bodily behavior  verbal behavior are those of one not greedy
And the Dhamma he teaches is deep hard to see hard to realize tranquil refined beyond the scope of conjecture subtle tobeexperienced by the wise
This Dhamma can't easily be taught by a person who's greedy
When on observing that the monk is purified with regard to qualities based on greed he next observes him with regard to qualities based on aversion based on delusion 'Are there in this venerable one any such qualities based on delusion that with his mind overcome by these qualities he might say I know while not knowing or say I see while not seeing or that he might urge another to act in a way that was for hisher longterm harm  pain' As he observes him he comes to know 'There are in this venerable one no such qualities based on delusion His bodily behavior  verbal behavior are those of one not deluded
And the Dhamma he teaches is deep hard to see hard to realize tranquil refined beyond the scope of conjecture subtle tobeexperienced by the wise
This Dhamma can't easily be taught by a person who's deluded
When on observing that the monk is purified with regard to qualities based on delusion he places conviction in him
With the arising of conviction he visits him  grows close to him
Growing close to him he lends ear
Lending ear he hears the Dhamma
Hearing the Dhamma he remembers it
Remembering it he penetrates the meaning of those dhammas
Penetrating the meaning he comes to an agreement through pondering those dhammas
There being an agreement through pondering those dhammas desire arises
With the arising of desire he becomes willing
Willing he contemplates
Contemplating he makes an exertion
Exerting himself he both realizes the ultimate meaning of the truth with his body and sees by penetrating it with discernment
To this extent Bharadvaja there is an awakening to the truth
To this extent one awakens to the truth
I describe this as an awakening to the truth
But it is not yet the final attainment of the truth
Yes Master Gotama to this extent there is an awakening to the truth
To this extent one awakens to the truth
We regard this as an awakening to the truth
But to what extent is there the final attainment of the truth
To what extent does one finally attain the truth
We ask Master Gotama about the final attainment of the truth
The cultivation development  pursuit of those very same qualities to this extent Bharadvaja there is the final attainment of the truth
To this extent one finally attains the truth
I describe this as the final attainment of the truth
With regard to external factors I don't envision any other single factor like friendship with admirable people as doing so much for a monk in training who has not attained the goal but remains intent on the unsurpassed safety from bondage
A monk who is a friend with admirable people abandons what is unskillful and develops what is skillful
As he was seated to one side Ven
Ananda said to the Blessed One This is half of the holy life lord having admirable people as friends companions  colleagues
Don't say that Ananda
Don't say that
Having admirable people as friends companions  colleagues is actually the whole of the holy life
When a monk has admirable people as friends companions  colleagues he can be expected to develop  pursue the noble eightfold path
And how does a monk who has admirable people as friends companions  colleagues develop  pursue the noble eightfold path
There is the case where a monk develops right view dependent on seclusion dependent on dispassion dependent on cessation resulting in letting go
He develops right resolve right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness right concentration dependent on seclusion dispassion cessation resulting in letting go
This is how a monk who has admirable people as friends companions  colleagues develops  pursues the noble eightfold path
And through this line of reasoning one may know how having admirable people as friends companions  colleagues is actually the whole of the holy life It's in dependence on me as an admirable friend that beings subject to birth have gained release from birth that beings subject to aging have gained release from aging that beings subject to death have gained release from death that beings subject to sorrow lamentation pain distress  despair have gained release from sorrow lamentation pain distress  despair
And what does it mean to have admirable people as friends
There is the case where a lay person in whatever town or village he may dwell spends time with householders or householders' sons young or old who are advanced in virtue
He talks with them engages them in discussions
He emulates consummate conviction in those who are consummate in conviction consummate virtue in those who are consummate in virtue consummate generosity in those who are consummate in generosity and consummate discernment in those who are consummate in discernment
This is called having admirable people as friends
And what does it mean to be consummate in conviction
There is the case where a noble disciple has conviction is convinced of the Tathagata's Awakening 'Indeed the Blessed One is worthy  rightly selfawakened consummate in knowledge and conduct wellgone an expert with regard to the world unexcelled as a trainer for those people fit to be tamed the Teacher of devas  human beings awakened blessed' This is called being consummate in conviction
And what does it mean to be consummate in virtue
There is the case where a noble disciple abstains from taking life abstains from stealing abstains from illicit sexual conduct abstains from lying abstains from taking intoxicants that cause heedlessness
This is called being consummate in virtue
And what does it mean to be consummate in generosity
There is the case of a noble disciple his awareness cleansed of the stain of miserliness living at home freely generous openhanded delighting in being magnanimous responsive to requests delighting in the distribution of alms
This is called being consummate in generosity
And what does it mean to be consummate in discernment
There is the case where a noble disciple is discerning endowed with discernment of arising and passing away  noble penetrating leading to the right ending of stress
This is called being consummate in discernment
Admirable friends are to be recognized both by what they say and by what they do
For the person who transgresses in one thing I tell you there is no evil deed that is not to be done
Which one thing
This telling a deliberate lie
A friend endowed with these three qualities is worth associating with
Which three
Heshe gives what is hard to give does what is hard to do endures what is hard to endure
A friend endowed with these three qualities is worth associating with
These three things have been promulgated by wise people by people who are truly good
Which three
Generositygoingforth service to one's mother  father
These three things have been promulgated by wise people by people who are truly good
Now what is the level of a person of no integrity
A person of no integrity is ungrateful does not acknowledge the help given to him
This ingratitude this lack of acknowledgment is second nature among rude people
It is entirely on the level of people of no integrity
A person of integrity is grateful  acknowledges the help given to him
This gratitude this acknowledgment is second nature among admirable people
It is entirely on the level of people of integrity
A person endowed with these four qualities can be known as 'a person of integrity' Which four
There is the case where a person of integrity when asked doesn't reveal another person's bad points to say nothing of when unasked
Furthermore when asked when pressed with questions he is one who speaks of another person's bad points not in full not in detail with omissions holding back
Then again a person of integrity when unasked reveals another person's good points to say nothing of when asked
Furthermore when asked when pressed with questions he is one who speaks of another person's good points in full  in detail without omissions without holding back
Then again a person of integrity when unasked reveals his own bad points to say nothing of when asked
Furthermore when asked when pressed with questions he is one who speaks of his own bad points in full  in detail without omissions without holding back
Then again a person of integrity when asked doesn't reveal his own good points to say nothing of when unasked
Furthermore when asked when pressed with questions he is one who speaks of his own good points not in full not in detail with omissions holding back
Monks a person endowed with these four qualities can be known as 'a person of integrity'
'It's through living together that a person's virtue may be known and then only after a long period not a short period by one who is attentive not by one who is inattentive by one who is discerning not by one who is not discerning' Thus it was said

There is the case where a person suffering loss of relatives loss of wealth or loss through disease does not reflect 'That's how it is when living together in the world
That's how it is when gaining a personal identity
When there is living in the world when there is the gaining of a personal identity these eight worldly conditions spin after the world and the world spins after these eight worldly conditions gain loss status disgrace censure praise pleasure  pain' Suffering loss of relatives loss of wealth or loss through disease he sorrows grieves  laments beats his breast becomes distraught
And then there is the case where a person suffering loss of relatives loss of wealth or loss through disease reflects 'That's how it is when living together in the world

There is the case where one individual through discussion with another knows this 'From the way this person rises to an issue from the way he applies from the way he addresses a question he is dull not discerning
Why is that
He does not make statements that are deep tranquil refined beyond the scope of conjecture subtle tobeexperienced by the wise
He cannot declare the meaning teach it describe it set it forth reveal it explain it or make it plain
He is dull not discerning' Just as if a man with good eyesight standing on the shore of a body of water were to see a small fish rise
The thought would occur to him 'From the rise of this fish from the break of its ripples from its speed it is a small fish not a large one' In the same way one individual in discussion with another knows this 'From the way this person rises to an issue from the way he applies from the way he addresses a question he is dull not discerning'
And then there is the case where one individual through discussion with another knows this 'From the way this person rises to an issue from the way he applies from the way he addresses a question he is discerning not dull
Why is that
He makes statements that are deep tranquil refined beyond the scope of conjecture subtle tobeexperienced by the wise
He can declare the meaning teach it describe it set it forth reveal it explain it  make it plain
He is discerning not dull' Just as if a man with good eyesight standing on the shore of a body of water were to see a large fish rise
The thought would occur to him 'From the rise of this fish from the break of its ripples from its speed it is a large fish not a small one' In the same way one individual in discussion with another knows this 'From the way this person rises to an issue from the way he applies from the way he addresses a question he is discerning not dull'
'It's through discussion that a person's discernment may be known and then only after a long period not a short period by one who is attentive not by one who is inattentive by one who is discerning not by one who is not discerning' Thus it was said
And in reference to this was it said
In addition to requiring time and clear powers of observation the ability to recognize a person of integrity requires that you be a person of integrity as well
Monks could a person of no integrity know of a person of no integrity 'This is a person of no integrity'
No lord
Good monks
It's impossible there's no way that a person of no integrity would know of a person of no integrity 'This is a person of no integrity'
Could a person of no integrity know of a person of integrity 'This is a person of integrity'
No lord
Good monks
It's impossible there's no way that a person of no integrity would know of a person of integrity 'This is a person of integrity'
Now monks could a person of integrity know of a person of no integrity 'This is a person of no integrity'
Yes lord
Good monks
It is possible that a person of integrity would know of a person of no integrity 'This is a person of no integrity'
Could a person of integrity know of a person of integrity 'This is a person of integrity'
Yes lord
Good monks
It is possible that a person of integrity would know of a person of integrity 'This is a person of integrity'

And what is the destination of people of integrity
Greatness among devas or among human beings
The opportunity to listen to the Dhamma is considered valuable both because it is rare and because it yields great benefits
Hard the chance to hear the true Dhamma
There are these five rewards in listening to the Dhamma
Which five
 One hears what one has not heard before
One clarifies what one has heard before
One gets rid of doubt
One's views are made straight
One's mind grows serene
These are the five rewards in listening to the Dhamma
To obtain these benefits one must come to the Dhamma both with the right karmic background and with the right attitude
Endowed with these six qualities a person is capable of alighting on the lawfulness the rightness of skillful mental qualities even while listening to the true Dhamma
Which six
He is not endowed with a kamma obstruction a defilement obstruction or a resultofkamma obstruction he has conviction has the desire and is discerning
Endowed with these six qualities a person is capable of alighting on the lawfulness the rightness of skillful mental qualities even while listening to the true Dhamma
It's also important to understand clearly the standards for distinguishing true Dhamma from false
These standards come down to a pragmatic test How does one behave and what results come from one's behavior when one puts the Dhamma into practice
As they were sitting to one side the Kalamas of Kesaputta said to the Blessed One Venerable sir there are some contemplatives  brahmans who come to Kesaputta
They expound  glorify their own doctrines but as for the doctrines of others they deprecate them revile them show contempt for them  disparage them
And then other contemplatives  brahmans come to Kesaputta
They expound  glorify their own doctrines but as for the doctrines of others they deprecate them revile them show contempt for them  disparage them
They leave us simply uncertain  doubtful Which of these venerable contemplatives  brahmans are speaking the truth and which ones are lying
Of course you are uncertain Kalamas
Of course you are doubtful
When there are reasons for doubt uncertainty is born
So in this case Kalamas don't go by reports by legends by traditions by scripture by conjecture by inference by analogies by agreement through pondering views by probability or by the thought 'This contemplative is our teacher' When you know for yourselves that 'These qualities are unskillful these qualities are blameworthy these qualities are criticized by the wise these qualities when undertaken  carried out lead to harm  to suffering'  then you should abandon them
What do you think Kalamas When greed arises in a person does it arise for welfare or for harm
For harm lord
And this greedy person overcome by greed his mind possessed by greed Doesn't he kill living beings take what is not given go after another person's wife tell lies and induce others to do likewise all of which is for longterm harm  suffering
Yes lord
So what do you think Kalamas Are these qualities skillful or unskillful
Unskillful lord
Blameworthy or blameless
Blameworthy lord
Criticized by the wise or praised by the wise
Criticized by the wise lord
When undertaken  carried out do they lead to harm  to suffering or not
When undertaken  carried out they lead to harm  to suffering Now Kalamas don't go by reports by legends by traditions by scripture by conjecture by inference by analogies by agreement through pondering views by probability or by the thought 'This contemplative is our teacher' When you know for yourselves that 'These qualities are skillful these qualities are blameless these qualities are praised by the wise these qualities when undertaken  carried out lead to welfare  to happiness'  then you should enter  remain in them
What do you think Kalamas When lack of greed arises in a person does it arise for welfare or for harm
For welfare lord
And this ungreedy person not overcome by greed his mind not possessed by greed He doesn't kill living beings take what is not given go after another person's wife tell lies or induce others to do likewise all of which is for longterm welfare  happiness  right
Yes lord
So what do you think Kalamas Are these qualities skillful or unskillful
Skillful lord
Blameworthy or blameless
Blameless lord
Criticized by the wise or praised by the wise
Praised by the wise lord
When undertaken  carried out do they lead to welfare  to happiness or not
When undertaken  carried out they lead to welfare  to happiness
Gotami the qualities of which you may know 'These qualities lead  to passion not to dispassion to being fettered not to being unfettered to accumulating not to shedding to selfaggrandizement not to modesty to discontent not to contentment to entanglement not to seclusion to laziness not to aroused persistence to being burdensome not to being unburdensome' You may categorically hold 'This is not the Dhamma this is not the Vinaya this is not the Teacher's instruction'
As for the qualities of which you may know 'These qualities lead  to dispassion not to passion to being unfettered not to being fettered to shedding not to accumulating to modesty not to selfaggrandizement to contentment not to discontent to seclusion not to entanglement to aroused persistence not to laziness to being unburdensome not to being burdensome' You may categorically hold 'This is the Dhamma this is the Vinaya this is the Teacher's instruction'
Upali the qualities of which you may know 'These qualities do not lead to utter disenchantment to dispassion to cessation to calm to direct knowledge to selfawakening nor to Unbinding' You may categorically hold 'This is not the Dhamma this is not the Vinaya this is not the Teacher's instruction'
As for the qualities of which you may know 'These qualities lead to utter disenchantment to dispassion to cessation to calm to direct knowledge to selfawakening to Unbinding' You may categorically hold 'This is the Dhamma this is the Vinaya this is the Teacher's instruction'
The test for the true Dhamma being pragmatic this means that even when you are convinced that you have heard the true Dhamma you must be careful to realize that simply hearing the truth is not enough to know it for sure
There are five things that can turn out in two ways in the herenow
Which five
Conviction liking unbroken tradition reasoning by analogy  an agreement through pondering views
These are the five things that can turn out in two ways in the herenow
Now some things are firmly held in conviction and yet vain empty  false
Some things are not firmly held in conviction and yet they are genuine factual  unmistaken
Some things are wellliked truly an unbroken tradition wellreasoned Some things are wellpondered and yet vain empty  false
Some things are not wellpondered and yet they are genuine factual  unmistaken
In these cases it isn't proper for a knowledgeable person who safeguards the truth to come to a definite conclusion 'Only this is true anything else is worthless
But to what extent Master Gotama is there the safeguarding of the truth
To what extent does one safeguard the truth
We ask Master Gotama about the safeguarding of the truth
If a person has conviction his statement 'This is my conviction' safeguards the truth
But he doesn't yet come to the definite conclusion that 'Only this is true anything else is worthless' To this extent Bharadvaja there is the safeguarding of the truth
To this extent one safeguards the truth
I describe this as the safeguarding of the truth
But it is not yet an awakening to the truth
Having heard the Dhamma it is important to bring appropriate attention  seeing things in terms of cause and effect  both to what you have heard and to your experiences in general for this one factor can make all the difference in the success or failure of your practice
With regard to internal factors I don't envision any other single factor like appropriate attention as doing so much for a monk in training who has not attained the goal but remains intent on the unsurpassed safety from bondage
A monk who attends appropriately abandons what is unskillful and develops what is skillful
I have heard that on one occasion a certain monk was dwelling among the Kosalans in a forest thicket
Now at that time he spent the day's abiding thinking evil unskillful thoughts ie thoughts of sensuality thoughts of ill will thoughts of harmfulness
Then the devata inhabiting the forest thicket feeling sympathy for the monk desiring his benefit desiring to bring him to his senses approached him and addressed him with this verse
The monk chastened by the devata came to his senses
Appropriate attention is essentially the ability to frame your understanding of experience in the right terms
In many cases this means framing the right questions for gaining insight into suffering and its end
This is the way leading to discernment when visiting a contemplative or brahman to ask 'What is skillful venerable sir
What is unskillful
What is blameworthy
What is blameless
What should be cultivated
What should not be cultivated
What having been done by me will be for my longterm harm  suffering
Or what having been done by me will be for my longterm welfare  happiness'
There is the case where an uninstructed runofthemill persondoes not discern what ideas are fit for attention or what ideas are unfit for attention
This being so he does not attend to ideas fit for attention and attends to ideas unfit for attention
And what are the ideas unfit for attention that he attends to
Whatever ideas such that when he attends to them the unarisen effluent of sensuality arises and the arisen effluent of sensuality increases the unarisen effluent of becoming the unarisen effluent of ignorance arises and the arisen effluent of ignorance increases This is how he attends inappropriately 'Was I in the past
Was I not in the past
What was I in the past
How was I in the past
Having been what what was I in the past
Shall I be in the future
Shall I not be in the future
What shall I be in the future
How shall I be in the future
Having been what what shall I be in the future' Or else he is inwardly perplexed about the immediate present 'Am I
Am I not
What am I
How am I
Where has this being come from
Where is it bound'
As he attends inappropriately in this way one of six kinds of view arises in him The view I have a self arises in him as true  established or the view I have no self or the view It is precisely by means of self that I perceive self or the view It is precisely by means of self that I perceive notself or the view It is precisely by means of notself that I perceive self arises in him as true  established or else he has a view like this This very self of mine  the knower that is sensitive here  there to theripening of good  bad actions  is the self of mine that is constant everlasting eternal not subject to change and will endure as long as eternity
This is called a thicket of views a wilderness of views a contortion of views a writhing of views a fetter of views
Bound by a fetter of views the uninstructed runofthemill person is not freed from birth aging  death from sorrow lamentation pain distress  despair
He is not freed I tell you from stress
The wellinstructed noble disciple discerns what ideas are fit for attention and what ideas are unfit for attention
This being so he does not attend to ideas unfit for attention and attends to ideas fit for attention And what are the ideas fit for attention that he attends to
Whatever ideas such that when he attends to them the unarisen effluent of sensuality does not arise and the arisen effluent of sensuality is abandoned the unarisen effluent of becoming the unarisen effluent of ignorance does not arise and the arisen effluent of ignorance is abandoned He attends appropriately This is stress This is the origination of stress This is the cessation of stress This is the way leading to the cessation of stress
As he attends appropriately in this way three fetters are abandoned in him identityview doubt and grasping at habits  practices
These are called the effluents that are to be abandoned by seeing
Appropriate attention can also mean framing the way you understand events as they occur
Sariputta my friend which things should a virtuous monk attend to in an appropriate way
A virtuous monk Kotthita my friend should attend in an appropriate way to the five clingingaggregates as inconstant stressful a disease a cancer an arrow painful an affliction alien a dissolution an emptiness notself
Which five
The form clingingaggregate the feeling perception fabrications consciousness clingingaggregate
A virtuous monk should attend in an appropriate way to these five clingingaggregates as inconstant stressful a disease a cancer an arrow painful an affliction alien a dissolution an emptiness notself
For it is possible that a virtuous monk attending in an appropriate way to these five clingingaggregates as inconstant notself would realize the fruit of streamentry
Then which things should a monk who has attained streamentry attend to in an appropriate way
A monk who has attained streamentry should attend in an appropriate way to these five clingingaggregates as inconstant stressful a disease a cancer an arrow painful an affliction alien a dissolution an emptiness notself
For it is possible that a monk who has attained streamentry attending in an appropriate way to these five clingingaggregates as inconstant notself would realize the fruit of oncereturning
Then which things should a monk who has attained oncereturning attend to in an appropriate way
A monk who has attained oncereturning should attend in an appropriate way to these five clingingaggregates as inconstant stressful a disease a cancer an arrow painful an affliction alien a dissolution an emptiness notself
For it is possible that a monk who has attained oncereturning attending in an appropriate way to these five clingingaggregates as inconstant notself would realize the fruit of nonreturning
Then which things should a monk who has attained nonreturning attend to in an appropriate way
A monk who has attained nonreturning should attend in an appropriate way to these five clingingaggregates as inconstant stressful a disease a cancer an arrow painful an affliction alien a dissolution an emptiness notself
For it is possible that a monk who has attained nonreturning attending in an appropriate way to these five clingingaggregates as inconstant notself would realize the fruit of arahantship
Then which things should an arahant attend to in an appropriate way
An arahant should attend in an appropriate way to these five clingingaggregates as inconstant stressful a disease a cancer an arrow painful an affliction alien a dissolution an emptiness notself
Although for an arahant there is nothing further to do and nothing to add to what has been done still these things  when developed  pursued  lead both to a pleasant abiding in the herenow and to mindfulness  alertness
In developing dispassion for the clingingaggregates appropriate attention is an important first step in practicing the Dhamma in accordance with the Dhamma
For a monk practicing the Dhamma in accordance with the Dhamma this is what accords with the Dhamma that he keep cultivating disenchantment with regard to form that he keep cultivating disenchantment with regard to feeling that he keep cultivating disenchantment with regard to perception that he keep cultivating disenchantment with regard to fabrications that he keep cultivating disenchantment with regard to consciousness
As he keeps cultivating disenchantment with regard to form feeling perception fabrications consciousness he comprehends form feeling perception fabrications consciousness
As he comprehends form feeling perception fabrications consciousness he is totally released from form feeling perception fabrications consciousness
He is totally released from sorrows lamentations pains distresses  despairs
He is totally released I tell you from suffering  stress
For a monk practicing the Dhamma in accordance with the Dhamma this is what accords with the Dhamma that he keep focused on inconstancy stress notself with regard to form that he keep focused on inconstancy stress notself with regard to feeling perception fabrications consciousness
As he keeps focusing on inconstancy stress notself with regard to form feeling perception fabrications consciousness he comprehends form feeling perception fabrications consciousness
As he comprehends form feeling perception fabrications consciousness he is totally released from form feeling perception fabrications consciousness
He is totally released from sorrows lamentations pains distresses  despairs
He is totally released I tell you from suffering  stress
If a monk teaches the Dhamma for the sake of disenchantment dispassion  cessation with regard to aging  death birth becoming clingingsustenance craving feeling contact the six sense media name  form consciousness fabrications ignorance he deserves to be called a monk who is a speaker of Dhamma
If he practices for the sake of disenchantment dispassion  cessation with regard to aging  death ignorance he deserves to be called a monk who practices the Dhamma in accordance with the Dhamma
If  through disenchantment dispassion cessation and lack of clingingsustenance with regard to aging  death ignorance  he is released then he deserves to be called a monk who has attained Unbinding in the herenow
The practice leading to disenchantment dispassion and release follows a stepwise path of cause and effect
Now I tell you clear knowing  release have their nutriment
They are not without nutriment
And what is their nutriment
The seven factors for awakening And what is the nutriment for the seven factors for awakening
The four establishings of mindfulness And what is the nutriment for the four establishings of mindfulness
The three forms of right conduct And what is the nutriment for the three forms of right conduct
Restraint of the senses And what is the nutriment for restraint of the senses
Mindfulness  alertness And what is the nutriment for mindfulness  alertness
Appropriate attention And what is the nutriment for appropriate attention
Conviction And what is the nutriment for conviction
Hearing the true Dhamma And what is the nutriment for hearing the true Dhamma
Associating with people who are truly good
Just as when the gods pour rain in heavy drops  crash thunder on the upper mountains The water flowing down along the slopes fills the mountain clefts  rifts  gullies the little ponds the big lakes the little rivers the big rivers
When the big rivers are full they fill the great ocean and thus is the great ocean fed thus is it filled
In the same way when associating with truly good people is brought to fulfillment it fulfills hearing the true Dhamma conviction appropriate attention mindfulness  alertness restraint of the senses the three forms of right conduct the four establishings of mindfulness the seven factors for awakening
When the seven factors for awakening are brought to fulfillment they fulfill clear knowing  release
Thus is clear knowing  release fed thus is it brought to fulfillment
Stay mindful monks and alert
This is our instruction to you all
And how is a monk mindful
There is the case where a monk remains focused on the body in  of itself  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the world
He remains focused on feelings mind mental qualities in  of themselves  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the world
This is how a monk is mindful
And how is a monk alert
There is the case where feelings are known to the monk as they arise known as they persist known as they subside
Thoughts are known to him as they arise known as they persist known as they subside
Discernment is known to him as it arises known as it persists known as it subsides
This is how a monk is alert
So stay mindful monks and alert
This is our instruction to you all
And how does a monk guard the doors of his senses
On seeing a form with the eye he does not grasp at any theme or details by which  if he were to dwell without restraint over the faculty of the eye  evil unskillful qualities such as greed or distress might assail him
On hearing a sound with the ear On smelling an odor with the nose One tasting a flavor with the tongue On touching a tactile sensation with the body On cognizing an idea with the intellect he does not grasp at any theme or details by which  if he were to dwell without restraint over the faculty of the intellect  evil unskillful qualities such as greed or distress might assail him
Endowed with this noble restraint over the sense faculties he is inwardly sensitive to the pleasure of being blameless
This is how a monk guards the doors of his senses
Now Cunda there are three ways in which one is made pure by bodily action four ways in which one is made pure by verbal action and three ways in which one is made pure by mental action
And how is one made pure in three ways by bodily action
There is the case where a certain person abandoning the taking of life abstains from the taking of life
He dwells with his rod laid down his knife laid down scrupulous merciful compassionate for the welfare of all living beings
Abandoning the taking of what is not given he abstains from taking what is not given
He does not take in the manner of a thief things in a village or a wilderness that belong to others and have not been given by them
Abandoning sensual misconduct he abstains from sensual misconduct
He does not get sexually involved with those who are protected by their mothers their fathers their brothers their sisters their relatives or their Dhamma those with husbands those who entail punishments or even those crowned with flowers by another man
This is how one is made pure in three ways by bodily action
And how is one made pure in four ways by verbal action
There is the case where a certain person abandoning false speech abstains from false speech
When he has been called to a town meeting a group meeting a gathering of his relatives his guild or of the royalty if he is asked as a witness 'Come  tell good man what you know' If he doesn't know he says 'I don't know' If he does know he says 'I know' If he hasn't seen he says 'I haven't seen' If he has seen he says 'I have seen' Thus he doesn't consciously tell a lie for his own sake for the sake of another or for the sake of any reward
Abandoning false speech he abstains from false speech
He speaks the truth holds to the truth is firm reliable no deceiver of the world
Abandoning divisive speech he abstains from divisive speech
What he has heard here he doesn't tell there to break those people apart from these people here
What he has heard there he doesn't tell here to break these people apart from those people there
Thus reconciling those who have broken apart or cementing those who are united he loves concord delights in concord enjoys concord speaks things that create concord
Abandoning abusive speech he abstains from abusive speech
He speaks words that are soothing to the ear that are affectionate that go to the heart that are polite appealing  pleasing to people at large
Abandoning idle chatter he abstains from idle chatter
He speaks in season speaks what is factual what is in accordance with the goal the Dhamma  the Vinaya
He speaks words worth treasuring seasonable reasonable circumscribed connected with the goal
This is how one is made pure in four ways by verbal action
And how is one made pure in three ways by mental action
There is the case where a certain person is not covetous
He does not covet the belongings of others thinking 'O that what belongs to others would be mine' He bears no ill will and is not corrupt in the resolves of his heart
'May these beings be free from animosity free from oppression free from trouble and may they look after themselves with ease' He has right view and is not warped in the way he sees things 'There is what is given what is offered what is sacrificed
There are fruits  results of good  bad actions
There is this world  the next world
There is mother  father
There are spontaneously reborn beings there are contemplatives  brahmans who faring rightly  practicing rightly proclaim this world  the next after having directly known  realized it for themselves' This is how one is made pure in three ways by mental action
These Cunda are the ten courses of skillful action
 Now on whatever occasion a monk breathing in long discerns that he is breathing in long or breathing out long discerns that he is breathing out long or breathing in short discerns that he is breathing in short or breathing out short discerns that he is breathing out short trains himself to breathe in out sensitive to the entire body trains himself to breathe inout calming bodily fabrication On that occasion the monk remains focused on the body in  of itself  ardent alert  mindful  subduing greed  distress with reference to the world
I tell you monks that this  the inout breath  is classed as a body among bodies which is why the monk on that occasion remains focused on the body in  of itself  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the world
 On whatever occasion a monk trains himself to breathe inout sensitive to rapture trains himself to breathe inout sensitive to pleasure trains himself to breathe inout sensitive to mental fabrication trains himself to breathe inout calming mental fabrication On that occasion the monk remains focused on feelings in  of themselves  ardent alert  mindful  subduing greed  distress with reference to the world
I tell you monks that this  close attention to inout breaths  is classed as a feeling among feelings which is why the monk on that occasion remains focused on feelings in  of themselves  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the world
 On whatever occasion a monk trains himself to breathe inout sensitive to the mind trains himself to breathe inout satisfying the mind trains himself to breathe inout steadying the mind trains himself to breathe inout releasing the mind On that occasion the monk remains focused on the mind in  of itself  ardent alert  mindful  subduing greed  distress with reference to the world
I don't say that there is mindfulness of inout breathing in one of confused mindfulness and no alertness which is why the monk on that occasion remains focused on the mind in  of itself  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the world
 On whatever occasion a monk trains himself to breathe inout focusing on inconstancy trains himself to breathe inout focusing on dispassion trains himself to breathe inout focusing on cessation trains himself to breathe inout focusing on relinquishment On that occasion the monk remains focused on mental qualities in  of themselves  ardent alert  mindful  subduing greed  distress with reference to the world
He who sees clearly with discernment the abandoning of greed  distress is one who oversees with equanimity which is why the monk on that occasion remains focused on mental qualities in  of themselves  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the world
This is how mindfulness of inout breathing is developed  pursued so as to bring the four establishings of mindfulness to their culmination
And how are the four establishings of mindfulness developed  pursued so as to bring the seven factors for awakening to their culmination
 On whatever occasion the monk remains focused on the body in  of itself  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the world on that occasion his mindfulness is steady  without lapse
When his mindfulness is steady  without lapse then mindfulness as a factor for awakening becomes aroused
He develops it and for him it goes to the culmination of its development
 Remaining mindful in this way he examines analyzes  comes to a comprehension of that quality with discernment
When he remains mindful in this way examining analyzing  coming to a comprehension of that quality with discernment then analysis of qualities as a factor for awakening becomes aroused
He develops it and for him it goes to the culmination of its development
 In one who examines analyzes  comes to a comprehension of that quality with discernment unflagging persistence is aroused
When unflagging persistence is aroused in one who examines analyzes  comes to a comprehension of that quality with discernment then persistence as a factor for awakening becomes aroused
He develops it and for him it goes to the culmination of its development
 In one whose persistence is aroused a rapture notoftheflesh arises
When a rapture notoftheflesh arises in one whose persistence is aroused then rapture as a factor for awakening becomes aroused
He develops it and for him it goes to the culmination of its development
 For one who is enraptured the body grows calm and the mind grows calm
When the body  mind of an enraptured monk grow calm then serenity as a factor for awakening becomes aroused
He develops it and for him it goes to the culmination of its development
 For one who is at ease  his body calmed  the mind becomes concentrated
When the mind of one who is at ease  his body calmed  becomes concentrated then concentration as a factor for awakening becomes aroused
He develops it and for him it goes to the culmination of its development
 He oversees the mind thus concentrated with equanimity
When he oversees the mind thus concentrated with equanimity equanimity as a factor for awakening becomes aroused
He develops it and for him it goes to the culmination of its development
This is how the four establishings of mindfulness are developed  pursued so as to bring the seven factors for awakening to their culmination
And how are the seven factors for awakening developed  pursued so as to bring clear knowing  release to their culmination
There is the case where a monk develops mindfulness as a factor for awakening dependent on seclusion dispassion cessation resulting in relinquishment
He develops analysis of qualities as a factor for awakening persistence as a factor for awakening rapture as a factor for awakening serenity as a factor for awakening concentration as a factor for awakening equanimity as a factor for awakening dependent on seclusion dispassion cessation resulting in relinquishment
This is how the seven factors for awakening when developed  pursued bring clear knowing  release to their culmination
The ability to follow this path to completion is not just a matter of mastering technique
It also depends on the ability to develop strong character traits
Now what are the eight thoughts of a great person
This Dhamma is for one who is modest not for one who is selfaggrandizing
This Dhamma is for one who is content not for one who is discontent
This Dhamma is for one who is reclusive not for one who is entangled
This Dhamma is for one whose persistence is aroused not for one who is lazy
This Dhamma is for one whose mindfulness is established not for one whose mindfulness is confused
This Dhamma is for one whose mind is concentrated not for one whose mind is unconcentrated
This Dhamma is for one endowed with discernment not for one whose discernment is weak
This Dhamma is for one who enjoys nonobjectification who delights in nonobjectification not for one who enjoys  delights in objectification

A monk endowed with these seven qualities is worthy of gifts worthy of hospitality worthy of offerings worthy of respect an unexcelled field of merit for the world
Which seven
There is the case where a monk is one with a sense of Dhamma a sense of meaning a sense of himself a sense of moderation a sense of time a sense of social gatherings  a sense of distinctions among individuals
And how is a monk one with a sense of Dhamma
There is the case where a monk knows the Dhamma dialogues narratives of mixed prose  verse explanations verses spontaneous exclamations quotations birth stories amazing events question  answer sessions
If he didn't know the Dhamma  dialogues narratives of mixed prose  verse explanations verses spontaneous exclamations quotations birth stories amazing events question  answer sessions  he wouldn't be said to be one with a sense of Dhamma
So it's because he does know the Dhamma  dialogues question  answer sessions  that he is said to be one with a sense of Dhamma
This is one with a sense of Dhamma
And how is a monk one with a sense of meaning
There is the case where a monk knows the meaning of this  that statement  'This is the meaning of that statement that is the meaning of this' If he didn't know the meaning of this  that statement  'This is the meaning of that statement that is the meaning of this'  he wouldn't be said to be one with a sense of meaning
So it's because he does know the meaning of this  that statement  'This is the meaning of that statement that is the meaning of this'  that he is said to be one with a sense of meaning
This is one with a sense of Dhamma  a sense of meaning
And how is a monk one with a sense of himself
There is the case where a monk knows himself 'This is how far I have come in conviction virtue learning generosity discernment quickwittedness' If he didn't know himself  'This is how far I have come in conviction virtue learning generosity discernment quickwittedness'  he wouldn't be said to be one with a sense of himself
So it's because he does know himself  'This is how far I have come in conviction virtue learning generosity discernment quickwittedness'  that he is said to be one with a sense of himself
This is one with a sense of Dhamma a sense of meaning  a sense of himself
And how is a monk one with a sense of moderation
There is the case where a monk knows moderation in accepting robes almsfood lodgings  medicinal requisites for curing the sick
If he didn't know moderation in accepting robes almsfood lodgings  medicinal requisites for curing the sick he wouldn't be said to be one with a sense of moderation
So it's because he does know moderation in accepting robes almsfood lodgings  medicinal requisites for curing the sick that he is said to be one with a sense of moderation
This is one with a sense of Dhamma a sense of meaning a sense of himself  a sense of moderation
And how is a monk one with a sense of time
There is the case where a monk knows the time 'This is the time for recitation this the time for questioning this the time for making an effort this the time for seclusion' If he didn't know the time  'This is the time for recitation this the time for questioning this the time for making an effort this the time for seclusion'  he wouldn't be said to be one with a sense of time
So it's because he does know the time  'This is the time for recitation this the time for questioning this the time for making an effort this the time for seclusion'  that he is said to be one with a sense of time
This is one with a sense of Dhamma a sense of meaning a sense of himself a sense of moderation  a sense of time
And how is a monk one with a sense of social gatherings
There is the case where a monk knows his social gathering 'This is a social gathering of noble warriors this a social gathering of brahmans this a social gathering of householders this a social gathering of contemplatives here one should approach them in this way stand in this way act in this way sit in this way speak in this way stay silent in this way' If he didn't know his social gathering  'This is a social gathering of noble warriors this a social gathering of brahmans this a social gathering of householders this a social gathering of contemplatives here one should approach them in this way stand in this way act in this way sit in this way speak in this way stay silent in this way'  he wouldn't be said to be one with a sense of social gatherings
So it's because he does know his social gathering  'This is a social gathering of noble warriors this a social gathering of brahmans this a social gathering of householders this a social gathering of contemplatives here one should approach them in this way stand in this way act in this way sit in this way speak in this way stay silent in this way'  that he is said to be one with a sense of social gatherings
This is one with a sense of Dhamma a sense of meaning a sense of himself a sense of moderation a sense of time  a sense of social gatherings
And how is a monk one with a sense of distinctions among individuals
There is the case where people are known to a monk in terms of two categories
Of two people  one who wants to see noble ones and one who doesn't  the one who doesn't want to see noble ones is to be criticized for that reason the one who does want to see noble ones is for that reason to be praised
Of two people who want to see noble ones  one who wants to hear the true Dhamma and one who doesn't  the one who doesn't want to hear the true Dhamma is to be criticized for that reason the one who does want to hear the true Dhamma is for that reason to be praised
Of two people who want to hear the true Dhamma  one who listens with an attentive ear and one who listens without an attentive ear  the one who listens without an attentive ear is to be criticized for that reason the one who listens with an attentive ear is for that reason to be praised
Of two people who listen with an attentive ear  one who having listened to the Dhamma remembers it and one who doesn't  the one who having listened to the Dhamma doesn't remember it is to be criticized for that reason the one who having listened to the Dhamma does remember the Dhamma is for that reason to be praised
Of two people who having listened to the Dhamma remember it  one who explores the meaning of the Dhamma he has remembered and one who doesn't  the one who doesn't explore the meaning of the Dhamma he has remembered is to be criticized for that reason the one who does explore the meaning of the Dhamma he has remembered is for that reason to be praised
Of two people who explore the meaning of the Dhamma they have remembered  one who practices the Dhamma in line with the Dhamma having a sense of Dhamma having a sense of meaning and one who doesn't  the one who doesn't practice the Dhamma in line with the Dhamma having a sense of Dhamma having a sense of meaning is to be criticized for that reason the one who does practice the Dhamma in line with the Dhamma having a sense of Dhamma having a sense of meaning is for that reason to be praised
Of two people who practice the Dhamma in line with the Dhamma having a sense of Dhamma having a sense of meaning  one who practices for both his own benefit and that of others and one who practices for his own benefit but not that of others  the one who practices for his own benefit but not that of others is to be criticized for that reason the one who practices for both his own benefit and that of others is for that reason to be praised
This is how people are known to a monk in terms of two categories
And this is how a monk is one with a sense of distinctions among individuals
A monk endowed with these seven qualities is worthy of gifts worthy of hospitality worthy of offerings worthy of respect an unexcelled field of merit for the world
To practice the Dhamma in accordance with the Dhamma not only makes one worthy of respect it also is a way of showing respect and gratitude to the Buddha for his admirable friendship in creating the opportunity for hearing the true Dhamma
Then the Blessed One said to Ven
Ananda Ananda the twin saltrees are in full bloom even though it's not the flowering season
They shower strew  sprinkle on the Tathagata's body in homage to him
Heavenly coraltree blossoms are falling from the sky Heavenly sandalwood powder is falling from the sky Heavenly music is playing in the sky Heavenly songs are sung in the sky in homage to the Tathagata
But it is not to this extent that a Tathagata is worshipped honored respected venerated or paid homage to
Rather the monk nun male lay follower or female lay follower who keeps practicing the Dhamma in accordance with the Dhamma who keeps practicing masterfully who lives in accordance with the Dhamma that is the person who worships honors respects venerates  pays homage to the Tathagata with the highest homage
So you should train yourselves 'We will keep practicing the Dhamma in accordance with the Dhamma we will keep practicing masterfully we will live in accordance with the Dhamma' That's how you should train yourselves
When treating the experience of stream entry and its results the Canon uses all three of its typical modes of discourse the narrative mode  stories about people who have attained stream entry the cosmological mode  descriptions of the afterdeath destinations awaiting those who have attained stream entry and what might be called the emptiness mode which describes mental states in and of themselves as they are directly experienced as absent or present both during and after stream entry
The material in this part of the study guide is presented in five sections
The first section The Arising of the Dhamma Eye discusses the experience of stream entry and concludes with a passage indicating why the experience is described in terms of the faculty of vision
The second section The Three Fetters discusses the three fetters of renewed existence that are cut with the arising of the Dhamma eye selfidentity views uncertainty and grasping at habits and practices
The third section The Character of the Streamentererdiscusses the personal characteristics of a streamenterer that flow directly from the cutting of the first three fetters
This section focuses on three lists of the four factors of stream entry which are not to be confused with the four factors for stream entry discussed in the first part of this study guide
The fourth section Rewards discusses the rewards of stream entry that are come both in this life and in future lives
The final section Advice echoes the Buddha's last words to his disciples before entering total nibbana
The discourse reporting those words  DN  also reports that the most backward of the monks present at the Buddha's passing away were streamenterers
The fact that his last words to them stressed the need for heedfulness underlies the fact that even streamenterers have to be wary of heedlessness
This is especially true in the present day when many different meditation schools define the attainment of stream entry in such different terms raising the question of whose certification of stream entry is valid and whose is not
The safest course of action for all meditators  whether certified as streamenterers or not and whether that certification is valid or not  is to maintain an attitude of heedfulness with regard to all mental qualities
The term stream in stream entry refers to the point where all eight factors of the noble eightfold path come together
Sariputta 'The stream the stream' thus it is said
And what Sariputta is the stream
This noble eightfold path lord is the stream right view right resolve right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness right concentration
Very good Sariputta
Very good
This noble eightfold path  right view right resolve right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness right concentration  is the stream
And what is right view
Knowledge in terms of stress knowledge in terms of the origination of stress knowledge in terms of the cessation of stress knowledge in terms of the way of practice leading to the cessation of stress This is called right view
And what is right resolve
Being resolved on renunciation on nonill will on harmlessness This is called right resolve
And what is right speech
Abstaining from lying from divisive speech from abusive speech  from idle chatter This is called right speech
And what is right action
Abstaining from taking life from stealing  from sexual intercourse This is called right action
And what is right livelihood
There is the case where a disciple of the noble ones having abandoned dishonest livelihood keeps his life going with right livelihood
This is called right livelihood
And what is right effort
There is the case where a monk generates desire endeavors arouses persistence upholds  exerts his intent for the sake of the nonarising of evil unskillful qualities that have not yet arisen for the sake of the abandoning of evil unskillful qualities that have arisen for the sake of the arising of skillful qualities that have not yet arisen for the maintenance nonconfusion increase plenitude development  culmination of skillful qualities that have arisen
This is called right effort
And what is right mindfulness
There is the case where a monk remains focused on the body in  of itself  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the world
He remains focused on feelings in  of themselves the mind in  of itself mental qualities in  of themselves  ardent alert  mindful  putting aside greed  distress with reference to the world
This is called right mindfulness
And what is right concentration
There is the case where a monk  quite secluded from sensuality secluded from unskillful qualities  enters  remains in the first jhana rapture  pleasure born of seclusion accompanied by directed thought  evaluation
With the stilling of directed thoughts  evaluations he enters  remains in the second jhana rapture  pleasure born of concentration unification of awareness free from directed thought  evaluation  internal assurance
With the fading of rapture he remains equanimous mindful  alert and senses pleasure with the body
He enters  remains in the third jhana of which the Noble Ones declare 'Equanimous  mindful he has a pleasant abiding' With the abandoning of pleasure  pain  as with the earlier disappearance of elation  distress  he enters  remains in the fourth jhana purity of equanimity  mindfulness neither pleasure nor pain
This is called right concentration
The comingtogether of these factors is called the stream because it leads inevitably to two things just as the current of a tributary will lead inevitably to a major river and then to the sea
In the immediate present the stream leads directly to the arising of the Dhamma eye the vision that actually constitutes this first awakening
Over time the stream ensures that  in no more than seven lifetimes  one will be totally unbound
What does the Dhamma eye see when it arises
Then Ven
Assaji gave this Dhamma exposition to Sariputta the wanderer
Then to Sariputta the wanderer as he heard this exposition of Dhamma there arose the dustless stainless Dhamma eye Whatever is subject to origination is all subject to cessation
This standard formula  it is repeated throughout the Canon  may not seem that remarkable an insight
However the texts make clear that this insight is not a matter of belief or contemplation but of direct seeing
As the following passages show belief and contemplation may be conducive to the seeing  and an undefined level of belief and discernment may actually guarantee that someday in this lifetime the seeing will occur  but only with the actual seeing does there come a dramatic shift in the course of one's life and one's relationship to the Dhamma
Monks the eye is inconstant changeable alterable
The ear The nose The tongue The body The mind is inconstant changeable alterable
Forms Sounds Aromas Flavors Tactile sensations Ideas are inconstant changeable alterable
Eyeconsciousness Earconsciousness Noseconsciousness Tongueconsciousness Bodyconsciousness Intellectconsciousness is inconstant changeable alterable
EyecontactEarcontactNosecontactTonguecontactBodycontact Intellectcontact is inconstant changeable alterable
Feeling born of eyecontact Feeling born of earcontact Feeling born of nosecontact Feeling born of tonguecontact Feeling born of bodycontact Feeling born of intellectcontact is inconstant changeable alterable
Perception of forms Perception of sounds Perception of smells Perception of tastes Perception of tactile sensationsPerception of ideas is inconstant changeable alterable
Intention for forms Intention for sounds Intention for smells Intention for tastes Intention for tactile sensations Intention for ideas is inconstant changeable alterable
Craving for forms Craving for sounds Craving for smells Craving for tastes Craving for tactile sensations Craving for ideas is inconstant changeable alterable
The earth property The liquid property The fire property The wind property The space property The consciousness property is inconstant changeable alterable
Form Feeling Perception Fabrications Consciousness is inconstant changeable alterable
One who has conviction  belief that these phenomena are this way is called a faithfollower one who has entered the orderliness of rightness entered the plane of people of integrity transcended the plane of the runofthemill
He is incapable of doing any deed by which he might be reborn in hell in the animal womb or in the realm of hungry ghosts
He is incapable of passing away until he has realized the fruit of stream entry
One who after pondering with a modicum of discernment has accepted that these phenomena are this way is called a Dhammafollower one who has entered the orderliness of rightness entered the plane of people of integrity transcended the plane of the runofthemill
He is incapable of doing any deed by which he might be reborn in hell in the animal womb or in the realm of hungry ghosts
He is incapable of passing away until he has realized the fruit of stream entry
One who knows and sees that these phenomena are this way is called a streamenterer steadfast never again destined for states of woe headed for selfawakening
To Upali the householder as he was sitting right there there arose the dustless stainless Dhamma eye Whatever is subject to origination is all subject to cessation
Then  having seen the Dhamma having reached the Dhamma known the Dhamma gained a footing in the Dhamma having crossed over  beyond doubt having had no more questioning  Upali the householder gained fearlessness and was independent of others with regard to the Teacher's message
Part of what makes the arising of the Dhamma eye such a powerful experience is that the realization that Whatever is subject to origination is all subject to cessation must follow on a glimpse of what stands in opposition to all that is subject to origination ie a glimpse of the Unconditioned  deathlessness
Sariputta the wanderer went to Moggallana the wanderer
Moggallana the wanderer saw him coming from afar and on seeing him said Your faculties are bright my friend your complexion pure  clear
Could it be that you have attained the Deathless
Yes my friend I have  Mv I
The connection between Ven
Assaji's verse above discussing causation and the arising of the Dhamma eye in Sariputta suggests that realization conveyed by the Dhamma eye is not just an insight into the fleeting impermanent nature of ordinary experience
Instead it extends also to a realization of the conditioned dependent nature of that experience
Other passages describing in more detail the knowledge of a streamenterer  one who has entered the stream  show that this is in fact the case
The Dhamma eye sees that things arise and pass away in line with a particular type of causality in which the effects of causes are felt immediately or over the course of time
And which is the noble method that he has rightly seen  rightly ferreted out through discernment
There is the case where a disciple of the noble ones notices
When this is that is
From the arising of this comes the arising of that
When this isn't that isn't
From the cessation of this comes the cessation of that
In other words
From ignorance as a requisite condition come fabrications
From fabrications as a requisite condition comes consciousness
From consciousness as a requisite condition comes nameform
From nameform as a requisite condition come the six sense media
From the six sense media as a requisite condition comes contact
From contact as a requisite condition comes feeling
From feeling as a requisite condition comes craving
From craving as a requisite condition comes clingingsustenance
From clingingsustenance as a requisite condition comes becoming
From becoming as a requisite condition comes birth
From birth as a requisite condition then aging  death sorrow lamentation pain distress  despair come into play
Such is the origination of this entire mass of stress  suffering
Now from the remainderless fading  cessation of that very ignorance comes the cessation of fabrications
From the cessation of fabrications comes the cessation of consciousness
From the cessation of consciousness comes the cessation of nameform
From the cessation of nameform comes the cessation of the six sense media
From the cessation of the six sense media comes the cessation of contact
From the cessation of contact comes the cessation of feeling
From the cessation of feeling comes the cessation of craving
From the cessation of craving comes the cessation of clingingsustenance
From the cessation of clingingsustenance comes the cessation of becoming
From the cessation of becoming comes the cessation of birth
From the cessation of birth then aging  death sorrow lamentation pain distress  despair all cease
Such is the cessation of this entire mass of stress  suffering
This is the noble method that he has rightly seen  rightly ferreted out through discernment
When a disciple of the noble ones has seen well with right discernment this dependent coarising  these dependently coarisen phenomena as they are actually present it is not possible that he would run after the past thinking 'Was I in the past
Was I not in the past
What was I in the past
How was I in the past
Having been what what was I in the past' or that he would run after the future thinking 'Shall I be in the future
Shall I not be in the future
What shall I be in the future
How shall I be in the future
Having been what what shall I be in the future' or that he would be inwardly perplexed about the immediate present thinking 'Am I
Am I not
What am I
How am I
Where has this being come from
Where is it bound' Such a thing is not possible
Why is that
Because the disciple of the noble ones has seen well with right discernment this dependent coarising  these dependently coarisen phenomena as they are actually present
The insight of a streamenterer into the truths of causality on the one hand and of the Deathless on the other is accurate as far as it goes but it does not equal the intensity of the insight of the arahant  one who has reached the final level of awakening
The differences between the two are suggested in the following simile
My friend although I have seen properly with right discernment as it actually is present that 'The cessation of becoming is Unbinding' still I am not an arahant whose effluents are ended
It's as if there were a well along a road in a desert with neither rope nor water bucket
A man would come along overcome by heat oppressed by the heat exhausted dehydrated  thirsty
He would look into the well and would have knowledge of 'water' but he would not dwell touching it with his body
In the same way although I have seen properly with right discernment as it actually is present that 'The cessation of becoming is Unbinding' still I am not an arahant whose effluents are ended
The four levels of Awakening are defined by the extent to which they cut the ten fetters by which the mind binds itself to conditioned experience
And which are the five lower fetters
Selfidentity views uncertainty grasping at habits  practices sensual desire  ill will
These are the five lower fetters
And which are the five higher fetters
Passion for form passion for what is formless conceit restlessness  ignorance
These are the five higher fetters
In this community of monks there are monks who are arahants whose effluents are ended who have reached fulfillment done the task laid down the burden attained the true goal totally destroyed the fetter of becoming and who are released through right gnosis
In this community of monks there are monks who with the total ending of the five lower fetters are due to be reappear there to be totally unbound never again to return from that world
In this community of monks there are monks who with the total ending of three fetters and with the attenuation of passion aversion  delusion are oncereturners who  on returning only one more time to this world  will make an ending to stress
In this community of monks there are monks who with the total ending of three fetters are streamwinners steadfast never again destined for states of woe headed for selfawakening
For the streamenterer the arising of the Dhamma eye  with its insight into the causal principles underlying the origination and cessation of stress  is what cuts through the first three fetters
He attends appropriately This is stress This is the origination of stress This is the cessation of stress This is the way leading to the cessation of stress
As he attends appropriately in this way three fetters are abandoned in him selfidentity view doubt and grasping at habits  practices
The Canon contains passages that amplify what it means to cut the first three of these fetters
First selfidentity views
But lady how does selfidentity come about
There is the case friend Visakha where an uninstructed runofthemill person  who has no regard for noble ones is not wellversed or disciplined in their Dhamma who has no regard for men of integrity is not wellversed or disciplined in their Dhamma  assumes form to be the self or the self as possessing form or form as in the self or the self as in form
He assumes feeling to be the self
He assumes perception to be the self
He assumes fabrications to be the self
He assumes consciousness to be the self or the self as possessing consciousness or consciousness as in the self or the self as in consciousness
This is how selfidentity comes about
But lady how does selfidentity not come about
There is the case where a wellinstructed disciple of the noble ones  who has regard for noble ones is wellversed  disciplined in their Dhamma who has regard for men of integrity is wellversed  disciplined in their Dhamma  does not assume form to be the self or the self as possessing form or form as in the self or the self as in form
He does not assume feeling to be the self
He does not assume perception to be the self
He does not assume fabrications to be the self
He does not assume consciousness to be the self or the self as possessing consciousness or consciousness as in the self or the self as in consciousness
This is how selfidentity does not come about
'The origination of selfidentity the origination of selfidentity' it is said lady
Which origination of selfidentity is described by the Blessed One
The craving that makes for further becoming  accompanied by passion  delight relishing now here  now there  ie craving for sensual pleasure craving for becoming craving for nonbecoming This friend Visakha is the origination of selfidentity described by the Blessed One
'The cessation of selfidentity the cessation of selfidentity' it is said lady
Which cessation of selfidentity is described by the Blessed One
The remainderless fading  cessation renunciation relinquishment release  letting go of that very craving This friend Visakha is the cessation of selfidentity described by the Blessed One
'The way of practice leading to the cessation of selfidentity the way of practice leading to the cessation of selfidentity' it is said lady
Which way of practice leading to the cessation of selfidentity is described by the Blessed One
Precisely this noble eightfold path  right view right resolve right speech right action right livelihood right effort right mindfulness right concentration This friend Visakha is the way of practice leading to the cessation of selfidentity described by the Blessed One
What is the noble liberation
There is the case Ananda where a disciple of the noble ones considers this 'Sensuality here  now sensuality in lives to come sensual perceptions here  now sensual perceptions in lives to come forms here  now forms in lives to come formperceptions here  now formperceptions in lives to come perceptions of the imperturbable perceptions of the dimension of nothingness perceptions of the dimension of neither perception nor nonperception that is an identity to the extent that there is an identity
This is deathless the liberation of the mind through lack of clingingsustenance'
Magandiya it is just as if there were a blind man who couldn't see black objects white blue yellow red the sun or the moon
Now suppose that a certain man were to take a grimy oilstained rag and fool him saying 'Here my good man is a white cloth  beautiful spotless  clean' The blind man would take it and wear it
Then suppose his friends companions  relatives took him to a doctor and the doctor treated him with medicine purges from above  purges from below ointments  counterointments and treatments through the nose
And thanks to the medicine his eyesight would appear  grow clear
Then together with the arising of his eyesight he would abandon whatever passion  delight he felt for that grimy oilstained rag
And he would regard that man as an enemy  no friend at all and think that he deserved to be killed
'My gosh how long have I been fooled cheated  deceived by that man  his grimy oilstained rag
 Here my good man is a white cloth  beautiful spotless  clean'
In the same way Magandiya if I were to teach you the Dhamma  this freedom from Disease this Unbinding  and you on your part were to understand that freedom from Disease and see that Unbinding then together with the arising of your eyesight you would abandon whatever passion  delight you felt with regard for the five aggregates for sustenance
And it would occur to you 'My gosh how long have I been fooled cheated  deceived by this mind
For in clinging it was just form that I was clinging toit was just feeling just perception just fabrications just consciousness that I was clinging to
With my clinging as condition there is becoming birth aging  death sorrow lamentation pains distresses  despairs all come into play
And thus is the origination of this entire mass of stress'
In the following passage Ven
Khemaka  a monk who has attained the level of nonreturner and so has cut the first five fetters  indicates how selfidentity views may be cut even though the mind has yet to cut the conceit I am which ends only at the level of full awakening
Friends it's not that I say 'I am form' nor do I say 'I am something other than form' It's not that I say 'I am feeling perception fabrications consciousness' nor do I say 'I am something other than consciousness' With regard to these five clingingaggregates 'I am' has not been overcome although I don't assume that 'I am this'
It's just like the scent of a blue red or white lotus If someone were to call it the scent of a petal or the scent of the color or the scent of a filament would he be speaking correctly
No friend
Then how would he describe it if he were describing it correctly
As the scent of the flower That's how he would describe it if he were describing it correctly
In the same way friends it's not that I say 'I am form' nor do I say 'I am other than form' It's not that I say 'I am feeling perception fabrications consciousness' nor do I say 'I am something other than consciousness' With regard to these five clingingaggregates 'I am' has not been overcome although I don't assume that 'I am this'
The fetter of uncertainty is defined as doubt in the Awakening of the Buddha the truth of his Dhamma and the practice of his noble disciples
What this uncertainty boils down to is doubt as to whether there is a Deathless dimension and whether one can realize it through one's own efforts
The experience of the Deathless  following on the practice of the Dhamma to the point of entering the stream  cuts this fetter by confirming the possibility of a human being's awakening to the Deathless the correctness of the Buddha's teaching as a guide to entering the stream and the worthiness of those who have reached the stream
There is the case where the disciple of the noble ones is endowed with unwavering confidence in the Awakened One 'Indeed the Blessed One is worthy and rightly selfawakened consummate in knowledge  conduct wellgone an expert with regard to the world unexcelled as a trainer for those people fit to be tamed the Teacher of devas  human beings awakened blessed'
He is endowed with unwavering confidence in the Dhamma 'The Dhamma is wellexpounded by the Blessed One to be seen here  now timeless inviting verification pertinent to be realized by the wise for themselves'
He is endowed with unwavering confidence in the Sangha 'The Sangha of the Blessed One's disciples who have practiced well who have practiced straightforwardly who have practiced methodically who have practiced masterfully  in other words the four types of noble disciples when taken as pairs the eight when taken as individual types  they are the Sangha of the Blessed One's disciples worthy of gifts worthy of hospitality worthy of offerings worthy of respect the incomparable field of merit for the world' NOTE
The four pairs are the person on the path to stream entry the person experiencing the fruit of stream entry the person on the path to oncereturning the person experiencing the fruit of oncereturning the person on the path to nonreturning the person experiencing the fruit of nonreturning the person on the path to arahantship the person experiencing the fruit of arahantship
The eight individuals are the eight types forming these four pairs
The fetter of grasping at habits and practices is often described in the Pali Canon with reference to the view that one becomes pure simply through performing rituals or patterns of behavior
This view in turn is related to the notion that one's being is defined by one's actions If one acts in accordance with clearly defined habits and practices one is ipso facto pure
Although the Canon recognizes the importance of habits and practices in the attaining the stream the experience of the Deathless shows the person who has attained the stream that one cannot define oneself in terms of those habits and practices
Thus one continues to follow virtuous practices but without defining oneself in terms of them
Now where do skillful habits cease without trace
Their cessation too has been stated There is the case where a monk is virtuous but not fashioned of virtue
He discerns as it actually is the awarenessrelease  discernmentrelease where his skillful habits cease without trace
A standard formula in the Canon describes a streamenterer in terms of four factors
The first three of these four factors of stream entry are directly related to the cutting of the fetter of uncertainty
The fourth is related to the cutting of the fetter of grasping at habits and practices
There is the case where the disciple of the noble ones is endowed with unwavering confidence in the Awakened One unwavering confidence in the Dhamma unwavering confidence in the Sangha Heshe is endowed with virtues that are appealing to the noble ones untorn unbroken unspotted unsplattered liberating praised by the wise untarnished leading to concentration
Although this is the standard list of the four factors of stream entry there are other lists that replace the fourth factor with other factors
SN
defines the fourth factor as follows Furthermore the disciple of the noble ones lives at home with an awareness cleansed of the stain of stinginess freely generous openhanded delighting in being magnanimous responsive to requests delighting in the distribution of alms
SN
defines it as follows Furthermore the disciple of the noble ones is discerning endowed with discernment of arising  passing away  noble penetrating leading to the right ending of stress
When these lists are collated we arrive at four qualities that describe a streamenterer conviction virtue generosity and discernment
AN
describes these as four qualities that lead to a lay person's happiness and wellbeing in lives to come Other passages in the Canon explore the implications of each of these four as embodied in a streamenterer's behavior
Conviction in the Triple Gem of the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha is not simply a matter of belief or devotion
It forces one to place trust in the principle of kamma  the principle of action and result in line with which one first gained entry to the stream
Endowed with these five qualities a lay follower is a jewel of a lay follower a lotus of a lay follower a fine flower of a lay follower
Which five
Heshe has conviction is virtuous is not eager for protective charms  ceremonies trusts kamma not protective charms  ceremonies does not search for recipients of hisher offerings outside and gives offerings here first
Virtue as practiced by the streamenterer is also a function of a deep trust in the principle of kamma and of a sympathy for others that arises from that trust
Although streamenterers may still break the minor rules of training the depth of insight that informs their virtue ensures that their adherence to the basic principles of morality is unshakable
There is the case where a disciple of the noble ones reflects thus 'I love life and don't love death
I love happiness and abhor pain
Now if I  loving life and not loving death loving happiness and abhorring pain  were to be killed that would be displeasing  disagreeable to me
And if I were to kill another who loves life and doesn't love death who loves happiness and abhors pain that would be displeasing  disagreeable to the other
What is displeasing  disagreeable to me is displeasing  disagreeable to others
How can I inflict on others what is displeasing  disagreeable to me' Reflecting in this way he refrains from taking life gets others to refrain from taking life and speaks in praise of refraining from taking life
In this way his bodily behavior is pure in three ways
Furthermore he reflects thus 'If someone by way of theft were to take from me what I haven't given that would be displeasing  disagreeable to me If someone were to commit adultery with my wives that would be displeasing  disagreeable to me If someone were to damage my wellbeing with a lie that would be displeasing  disagreeable to me If someone were to divide me from my friends with divisive speech that would be displeasing  disagreeable to me If someone were to address me with harsh speech that would be displeasing  disagreeable to me If someone were to address me with idle chatter that would be displeasing  disagreeable to me
And if I were to address another with idle chatter that would be displeasing  disagreeable to the other
What is displeasing  disagreeable to me is displeasing  disagreeable to others
How can I inflict on others what is displeasing  disagreeable to me' Reflecting in this way he refrains from idle chatter gets others to refrain from idle chatter and speaks in praise of refraining from idle chatter
In this way his verbal behavior is pure in three ways
Monks this recitation of more than training rules comes every fortnight in reference to which sons of good families desiring the goal train themselves
There are these three trainings under which all that is gathered
Which three
The training in heightened virtue the training in heightened mind the training in heightened discernment
These are the three trainings under which all that is gathered
There is the case where a monk is wholly accomplished in virtue moderately accomplished in concentration and moderately accomplished in discernment
With reference to the lesser and minor training rules he falls into offenses and rehabilitates himself
Why is that
Because I have not declared that to be a disqualification in these circumstances
But as for the training rules that are basic to the holy life and proper to the holy life he is one of permanent virtue one of steadfast virtue
Having undertaken them he trains in reference to the training rules
With the wasting away of three fetters he is a streamwinner never again destined for states of woe certain headed for selfawakening
Generosityis actually a characteristic that must precede stream entry
However the attainment of stream entry gives generosity a distinctive integrity
Monks there are these five forms of stinginess
Which five
Stinginess as to one's monastery stinginess as to one's family stinginess as to one's gains stinginess as to one's status and stinginess as to the Dhamma
These are the five forms of stinginess
And the meanest of these five is this stinginess as to the Dhamma
Without abandoning these five things one is incapable of realizing the fruit of stream entry
Without abandoning these five things one is incapable of realizing the fruit of stream entry
Which five
Stinginess as to one's monastery stinginess as to one's family stinginess as to one's gains stinginess as to one's status and ingratitude
These five are a person of integrity's gifts
Which five
A person of integrity gives a gift with a sense of conviction
A person of integrity gives a gift attentively
A person of integrity gives a gift in season
A person of integrity gives a gift with an empathetic heart
A person of integrity gives a gift without adversely affecting himself or others
Discernment is the character trait of the streamenterer that is most directly related to the cutting of the fetter of selfidentity views
However its implications spread to other facets of right view as well
In fact consummate in view is one of the epithets for a streamenterer
The impact of being consummate in view extends not only to one's intellectual life but also to one's emotional life as well
There is the case where a monk having gone to the wilderness to the root of a tree or to an empty dwelling considers thus 'Is there any internal enthrallment unabandoned in me that enthralled with which my enthralled mind would not know or see things as they actually are' If a monk is enthralled with sensual passion then his mind is enthralled
If he is enthralled with ill will then his mind is enthralled

If a monk is absorbed in speculation about the other world then his mind is enthralled
If a monk is given to arguing and quarreling and disputing stabbing others with weapons of the mouth then his mind is enthralled
He discerns that 'There is no enthrallment unabandoned in me that enthralled with which my enthralled mind would not know and see things as they actually are

Then Anathapindika the householder went to where the wanderers of other persuasions were staying
On arrival he greeted them courteously
After an exchange of friendly greetings  courtesies he sat to one side
As he was sitting there the wanderers said to him Tell us householder what views the contemplative Gotama has
Venerable sirs I don't know entirely what views the Blessed One has
Well well
So you don't know entirely what views the contemplative Gotama has
Then tell us what views the monks have
I don't even know entirely what views the monks have
So you don't know entirely what views the contemplative Gotama has or even that the monks have
Then tell us what views you have
It wouldn't be difficult for me to expound to you what views I have
But please let the venerable ones expound each in line with his position and then it won't be difficult for me to expound to you what views I have
When this had been said one of the wanderers said to Anathapindika the householder The cosmos is eternal
Only this is true anything otherwise is worthless
This is the sort of view I have
Another wanderer said to Anathapindika The cosmos is not eternal
Only this is true anything otherwise is worthless
This is the sort of view I have
Another wanderer said The cosmos is finite The cosmos is infinite The soul  the body are the same The soul is one thing and the body another After death a Tathagata exists After death a Tathagata does not exist After death a Tathagata both does  does not exist After death a Tathagata neither does nor does not exist
Only this is true anything otherwise is worthless
This is the sort of view I have
When this had been said Anathapindika the householder said to the wanderers As for the venerable one who says 'The cosmos is eternal
Only this is true anything otherwise is worthless
This is the sort of view I have his view arises from his own inappropriate attention or in dependence on the words of another
Now this view has been brought into being is fabricated willed dependently originated
Whatever has been brought into being is fabricated willed dependently originated that is inconstant
Whatever is inconstant is stress
This venerable one thus adheres to that very stress submits himself to that very stress 
When this had been said the wanderers said to Anathapindika the householder We have each  every one expounded to you in line with our own positions
Now tell us what views you have
